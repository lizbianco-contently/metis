Resnicoff, offered the following \nprayer:\n  Almighty God, this week we remember nightmares, to reaffirm our \ndreams. On this Holocaust Remembrance Day--during this week we have set \naside--our Nation recalls victims of the Holocaust: a Holocaust brave \nAmericans took up arms to fight and many gave their lives to end. And \nso, before this session starts, and during a time when our brave men \nand women still risk their lives for better times, we pray the day will \ncome when the lesson of this horror, the lessons of all nightmares, \nhelp make our dreams of peace come true.\n  From the Holocaust we learn: when human beings deny humanity in \nothers, they destroy humanity within themselves. When they reject the \nhuman in a neighbor's soul, then they unleash the beast, and the \nbarbaric, in their own hearts.\n  And so, remembering, we pray: if the time has not yet dawned when we \ncan proclaim our faith in God, then let us say at least that we admit \nwe are not gods ourselves. If we cannot yet see the face of God in \nothers, then let us see, at least, a face as human as our own.\n  You taught us through the Bible--taught that life might be a blessing \nor a curse: the choice is in our hands. So many people, so many \npeoples, have felt the curse of life too filled with cruelty, violence, \nand hate. As Americans we pray--we vow--to keep alive the dream of \nbetter times; to keep our faith that we can be, will be, a force for \ngood; a force for hope; a force for freedom; a blessing, not a curse--\nto all our people; to all the world.\n  And may we say, Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5439-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Ted Stevens led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5439-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to be a circuit judge for the Sixth \nCircuit. Under the previous consent agreement reached, a vote will \noccur on the confirmation of that nomination at 12 noon.\n  The Senate will recess for the weekly party lunches from 12:30 until \n2:15 p.m.\n  Following the confirmation of Jeffrey Sutton, it is my intention to \nresume consideration of the nomination of Priscilla Owen to be a \ncircuit judge for the Fifth Circuit. It will be my hope that we can \nreach a time agreement for the vote on this judicial nomination.\n  In addition, there are a number of other legislative items that will \nbe scheduled for action during the remainder of this week, including \nthe bioshield bill, the digital and wireless technology legislation, \nState Department authorization, and other legislative or executive \nitems that can be cleared over the coming days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished majority leader will \nallow me to direct a couple of questions to him. First, we have asked \nbefore. Do you think there is any way we can have the vote on the \nSutton nomination after the caucus? We have a lot of people who want to \nbe able to discuss it in our caucus. I don't think it would in any way \nhurt the schedule or hold up getting to the Owen nomination by 20 \nminutes or half an hour, but there would be a number of Senators--\nespecially Senator Harkin--who would deeply appreciate it if we could \nhave a vote at 2:15. We would even be willing to shorten our caucus to \nexpedite the time on this and vote at 2 rather than 2:15.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have been made aware of the request. I \ntalked to our caucus and our leadership and really would much prefer to \ngo ahead with the vote as scheduled. A number of people made plans to \ncome back from out of town specifically for this vote recognizing that \nwe had made it clear the vote would be at 12 noon today. Out of \nconsistency, when I set a time for a vote, people alter their plans \nvery specifically to make sure they are here. Some simply can't be \nback, and I understand that as well. But we will go ahead and have that \nvote at noon today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been advised by the leader's \ncompetent floor staff that this afternoon, during the debate of \nPriscilla Owen, it will not be necessary for somebody to be here all \nday. I will be happy to be here, as the distinguished leaders know, but \nwe would hope there would not be a vote unless the majority leader \ngives us some notice.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for today, that is absolutely fine. We will \nwork in good faith. The objective with all of these nominees is to have \ngood discussion as we go forward. We want to make sure that occurs. I \nexpect today that we will not have a vote this afternoon, and we will \nnotify leadership in advance.\n  Mr. REID. One final note: We have worked during the recess. I think \nthe\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nposition of the minority is the same as it was prior to the break. We \ndon't think there will be any time that would be agreeable on the Owen \nnomination. That being the case, is it the expectation of the majority \nleader that he would file cloture on the Priscilla Owen nomination \nsometime today or tomorrow?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me get back with the leadership on the \nother side of the aisle. We, of course, would very much like an up-or-\ndown vote on Priscilla Owen. If not and it is necessary for us to file \ncloture, it will be done either sometime this week or next week. The \nfinal decision has not been made. We would like to discuss this with \nyou, and we will let you know once that decision is made.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, Mr. President, we are willing to work with the \nmajority on judges. We have a number of circuit judges on which we \nthink we can move very quickly. The leadership should know that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, I recognize that. We are \nmaking slow but consistent and steady progress. We have the vote today. \nWe have made reasonable progress up until today. I think as judges are \nput forward, we will continue to consider them in an orderly way in the \nSenate. That being said, I am very hopeful that we can ultimately have \nan up-or-down vote on Miguel Estrada, someone whom we believe is the \nembodiment of the American dream. We will work in that regard. I hope \nwe will be able to have an up-or-down vote on Priscilla Owen as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5440-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I \nimmediately proceed after Senator Durbin for 15 minutes--that I follow \nhim.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New York understands----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. There will be a Republican in between him and Senator \nDurbin.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week appears to be ``Judge Week'' in \nthe Senate. We are going to focus on judicial nominations.\n  It is interesting, as I traveled across Illinois over the last 2 \nweeks, not a soul raised a question about Federal judges--the debate \nhere in the Senate. It does not seem to be on the radar screen of \naverage Americans. It is certainly an important issue; it is one that \nwe focus on as political parties, and it is one that I think is timely \nwhen we consider the nominees who are before us.\n  For the average American, it may not mean much, it may not mean much \nuntil that day comes that a decision is handed down by a court that has \nan impact on families across America, and businesses and individuals, \nbecause Federal judges have extraordinary power. The men and women we \nare considering in the Senate are being given lifetime appointments to \nthe Federal bench. If they are good, they will be good for a lifetime; \nif they are bad, they will be bad for a lifetime. Most of us in the \nSenate will come and go, and they will still be sitting on the bench \nwith gavel in hand, in their black robes, meting out justice according \nto their own values. So it is important that we ask questions and make \ninquiries as to what those values might be.\n  The judge before us today is Jeffrey Sutton. If you read about \nJeffrey Sutton, you find a man of extraordinary intellect. He is a \npartner in a large Columbus, OH, law firm, and served as State \nsolicitor in Ohio. He is a professor at Ohio State University Law \nSchool. He has been a law clerk for Supreme Court Justices Scalia and \nPowell, and he has done a number of other things which suggest that \nthis is a thoughtful man.\n  There is no question as to whether he is up to the job \nintellectually. The question is whether he brings to the job the values \nthat are in the mainstream of America. I would suggest that he does \nnot.\n  As a result of that, I will oppose his nomination. I would like to \nspell out exactly why. In the cases he has taken, and the legal \narguments he has advanced, Jeffrey Sutton has shown a consistent \npattern of insensitivity to civil rights, human rights, and the rights \nof minorities, women, and the disabled in America.\n  Time and again, he has asked the Federal courts to remove the \nauthority of Congress to create laws involving individual rights and \nliberties and to give compensation to those who have been wronged. That \nis the hallmark of his legal career. That is who Jeffrey Sutton is. \nThat is what he believes.\n  Given a lifetime appointment to this bench in the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, we can predict, with some degree of certainty, he will \ncontinue in his quest to try to deny those coming before the court the \nright for a day in court if they happen to be disabled, victims of age \ndiscrimination, victims of civil rights discrimination, and the like.\n  His hearing was held on January 29, with two other controversial \nnominees: Deborah Cook, also a nominee for the Sixth Circuit, and John \nRoberts, for the DC Circuit. It was the first time since 1990 that the \nJudiciary Committee held a hearing on one day for three circuit court \nnominees. It is unfortunate. We had some time to ask Professor Sutton \nquestions, but not as much time as we needed. I sent some written \nquestions to him and have those responses.\n  But if you look at the interest in his nomination, you will find an \nextraordinary lineup of organizations that oppose Jeffrey Sutton. It is \nhard to believe, but true, that 70 national and nearly 400 local \norganizations oppose Jeffrey Sutton for confirmation to the Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Twenty-three of them are based in Illinois. The \ndisability community is particularly alarmed. And you will understand \nthat as I talk about some of the cases he has taken.\n\n  In our history, seldom do people stand and announce publicly they are \nprejudiced. That is not something you hear very often. There are a lot \nof things people say. Usually the shield, the explanation, and the \nrationale for prejudice in America is to say: I am standing up for \nStates rights. Boy, that has been the clarion call from those who \noppose universal concepts and principles of human rights and civil \nrights, I guess dating back to our debates in the Senate and the House \nabout slavery, which led to the Civil War. You remember that, of \ncourse.\n  The States argued that the Federal Government could not impose on \nthem a standard relative to slavery; it would be a matter of States \nrights. It reached such a high peak of anger and frustration that it \nled to the secession of States, a civil war, and the bloodiest moment \nin the history of the United States.\n  The end of that war did not end the debate. Those who continue to \noppose civil rights and human rights--whether\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\nthey are for people of color; for those of different ethnic \nbackgrounds, different genders, or sexual orientation; or for those \nwith certain disabilities--never stand up and say: I am really \nprejudiced against these people; I just don't like these people. They \nsay: No, no, we are for States rights. We don't believe the Federal \nGovernment should have a standard across America for all people who are \nin this category. We think each State should make up a standard.\n  That is what former Senator Hubert Humphrey referred to as ``the \nshadow of civil rights''--a shadow cast over America after the Civil \nWar, until Brown v. Board of Education, a case handed down in 1954 \nacross the street at the U.S. Supreme Court. It was finally after that \ndecision that, as Senator Humphrey once said, we came out of the shadow \nof civil rights into the bright sunshine of human rights.\n  Jeffrey Sutton has never come out from under that shadow. In fact, he \nhas made a legal career of extending that shadow over more and more \nAmericans so that they would have less likelihood of prevailing when \nthey were discriminated against. While Mr. Sutton's record is devoid of \nobvious manifestations of prejudice, his vision of a Federal Government \nwith diminished power to enforce civil rights would achieve the goals \nof those who oppose equality.\n  Mr. Sutton has been front and center in some of the most important \nSupreme Court cases of our generation. He personally argued five of the \nmost significant cases in the past decade before the Supreme Court. \nThat attests to his legal skill, but it certainly speaks volumes, as \nwell, as to what is in his heart, what he believes, and where he would \nstand as a judge if confronted with similar issues. And in every one of \nthese cases, Jeffrey Sutton asked the Supreme Court to restrict the \nrights of the disabled, women, the elderly, the poor, and racial and \nethnic minorities. He is consistent and, from my point of view, \nconsistently wrong.\n  Consistently he has argued before the Supreme Court to take away the \npower of individuals to recover for discrimination. One of the most \nglaring cases is the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. \nGarrett. I took a look at the published decision in this case because I \nwanted to read specifically what was at issue.\n  We can talk a lot about States' rights and discrimination, and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, but let me read you what was at issue \nin this case so you understand where Jeffrey Sutton was in this \nargument.\n  This is a case involving a woman, a respondent, Patricia Garrett. She \nis a registered nurse, and she was employed as the director of nursing, \nOB-GYN and Neonatal Services, for the University of Alabama in its \nBirmingham hospital. I might say parenthetically, that this is an \nextraordinarily well respected medical institution. Patricia Garrett \nwas director of nursing at this hospital, think of that--quite an \nachievement in her career.\n  In 1994, Patricia Garrett was diagnosed with breast cancer, \nsubsequently underwent a lumpectomy, radiation treatment, and \nchemotherapy. Garrett's treatments required her to take substantial \nleave from work because of this cancer. Upon returning to work in July \nof 1995, Patricia Garrett's supervisor informed her that she would have \nto give up her position as director of nursing at the hospital.\n  Garrett then applied for, and received, a transfer to another, lower \npaying position as a nurse manager. She brought a case under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and she said: I think the Federal \nGovernment passed a law that said you cannot discriminate against a \nperson because of a disability or an illness--exactly the situation \nthat she faced.\n  I voted for that law. I remember it well. It brought together an \nextraordinary bipartisan coalition.\n  In a few moments, the Senate will hear from my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Tom Harkin. He was one of the leaders on that bill. Senator \nBob Dole was a leader as well. It was bipartisan legislation which, for \nour generation, said: We will open up opportunities for a group of \nAmericans who have been subject to discrimination because they have a \ndisability or illness.\n  We passed the bill overwhelmingly with a bipartisan vote. I believed \nwe were establishing a new frontier of civil rights. I was proud to be \npart of the debate. I contemplated, in voting for it, as many Senators \ndid, people such as Patricia Garrett, a woman who reached a pinnacle of \nsuccess in her career as director of nursing at an extraordinary \nhospital in Alabama, learned she had breast cancer, went through the \nanguish and pain of treatment, successful treatment, only to return to \nwork after her illness and be told that she had been demoted from her \nposition and would suffer a pay cut. She felt she had been wronged. I \nagreed with her.\n  When she turned to sue the State of Alabama, which managed the \nuniversity hospital, she ran into a brick wall named Jeffrey Sutton. \nJeffrey Sutton, the nominee before us, stood up and said: Patricia \nGarrett and people like her, who have been discriminated against by \nStates such as Alabama, have no right to recover under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. This was a decision made by Mr. Sutton to take a \ncase which involved more than Patricia Garrett. It involved a basic \nprinciple of law. Time and again and this case stands out because the \nfacts are so compelling that has been the story of Jeffrey Sutton's \nlegal career.\n  In another disability case, Olmstead v. LC, Mr. Sutton argued it was \nnot a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act to force people \nwith mental disabilities to remain institutionalized even when less \nrestrictive settings were available. Thank God the Supreme Court \nrejected Jeffrey Sutton's twisted logic in that case 7 to 2. Only \nJustices Scalia and Thomas, the most--let me be careful of my \nlanguage--conservative members of the Supreme Court agreed with Jeffrey \nSutton's twisted logic.\n  In Alexander v. Sandoval, Jeffrey Sutton argued that private \nindividuals did not have the power to bring lawsuits under the \ndisparate impact regulations of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964. The Supreme Court agreed with Sutton by the same 5 to 4 majority \nwe saw in the Garrett case. As a result of his advocacy, it is now \nimpossible for individuals to use title VI to challenge the \ndisproportionate impact of many wrongful situations; for example, the \ndumping of toxic waste in poor minority neighborhoods. Congratulations, \nMr. Sutton. You stood up to stop poor families exposed to toxic waste \nfrom bringing suit against those responsible for it and who chose their \nneighborhoods as the dumping grounds. I am sure that is a feather in \nhis cap with some people but not with this Senator.\n  It is impossible to use title VI--because of Jeffrey Sutton's \nargument--to challenge educational tests or tracking procedures that \ndisproportionately harm minority students.\n  Sutton claims that he was just being an advocate in these cases. He \nsays he just wanted to develop a Supreme Court litigation practice. \nWhile I accept the principle that it is wrong to ascribe the views of a \nclient to that client's attorney, I believe it is appropriate to \nconsider which clients an attorney chooses to represent. Time and time \nagain, Jeffrey Sutton, who is asking for a lifetime appointment to sit \non a bench in a Federal courtroom and decide the fate of people such as \nPatricia Garrett and victims of discrimination, has chosen to come down \non the wrong side of history.\n\n  Another indicator of Mr. Sutton's conservative ideology is that he is \na member and, indeed, an officer of the famed Federalist Society, an \norganization with a mission statement claiming:\n\n       Law schools and the legal profession are strongly dominated \n     by a form of orthodox liberal ideology which advocates a \n     centralized and uniform society.\n\n  Mr. Sutton, an officer of the organization, came before us as a \nnominee--no surprise. If you scratch the DNA of most of President \nBush's judicial nominees, you will find the Federalist Society \nchromosome. I think about two-thirds of President Bush's circuit court \nnominees who have been brought before the committee have to pass the \ntest of being Federalist Society true believers. Jeffrey Sutton goes \nbeyond membership. He is an officer of the organization.\n  Fewer than 1 percent of attorneys across America belong to the \nFederalist Society. But if you want to make it big in President Bush's \nWhite\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\nHouse and make it to a high level, you better show credentials with the \nFederalist Society. That is your ticket to being considered for a \nnomination. Mr. Sutton had his ticket punched, as did Miguel Estrada, \nPricilla Owen, Timothy Tymkovich, Jay Bybee, and Carolyn Kuhl. Jeffrey \nSutton is part of a pattern of conservative ideologues that President \nBush has nominated to the Federal court.\n  The Sixth Circuit is evenly balanced now, but the President wants to \nchange it. He has already nominated six staunch conservatives to that \ncourt. The President is using ideology as a basis for his nomination, \nand the Senate should reject it.\n  Mr. Sutton's legal career has been spent practicing in the shadows of \nStates' rights. He has said repeatedly how much he values federalism. \nTime and again he has argued important cases on the side of States' \nrights and not individual rights. We should reject that. We should say \nthat as a matter of principle and practice, the men and women seeking \nappointments to these circuit courts of appeal, who decide tens of \nthousands of cases each year and are the gatekeepers for most cases \nbefore they come to the Supreme Court, should be people who are \nmoderate, centrist, and reasonable in their views.\n  Jeffrey Sutton is not one of those nominees. What he brings to this \nnomination is an extreme viewpoint, one that should be rejected, one \nthat certainly should not be enshrined for a lifetime at the circuit \ncourt of appeals.\n  I was in Alabama several months ago visiting Birmingham, Montgomery, \nand Selma with John Lewis, Congressman from Atlanta, GA, who was part \nof the civil rights movement. He told me, as we visited the shrines of \nthe movement--the street corner where Rosa Parks boarded the bus and \nrefused to sit in the segregated section, and the bridge at Selma where \nJohn Lewis had his head bashed in by an Alabama State trooper trying to \nprotest civil rights discrimination--that none of that could have taken \nplace were it not for one Federal judge with courage, Judge Frank \nJohnson of Alabama. He stood up to the establishment and other Federal \ncourts and said: We are going to see civil rights in America. He had \nthe courage of his convictions. Because of that courage, people have a \nchance to succeed in America today that they did not have in the 1960s.\n  I thought to myself, as I reflected on Frank Johnson, an unheralded \nhero, how many nominees to the Federal court coming before us today \nwould have the courage and vision of Frank Johnson. Trust me, based on \nhis record, Jeffrey Sutton would not be one of those judges.\n  Jeffrey Sutton, time and time again in his legal career, has stood in \nthe path of progress toward equality and opportunity. He has denied \nopportunity to people who are disabled. He has denied people who have \nbeen victims of age discrimination, he has denied people of color and \npoor people who are looking for their day in court, he has denied them \nthat chance.\n  How can we in good conscience look the other way? How can we say: \nthis is just another political decision, this man may sit on the bench \nfor a lifetime but it is the President's right to pick his nominees?\n  I don't think we can. In good conscience, we have to say no to this \nnominee. We have to say to the White House: Send us moderate people. Do \nnot send us people who will preach intolerance from the bench. Do not \nsend us people who will close the courthouse door to Americans who have \nno other recourse when it comes to protecting their civil rights.\n  Jeffrey Sutton is just that sort of nominee. For that reason, his \nnomination should be rejected. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Chair inform the Senator as to the agreement \nentered into and what is the time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the \nSenator from Illinois is to speak for 20 minutes, followed by a \nRepublican to speak, and then Senator Schumer is to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Therefore, if time is running, it runs off of the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. It is being charged to the \nSenator speaking, but that would be correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no objection if the Senator from Iowa wants to \nspeak at this time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The order was entered into and Mr. Schumer is not here.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is our understanding if we didn't take the floor, \nSenator Schumer would. He is not here, but I would be happy to yield to \nthe Senator from Iowa. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, if I may ask the Chair to state the \nparliamentary situation now on the time. My understanding is that we \nhad a total of 2 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time reserved \nuntil 12 noon is to be equally divided between the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin. The Senator \nfrom Illinois was recognized first under the agreement. Now the \nRepublican side has the opportunity to respond, followed by Senator \nSchumer of New York.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time. \nSenator Schumer is now here and he can go ahead.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Since the other \nside is not speaking, does their time run?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If someone is claiming time on the Democratic \nside, it would be charged to the Democrats.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before I begin, was the Senator from Iowa \nseeking extra time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under the previous order, how much time was the Senator \nfrom New York given?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He is to have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Could my colleague from Iowa proceed following me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By consent.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no objection if the Senator from Iowa would like to \nfollow the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was informed that I may reserve time for \nthe end of the debate also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the time is divided equally. \nWhatever is left, they would use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. As long as it is on their time, it is fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be charged to the Senator \nspeaking.\n\n  With that understanding, the Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nJeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am going to get \ninto Mr. Sutton in a minute, but I just say that Mr. Sutton is another \nexample of nominees who have been nominated who are not simply \nmainstream conservatives but are way over to the right side. That is \nwhat we have seen in this judicial process. We have seen nominee after \nnominee after nominee who is not simply a mainstream conservative--we \nvoted for most of those--but a nominee who is a passionate ideologue \nand whose major view--if you had to underline it all, perhaps with the \nexception of the issue of choice--is a wish to curtail the power of the \nFederal Government.\n  They, in a very real sense, wish to turn the clock back--many not to \nthe 1930s but even to the 1890s. There has been 100 years of history \nthat the Federal Government expanded its power to deal with injustices \nthat occurred with individuals. Keeping in concept with a limited \ngovernment and a free market society, the general consensus in our \nsociety has been to move forward. There have been ebbs and flows. I \nthink there was legitimacy to Ronald Reagan. There had been 50 years of \nFederal expansion and he said retrench. Since that time I think there \nis\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\nno groundswell among the American people to turn the clock back to 1930 \nor 1890. Any attempts by either the President or the Congress to do \nthat are always defeated, or almost always defeated in the long run \nbecause those two parts of our Government, the article I part, the \nCongress, and the article II part, the Executive, are elected.\n  What has happened here, Mr. President, is that those who wish to turn \nthe clock back--a narrow band of ideologues--have either captured the \nPresident's ear or certainly captured the nomination process, and they \nput forward nominee after nominee after nominee who is beyond the \nmainstream--not people who disagree on views but people, if they sat in \nthis Chamber, would be more conservative perhaps than any of the 100 \nSenators. But they are not elected.\n  The President and his allies thought they could do this without a \nwhimper. Some of us, a year and a half ago, said we were going to \nquestion these nominees on their ideological views, on their judicial \nphilosophy. Initially, there was an outcry, but I think basically the \nargument has been settled.\n  Certainly, there is a right to ask nominees about their views. \nSecondly, I believe there is an obligation because the article III \nsection of Government, the judiciary, has huge power. The nominees, if \nthey become members of the bench, are there for life. This is the only \nchance because the White House doesn't vet their views. In fact, there \nseems to be a philosophy in the White House to tell the nominees to say \nas little as possible, and the apotheoses of that was Miguel Estrada, \nwho was like a Cheshire cat and would not say a single thing about his \nviews. But with the problems that Mr. Estrada has had on this floor, I \nthink that philosophy is not going to work.\n  My guess is if any other nominees to the court of appeals took the \nstrategy of not dare telling us how they think on anything, they would \nreach the same fate as Mr. Estrada, and they would not be supported by \na majority here. They will not be nominated either. Mr. Sutton is one \nof these nominees. He is not merely a conservative judge. In fact, as I \nsaid, conservative judges are nominated--there is a nominee, for \ninstance, in the Fifth Circuit who is pending right now, Judge Prado. \nJudge Prado is conservative, but he is not out of the mainstream. He is \nHispanic. He is nominated to the Fifth Circuit. The majority doesn't \nbring him forward. Why? Because they know he will be supported by the \nmajority on our side. Instead, we are going to refight the nomination \nof Priscilla Owen, one of the judges like Judge Sutton who is way over.\n  The point is that we are not blocking every judge. I don't have the \nexact number, but of approximately 110 or 120 of the President's \nnominees, I have supported around 100. And 111 out of 116 of the \nPresident's nominees have been confirmed. I voted for all 111 of them.\n  There are some who are so far over that we have to say no. Mr. Sutton \nis such a nominee. I just wish our President would understand this, \nwould treat the Senate with some respect, would understand that the \nchecks and balances in this Government make sense, and that he cannot \njust give the nominating process to a small group of ideologues, led by \nthe Federalist Society, who have a view--a very respectful view, but it \nis out of the mainstream, way out of the mainstream.\n  Very few people believe the Federal Government's role should be cut \nso dramatically that we go to a Federal Government ala 1930 or 1890. So \nI believe our fight on these issues is gaining support, not losing it. \nIt is a tough fight to make.\n  Why not give the President his way? No one knows the damage these \nnominees will do because they have not heard these cases. I will say \nthat when our caucus rallied and coalesced around opposing the nominee \nMiguel Estrada and not letting him come to a vote until he was doing \nwhat the Founding Fathers wanted him to do, discuss the issues, we did \nnot do it in this caucus for political advantage. We did it because we \nwere so appalled by the arrogance of a nominating process that said the \nadvise and consent process could be ignored and the nominee could say, \nI cannot answer this because I might have to judge it on a future case. \nNo other nominee has done that.\n  In fact, yesterday, in my State, I was proud to support a nominee of \nthe President named Judge Irizarry, another Hispanic nominee. I called \nher into my office and talked to her. I said, give me some court cases \nyou do not like. And without flinching, this woman, educated, I \nbelieve, at Columbia and Yale, an excellent lawyer, an excellent judge, \ntold me two cases, one she disagreed with from the right, one she \ndisagreed with from the left. I told the White House, let's move her.\n  So this is not an issue of Hispanics or women. This is not an issue \nof being obstructionist. This is very simply an issue about the \nConstitution and about some degree of balance that ideologs--neither \nideologs of the far left nor ideologs of the far right should capture \nthe judiciary, because when they do, they do not interpret the law, \nwhich is what the Founding Fathers wished them to do but, rather, they \nmake law.\n  The great irony is the conservative movement in the 1960s and 1970s \nhad a revulsion towards judge-made law. I remember arguing with some of \nmy classmates in college about this. All of a sudden it has flip-\nflopped and now activism on the rightwing side is okay, turning the \nclock back, which certainly in an Einsteinian way, and I think in a \ngeneral way, is as much changing direction as moving it forward, is not \nactivism but fidelity to the Constitution? Judge after judge will \nreverse precedent--that is what activism is--when they should not.\n  So I believe, with every bone in my body, with every atom in my body, \nthat we are doing the right thing here--that we are doing more than the \nright thing; we are doing the Nation a service. If we succeed, no one \nwill ever know because the kinds of cases that would be ruled on will \nnot come to the fore. If we fail, people will know, but it may not be \nfor 5 or 10 years. It is the right thing to do. We know it, and I \nbelieve most people over there know it.\n  These are not nominees who are mainstream. They are not the kinds of \nnominees Bill Clinton generally nominated, people who were to the \nliberal side but not out of the mainstream, not a whole lot of legal \naid lawyers or ACLU advocates but, rather, partners in law firms and \nprosecutors. That was the Clinton nominee.\n  Here, it is nominee after nominee who sort of with a passion wishes \nto say the minute the Federal Government moves its fingers, chop them \noff.\n  Let's talk a little bit about Mr. Sutton, because I think he fits \nthat extreme mold. Now to his credit--and I want to give him credit--he \nanswered questions when we asked him. He was not silent like Miguel \nEstrada. I do not hear anybody saying he is violating Canon No. 5 of \nthe lawyers' ethics by saying how he felt on certain issues. That was \nwhy Mr. Estrada would not tell us things.\n  In general, some of the cases he has talked about advance an agenda \nthat is antirights, antifairness and, in my judgment, antijustice. \nProbably the most notorious is Patricia Garrett. There, he sought and \nobtained--this was not just someone who looked up his name in the phone \nbook, went and looked up an ``S'' and came to Sutton. He went out of \nhis way to find the opportunity to oppose a breast cancer patient's bid \nto vindicate a right to keep her nurse's job. In other words, she was \nfired because she had breast cancer.\n\n  He went so far as to argue the Congress had no power under the 14th \namendment to protect the disabled. Whether you agree or disagree with \nthe view, it is clearly an attempt to say the Federal Government, in \nthe kind of general, gradual, fitful progress we have made to protect \nthe rights of individuals, should be pushed back.\n  In the case of Westside Mothers, Mr. Sutton again grabbed the \nopportunity to oppose a group of mothers whose children were being \ndeprived of services under Medicaid. Mr. Sutton apparently believed \nimpoverished children should not have the right to force the State they \nlive in to provide them services that Congress guaranteed to them. \nAgain, cut the Federal Government back.\n  In another case, Mr. Sutton sought the opportunity to file a brief \narguing Congress does not have the power to address violence against \nwomen and argued that significant portions of the Violence Against \nWomen Act were unconstitutional.\n  Do my colleagues think most of America agrees with that? Do they \nthink most of America thinks Congress\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\nhas no right to legislate, particularly when there are findings that \nsay this is interfering with commerce and interfering with women's \nrights to hold jobs and be productive citizens? It is sort of obvious \nif a woman is beaten at home, that that will interfere. Do my \ncolleagues think most Americans agree with Mr. Sutton to say there \nshould be no Federal power to do it?\n  The bottom line is, in case after case, Mr. Sutton has sought the \nopportunity to represent States rights at the expense of individual \nrights. He has sought the opportunity to seek injustice at the expense \nof basic fairness, guided by some ideological construct that the \nFederal Government is bad, it is evil, it grabs too much power, in ways \nthat most Americans, 95 percent--99 percent, maybe of all Americans--\nwould have no problem with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 5 \nminutes of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes 38 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Five more minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for his generosity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now, it is no exaggeration to say Jeffrey Sutton is one \nof the architects of the rightwing revolution that is taking place in \nour Federal courts. In hearings before the Judiciary Committee, he \nclaimed he was trying to build a Supreme Court practice and he cannot \nbe condemned for the views espoused in his advocacy, because lawyers \nhave to represent their clients. Generally, that is true. If Mr. Sutton \nwere a public interest lawyer taking all cases that come to him, I \nwould agree. If he were a junior associate taking the cases partners \nassigned to him, I would agree. If he had a diverse array of cases \ntaking different ideological perspectives, I would agree. But the cases \nMr. Sutton took reflect a clear agenda. He believed in what he was \ndoing.\n  In one interview, Mr. Sutton said: I love this Federalism stuff. It \nwas obvious to me, at least, that at the hearing this was a personal \nagenda for him. He has taken positions far beyond what his clients' \ninterests have demanded. His record, viewed as a whole, makes clear he \nhas an agenda and his career has been devoted to advancing that agenda.\n  Frankly, I do not believe someone with such strong against-the-grain \nideological views will simply set them aside to become a fair and \nneutral judge. That is a pretty tough thing to do.\n  So the bottom line is we have another nominee from the extreme, \nanother nominee clearly bright, clearly accomplished--I have no dispute \nwith his intellectual character or his ethics, but he comes from way \noutside the mainstream. It is a pity this judge divides us, does not \nunite us. If every judge the President nominated were that way, I would \nsay it is not much of an argument, but it is just some. So I would urge \nmy colleagues to oppose Mr. Sutton.\n  Frankly, I think a large number will. I think because Mr. Sutton \nanswered questions and other reasons that there is not going to be a \nprevention of his nomination from coming to a vote. He certainly adds \nweight and burden to future nominees because many Members want to seek \nbalance on the courts. Jeffrey Sutton does not bring a bit of balance \nto the courts. It continues the push, bringing them far over to the \nright side to eliminate the powers of the Federal Government or to \ngreatly reduce the powers of the Federal Government at a time when only \na small band of ideologues is demanding just that.\n\n  I yield the remainder of the time I have not used to my colleague \nfrom Iowa, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides. \nSenator Harkin from Iowa has 16 minutes and the chairman of the \nJudiciary has 53 minutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is an odd game that is being played \nhere by the majority party of the Senate. First, we asked a vote be put \noff until after the caucus this afternoon. The majority leader could \nnot even do that. Why do they want to rush a vote at noon after we have \nbeen gone for 2 weeks? Senators have just come back. Some Members \nwanted the opportunity to talk about Mr. Sutton in our caucuses. The \nmajority leader says no, we will vote at noon; we cannot vote at 2:15. \nWe will not have any other votes today but they want to ram this \nthrough and vote at noon. I know our assistant minority leader, Senator \nReid, asked if we could have the vote later on and the majority leader \nobjected. Why? What are they afraid of?\n  Again, I point to an incident that happened today and yesterday that \nagain illustrates why people with disabilities have every reason to be \nout here in the lobby today--and the reception room--opposing Mr. \nSutton's nomination. We had a room reserved, the Mansfield Room, for a \npress conference this morning for disability groups. Somehow yesterday \nit was taken away from us. We do not know why; it was just taken away. \nThen we were told we could use the LBJ Room--fine--at 10 o'clock. \nPeople with disabilities lined up outside to come in to that press \nconference at 10 o'clock, but they were not allowed to come in until \n9:30. People with wheelchairs, people what seeing eye dogs, people who \nare hearing impaired, standing in line out there to try to come in here \nto exercise their legitimate rights; yet they are held up out there \nbecause it takes a long time to process them and get them through.\n  When I heard this was happening, I called Mr. Pickle, the Sergeant at \nArms, and he rushed right down there and he made sure they got through. \nI thank Mr. Pickle.\n  But why do we have to do that? The people who are down there should \nhave been treated just like a banker, a financier, or K Street lobbyist \nwho come up here when we have votes on the floor. And they were not--\nuntil Mr. Pickle went down there and straightened things out.\n  People with disabilities struggle every day just to get through. We \nhad years, decades, centuries of discrimination against people with \ndisabilities in this country, so we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act in 1990. Mr. Sutton, the nominee before the Senate, \nsays it is not needed. It was not needed? On National Public Radio he \nsaid ``disability discrimination in a constitutional sense is difficult \nto show.''\n  We did not think it was that difficult: 25 years of study by the \nCongress, starting in 1965 with the National Commission on \nArchitectural Barriers, through 1989--25 years. And then Congress, \nrecognizing that we had left out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 people \nwith disabilities.\n  After all the studies--we had 17 hearings, we had a markup by five \nseparate committees, 63 public forums across the country, held by \nJustin Dart, who was President Reagan's appointee to head the National \nCommittee on People With Disabilities. Justin Dart collected over 8,000 \npages of testimony of individual acts of discrimination against people \nwith disabilities in this country. Attorney General Thornburg testified \non behalf of it and said it was needed, along with Governors and State \nattorneys general. We had over 300 examples of discrimination by State \ngovernments in the legislative record--300 examples of discrimination \nby State governments. Yet when Patricia Garrett of Alabama was fired \nfrom her job because of her disability, Mr. Sutton, in representing the \nState of Alabama, just said that is tough; we do not need the ADA. He \nsaid it is not needed. Well, Congress thought it was needed and people \nwith disabilities all over this country knew it was needed also.\n\n  I make it clear, I am not accusing Jeffrey Sutton of having any \npersonal animosity toward people with disabilities. I spent an hour and \na half with him. I don't believe he does. But what he does have is a \nvery narrow, rigid view of the law which he summed up best when he said \nthat in the contest involving these laws between the Federal Government \nand States rights, it\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nis a zero sum game. In other words, if a claimant on civil rights under \na Federal civil rights statute, for example, such as the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, if that person wins against a State that does not \nprotect those civil rights, then somehow the State loses. The Federal \nGovernment wins and the State loses. He says it is a zero sum game.\n  What an odd view to have that somehow if the civil rights of people \nwith color, the civil rights of women, the civil rights of the elderly, \nthe civil rights of people with disabilities, if somehow they are \nconstitutionally upheld by the Federal courts, a State loses--an odd, \nodd view. But that is Mr. Sutton's view, a narrow, rigid, \ninterpretation of the law that does not recognize what we did, that \ndoes not recognize the history of discrimination, only his own ideology \nabout how that law should be interpreted. If civil rights wins, the \nState loses, according to Mr. Sutton.\n  This is what the New York Times said yesterday morning in the \neditorial: ``Another ideologue for the courts.'' Not that he is a bad \nman. I am not saying he is a bad man at all. I am just saying his views \nare antithetical to civil rights laws in this country. That is why over \n400 civil rights groups in this country have come out in opposition to \nMr. Sutton. Never before have all these groups come together to oppose \na nominee to the Federal bench. Maybe this group or that group might \nhave opposed this judge or that judge, but never before have all 400 \ncome together in opposing Mr. Sutton. Yet we are told we have to rush \nthe vote. We have to vote. We cannot debate it. We can't talk to our \ncaucuses; we have to vote at noon.\n\n  We hear all this talk that Mr. Sutton was just representing his \nclients. He wasn't just representing his clients. In his writings, in \nhis statements, in his sayings outside the courtroom, he says his \nideology, his belief is that it is a zero sum game. He believes in this \nfederalism stuff.\n  He says any congressional staffer with a laptop can make \nconstitutional law. That is not what we did when we passed the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. We spent years documenting \ndiscrimination against people with disabilities.\n  People may get up and say, ``I voted for the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.'' ``I cosponsored the Americans with Disabilities \nAct.'' Fine, we appreciate it. It passed the Senate 90 to 6. But I \ndon't understand how you can say you voted for it, you supported the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, but now you want to put a judge on the \nbench who wants to undermine that law and has so stated and has so \nwritten, that he would be willing to undermine it in preference to \nStates rights.\n  In 1948, the then-mayor of Minneapolis, Hubert Humphrey, stood up in \nfront of the national convention of the Democratic Party when then \nStrom Thurmond, who later became a Senator, walked out, took the South \nwith him, and formed the Dixiecrat Party because they didn't like the \ncivil rights plank in the Democratic platform in 1948. It was then-\nMayor Humphrey who got up before that Democratic convention and said: \nIt is time we get out of the shadow of States rights and into the \nsunshine of human rights.\n  He was right. The history of this country since then has been one of \nensuring the civil rights and civil liberties of our citizens.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, when you come over to vote, go through \nthe reception room. You will see dozens of people there: Hearing \nimpaired, some who are blind, people who use wheelchairs--people with \nall forms of the different types of disabilities. They are there. Walk \nby them and tell them you are going to vote for Jeffrey Sutton. Tell \nthem you are going to vote for Jeffrey Sutton because you believe their \nindividual States will protect their civil rights; that the individual \nStates will take care, will make sure they are not discriminated \nagainst.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will.\n  I just hope Senators will go by and, rather than saying they are \ngoing to vote for Sutton, will strike another blow for civil rights in \nthis country and tell the assembled people with disabilities out here \nin this reception room that we are going to say no to Mr. Sutton and we \nare going to set a higher standard for our Federal judges.\n  Let's defeat this nominee, not on a personal basis, but let's have \njudges who will understand that upholding people's civil rights against \nStates rights is not a zero sum game. When we win on our civil rights, \nwe all win.\n  I am glad to yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I said yesterday evening as we closed how I appreciated the \nstatements of the Senator from Arkansas yesterday and how the \nstatements were based on substance. A lot of times when we come to the \nSenate floor we talk in the abstract. You have not. I was touched when \nI heard the Senator from Iowa speak of his brother who was sent to a \nschool for the deaf and dumb--even though he was not dumb; he just \ncouldn't hear.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. I want the Senator to answer this question. The Senator \nfrom Iowa remembers Congressman Jim Bilbray, a Congressman from Nevada. \nWhen he was living back here, he had a daughter who had graduated from \nhigh school and invited one of her friends from Nevada to come back to \nWashington. They were trying to find accommodations for her friend, who \nwas a paraplegic. He was confined to a wheelchair. They called over 50 \nhotels and motels before they could find a place to stay for this young \nman with his wheelchair. That was prior to the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n  Is the Senator from Iowa describing what my friend Congressman \nBilbray's daughter went through, trying to find State-protected rights \nfor people with disabilities?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Nevada, when my brother Frank was \nout of school and in the workforce, I remember I was in the military. I \nwas a Navy pilot. I was down in Florida. I wanted my brother to come \ndown and visit me on one of his vacations. He didn't want to do that. I \nwas wondering why.\n  He said, You know, I am really concerned. I can get a car; I have a \ndriver's license. But he was afraid of staying in hotels and motels \nbecause he was concerned because he had read about a couple of motel \nfires. He said, What if I am in a motel or hotel and there is a fire? I \nwon't be able to hear anything. So he was afraid to travel.\n  Today when you go to hotels or motels, they have lights that flash \nand modest little improvements to make sure people with disabilities \ncan basically enjoy the same things we do.\n  The Senator from Nevada has accurately described what this country \nwas like before the Americans with Disabilities Act. Architectural \nbarriers? My nephew is an architect. After the act was passed, I \nremember my nephew said, Now we can start designing buildings the way \nthey ought to be designed, with universal accessibility. That is \nhappening today.\n  There was a young child turned away from a zoo because the child had \ncerebral palsy. The child was turned away from the zoo because they \nwere afraid that child would scare the chimpanzees. That is a true \nstory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had spoken to the majority staff. The \nmajority leader wants the vote at noon. However, the majority, of \ncourse, has indicated if we need another 5 minutes on each side, that \nwould be fine. So I ask unanimous consent the time for the vote be \nscheduled at 12:10, rather than 12, and that each side have an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nconcerned that they have used up their time. I would have yielded him \nsome time from my time if necessary. So there is no desire to mistreat \nhim or to treat him unfairly.\n  But let's just get the facts here. The nomination of Jeffrey Sutton \nhas been sitting here for 2 solid years and now we hear complaints that \nwe have to have a vote at 12:10 or 12? Come on.\n  Plus, I get a little tired of hearing from the other side that they \nseem to be the only people who care about persons with disabilities. I \ncan tell you\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\nthat bill would not have passed had it not been for people on this \nside, and I was one of the leaders. I managed the floor for the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. I was in all the meetings. I helped to \nnegotiate the compromise with the White House. I helped to resolve the \nproblem. And I feel every bit as deeply about persons with \ndisabilities, and so do all of my Republican colleagues, as do my \nwonderful friends on the other side, who seem to think they are the \nonly ones who care about persons with disabilities, or civil rights.\n  The fact is that had it not been for the Republican Party, the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 wouldn't have passed. I get a little tired of this \nholier-than-thou attitude--that they are the only ones who understand \nand they are the only ones who feel deeply about it.\n  I managed the floor the day we passed the Americans with Disabilities \nAct--and I went with the distinguished Senator from Iowa outside to \nmeet with the folks who were suffering from disabilities, and we both \nbroke down and cried because we were so happy to have passed that bill. \nI remember the day that I carried my brother-in-law through the Los \nAngeles temple in my arms with a great effort because he contracted \nboth types of polio. He contracted polio and became a paraplegic who \nwent on to finish his undergraduate, and went on to receive his \nmaster's in electrical engineering. He worked up to the day he died, \nalthough he came home every night and got into an iron lung.\n  So I hope our colleagues on the other side quit suggesting that we \ndon't seem to understand on this side the problems people have with \ndisabilities. We do understand.\n  Jeffrey Sutton worked for his father who ran a school for kids with \ncerebral palsy. To have him maligned here today and yesterday the way \nhe has been, after 2 years of sitting here waiting to get a chance to \nhave a vote up or down, goes a little bit beyond the pale.\n  I support this nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to be a judge on the \nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals precisely because he is a person of \ncapacity, decency, and honor who cares for those with disabilities. He \nis one of the top appellate lawyers in the country. He has nearly the \nhighest rating from the American Bar Association. They don't give that \nrating out easily. To have him presented here today as outside of the \nmainstream--that means outside of the way certain Senators on the other \nside believe--well, I have to say that isn't the description of the \nmainstream. Mr. Sutton is one of the top appellate lawyers in the \ncountry. He has argued over 45 appeals in this country--appeals for a \ndiversity of citizens in Federal and State courts across the country, \nincluding an impressive number--12 cases--before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. And I hear that he is outside the mainstream because he wins his \ncases before the Supreme Court? In a couple of cases, he lost. They \ndisagree with that, too.\n  I happen to believe the Supreme Court decides what mainstream is, in \nmany cases. They are not always right; I admit that. I was disappointed \nin some of their decisions. But the fact is he has been more in the \nmainstream than some of his critics. He understands what mainstream is. \nIn 2001, he had the best appellate advocate record of any advocate \nbefore the Supreme Court, arguing four cases and winning all four of \nthem. The fact that my colleagues on the other side do not like the \nresults in those cases--a number of which were decided unanimously by \nthe Supreme Court--shows they are outside the mainstream.\n  On January 2, 2003, the American Lawyer named him one of the best 45 \nlawyers in the country under the age of 45. That doesn't sound like \nsomebody who is out of the mainstream.\n  He is an outstanding nominee. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nhim.\n  I am happy to yield time to the distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah.\n  After 12 years, in about an hour from now we will finally be voting \non the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton, 2 years after his nomination was \nsubmitted by President Bush to this body.\n  I spoke twice yesterday in the Chamber in regard to his nomination, \nso I will not take much of my colleagues' time today to talk about the \nnomination. I have listened to my friends' comments--they are my \nfriends--who oppose this nomination. I have a great deal of respect for \nthem. But I believe I had to come back to the floor this morning and \nrespond, however briefly, to their comments.\n  As I have listened to their comments, it has become clear that the \nopposition to Jeffrey Sutton really does boil down to this: The fact \nthat the opponents to Jeffrey Sutton, those who in a few moments will \nvote against his nomination, do not like the positions he has taken in \ncases he has argued. The Garrett case is a prime example.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, as I said yesterday, and as \nI explained in more detail than I will today, I thought Jeffrey \nSutton's own argument on behalf of the State of Alabama in the Garrett \ncase was wrong. This Senator from Ohio believed it was wrong. And the \nU.S. Supreme Court decided that I was wrong. They decided that Jeffrey \nSutton and the State of Alabama were right. I happen to still think the \nSupreme Court got it wrong. I still happen to think Mr. Sutton's \narguments on behalf of his client, the State of Alabama, were wrong.\n  But the fact remains that Jeffrey Sutton was simply acting as a \nlawyer. He was acting as a lawyer--and in this case a successful \nlawyer--representing his client. If you analyze the different \ncriticisms and the different cases, what you will find time after time \nafter time is that he was acting in his capacity as a lawyer, and a \npretty successful lawyer.\n  If we would deny Jeffrey Sutton the ability to serve on the Federal \nbench because we do not like his clients, or we do not like the \nposition of his clients, or we do not like his advocacy for those \nclients or the position he took as a good lawyer following the canons \nof judicial ethics, it would set a very dangerous precedent for this \nSenate. It would have a chilling effect on the practice of law in this \ncountry.\n  Every lawyer in this country who had any thought or any ambition of \never serving on the Federal bench--I will guarantee that there are an \nawful lot of them out there who someday will have some dream in their \nmind of serving on the Federal bench, however realistic or not it might \nbe--each one of them would have to think: Gee, is my representation of \nthis client, is my representation of this particular cause going to \nsomehow affect my ability to get on the Federal bench? Will some \njudiciary committee, will some U.S. Senator, will some White House in \nthe future look at this and say, oh, that was a bad cause, that was \nsomething that was just too controversial?\n  No, my friends in the Senate, we don't want to go down that path. \nThat is a wrong path to go down. We know better. We know better than to \ndo that.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said: No, that is \nreally not what we are talking about. We are not talking about his \nrepresentation of someone in court. We are talking about what he said \noutside of the court. I think we have to look at that.\n\n  I submit to Members of the Senate, when you look at that allegation, \nand when you strip it away and look at the real facts, what you find \nis, in the cases that we look at, Jeffrey Sutton was still working as a \nlawyer.\n  I will give you an example: The famous NPR interview, National Public \nRadio interview, that has been cited time and time again on the floor \nby the opponents. There are quotes from Jeffrey Sutton about that, and \npeople say: Oh, look. He was talking on National Public Radio, and he \nwas not serving as a lawyer then, or he was not arguing a case in front \nof the United States Supreme Court; that must have been his own ideas.\n  What my colleagues fail to mention is that interview was done in \nconjunction with an oral argument in front of the United States Supreme \nCourt. If I am not mistaken, I think it was actually the same day he \nwas making the oral argument in front of the United States Supreme \nCourt. He was talking, I believe, about the Garrett case, and he was \ntelling the interviewer from NPR what his oral argument was going to \nbe.\n  We would obviously expect him not to disagree with what his oral \nargument was going to be. We would not expect him to say anything \ninconsistent\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\nwith what his oral argument was going to be. And we would expect him to \nadvocate for his clients and say the same thing on National Public \nRadio that he would say in the courtroom of the United States Supreme \nCourt. So again, Mr. Sutton was acting as a lawyer.\n  So to put it in a common term, it is a ``bum rap.'' This man has a \nright to be a lawyer--not only has a right to be a lawyer, he has an \nobligation to be a lawyer. It is what he has to do once he takes a \ncase.\n  He is a good lawyer. He is a lawyer who has done his job. He is a \nlawyer who is well qualified to serve on the Federal bench. I hope my \ncolleagues, when they come to the floor, will consider his life \nexperiences, his life's work, things he has done outside the courtroom \nas far as community service, as well as how well respected he clearly \nis by courts, by his colleagues, and by the community. Therefore, I \nhope my colleagues will vote to confirm Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also compliment my esteemed colleague \nfrom Ohio for his excellent remarks. Nobody knows this man better than \nthe distinguished Senator from Ohio. And, frankly, I know him quite \nwell myself. We ought to pay attention to the people who know him and \nnot make up stories about him, which I think is what is happening.\n  I have seen more and more of a vindictive approach against President \nBush's judgeship nominees than I have ever seen in my 27 years in the \nSenate. To malign these people who have the highest rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, as though they are not in the judicial \nmainstream, I think is hitting below the belt. And everybody suspects \nthe reason why this hitting below the belt is occurring is because, No. \n1, they think he might be pro-life. I do not know what he is as far as \nthat particular issue. The fact is, no single issue should stop \nsomebody who is otherwise qualified from serving in the Federal \nGovernment and serving his fellow human beings in this country.\n  But No. 2 is, they are afraid this fellow has Supreme Court \npotential, as many of President Bush's nominees have who have such high \nratings. So there is a deliberate attempt to damage him on his way up \nto the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals so he will never be nominated for \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I support the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to be a \njudge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals because he is worthy of it. \nMr. Sutton, like I say, is one of the top appellate lawyers in the \ncountry today. There is no question about it. I have mentioned how many \ncases he has argued, appellate cases, and at least 12 before the \nSupreme Court, winning most of them. I spoke yesterday at length about \nMr. Sutton's extremely accomplished legal record and the numerous \nletters of support I have received on his behalf.\n  Let me just take a few minutes today to discuss some additional \npoints my colleagues on the other side have raised.\n  Specifically, I would like to respond to the points raised on the \ntopic of federalism. It is as though they do not believe in federalism, \nthey only believe the Federal Government should have total control over \neverything. It is one reason I left the Democratic Party long ago, \nbecause I realized there is a principle of federalism that is hallowed \nin this country, constitutionally hallowed.\n  Mr. Sutton has argued three very important cases that have resulted \nin hotly debated U.S. Supreme Court opinions concerning the scope of \nCongress's power under section 5 of the 14th amendment to regulate \nState governments. Some of his critics--and a number of them, almost \nall of them--have suggested his involvement in these cases should \nsomehow disqualify him from the bench.\n  I think everyone here knows I have worked hard to enact some of the \nvery laws Mr. Sutton argued against on behalf of his clients as an \nadvocate, which is his responsibility as an attorney. Together with my \ngood friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, and \nothers, I worked very long hours on the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct, which was struck down in the City of Boerne case. I was one of the \nprincipal sponsors of and managed the floor for the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, a small portion of which was limited by University of \nAlabama v. Garrett, a case argued by Jeffrey Sutton. I also worked \nclosely with the distinguished Senator from Delaware on another law \nthat the Supreme Court, in the Morrison case, found, in part, to be \nbeyond Federal authority--the Violence Against Women Act.\n  It is important to understand that, notwithstanding the suggestions \nof some of my Democratic colleagues yesterday, the arguments Mr. Sutton \nadvanced on behalf of his clients in Garrett and Morrison did not \nadvocate an outright repeal of the ADA or the Violence Against Women \nAct, nor did those arguments suggest the purposes of those laws were \nnot worthwhile. Ultimately, the Supreme Court's decisions in those \ncases did limit certain aspects of those pieces of legislation, and I \nwill admit it was disappointing to see that happen after I put so much \ntime and energy into their enactment.\n  Under these circumstances, it would be relatively easy for me to take \ncheap shots and criticize Mr. Sutton for the role he played as an \nadvocate in those cases. But I am certainly not going to do so, for the \nsimple reason that ascribing to Mr. Sutton the positions of his clients \nis wrong, it is unfair, it is not right, it is beneath the dignity of \nthose who are attorneys who understand that advocates are advocates, \nand they should carry the best argument for their clients they can.\n  This principle is so fundamental that it hardly merits mention, and \nyet you hear these arguments like he should not have done that. If we \nshould not do things as attorneys, maybe there will not be any \nadvocates to advocate for various positions.\n  Moreover, as a substantive matter, none of Mr. Sutton's arguments can \nfairly be characterized as outside the mainstream--not one.\n  In the City of Boerne v. Flores, a 6-to-3 decision he won, dealing \nwith the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, none--none--of the Supreme \nCourt Justices disagreed with the position Mr. Sutton advocated in that \ncase--none. All nine agreed with him. So he is outside the mainstream \nof American jurisprudence? Guess who is outside the mainstream. It \nisn't Mr. Sutton. It is this desire that everybody think in lockstep, \nand do in lockstep, what some on the other side think ought to be done. \nNo Justice disagreed with him.\n  Now, as much as my colleagues do not like the Supreme Court, I have \nto tell you, they are a coequal branch of Government, and they do help \nus to know what the law really is. And none of them disagreed with Mr. \nSutton.\n  The same was true in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents--not one \nJustice on the Supreme Court disagreed with the interpretation of the \n14th amendment Mr. Sutton advanced in that case--not one. Who is \noutside the mainstream? It certainly isn't Mr. Sutton.\n  Now, I will concede the Garrett case was a bit narrower, but it was \nstill a 5-to-4 decision. Five of the Justices voted with Mr. Sutton's \nargument in that case. Nevertheless, almost by definition, I think \nlegal arguments which garner that kind of support in the Supreme Court \nsimply cannot be pegged as outside of the mainstream of American legal \nthinking as to be somehow unworthy of an advocate--or a judicial \nnominee.\n  I agree. My colleagues don't agree with him or didn't agree with his \narguments. I didn't in some ways. But that disagreement should not stop \nus from voting for a person who, as an advocate, had an obligation to \nmake those arguments and who won on his arguments.\n  I would also like to discuss Mr. Sutton's comments in the media \nmentioned during the course of this debate. Much ado has been made \nabout his comment reported in the Legal Times that:\n\n       It doesn't get me invited to cocktail parties, but I love \n     these issues. I believe in this Federalism stuff.\n\n  Tell me what is wrong with that. Federalism is a hallowed principle \nof constitutional law. I believe in it, too. I believe deep down some \nof my colleagues on the other side believe in it, although I have to \nadmit, I think a\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\nnumber of them don't. They are wrong not to. They are outside of the \nmainstream of American jurisprudence.\n  Well, federalism is not a bad word or an unpopular concept. It is a \nwell-established part of our system of government. As the Supreme Court \nnoted in its 1995 decision in U.S. v. Lopez:\n\n       Just as the separation and independence of coordinate \n     branches of the Federal Government serve to prevent the \n     accumulation of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy \n     balance of power between the States and the Federal \n     Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from \n     either front.\n\n  The court also noted that:\n\n       This constitutionally mandated division of authority ``was \n     adopted by the framers to ensure protection of our \n     fundamental liberties.''\n\n  Who is outside of the mainstream of American jurisprudence? Certainly \nnot Mr. Sutton. Some of these arguments made against him are outside. I \nadmit that.\n  That is what federalism means. Like Jeffrey Sutton, I believe in it, \ntoo. I think anybody who understands constitutional law must believe in \nit. We could differ as to how it should be applied in all cases, but \nthose are political arguments. Frankly, an advocate has an obligation \nto represent his client and do the best he can for them, which Sutton \ndid, and he won.\n  Just as I believe in the separation of powers of the three branches \nof the Federal Government, believing in federalism does not mean you \nalways believe States should prevail in any given dispute. Mr. Sutton \ndoesn't believe that; neither do I. As I have stated before, I am \ndisappointed any time the Supreme Court holds unconstitutional any \nlegislation for which I fought and bled, that I vigorously worked to \nenact. However, I do believe in the Federal system that our Founders \ncreated and the courts have protected over the years. I cannot derive \nfrom Mr. Sutton's quote that he meant anything more than he believed in \nfederalism as a structural component of our American system of \ngovernment, something I think is certainly true.\n  I want to make a few points about Mr. Sutton's record which has been \nattacked, I believe, unfairly. We are getting used to that in the \nSenate. Some suggest that the few cases in which Mr. Sutton has \nrepresented States, in what some consider unpopular causes, \ndemonstrates a bias towards States rights. However, Mr. Sutton has \nrepresented a wide range of clients in his legal practice. In those \ncases where he represented States, he was either acting in his official \ncapacity or was hired by the State and paid a full fee. However, he has \nrepresented a significant number of clients with very diverse interests \non a pro bono basis. These clients include death row defendants, \nprisoner rights plaintiffs, the National Coalition for Students with \nDisabilities, the NAACP, the Center for Handgun Violence--to name a \nfew. I notice some of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee on the \nDemocrat side have sent out a letter criticizing him, saying he has \nnever done anything for civil rights. What are those cases?\n\n  In addition, I recently received a very supportive letter from Mr. \nRiyaz Kanji, a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice David Souter \nand Judge Betty Fletcher of the Ninth Circuit, neither of whom would be \nconsidered conservatives by any judicial measure. He said that he \ncontacted Mr. Sutton in advance to ask for assistance on an amicus \nbrief for the National Congress of American Indians and an Indian law \ncase pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Kanji wrote:\n\n       Mr. Sutton took the time to call me back from vacation the \n     very next morning to express a strong interest in working on \n     the case. In our ensuing conversations, it became apparent to \n     me that Mr. Sutton did not simply want to work on the matter \n     for the small amount of compensation it would bring him (he \n     readily agreed to charge far below his usual rates for the \n     brief), but that he instead had a genuine interest in \n     understanding why Native American tribes have fared as poorly \n     as they have in front of the Supreme Court in recent years . \n     . . I think it is fair to say that most individuals who are \n     committed to furthering the cause of State's rights without \n     regard to any other values or interests in our society do not \n     evidence that type of concern for tribal interests.\n\n  I would also like to share a letter from a good friend, former \ncolleague to all of us in this body, Senator Robert Dole. Senator Dole \nwas also in the meetings when we were able to arrive at a final \nconclusion on the Americans with Disabilities Act. He was instrumental \nin passing the Americans with Disabilities Act. Senator Dole is a well-\nknown advocate for the rights of disabled Americans. He wrote a letter \nto the Judiciary Committee strongly supporting Jeffrey Sutton because \nof his ``demonstrated commitment to safeguarding the rights of all \nAmericans, especially those of persons with disabilities.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the Dole letter in the \nRecord, along with some of the copies of other letters of support for \nJeffrey Sutton's nomination that the committee has received.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Senator Bob Dole,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On May 9 of 2001, President Bush \n     nominated to a vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     Sixth Circuit one of the most distinguished lawyers in the \n     United States: Jeffrey S. Sutton of Columbus, Ohio. I ask \n     that you join me in backing Jeff's nomination, which I \n     support in part because of his demonstrated commitment to \n     safeguarding the rights of all Americans--especially those of \n     persons with disabilities.\n       As you know, some in the disability-rights community--for \n     whom I have great respect and with whom I have had the \n     privilege of working in the past, including during our joint \n     efforts to pass the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act \n     in 1990--have raised questions about Jeff's nomination. I \n     believe that these criticisms miss the mark, and do so by a \n     wide margin. For during his career as a lawyer, both as an \n     Ohio government official and in private practice, Jeff Sutton \n     has gone out of his way to defend the interests of the \n     disabled.\n       In 1996, Jeff tried to convince the Ohio Supreme Court that \n     Case Western Reserve University had unlawfully discriminated \n     against Cheryl Fischer, who is blind, when it refused to \n     admit her to its medical school solely on the basis of her \n     disability. Jeff actively sought out the opportunity to \n     represent Ms. Fischer, and he was passionately dedicated to \n     her cause. But don't take my word for it. Here's what Ms. \n     Fischer has to say:\n       ``Working for the State, Jeff took my case on, firmly \n     convinced I had been wronged. I recall with much pride just \n     how committed Jeff was to my cause. He believed in my \n     position. He cared and listened and wanted badly to win for \n     me. I recall well sitting in the courtroom of the Ohio \n     Supreme Court listening to Jeff present my case. It was then \n     that I realized just how fortunate I was to have a lawyer \n     of Jeff's caliber so devoted to working for me and the \n     countless of others with both similar disabilities and \n     dreams.''\n       Jeff fell just one vote short of prevailing, but his \n     service to Ms. Fischer leaves no doubt as to his commitment \n     to defending the rights of the disabled.\n       Cheryl Fischer is not the only person with a disability to \n     be helped by Jeff Sutton. Six years later, Jeff was the lead \n     counsel in a case brought by the National Coalition of \n     Students with Disabilities against the state of Ohio, his \n     former employer. Jeff argued that Ohio universities were \n     failing to provide voter-registration materials to their \n     disabled students, in violation of the federal ``motor \n     voter'' law. As a direct result of Jeff's efforts, the \n     National Coalition of Students with Disabilities prevailed, \n     and the state of Ohio was made to set up voter-assistance \n     stations at state colleges and universities.\n       Beyond representing them in court, Jeff Sutton has improved \n     the lives of the disabled through his service to a \n     disability-rights group. Since 2000, Jeff has served on the \n     Board of Trustees of the Equal Justice Foundation, which \n     provides free legal services to the disadvantaged, including \n     persons with disabilities. During his service, the Equal \n     Justice Foundation has filed lawsuits against three Ohio \n     cities demanding that they make their sidewalks wheelchair \n     accessible. It has sued an amusement park that flatly \n     prohibited the disabled from riding its rides. And it has \n     represented a woman with a mental illness who lived in \n     subsidized housing, when her landlord tried to evict her on \n     the ground of her disability.\n       Again, those who know Jeff Sutton best speak with great \n     eloquence about his dedication to the disabled. Kim Skaggs, \n     the Executive Director of the Equal Justice Foundation, \n     testifies that:\n       ``I admired Mr. Sutton's abilities so much that, upon \n     joining the Equal Justice Foundation, I actively recruited \n     him to become a member of the Equal Justice Foundation's \n     Board of Trustees. Much to his credit, Mr. Sutton accepted \n     and has been extremely supportive of the Foundation's work. I \n     believe that Mr. Sutton possesses all the necessary qualities \n     to be an outstanding federal judge. I have no hesitation \n     whatsoever in supporting his nomination.''\n       These are not the actions of a man who is indifferent to \n     the rights of persons with disabilities. Although he defended \n     the state of Alabama in an Americans with Disabilities Act \n     lawsuit, the complete picture of Jeff Sutton's career reveals \n     a consistent concern\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\n     about the special burdens that the disabled face in their \n     everyday lives, and an equally consistent commitment to \n     alleviating those burdens. In all candor, I believe that my \n     friends in the disability-rights community should be actively \n     supporting Jeff Sutton's nomination. For we are not likely to \n     find a more sympathetic ear on the federal bench.\n       I do not write these words lightly. As you know, I spent \n     many years in the United States Senate fighting for the \n     rights of the disabled. I co-sponsored and worked hard for \n     passage of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. I have \n     no doubt that, if he is confirmed, Jeff Sutton will \n     faithfully enforce that law, just as he will enforce all acts \n     of Congress. And I have no doubt that he will scrupulously \n     respect the rights of the disabled, just as he will respect \n     the rights of all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Arent Fox Kintner Plotkin\n\n\n                                                 & Kahn, PLLC,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 7, 2003.\n     Re nomination of Jeffrey S. Sutton to the Sixth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch: I am writing to urge \n     the prompt confirmation of Jeffrey S. Sutton to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. I believe that \n     Mr. Sutton is eminently qualified and would be a great asset \n     to the federal judiciary.\n       Mr. Sutton is one of the top appellate advocates in the \n     country, having argued twelve cases in the United States \n     Supreme Court, with a 9-2 record (and one case pending). In \n     the 2000-2001 Term, he argued more cases than any other \n     private attorney in the country, and won all four of them. \n     And in Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236 (1998), the Court \n     sua sponte appointed Mr. Sutton to argue the case as a friend \n     of the Court. When he served as the State Solicitor of Ohio, \n     the National Association of Attorneys General presented Mr. \n     Sutton with a Best Brief Award for practice in the United \n     States Supreme Court an unprecedented four years in a row. \n     And this month, the American Lawyer included Mr. Sutton in \n     its list of the top forty-five lawyers in the country under \n     the age of forty-five.\n       I understand that some legal arguments Mr. Sutton has made \n     in the course of representing clients have aroused some \n     controversy in connection with his nomination. Having recent \n     experience myself with the judicial confirmation process, I \n     strongly urge the Senate to reject any unfair inference that \n     Mr. Sutton's personal views must coincide with positions he \n     has advocated on behalf of clients. It is, of course, the \n     role of the advocate to raise the strongest available \n     arguments on behalf of a client's litigation position \n     regardless of the lawyer's personal convictions on the proper \n     legal, let alone policy, outcome of the case. I am confident \n     that Mr. Sutton has the ability, temperament, and objectivity \n     to be an excellent judge.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bonnie J. Campbell.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                Cleveland, OH,\n\n                                                     May 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Senator Mike DeWine,\n     Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: A few weeks ago my sister called to \n     tell me that President Bush nominated Jeff Sutton to serve on \n     the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. I was thrilled to hear \n     the news.\n       While working as Solicitor General for the State of Ohio, \n     Jeff represented me in a lawsuit the Ohio Civil Rights \n     Commission brought against Case Western Reserve University on \n     my behalf. I sought but was denied admission to the Case \n     Western medical school. I alleged then, as I continue to \n     believe now, that the school denied my application for one \n     impermissible reason: I'm blind. The Ohio Civil Rights \n     Commission agreed with me. After a thorough investigation, \n     the Commission determined that I was otherwise qualified for \n     admission and that the school could make reasonable \n     accommodations to enable me to pursue training to become a \n     psychiatrist.\n       The case worked its way through the Ohio courts and \n     ultimately landed on the Ohio Supreme Court. It was at this \n     point that I first met Jeff Sutton. Working for the State, \n     Jeff took my case on, firmly convinced I had been wronged. I \n     recall with much pride just how committed Jeff was to my \n     cause. He believed in my position. He cared and listened and \n     wanted badly to win for me. I recall well sitting in the \n     courtroom of the Ohio Supreme Court listening to Jeff present \n     my case. It was then that I realized just how fortunate I was \n     to have a lawyer of Jeff's caliber so devoted to working for \n     me and the countless of other with both similar disabilities \n     and dreams.\n       Although I ultimately fell short in the courts, Jeff Sutton \n     stood firm by my side. My experience confirmed what President \n     Bush understands: Our nation would be greatly served with \n     Jeff Sutton on the federal bench.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Cheryl A. Fischer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 State of Arizona,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                       Phoenix, AZ, July 24, 2001.\n     Re nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the United States Court of \n         Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Hatch: As the Attorney General for \n     Arizona, and a former U.S. Attorney, I write to urge that Mr. \n     Sutton's nomination be considered based on his own merits as \n     a prospective judge rather than positions he may have taken \n     as an advocate for particular clients. Lawyers have a \n     professional obligation to be zealous advocates on behalf of \n     their clients, and the ethical rules governing lawyers \n     generally recognize that such representation does not \n     constitute a personal endorsement of a client's position. See \n     ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, ER 1.2(b). This \n     principle is particularly important for lawyers representing \n     State governments and other public entities. Often such \n     lawyers have a professional obligation to defend or advocate \n     positions taken by legislatures, elected officials, or public \n     agencies that may differ from the lawyer's personal views on \n     public policy or moral issues. Penalizing a lawyer for \n     vigorously advocating on behalf of such clients would be \n     wrong--it would not only blur the important distinction \n     between the positions a lawyer may take on behalf of a client \n     and the lawyer's own views, it would also undermine effective \n     representation for public entities.\n       Mr. Sutton served with great distinction as the Solicitor \n     General of Ohio and has otherwise had a distinguished legal \n     career. I respectfully urge that his nomination be scheduled \n     for a hearing and considered based on his individual \n     qualifications rather than positions he may have advanced for \n     particular clients.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Janet Napolitano,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2001.\n     Re Nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the United States Court of \n         Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned individual state \n     Attorneys General, are writing to urge your prompt and \n     affirmative vote on confirmation of the nomination of Jeffrey \n     Sutton to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth \n     Circuit.\n       Mr. Sutton is an award-winning, highly-qualified attorney. \n     Jeff Sutton's intelligence and qualifications are \n     unquestioned, with a great deal of experience in commercial, \n     constitutional and appellate litigation. He has argued nine \n     cases in the United States Supreme Court, including Hohn v. \n     United States, in which the Court invited Mr. Sutton's \n     participation, and Becker v. Montgomery, in which he \n     represented a prisoner's interests pro bono. He has argued \n     twelve cases in the Ohio Supreme Court and seven cases in the \n     federal courts of appeal. And, as the former Ohio State \n     Solicitor, he has also handled countless cases in the state \n     and federal courts. His career has been distinguished, and he \n     has displayed a rare sense of principled fairness throughout \n     it.\n       Jeff Sutton graduated first in his law school class, and \n     clerked for two United States Supreme Court justices. It \n     deserves note that Mr. Sutton has represented a wide range of \n     clients. For example, he represented Cheryl Fischer, a blind \n     woman, who claimed that Case Western University Medical \n     School discriminated against her on basis of disability in \n     denying her admission to medical school. He also is a board \n     member of the Equal Justice Foundation, which provides legal \n     representation to the indigent and has filed several class \n     actions on behalf of the disabled. Beyond this, he has filed \n     pro bono amicus briefs on behalf of the NAACP, the \n     AntiDefamation League and the Center for the Prevention of \n     Handgun Violence.\n       Unfortunately, Mr. Sutton's exemplary record is being \n     distorted by some critics, and as state Attorneys General, we \n     are particularly concerned when we see a lawyer being \n     attacked not for positions he advocated as a private \n     individual, but for positions he argued as a legal advocate \n     for State government. For example, some critics have claimed \n     that Mr. Sutton is against the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act because he argued that one provision of the law \n     overstepped States' rights (in the case of Univ of\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\n     Alabama v. Garrett). We do not wish here to debate the merits \n     of that position; although we note that the Supreme Court \n     agreed with that position. The important point here at issue \n     is that Mr. Sutton argued that case as a lawyer representing \n     his client. He was not advocating his personal views; rather, \n     he was working to represent a public-sector client.\n       This distinction, between personal policy preferences and \n     legal advocacy, is a crucial one, and we Attorneys General \n     have a unique perspective on the importance of that \n     distinction. We are legal advocates, sworn to uphold the \n     interests of our clients, and while we also serve as policy \n     advocates for our States, we often must adopt legal positions \n     that do not match our personal beliefs.\n       As you know, all attorneys have an ethical duty to \n     zealously represent their clients' interests within the \n     bounds of the law, even where the lawyer may not personally \n     share the client's views. This is especially true for public \n     sector lawyers, because we are bound not only by the same \n     ethical rules as all lawyers, but we are also bound by law to \n     represent our legislatures, governors, and agencies. As \n     Attorney General, each of us has worked to advocate legal \n     positions that may not reflect our personal beliefs. Doing so \n     may be difficult, but that is our job and our duty as lawyers \n     and as public servants.\n       Just as we do this, so do the attorneys who work for us. \n     They have often been faced with the challenge of espousing a \n     position which might not match their own personal beliefs. \n     While their abilities in representing their clients will \n     surely be evaluated by the Senate whenever those government \n     lawyers are nominated for federal judgeships, we urge you not \n     to unnecessarily mistake their advocacy for personal belief. \n     We all believe that everyone in America deserves legal \n     representation no matter how unpopular his or her cause may \n     seem. Lawyers will not be willing to take on such causes if \n     they fear that their advocacy may later be used against them. \n     The potential chilling effect could be enormous.\n       Indeed, as legislators, you have a great interest in seeing \n     that government lawyers advocate the government's position \n     and not their own. When Congress passes legislation, you have \n     the right to expect that the United States Solicitor General \n     and the entire Department of Justice will defend Congress's \n     work. Individual federal lawyers cannot pick and choose \n     whether to represent only the federal acts that they like. We \n     expect the same of lawyers for the States.\n       We respectfully suggest that Mr. Sutton should not be \n     criticized because he has been a vigorous and effective \n     advocate. That has been his duty, and it is to his credit \n     that he has discharged that duty well.\n       When you review Mr. Sutton's nomination, please look at his \n     qualifications and his ability to understand and apply the \n     law. Please do not assume that his past legal positions \n     reflect his personal views. No lawyer would wish to be \n     personally held to every position which, as an advocate, he \n     or she was required to advance.\n           Sincerely,\n         Betty D.

Butterworth, \n           Attorney General of Florida; Alan Lance, Attorney \n           General of Idaho; M.

Stridiron, Attorney General of the \n           Virgin Islands.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also point out a letter from Bonnie \nCampbell from Arent Fox, who herself was not approved to go on the \ncourt. I feel badly that we were unable to get to her. But she writes:\n\n       . . . to urge prompt confirmation of Jeffrey S. Sutton to \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. I \n     believe that Mr. Sutton is eminently qualified and would be a \n     great asset to the federal judiciary.\n\n  By the way, Ms. Campbell headed the Violence Against Women efforts on \nbehalf of the Clinton administration; some on the other side have \ncriticized Mr. Sutton and his arguments on the violence against women \ncases before the Supreme Court.\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       Mr. Sutton is one of the top appellate advocates in the \n     country, having argued twelve cases in the United States \n     Supreme Court, with a 9-2 record (and one case pending). In \n     the 2002 and 2001 Term, he argued more cases than any other \n     private attorney in the country, and won all four of them. \n     And in Hohn v. United States . . . the Court sua sponte \n     appointed Mr. Sutton to argue the case as a friend of the \n     Court.\n\n  That in and of itself, I might add, shows the high esteem with which \nthe Supreme Court holds this man, certainly a man not outside the \nmainstream. She said:\n\n       When he served as State Solicitor of Ohio, the National \n     Association of Attorneys General presented Mr. Sutton with \n     the Best Brief Award for practice in the United States \n     Supreme Court, an unprecedented four times in a row.\n\n  Does that sound like somebody outside the mainstream? Continuing from \nthe letter:\n\n       And this month the American Lawyer included Mr. Sutton in \n     its list of the top 45 lawyers in the country under the age \n     of forty-five.\n       I understand that some legal arguments Mr. Sutton has made \n     in the course of representing clients have aroused some \n     controversy in connection with his nomination. Having recent \n     experience myself with the judicial confirmation process, I \n     strongly urge the Senate to reject any unfair inference that \n     Mr. Sutton's personal views must coincide with positions he \n     has advocated on behalf of clients.\n\n  This is exactly the argument made by a number on the other side, an \nargument she rejects. She continues:\n\n       It is, of course, the role of the advocate to raise the \n     strongest available arguments on behalf of a client's \n     litigation position regardless of the lawyer's personal \n     convictions on the proper legal, let alone policy, outcome of \n     the case. I am confident that Mr. Sutton has the ability, \n     temperament, and objectivity to be an excellent judge.\n\n  I respect her for writing that letter. I have to say I admire her for \ndoing so.\n  I might add that in Senator Dole's letter, he went on to list Mr. \nSutton's work on behalf of Cheryl Fischer and the nonprofit Equal \nJustice Foundation, which often represents disabled clients in the Ohio \ncommunity. Senator Dole continued:\n\n       I do not write these words lightly. As you know, I spent \n     many years in the United States Senate fighting for the \n     rights of the disabled.\n       I have no doubt that, if he is confirmed, Jeff Sutton will \n     faithfully enforce that law, just as he will enforce all laws \n     of Congress. And I have no doubt that he will scrupulously \n     respect the rights of the disabled, just as he will respect \n     the rights of all Americans.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will take note of Senator Dole's endorsement, \nwhich I believe speaks volumes on the integrity and fairness of Jeffrey \nSutton. His record indicates he will be a brilliant jurist of whom we \ncan all be proud.\n  I am going to cast my vote in favor of this confirmation to the Sixth \nCircuit, and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to do the same. I \nurge my colleagues to get beyond these fallacious arguments that he is \noutside of the mainstream of American jurisprudence, these arguments \nthat he is unworthy of being in this position--although they admit he \nis a highly qualified, good person. Think about it.\n  The fact is, their gold standard rated him--the American Bar \nAssociation--nearly the highest possible rating available. Now, that \nspeaks volumes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I come to the floor of the Senate \nto offer my support for Jeffrey Sutton and urge my colleagues to \nsupport his confirmation. The Sixth Circuit, which includes my State of \nKentucky, is experiencing a true judicial emergency. Six of the sixteen \nseats on that court currently sit vacant, leading to justice delayed--\nand thus justice denied--for the citizens of Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, \nand Michigan. We need Jeffrey Sutton and we need five others like him \non the Sixth Circuit.\n  Jeffrey Sutton was first nominated by President Bush on May 9, 2001. \nIt has taken him almost 2 years to be confirmed and assume his seat on \nthe bench. That is a long time to wait--but he is one of the lucky \nnominees, since he is actually getting a vote.\n  Jeffrey Sutton is an example of the fine nominees President Bush has \nsubmitted to the Senate. He was rated ``Qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation. He has argued 12 cases before the United States Supreme \nCourt, with a strong record of success. He has served as State \nSolicitor of Ohio and\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\nwas highly respected by his peers in that position. He clerked for two \nSupreme Court justices as well as for the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Currently, Mr. Sutton is a partner at the well respected Jones \nDay law firm and he teaches law school classes at Ohio State \nUniversity. His experience in appellate law practice has earned him \nacclaim from one legal publication as one of the 45 best lawyers under \nthe age of 45 in the whole country.\n  I am proud that President Bush nominated Jeffrey Sutton and I am \nproud to vote for him. He is well qualified to serve on an appellate \ncourt and will do a fine job for all states in the circuit. I am glad \nhe will soon be confirmed to the Sixth Circuit, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support him as well.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote no on the nomination of \nJeffrey Sutton to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit. I'd like to take a moment to explain my decision.\n  I have concluded that I cannot support the nomination of Mr. Sutton \nbecause I am not convinced that he will give all those who appear \nbefore him a fair and impartial hearing. I am greatly troubled by Mr. \nSutton's record of handling cases that have resulted in the curtailment \nof important civil rights, environmental, and other protections. Mr. \nSutton has filed amicus briefs that argued for limiting Congress' \nauthority to enact laws to protect the rights of the disabled, women, \nthe elderly, the poor, and racial or ethnic minorities, as well as laws \ncritical to protecting the environment.\n  These cases resulted in some of the most notable Supreme Court \ndecisions of the last decade that have restricted the ability of \nCongress to protect the rights of Americans and the environment.\n  Now, at his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sutton repeatedly defended his \ninvolvement in these cases by stating that he was simply doing his job \nof zealously representing his client. I appreciate this argument to \nsome extent, especially during his tenure as State Solicitor of Ohio. \nBut my concerns remain because I know that once he went into private \npractice, he certainly had the ability to choose whether to accept \nclients and inject himself into cases. Moreover, the purpose of amicus \nbriefs, which Mr. Sutton filed while in both the Solicitor's office and \nprivate practice, is not to defend a client against litigation or to \nseek redress on behalf of that client. It is, as we know, an \nopportunity for a third party to inject an opinion into a case for \nwhich the third party has no immediate interest. In significant states' \nrights case after case, Mr. Sutton consistently sought out cases in \nwhich he could argue for limiting the role of Congress in ensuring \nconstitutional protections for Americans.\n  Furthermore, it seems as though this is a personal crusade for Mr. \nSutton. Outside of his role as a lawyer representing clients, he took \ntime to articulate his personal view that Congress should be restrained \nin its effort to protect civil rights and the environment. Through his \ninvolvement with the Federalist Society, including serving as an \nofficer of its Separation of Powers and Federalism practice group, and \nhis writings and statements, Mr. Sutton has said that he ``believes in \nthis stuff'' and is ``on the lookout'' for cases where he can raise \nfederalism issues.\n  I am concerned about this pattern of arguments, writings, and \nstatements that challenge laws Congress has worked so hard to advance \nthose that would safeguard our precious wetlands and natural habitats \nand fight discrimination of any and every kind. We cannot reasonably \nexpect to one day eliminate discrimination in this country if we \nconfirm nominees like Mr. Sutton, who seem to be ready to turn back the \nclock on civil rights through the application of a dry but extremely \nconsequential federalism doctrine, to one of the most important courts \nin the nation.\n  Finally, I want to add that I was troubled by Mr. Sutton's response \nto one of my questions. In answering to a question about congressional \nauthority for enacting a Federal environmental law, he said that the \ncase involved statutory interpretation and that he simply argued that \nthe Court need not reach the constitutional question. I later reviewed \nthe brief and confirmed that six out of ten pages of his brief, in \nfact, focused on the constitutionality of the Federal environmental \nregulation. I confronted him with this fact in a followup question, and \nhe continued to insist that the argument he made was not unusual. I do \nnot believe that is the case. Mr. Sutton himself filed an amicus brief \nin another case urging ``constitutional avoidance'' without making such \nan extensive argument against the constitutionality of the statute.\n  I don't like voting against judicial nominees. This was a difficult \ndecision for me because I do think that Mr. Sutton made an effort to \naddress the Committee's concerns, in contrast to some other nominees \nwho have come before us. I understand that President Bush has the right \nto nominate whomever he wants to the federal bench. But the Senate is \nnot obligated to let the President's nominees sail through, as if there \nwere no checks and balances, no constitutional requirement of advise \nand consent. As much as it is our duty to fill vacancies in the Federal \njudiciary, it is also our duty to give great and searching scrutiny to \nthose nominees who have a record that calls into question their ability \nto give all those litigants who would appear before the nominees a fair \nand impartial hearing.\n  I am more than pleased to vote to confirm judicial nominees that are \nfair-minded and supported by a consensus of members, and, once again, I \nurge the President to speed up the nominations process by sending such \nnominees to the Senate. I do not believe that Mr. Sutton is such \nnominee. He is a bright and accomplished attorney, but he is not the \nright person for this seat on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my strong opposition to the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the \nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  During my time in Congress, I have worked hard to ensure equal rights \nfor all Americans. Over the last three decades we have made great \nstrides in ensuring equal rights for disabled Americans, older \nAmericans, and other individuals. The confirmation of Jeffrey Sutton to \nthe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals will set back our progress if he is \nallowed to continue his work of eroding the coverage of civil rights \nlaws passed by Congress, not just as an attorney, but as a Federal \njudge.\n  Let me provide my colleagues a quick review of Mr. Sutton's record \nand its impact on equal rights for all Americans. In University of \nAlabama v. Garrett, State workers lost their right to bring damage \nsuits under the Americans with Disabilities Act. In Kimel v. Florida, \nState workers lost the right to bring damage suits under the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act. In Alexander v. Sandoval, all \nAmericans lost the ability to file a private right of action to enforce \nthe disparate impact regulations of title VI of the Civil Rights Act. \nIn fact, the Sandoval rationale has been applied to say that \nindividuals who are fired or demoted because they complain about gender \ninequities in a school's sports or education program cannot bring a \nchallenge under title IX.\n  Unfortunately, for all Americans interested in equal rights, the \nexamples above have already occurred. Other arguments Mr. Sutton has \nmade will provide my colleagues and all Americans a look ahead to the \nfurther erosion of equal rights if Mr. Sutton is confirmed to the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. Sutton has argued that advocates for low-income children should \nnot be allowed to effectively enforce a State's failure to provide them \nessential health services required by the Medicaid Act, Westside \nMothers v. Haveman. Families would not be able to challenge a State's \nfailure to provide notices or hearings when their Medicaid HMOs deny or \ndelay needed treatment if Sutton's theories from Westside Mothers had \nbeen accepted. Additionally, parents would not be able to bring a \nchallenge to a State's systemic failure to provide occupational \ntherapy, speech therapy, and other services that help ensure that \ndisabled children receive a free and appropriate public education as \nrequired by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act if Sutton's \ntheories in Westside\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\nMothers had been accepted. Deaf students at State universities would \nnot be able to require schools to provide them with interpreters, \ncaptioning, and other assistance as required by title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. if Sutton's additional far-reaching \narguments in Garrett had prevailed.\n  Mr. Sutton's history shows more than just a desire to represent his \nclients zealously; it shows a belief in a philosophy. This is a \nphilosophy that says the right of the State trumps all, even in the \nface of extensive Congressional findings. This is a philosophy that \nsays the right of the State overrules the most basic of equal rights \nlaws that the Federal Government may pass. This is a philosophy that \nthe State can discriminate against its employees and citizens even in \nthe face of Federal antidiscrimination laws. This is not a philosophy I \ncan support, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this morning we are going to vote on the \nnomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit. Yesterday, I spoke about some of my concerns, but I want to \nagain discuss my serious concerns with this nominee.\n  Mr. Sutton has a legal philosophy focused on limiting Congress' \nhistoric role in protecting the civil and constitutional rights of all \nAmericans. He has led an aggressive campaign to dismantle longstanding \nFederal laws, enacted with bipartisan support, that have made this \ncountry more inclusive over the last half-century, and to close access \nto the Federal courts for people challenging illegal acts by their \nState governments.\n  As a lawyer in private practice, he has aggressively sought out cases \nto limit the power of Congress to enact laws protecting individual \nrights, and has been dismissive of congressional findings and hearings \nsupporting important Federal laws. He has sought to weaken, among other \nlaws, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act. He has also sought to limit the ability of \nMedicaid recipients to enforce their rights and the ability of \nindividuals to enforce disparate impact regulations under title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act. In essence, he has argued for the Supreme Court \nto repudiate more than 25 years of legal precedents that permitted \nindividuals to sue States when they violate Federal civil rights \nregulations. His extreme judicial philosophy would undermine the rights \nof State workers, disabled individuals, women, children, racial and \nethnic minorities, and senior citizens.\n  Mr. Sutton and his supporters have claimed that he was merely acting \non behalf of his clients in all these cases, but this claim is \nunconvincing. Mr. Sutton had no obligation to participate in any of the \ncases taken after he left the Ohio State Solicitor's office in 1998. In \nfact, he has admitted that he sought out cases curtailing congressional \npower as a private lawyer and that he is on the ``lookout'' for these \ncases. He has aggressively pursued a national role as the leading \nadvocate of States' rights and, as my colleagues have noted, he has \nstated that his advocacy on the principles of federalism is something \nthat he believes in.\n  He has made statements praising many of the Supreme Court's decisions \nundermining Congress' authority to protect and assist citizens, and in \nhis personal writings and speeches he has advocated an even narrower \nview of Congress' role. Perhaps most significantly, Mr. Sutton has \ntaken not a single case that supports congressional power to enact laws \nprotecting civil and individual rights. In each case he has argued \nbefore the Supreme Court he has always been on the same side of this \nissue--arguing that individuals have no right to enforce the civil \nrights protections that Congress has given them. This must be more than \na coincidence.\n  His personal writings and speeches promote his theory that State laws \nadequately protect civil liberties, and display a lack of respect and \nunderstanding for Congress' long-standing role in protecting individual \nrights.\n  Mr. Sutton has stated in several articles that States should be the \nprincipal bulwark in protecting civil liberties, a claim that has \nserious implications given a history of State discrimination against \nindividuals. In numerous papers for the Federalist Society, he has \nrepeatedly stated his belief that federalism is a ``zero-sum situation, \nin which either a State or a Federal lawmaking prerogative must fall.'' \nIn his articles, he has stated that the federalism cases are a battle \nbetween the States and the Federal Government, and ``the national \ngovernment's gain in these types of cases invariably becomes the \nState's loss, and vice versa.''\n  He also states that federalism is ``a neutral principle'' that merely \ndetermines the allocation of power. This view of federalism is not only \ninaccurate but troubling. These cases are not battles in which one law-\nmaking power must fall, but in which both the State and the Federal \ngovernment--and the American people--may all win. Civil rights laws set \nFederal floors or minimum standards but States remain free to enact \ntheir own more protective laws. Moreover, federalism is not a neutral \nprinciple as Mr. Sutton suggests, but has been used by those critical \nof the civil rights progress of the last several decades to limit the \nreach of Federal laws.\n  Mr. Sutton tried to disassociate himself from these views, by saying \nthat he was constrained to argue the positions that he argued on behalf \nof his clients. As far as I know, no one forced Mr. Sutton to write any \narticle, and most lawyers are certainly more careful than to attribute \ntheir name to any paper that professes a view with which they strongly \ndisagree. In my view, Mr. Sutton's suggestions that he does not \npersonally believe what he has written are intellectually dishonest and \ninsincere.\n  I would also like to respond to the claim by those of the other side \nof the aisle. Those opposed to Mr. Sutton's confirmation believe he has \na personal antipathy to people with disabilities. I know of no Senator \nwho is claiming that Mr. Sutton has a personal antipathy to the \ndisabled. I have heard from hundreds of people and organizations who \nexpress concern that millions of disabled individuals have been harmed \nby his broad advocacy to limit the rights of the disabled as a class. \nThe fact is that Mr. Sutton has chosen to argue against the rights of \npeople with disabilities in three major cases to the Supreme Court; \nthat he has argued that the ADA is ``not needed''; and that he has \ndevoted his career to making States less accountable.\n  I have been stunned by the Republican Senators who have come to this \nfloor to argue that Senators should not consider a lawyer's \nrepresentation of clients in considering a judicial nomination. I am \nstunned because so many of them voted against so many nominees of \nPresident Clinton on that very basis, but they now condemn the approach \nthey themselves took--without, of course, acknowledging the \ncontradiction. I am reminded that a key member of this President's \njudicial nomination selection team, his former White House Deputy \nCounsel testified before the Senate in 1997 that:\n\n       Although the Senate Judiciary Committee has long \n     recognized--correctly, in my view--that positions taken as an \n     advocate for a client do not necessarily reflect a nominees \n     own judicial philosophy, a long history of cases in which a \n     nominee has repeatedly urge courts to engage in judicial \n     activism may well be probative of the nominee's own \n     philosophy.\n\n  With this nomination, we have Mr. Sutton's admissions in statements \nand interviews and articles outside the courtroom that he believes \nstrongly in this ``federalism stuff.''\n  Mr. Sutton is opposed by more than 400 disability and civil rights \norganizations. They have concluded that his ideological views and \nextremely narrow reading of the Constitution make it doubtful that he \nwould be a fair and balanced judge. The burden is on Mr. Sutton to show \nthat he will protect individual rights and civil rights as a lifetime \nappointee to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. This he has not done.\n  The oath taken by Federal judges affirms their commitment to \n``administer justice without respect to persons, and of equal right to \nthe poor and to the rich.'' No one who enters a Federal courtroom \nshould have to wonder whether he or she will be fairly heard by the \njudge. Jeffrey Sutton's record does not show that he will put aside his \nyears of passionate advocacy in favor of States' rights and against \ncivil\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\nrights and his extreme positions limiting Congress' authority to \nprotect all Americans. Accordingly, I will not vote to confirm Mr. \nSutton for appointment to one of the highest courts in the land.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my time as leader to make a \nfew comments regarding this nominee.\n  Mr. President, I first want to commend the distinguished Senator from \nIowa for his extraordinary work on this nomination. I watched him prior \nto the time we recessed a couple of weeks ago. His passion, his \neloquence, and the power of his words were ones that I wish the rest of \nthe country could have heard. I have no doubt he would have persuaded \nmany had they heard him, as I did. He was back in the Chamber yesterday \nand again this morning. I thank him for that commitment and his \nextraordinary efforts to make sure that people understand the \nconsequences of this decision and the great difficulty many of us have \nwith this nomination.\n  Let me also thank our distinguished ranking member for all his work, \nboth in the committee and on the Senate floor, again, in opposition to \nthis nomination.\n  I have not seen the letter of Senator Dole, and I don't know that \nmany of us have had the opportunity to talk to Senator Dole about it, \nbut I will say this: Senator Harkin and Senator Dole were both very \ndirectly and successfully involved with the passage of the ADA some \nyears ago. That legislation has been monumental in terms of the change \nit has meant for the rights of the disabled.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act passed in 1990. George Bush said \nat the time that ``as a result of its passage, every man, woman, and \nchild with a disability can now pass through once closed doors into a \nbright new era of equality, independence, and freedom.'' Those were the \nwords of President Bush when he signed this extraordinary legislation.\n  But that legislation depends, of course, on interpretation, and \ninterpretation depends upon the courts. What happens at the district \nand circuit court levels, not to mention the Supreme Court level, \nprofoundly affects the words and, obviously, more important, the effect \nof the act as it is viewed today, 13 years later.\n  I must say that we are considering a nominee today, to a lifetime \nposition as a Federal judge, who has worked his entire career to roll \nback the progress of the ADA. Over the past several years, the courts \nhave consistently acted to weaken and limit the important protections \nprovided by the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well, I might add, \nas the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, the Civil Rights Act, and \nthe Violence Against Women Act.\n  Those doors to a bright new era, as President Bush once called them, \nare slowly being closed. Jeffrey Sutton is one of the most significant \nreasons why. He has spent years fighting aggressively to limit the \nlegal protections of individuals who experience discrimination and \nrestrict the authority of Congress to protect those who are most \nvulnerable to discrimination.\n  Mr. Sutton was the lead attorney in the case of the University of \nAlabama v. Garrett. It has been discussed and noted on several \noccasions, of course, in the debate, but it bears repeating. In that \ncase, he fought to limit, incredibly, the rights of a breast cancer \nsurvivor who was told by her employer, after she finished chemotherapy \ntreatment, that she would have to quit, accept a limited demotion, or \nbe fired solely because of her illness. He was the lead attorney in \nKimel v. Florida Board of Regents. In that case, he argued aggressively \nto limit the rights of Americans who experienced age discrimination.\n\n  In both of these cases, Mr. Sutton acted as a private attorney, which \nmeans he chose to represent his clients. He didn't have to take those \nclients. No one forced him, saying, you have to go into court, \nregardless of your position, and you have to go make your defense, your \narguments, as he did before the Court. In both cases, he argued \naggressively that, despite clearly discriminatory actions, national \nlegal protections were not only unnecessary; they were \nunconstitutional.\n  In other cases, Mr. Sutton has fought to limit the protections under \nthe Violence Against Women Act and to enable States to restrict access \nto health care for low-income children. He has made a career of \nfighting to weaken protections for some of America's most vulnerable \ncitizens--the sick, the elderly, the disabled, battered women, and poor \nchildren. I don't know what ``compassionate conservatism'' is exactly, \nbut I surely know this is not it.\n  I must say, Mr. President, we will be casting a number of challenging \nand difficult votes as we consider the judiciary. Already we have \nconfirmed 18 judges in this Congress. In the last Congress, we \nconfirmed 100.\n  I am dismayed that this nominee is before us today, given his record, \ngiven the implications of that record for his future decisions as a \njudge on such an important court. I am dismayed and concerned by its \nimplications for all of the vulnerable people of this country, all of \nthose who have already sacrificed, all of those who have hoped and \ndreamed that there could be a new day of freedom and independence for \nthemselves as a result of the passage of this critical and monumental \nlegislation just 13 years ago. I am dismayed that one person can be so \neffective in rolling back those protections and eliminating their \naccess in dealing with their independence in such a crass and \nunfortunate way. Closing the door to those people, after waiting \ndecades for them to reach this point of freedom and independence in our \ncountry today, is all the reason one needs to vote against this \nnomination.\n  We will have many more nominees, many conservative nominees. Most, if \nnot all, of the nominees who will come before us today will be \nconservative, and many will have the same Federalist mentality and \nphilosophical approach that Mr. Sutton represents; but they will not be \nthe opponents of those who seek independence, freedom, and equality as \ndisabled people, as Mr. Sutton has done throughout his public career.\n  I urge my colleagues, let us not retreat from the progress this \ncountry has achieved. Let us reject this nomination and protect the \nhard-won legal protections of America's most vulnerable citizens.\n  Our only hope in doing so would be to reject this nomination, to \nspeak out as loudly and clearly as we can that ADA is as important \ntoday, if not more important, than it was in 1990 when it passed, \nthanks to the leadership of Senator Harkin, the leadership of Senator \nDole, the leadership of those who understood the importance of equality \nfor everyone, especially those disabled, those who sought that same \nfreedom we take for granted today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. I \nhave been sitting in my office today listening to the debate on this \nnomination, and I am really a little bit taken aback, as I was in the \nJudiciary Committee hearing when I heard the discussion about Mr. \nSutton and the opposition to Mr. Sutton.\n  It is not as though Mr. Sutton is not qualified to be a nominee to \nthe Sixth Circuit. He is a gentleman who graduated first in his class \nfrom the Ohio State University Law School. He is a gentleman who has \nargued 12 cases before the United States Supreme Court, winning nine of \nthem and only losing three. No Sixth Circuit judge currently serving \nhas ever had as much Supreme Court experience before taking the bench.\n  During the Supreme Court's 2000-2001 term, Mr. Sutton argued four \ncases and won four cases, the best win-loss record of any private \nlawyer in the country that year.\n  On January 2, 2003, the American Lawyer named Mr. Sutton one of the \n45 best lawyers in America under the age of 45. They did not say one of \nthe best 45 conservative lawyers or federalist lawyers, but one of the \nbest 45 lawyers in America under the age of 45. He is an eminently \nqualified man, and I am really appalled by the objections I am hearing.\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\n  The critics who are trying to put various labels on Mr. Sutton, such \nas anti-Americans with Disabilities Act and anti-environment, based on \npositions that he has taken as an attorney advocate, really miss the \nwhole point about the American adversarial and judicial system. Lawyers \nroutinely adopt positions on behalf of their client as an advocate, \npositions to which they personally might not subscribe, but that is \nwhat makes our judicial system so great. It is the core of our legal \nsystem that people are entitled to have attorneys argue their cases for \nthem.\n\n  If we start to walk down the road where lawyers are accountable for \nany of the positions they take on behalf of their clients, then we \nmight as well write off any criminal defense lawyer for judicial \nappointments because they routinely have to argue for some pretty \nunsavory characters. Our legal system would not be as great as it is \nwithout these attorney advocates fighting for and advancing the rights \nof their clients.\n  As an example of this mislabeling, it is wrong to try to paint \nJeffrey Sutton as someone who works against the interests of the \ndisabled. In truth, he has actually worked as an advocate in cases \nwhere he represented disabled clients in advancing their rights. This \nman's father ran a home for disabled children where Jeffrey Sutton \nworked as a young man. Beverly Benson Long, who is the immediate past \npresident of the World Federation for Mental Health, which is among one \nof many posts she has held, has said:\n\n       No doubt that Mr. Sutton would rule fairly in all cases, \n     including those involving persons with disabilities.\n\n  Mrs. Long described the lobbying against Mr. Sutton by advocates of \nthe disabled as unfortunate and misguided:\n\n       In my own opinion, it is not only unfortunate and \n     misguided, it is just plain wrong.\n\n  There was also a quote in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which is really \nsomewhat of an independent-thinking newspaper in our great country. An \neditorial which ran on June 17, 2001, compared Sutton to John Adams, \nwho represented the British troops accused of perpetrating the Boston \nMassacre. The Plain Dealer said:\n\n       It is the duty of a lawyer to represent to the best of his \n     ability the interests of his clients. That, the record shows, \n     Sutton has done throughout his career.\n       A good judge, doing his job, will have but one abiding \n     friend--the law he has sworn to uphold. Sutton's ability to \n     honor that friendship should be the criterion of his \n     consideration.\n\n  In summary, one cannot deny Mr. Sutton has the intellectual abilities \nwe need in our appellate judges. Moreover, he has tremendous \nexperience, arguing before the State and Federal Courts of Appeal as \nwell as before the United States Supreme Court.\n  Finally, he has another quality we need in our appellate judges. The \nAttorney General of my home State, who is a dear friend of mine, is a \nman who is an elected Democrat, and he is a man for whom I have the \nutmost respect and a man who has had an occasion to work with Jeffrey \nSutton. He said it best when he told me Mr. Sutton would have a great \njudicial temperament. So we have a nominee with intellect, with \nexperience, and with temperament. We cannot ask for more than that in a \njudicial nominee, and yet his confirmation has been delayed because of \npartisan bickering.\n  It is no wonder we are in a judicial crisis with so many open \njudicial seats unfilled. It is no wonder we are stalled in moving \nforward on other judicial nominees. Jeffrey Sutton is a highly \nqualified nominee for the appellate bench. Let us move forward. I \nstrongly urge a vote to confirm Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes on the Senator's side and 5 \nminutes on the other side.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a lot of times these debates, especially \nwhen they involve a court nominee such as Mr. Sutton, tend to get \npersonal, and they should not. I hope no one here interprets anything I \nhave said as being any kind of personal thing against Mr. Sutton.\n  I said at the beginning I found him to be a pleasant, intellectual \nindividual with whom I spent an hour and a half. I do not know him \npersonally, of course. That is not the point. It is just like my good \nfriend from Utah, Senator Hatch. Senator Hatch was very helpful when we \npassed the Americans with Disabilities Act. I have told him that many \ntimes. He happens to be a good friend of mine on a whole host of issues \non which we have worked together. I have no doubt that perhaps Mr. \nSutton has compassion toward people with disabilities, but that also \nraises a problem with me.\n  It has been said many times Mr. Sutton's father had a school for kids \nwith cerebral palsy. When Mr. Sutton was in my office, I asked him if \nthat was a segregated school and he said, no, it was not. But he \nthought I meant male and female. What it was, was kids with cerebral \npalsy only went to this school. Well, I commend Mr. Sutton's father for \nhis compassion, for having a school for kids with cerebral palsy, but \nthat is what we are trying to get over with the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. That is what we are trying to get beyond. We are \ntrying to get beyond segregation.\n  I spoke about my brother Frank when he was sent half way across the \nState to the school for the deaf--segregation because he was disabled. \nSo, again, to have that mindset that somehow people have to be put in \nan institution, like the Olmstead case--fortunately, Mr. Sutton did not \nwin that one, but if his view had prevailed, the two women in that case \nwould still be in an institution. Now they are living by themselves, \nout free to shop, free to make their own meals, free to travel, not \nbeing stuck in an institution.\n  This vote we are about to have has nothing to do with Jeffrey Sutton \nas a person, but it has a lot to do with him as a potential judge and \nhow he views his role and how he views Congress's role. He said that \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act was not needed. On National Public \nRadio he said that, ``disability discrimination in a constitutional \nsense is really very difficult to show.''\n\n  Then, later on, Mr. Sutton said that in this context it is a zero sum \ngame; that if civil rights wins, the States lose.\n  It is not a zero sum game at all. Yes, like my friend from Utah, I \nbelieve in federalism. I believe in the Federal/State system on which \nour country is set up, on which our constitutional framework is \nestablished. I think it is the best system ever devised on the face of \nthe Earth. But I do not believe in the kind of federalism that Mr. \nSutton espouses, that it is a zero sum game; that if we expand civil \nrights somehow a State loses, or that somehow Congress does not have \nthe authority, constitutionally, to address the kinds of social ills \nand social wrongs perpetrated so long in our country on minorities and \non people with disabilities. That is why 400 civil rights groups have \ncome out opposed to Mr. Sutton.\n  We here in the Congress did our job. We worked long and hard over \nmany, many years, Republicans and Democrats, to pass the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. Mr. Sutton says that discrimination against people \nwith disabilities is very difficult to show. Is that the mindset we \nwant on the Federal bench? I ask my fellow Senators, send a strong \nmessage that we are going to stand behind the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, that we are not going to let it be chiseled away by a \nFederal judge such as Mr. Sutton. I ask for a ``no'' vote to send that \nmessage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed the Record a \nlist of letters the Committee has received in opposition to the \nconfirmation of Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nand three of these letters which come from large coalitions of civil \nrights, women's rights and disability rights organizations.\n  First, a letter from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and \nthe Alliance for Justice, dated April 28, 2003.\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\n  Second, a letter from 25 women's groups, dated April 28, 2003.\n  Third, a letter from ADA WATCH, a coalition of disability rights \norganizations, dated May 14, 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Opposition to Jeffrey Sutton, Nominee to the United States Court of \n                     Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\n\n\n                         public interest groups\n\n       Ability Center of Defiance also signed by: Courage \n     Incorporated, Independent Living Center of North Central \n     Ohio, Ability Center of Greater Toledo, Access II Independent \n     Living Center, Access to Independence of Courtland County, \n     Inc., Access Living, Advocates for Ohioans with Disabilities, \n     ADA WATCH, AIDS Action, Alliance for Disabled in Action, \n     American Association of People with Disabilities, American \n     Association of University Women, American Council of the \n     Blind, American Council of the Blind of Maryland, American \n     Council of the Blind of South Carolina, AFL-CIO, American \n     Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), \n     Americans for Democratic Action, Arizona Bridge to \n     Independent Living, Brain Injury Association of Tennessee, \n     Capitol District Center for Independence, Inc., Center for \n     Civil Justice, Center for Independent Living Options, Center \n     for Independence of the Disabled in New York, Inc., Cerebral \n     Palsy Association of Ohio, Cerebral Palsy Association of New \n     Jersey.\n       Civil Rights coalition letter signed by: ADA Watch/National \n     Coalition for Disability Rights, AFL-CIO, Alliance for \n     Justice, American Association of University Women, Feminist \n     Majority, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, MoveOn.org, \n     NAACP, NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, National \n     Council of Jewish Women, National Fair Housing Alliance, \n     National Partnership for Women and Families, National Women's \n     Law Center, People for the American Way, United Auto Workers, \n     Coalition for Independent Living Options, Inc., Council for \n     Disability Rights, Deaf and Hard of Hearing Consumer Advocacy \n     Network, Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association.\n       Environmental coalition letter signed by: Clean Water \n     Action, Community Rights Counsel, Defenders of Wildlife, \n     Earthjustice, Endangered Species Coalition, Friends of the \n     Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, Oceana, Physicians \n     for Social Responsibility, Sierra Club, The Wilderness \n     Society, Everybody Counts Center for Independent Living, \n     Freedom Center, Inc., Gender Justice Action Group, Harrison \n     County Sheltered Workshop, Inc., Heightened Independence & \n     Progress, Human Rights Campaign, Independent Living Center of \n     the Hudson Valley.\n       Justice for All Project signed by: California Abortion and \n     Reproductive Rights Action League, California Employment \n     Lawyers Association, Committee for Judicial Independence, \n     Democrats.com, Environmental Law Foundation, National Center \n     for Lesbian Rights, California National Organization for \n     Women, Planned Parenthood Los Angeles County, Progressive \n     Jewish Alliance, Stonewall Democratic Club, Unitarian \n     Universalists Project Freedom of Religion, Western Law Center \n     for Disability Rights, Women's Reproductive Rights Assistance \n     Project, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Liberty \n     Resources Inc.

Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: We, the undersigned civil \n     rights, women's rights, labor, and human rights \n     organizations, together representing millions of Americans \n     across the United States, write to express our opposition to \n     the confirmation of Jeffrey Sutton to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Mr. Sutton's record as a \n     lawyer and advocate reveals him to be an extremely \n     ideological and conservative activist with a particularly \n     troubling record in many areas important to our communities.\n       We have serious concerns about Mr. Sutton's legal \n     philosophy in a number of areas, particularly his views on \n     Congress' authority to enact laws protecting civil and other \n     individual rights. Mr. Sutton has become, over the last \n     several years, a leading activist in the so-called ``states' \n     rights'' movement. In fact, he has personally argued key \n     Supreme Court cases that, by narrow 5-4 majorities, have \n     undermined Congress' ability to protect Americans against \n     discrimination based on race, age, gender, disability, and \n     religion. Mr. Sutton's arguments in several of these cases \n     sought to restrict civil rights and environmental protections \n     even more severely than has the Supreme Court. Also, Mr. \n     Sutton was not just making a strong case on behalf of his \n     client; he actively sought out these cases in order to expand \n     states' rights doctrines. As he told the Legal Times, ``I \n     love these issues. I really believe in this federalism \n     stuff.''\n       Mr. Sutton's work on behalf of limiting Congress' power to \n     enact protective legislation has had a devastating impact on \n     the rights of individuals with disabilities. Over the past \n     several years, Mr. Sutton has been involved in an effort to \n     challenge and weaken the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (ADA), a popular and important bill enacted by a bipartisan \n     Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. \n     Mr. Sutton represented the University of Alabama in the case \n     of University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 456 (2001), in \n     which the Court ruled 5-4 that it was unconstitutional for \n     the ADA to permit state employees to bring lawsuits for \n     damages to protect their rights against discrimination. In \n     fact, Mr. Sutton's arguments went even further than the \n     Court's decision. During oral argument, Mr. Sutton told the \n     Court that the ADA was ``not needed.'' In another case, \n     Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), Mr. Sutton argued that \n     it should not be a violation of the ADA to force persons with \n     mental disabilities to remain institutionalized without \n     proper justification, despite clear congressional findings to \n     the contrary. In a third case, Pennsylvania Department of \n     Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\n     (1998), Mr. Sutton filed an amicus brief arguing that the ADA \n     does not apply at all to state prison systems. The Supreme \n     Court rejected Mr. Sutton's arguments in Olmstead and Yeskey, \n     which would have further weakened the ADA had they been \n     accepted.\n       Mr. Sutton has also argued for a narrow view of Congress' \n     ability to protect the environment or to provide a means for \n     individuals to vindicate their rights. In Alexander v. \n     Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), he argued against allowing \n     private individuals to sue to enforce the disparate impact \n     regulations of Title VI of the 1964 Civil rights Act, which \n     prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national \n     origin, by recipients of federal financial assistance. He has \n     also argued for severe limits on the ability of state \n     employees who are victims of age discrimination to recover \n     damages, against increased protection for religious freedom \n     from encroachment by states, and against a federal remedy for \n     victims of sexual assault and violence, positions adopted by \n     the 5-4 Supreme Court majority. He also argued that Congress \n     did not have the Constitutional authority to enact \n     legislation protecting environmentally sensitive wetlands \n     from harmful dumping.\n       In addition, Mr. Sutton has advocated for other specific \n     steps by the courts to limit federal civil rights \n     protections. In an article for the Federalist Society, Mr. \n     Sutton praised a concurring opinion by Justices Thomas and \n     Scalia in Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874 (1994), which would \n     have severely restricted the application of Section 2 of the \n     Voting Rights Act (prohibiting state and local conduct that \n     has a racially discriminatory purpose or effect), and would \n     have required overturning or reconsidering at least twenty-\n     eight previous Supreme Court voting rights decisions. Mr. \n     Sutton has even suggested that the Thomas-Scalia concurrence \n     provided a blueprint for broadly reconsidering and \n     overturning court decisions that right-wing advocates do not \n     like in civil rights and other areas.\n       In sum, based on his record as a lawyer and legal advocate, \n     it is clear that Mr. Sutton's legal philosophy is focused on \n     limiting Congress' historic role in protecting the civil and \n     constitutional rights of all Americans. Jeffrey Sutton's \n     advocacy on many issues important to our communities, such as \n     the reach of federal civil rights and environmental statutes, \n     federalism, the right to vote, and the ability of individuals \n     to vindicate their rights, reflect views that are outside the \n     mainstream of judicial thought.\n       Therefore, given Mr. Sutton's record of hostility to \n     important civil rights and equal opportunity principles, we \n     urge the Senate to reject his nomination to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wade Henderson,\n                            Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n     Nan Aron,\n     Alliance for Justice.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 28, 2003.\n     Hon. William H. Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: We, the undersigned \n     women's rights organizations, write to express our strong \n     opposition to the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Jeffrey Sutton \n     is an experienced Supreme Court litigator who has gained \n     prominence because of his staunch advocacy in favor of \n     states' rights and elevating state sovereignty over Congress' \n     power to protect civil rights. As organizations dedicated to \n     the advancement of women, we are extremely concerned about \n     the growing resurgence of states' rights, particularly as a \n     tool to undermine rights essential to women's progress. \n     Jeffrey Sutton is not merely a proponent of state's rights--\n     he has been the principal architect of an effort to curtail \n     Congress' efforts to protect against discrimination and \n     ensure equal opportunity. Indeed, his persistent, single-\n     minded advocacy is reflected not only in his case \n     participation, but also in his speeches and writings. His \n     confirmation to a lifetime position on the federal bench \n     threatens to dismantle the important gains that have been \n     critical to women's success and we urge you to reject his \n     nomination.\n       Jeffrey Sutton has argued before the Supreme Court in a \n     number of seminal civil rights cases that have weakened the \n     ability of Congress to protect women's rights. For example:\n       Mr. Sutton represented Alabama as amicus curiae in United \n     States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), and argued \n     successfully that the civil rights remedy of the Violence \n     Against Women Act (VAWA) was unconstitutional. Congress \n     passed VAWA after hearing wide-ranging testimony that states \n     were not adequately protecting women from violence motivated \n     by gender. Despite substantial evidence gathered by Congress \n     and the views of attorneys general from 36 states, Sutton \n     argue that ``there has been no tenable showing that the \n     [s]tates have violated the Fourteenth Amendment through their \n     regulation of gender-based violence.'' He not only \n     volunteered to write this brief, but also wrote two \n     subsequent articles for the Federalist Society which \n     supported the Court's decision and its rationale.\n       Mr. Sutton played a significant role in weakening the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964, arguing in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \n     U.S. 275 (2001), that citizens could not sue under Title VI \n     to challenge federally funded programs that had the effect of \n     discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national \n     origin. This case has had a serious impact not only on Title \n     VI cases, but also on the implementation of Title IX, which \n     prohibits gender discrimination in federally funded education \n     programs or activities. Because Title IX was modeled on Title \n     VI, many courts have applied principles established under \n     Title VI to Title IX cases. Already, at least four courts \n     have found that Title IX retaliation claims were not \n     actionable in the wake of the Sandoval decision. While \n     further action in these cases is possible, these decisions \n     illustrate the potential harm posed by Sandoval in cases \n     challenging gender discrimination in education.\n       Mr. Sutton represented the state of Alabama in Board of \n     Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. \n     356 (2001), advancing a state's rights argument that \n     ultimately led the Supreme Court to dismiss the claim of a \n     woman who was fired because she had breast cancer and to \n     further undermine the Americans with Disabilities Act. \n     Despite evidence that Congress had mounted to show that \n     states had a history of discrimination in their treatment of \n     citizens with disabilities, Sutton argued to the contrary, \n     and urged the Court to find that Congress had exceeded its \n     power under the Fourteenth Amendment. These same legal \n     arguments are now being used to challenge the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act, another law that is critical to the \n     ability of women and men to balance their work and family \n     responsibilities.\n       Mr. Sutton's unyielding and extreme views on federalism and \n     civil rights would restrict Congress' power to pass civil \n     rights laws and the abilities of individuals to seek redress \n     for violations of those rights, as well as inhibit access to \n     courts for people challenging illegal acts by their state \n     governments. These views are contrary to the balanced \n     approach we believe is necessary for a federal appeals court \n     judge.\n       Because we believe Mr. Sutton's confirmation would \n     accelerate the rollback of essential civil rights laws and \n     undermine important gains for women, we urge you to oppose \n     his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Association of University Women.\n       Business and Professional Women/USA.\n       Center for Women Policy Studies.\n       Choice USA.\n       Coalition of Labor Union Women.\n       Equity in Education and Employment.\n       Feminist Majority.\n       Gender Watchers.\n       Ms. Foundation for Women.\n       National Council of Jewish Women.\n       National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n       National Organization for Women.\n       NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       National Partnership for Women & Families.\n       National Women's Conference.\n       National Women's Law Center.\n       Northwest Women's Law Center.\n       Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice.\n       Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault.\n       Women Against Abuse, Inc.\n       Women's Caucus for Political Science.\n       Women Employed.\n       Women Empowered Against Violence, Inc.\n       Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press.\n       Women's Sports Foundation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                    ADA WATCH,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: President Bush's nomination of Jeffrey \n     Sutton for federal judgeship is of great concern to members \n     of the disability community and it is our hope that you will \n     be willing to meet with representatives of the ADA WATCH to \n     discuss our opposition.\n       The ADA WATCH is a campaign to protect the civil rights of \n     people with disabilities. This includes an informational \n     network designed to alert and activate the grassroots to \n     respond to threats to the ADA from Congress, the \n     Administration, and the courts. Our 100+ member organizations \n     include: ADAPT, National Council on Independent Living, \n     American Association of People with Disabilities, Consortium \n     for Citizens with Disabilities, Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America, and the National Association of Protection and \n     Advocacy Systems. While the ADA WATCH does not speak for any \n     of these individual organizations, we are currently making \n     the judicial nomination of Jeffrey Sutton a top priority and \n     a great majority of our partners are united in opposing this \n     nomination in light of Mr. Sutton's outspoken disregard for \n     the civil rights of people with disabilities. The nomination \n     of a lawyer who has enthusiastically argued against the \n     constitutionality of the ADA is hardly consistent with the \n     Bush Administration's stated support of the ADA and the \n     legacy of the man who signed the ADA into law, President \n     George H.W. Bush.\n       Mr. Sutton has made it clear that he is not supportive of \n     the rights granted to people with disabilities by Congress \n     through the passage of the ADA. Despite extensive \n     documentation of state government discrimination against \n     people with disabilities, Mr.\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\n     Sutton enthusiastically supported the position that Congress \n     did not have the authority to create the important civil \n     rights protections afforded by the ADA. Mr. Sutton told the \n     Supreme Court last fall when he argued the Garrett case for \n     Alabama that the ADA ``exaggerated discrimination problems by \n     states.'' He told the court that the ADA was ``not needed'' \n     and used similar arguments to weaken civil rights laws in the \n     Kimel and Sandoval cases. His belief that laws of the various \n     states provide adequate protections ignores the hundreds of \n     pages of testimony before Congress that detailed the \n     discrimination faced by people with disabilities across the \n     country at the hands of state government agencies.\n       Please understand the ADA WATCH's respectful opposition to \n     this nomination and our concern that the nomination of Mr. \n     Sutton represents a serious threat to the civil rights of \n     people with disabilities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Jim Ward.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will only take a few minutes and then I \nintend to yield back the remainder of our time, as long as no one else \nwants to speak.\n  I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Iowa. I would have \nyielded time to him, had he needed time, without the extra 10 minutes \nthat were asked for.\n  It seems to me the arguments on the other side come down to this. Mr. \nSutton is outside the mainstream of American jurisprudence, that he \nadvocated cases that literally the Supreme Court agreed with, that they \ndisagree with, maybe I disagree with, but the Supreme Court did decide \nin at least two of those cases, nine to zip, in favor of Mr. Sutton's \nposition. That is basically what it seems to come down to.\n  The fact is, Mr. Sutton, as an advocate, has an obligation to argue \nthe best he can for his clients. He did that, winning 9 of the 12 cases \nthat he had before the Supreme Court, and a number of them \nunanimously--that they have been complaining about. In the Garrett \ncase, he got five Justices on the Supreme Court, a clear majority, to \ngo along with his particular position.\n  I have read the letter from some of my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee that indicated he has never advocated for a civil rights \nposition. That is pure bunk, and I have made that case here today.\n  What is behind this type of treatment of an excellent nominee such as \nJeffrey Sutton? I can understand the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nwho is a very strong advocate for persons with disabilities, as am I, \nwho may not have read the full judicial record and who may not, as a \nnonlawyer, fully appreciate the role of an advocate. But it is very \ndifficult for me to understand how members of the Judiciary Committee \nwho are advocates themselves, who hold their attorney's licenses in \ngood esteem, can make some of the arguments they have made, and \nespecially in the letter they distributed to all Senators.\n\n  The record flies in the face of those allegations. The fact is, I \nbelieve Jeffrey Sutton will be one of the most sensitive people towards \npersons with disabilities because he comes from that mindset. His \nfather ran a school for persons with disabilities, kids who suffered \nfrom cerebral palsy. He worked for his father. He has argued for \npersons with disabilities and he has argued in cases where the Court \ndecided against the Americans with Disabilities Act. But the Court made \nthat decision.\n  Is the Court outside the mainstream of American juris prudence? I am \nsure each of us in this body can find a case or two in which we \ndisagree with the Supreme Court. I can find a lot of cases with which I \ndisagree. But their pronouncements happen to be the law and that has \nbeen the law ever since Marbury v. Madison.\n  All I can say is that here is a person who is respected by his peers, \nwho receives the highest rating from the American Bar Association--not \na conservative organization, something that has been called the gold \nstandard by my colleagues on the other side--who has eminent experience \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court and other appellate bodies in this \ncountry, one of the premier appellate lawyers in the country, even \nthough he is only 45 years of age, who has had extensive experience as \nan advocate for a wide variety of diverse people, who appeared before \nthe committee and everybody on the committee, even those who are \nagainst him here today, admit he is a fine person with great ability.\n  But they try to smear the Federalist Society by saying these are \nFederalist Society nominees. That is a joke. The Federalist Society \nputs on the best seminars of any legal society in America today, and \nthose seminars are always balanced with the left and the right. They \ngive the left every chance to explain their position and give the right \nevery chance to explain their position. That is precisely what a good \nlegal society should do. They do not take advocacy positions but they \ndo try to get people to think about the law.\n  I get a little tired of having the Federalist Society run down when \nsome of the most eminent people in society are members of the \nFederalist Society, which is basically a debating society considering \nthe various aspects of the law and making sure both sides are heard. \nThat is pretty hard to beat.\n  I hope I am wrong, that the real reasons against Mr. Sutton is, No. \n1, he is so good; No. 2, he has a chance of being on the Supreme Court \nsomeday and why not damage him now so he can't be there; No. 3, he \nmight be pro-life, although I personally don't know what he is with \nregard to that issue. Those seem to be the major issues.\n  The fact is, he has the highest rating he can possibly have from the \nAmerican Bar Association. He is an excellent lawyer. He is an excellent \nadvocate. He is a person whom I believe will do justice on the courts. \nBy all measurement by any fair person, any student of the law, you \nwould have to conclude that this man not only is within the mainstream \nof American juris prudence, but he is one of the leaders in the \nmainstream of American juris prudence.\n  For the life of me, I don't understand why anybody would vote against \nJeffrey Sutton. The mere fact that he may have represented some clients \nwho they don't like, they on the other side, that is not a good enough \nargument. In fact, it is laughable. Good lawyers represent their \nclients.\n  In the Garrett case, contrary to what has been argued, he didn't ask \nfor that case. He was called by the attorney general of the State \ninvolved and asked if he would be willing to represent them, if I \nrecall correctly.\n  So the arguments that have been made--I haven't heard one meritorious \nargument on this whole debate. If you look at the record, there is \nevery meritorious argument as to why those who really understand the \nlaw, those who really are fair about this process, would vote for \nJeffrey Sutton.\n  Mr. President, if there is no one else who wants to speak, then I \nyield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nresume consideration of the nomination of Priscilla Owen to be United \nStates Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Priscilla \nRichmond Owen, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nFifth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator will proceed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to voice my strong \nsupport for the confirmation of Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Justice Owen's nomination has been pending \nnow for nearly 2 years--720 days in total, so I hope we can vote on it \nsoon. Justice Owen is among the longest pending judicial nominees \nselected by President Bush. She was first nominated on May 9, 2001, so \nit is natural that we should move forward at this time.\n  I should say at the outset that I truly hope the news reports are \ninaccurate about another move by the other side to filibuster a well-\nqualified nominee and deny a vote by the full Senate. We know the usual \nliberal interest groups are crying for a filibuster, but we ought to do \nwhat the American people have sent us here to do, and vote.\n  I expressed a similar hope when Miguel Estrada's nomination reached \nthe floor on February 5. Yet here we are 3 months and 4 cloture votes \nlater and still he has not been allowed a vote.\n  We have 200 years of precedent for providing an up-or-down vote on \njudicial nominees and we should follow that.\n  If certain Senators do not like Priscilla Owen or Miguel Estrada, \nthey ought to vote no. That is their right. But they ought to vote.\n  I fully support an open debate on Justice Owen's nomination. And we \nhave had a number of debates already. I do not, however, support any \nfilibuster on a circuit court nominee, or any judge for that matter, \nor, frankly, anybody on the Executive Calendar. I think in the past \nsome of us voted against cloture on Executive Calendar nominees without \nrealizing how important it is to not filibuster the President's \nnominees, whoever the President might be. I believe we have made those \nmistakes. And I believe I probably have. It is the wrong thing. But \nnobody has ever filibustered a circuit court of appeals nominee until \nMiguel Estrada. If they filibuster Priscilla Owen, that means two in 1 \nyear in a procedure that has never before been used.\n  I fully support an open debate on Justice Owen's nomination. Like I \nsay, we should not suffer through another filibuster. My colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have already set a terrible partisan \nprecedent in filibustering for the first time in history a circuit \ncourt nominee, Miguel Estrada. A simultaneous filibuster of two \nnominees would not only be unpredecented, but I think it would damage \nall three institutions even more. Let us have a full and open debate \nand then leave it up to each Senator to decide for himself or herself \nby holding a simple up-or-down vote.\n  Let me now explain why I intend to vote yes on Justice Owen's \nnomination.\n  Justice Owen is a terrific selection for the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. She has the intelligence, the education, the experience, and \nthe integrity we look for in a federal judge. A native of Texas, \nJustice Owen attended Baylor University and Baylor University School of \nLaw. She graduated cum laude from both institutions and served as a \nmember of Baylor's law review. In addition, she finished third in her \nlaw school class, which means that she is worthy of the appointment, \nsomething most lawyers can never dream about.\n  Justice Owen went on to earn the highest score on the Texas bar exam \nand thereafter accepted a position at the nationally ranked Houston law \nfirm of Andrews & Kurth. She worked for the next 17 years as a \ncommercial litigator with the firm, specializing in oil and gas matters \nand doing some work in securities and railroad issues.\n  Justice Owen has the full support of Senators Hutchison and Cornyn--\nboth Senators from Texas--who know her well. Senator Cornyn has spoken \nin committee and on the Senate floor about his time working as a fellow \nJustice to Justice Owen on the Texas Supreme Court. Senator Cornyn has \nspoken to the criticism of Justice Owen's work on the bench and has \nmade a strong case for Justice Owen's confirmation. I would commend \nSenator Cornyn's remarks regarding Justice Owen as worthy of the \nspecial attention of all my fellow Senators. Senator Cornyn's responses \nto criticisms of Justice Owen's judicial record are especially \nenlightening.\n  Former Texas Supreme Court Justices John L. Hill, Jack Hightower, and \nRaul Gonzalez--each of them a committed Democrat--also endorse Justice \nOwen. In particular, they note her impartiality and restraint on the \nbench. A group of 15 former Presidents of the Texas State Bar supports \nJustice Owen. This is no partisan group. They write: ``Although we \nprofess different party affiliations and span the spectrum of views of \nlegal and policy issues, we stand united in affirming that Justice Owen \nis a truly unique and outstanding candidate for appointment to the \nFifth Circuit.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              Hughes Luce LLP,\n\n                                        Dallas, TX, July 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 224 Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: As past presidents of the State Bar of \n     Texas. we join in this letter to strongly recommend an \n     affirmative vote by the Judiciary Committee and confirmation \n     by the full Senate for Justice Priscilla Owen, nominee to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\n       Although we profess different party, affiliations and span \n     the spectrum of views of legal and policy issues, we stand \n     united in affirming that Justice Owen is a truly unique and \n     outstanding candidate for appointment to the Fifth Circuit. \n     Based on her superb integrity, competence and judicial \n     temperament, Justice Owen earned her Well Qualified rating \n     unanimously from the American Bar Association Standing \n     Committee on the Federal Judiciary--the highest rating \n     possible. A fair and bipartisan review of Justice Owen's \n     qualifications by the Judiciary Committee certainly would \n     reach the same conclusion.\n       Justice Owen's stellar academic achievements include \n     graduating cum laude from both Baylor University and Baylor \n     Law School, thereafter earning the highest score in the Texas \n     Bar Exam in November 1977. Her career accomplishments are \n     also remarkable. Prior to her election to the Supreme Court \n     of Texas in 1994, for 17 years she practiced law specializing \n     in commercial litigation in both the federal and state \n     courts. Since January 1995, Justice Owen has delivered \n     exemplary service on the Texas Supreme Court, as reflected by \n     her receiving endorsements from every major newspaper in \n     Texas during her successful re-election bid in 2000.\n       The status of our profession in Texas has been \n     significantly enhanced by Justice Owen's advocacy of pro bono \n     service and leadership for the membership of the State Bar of \n     Texas. Justice Owen has served on committees regarding legal \n     services to the poor and diligently worked with others to \n     obtain legislation that provides substantial resources for \n     those delivering legal services to the poor.\n       Justice Owen also has been a long-time advocate for an \n     updated and reformed system of judicial selection in Texas. \n     Seeking to remove any perception of a threat to judicial \n     impartiality, Justice Owen has encouraged the reform debate \n     and suggested positive changes that would enhance and improve \n     our state judicial branch of government.\n       While the Fifth Circuit has one of the highest per judge \n     caseloads of any circuit in the country, there are presently \n     two vacancies on the Fifth Circuit bench. Both vacancies have \n     been declared ``judicial emergencies'' by the Administrative \n     Office of the U.S. Courts. Justice Owen's service on the \n     Fifth Circuit is critically important to the administration \n     of justice.\n       Given her extraordinary legal skills and record of service \n     in Texas, Justice Owen deserves prompt and favorable \n     consideration by the Judiciary Committee. We thank you and \n     look forward to Justice Owen's swift approval.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Darrell E. Jordan.\n       On behalf of former Presidents of the State Bar of Texas: \n     Blake Tartt; James B. Sales; Hon. Tom B. Ramey, Jr.; Lonny D. \n     Morrison; Charles R. Dunn; Richard Pena; Charles L. Smith; \n     Jim D. Bowmer; Travis D. Shelton; M. Colleen McHugh; Lynne \n     Liberaito; Gibson Gayle, Jr.; David J. Beck; Cullen Smith.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Justice Owen is recognized for her services \nfor the poor and for her work on gender and family law issues. Justice \nOwen has taken a genuine interest in improving access to justice for \nthe poor. She successfully fought with others for more funding for \nlegal aid services for the indigent. Hector De Leon, former president \nof Legal Aid of Central Texas, has written: ``Justice Owen has an \nunderstanding of and a commitment to the availability of legal services \nto those who are disadvantaged and unable to pay for such legal \nservices. It is that type of insight and empathy that Justice Owen will \nbring to the Fifth Circuit.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  De Leon, Boggins & Icenogle,\n\n                                        Austin, TX, June 26, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: This correspondence is sent to you in \n     support of the nomination by President Bush of Texas Supreme \n     Court Justice Priscilla Owen for a seat on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       As the immediate past President of Legal Aid of Central \n     Texas, it is of particular significance to me that Justice \n     Owen has served as the liaison from the Texas Supreme Court \n     to statewide committees regarding legal services to the poor \n     and pro bono legal services. Undoubtedly, Justice Owen has an \n     understanding of and a commitment to the availability of \n     legal services to those who are disadvantaged and unable to \n     pay for such legal services. It is that type of insight and \n     empathy that Justice Owen will bring to the Fifth Circuit.\n       Additionally, Justice Owen played a major role in \n     organizing a group known as Family Law 2000 which seeks to \n     educate parents about the effect the dissolution of a \n     marriage can have on their children. Family Law 2000 seeks to \n     lessen the adversarial nature of legal proceedings \n     surrounding marriage dissolution. The Fifth Circuit would be \n     well served by having someone with a background in family law \n     serving on the bench.\n       Justice Owen has also found time to involve herself in \n     community service. Currently Justice Owen serves on the Board \n     of Texas Hearing and Service Dogs. Justice Owen also teaches \n     Sunday School at her Church, St. Barnabas Episcopal Mission \n     in Austin, Texas. In addition to teaching Sunday School \n     Justice Owen serves as head of the altar guild.\n       Justice Owen is recognized as a well rounded legal scholar. \n     She is a member of the American Law Institute, the American \n     Judicature Society, The American Bar Association, and a \n     Fellow of the American and Houston Bar Foundations. Her \n     stature as a member of the Texas Supreme Court was recognized \n     in 2000 when every major newspaper in Texas endorsed Justice \n     Owen in her bid for re-election to the Texas Supreme Court.\n       It has my privilege to have been personally acquainted with \n     various members of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \n     Circuit. The late Justice Jerry Williams was my \n     administrative law professor in law school and later became a \n     personal friend. Justice Reavley has been a friend over the \n     years. Justice Johnson is also a friend. In my opinion, \n     Justice Owen will bring to the Fifth Circuit the same \n     intellectual ability and integrity that those gentlemen \n     brought to the Court.\n       I earnestly solicit your favorable vote on the nomination \n     of Justice Priscilla Owen for a seat on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       Thank you for your attention to this correspondence.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Hector De Leon.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Justice Owen is committed to opening \nopportunities to women in the legal profession. She has been a member \nof the Texas Supreme Court Gender Neutral Task Force, and she served as \none of the editors of the Gender Neutral Handbook, a guide for all \nTexas lawyers and judges on the issue of recognizing and combating \ngender bias in the legal field. Incredibly, this is the same woman the \nusual interest groups mischaracterize as ``anti-woman.''\n  Justice Owen's confirmation is backed by Texas lawyers such as E. \nThomas Bishop, president of the Texas Association of Defense Counsel, \nand William B. Emmons, a Texas trial attorney and a Democrat who says \nthat Justice Owen ``will serve [the Fifth Circuit] and the United \nStates exceptionally well.''\n  You can see the type of bipartisan support Justice Priscilla Owen \nenjoys.\n  Justice Owen has served on the Texas Supreme Court since 1994, \nwinning reelection to another 6-year term in the year 2000. She had \nbipartisan support, earning the endorsement of all major Texas \nnewspapers and the endorsement of the Texas voters--84 percent of the \nelectorate to be exact.\n  This kind of support--running across the board and across party \nlines--leaves no doubt that Justice Owen is a fair-minded, mainstream \njurist.\n  The fact that Justice Owen earned an ABA rating of unanimous well \nqualified, the gold standard of many of my colleagues on the other side \nwhen evaluating judicial nominees, is further evidence of Justice \nOwen's fitness to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  This well qualified rating means that Justice Owen is at the top of \nthe legal profession in her legal community; that she has outstanding \nlegal ability, breadth of experience, and the highest reputation for \nintegrity; and that she has demonstrated, or exhibited the capacity \nfor, judicial temperament.\n  This ranking comes only after careful investigation and \nconsideration. There is close examination of the nominee's legal \nwriting--whether judicial opinions, law review articles, or other \nscholarship. Lawyers in private practice and in the public sector are \ninterviewed and provide their candid assessment of the nominee. Those \ninterviewed may be law school professors, lawyers working for public \ninterest services, members of bar associations and legal organizations, \nand community leaders. Men and women of all backgrounds are invited by \nthe ABA to assess the nominee's fitness for judicial service. All of \nthis investigation is done to provide a full picture of the nominee's \nqualifications for the federal judiciary.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen will be a great asset to the Fifth \nCircuit. One can nitpick at her record, as many have done, and will no \ndoubt continue to do, but when we lay out her full record and look at \nit with a sense of balance, we see a judge who honors the law and lives \nup to her judicial oath.\n\n  I express my hope, once again, that we will commit to hold a debate \nand\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\nthen vote on Justice Owen's confirmation. This will allow each Senator \nto decide the merits of her record for himself or herself and allow the \nentire Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty.\n  I, for one, hope we are not set up for another filibuster--another \nfirst time in history. I hope that will not be the case, but if it is, \nI hope we can face it head on. Ultimately, I hope we can somehow or \nother pull out the stops and get a vote for Justice Owen up and down. \nThose who do not agree with her can vote against her; and those who do, \ncan vote for her.\n  This is an excellent woman, one of the best nominees I have seen in \nmy whole 27 years on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I do not think you \ncan find better people than Justice Owen. I personally believe she is a \nperson of great capacity, and I think her record proves that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Democratic leader is on his way to the \nfloor and wants to be the first speaker on this matter on our side. We \nwish that he be the first speaker. In light of that, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I note we are now debating the Owen \nnomination. This morning we had a debate, as we have had over the last \nseveral days, on the Sutton nomination. There were those who supported \nMr. Sutton. Many of us opposed him, we think for good reason. But there \nought to be a recognition that, as we consider all of those nominees \nwho come before the Judiciary Committee, there are those, of course, \nthat will divide us but there are many that ought to unify us, that \nought to bring us together in recognition of the importance of the \nrecord that has already been made with regard to judges these past 2\\1/\n2\\ years since this administration has come to office.\n  In that time, the Senate has now confirmed 119 circuit and district \njudges. I am told that is a record in that period of time, that we have \nnever confirmed that many judges over that period of time. But whether \nit is a record or not, arguably there are other times when we have been \nvirtually as productive.\n  We have only opposed two of those nominations. Judge Priscilla Owen \nwas opposed before, and is opposed now. Judge Pickering, of course, in \nthe committee was defeated 2 years ago. The only other nomination to \ncome to the floor, as I said--the second one--is Judge Estrada, and \nthat has to do with his lack of cooperation and his unwillingness to \nbring forward the documents that we think ought to be required if we \nare going to make a collective and a thoughtful judgment about his \nqualifications.\n  There are others who have been considered in the committee that I \nhave offered to the distinguished Republican leader, the majority \nleader, who could be brought up and passed in a very short period of \ntime.\n  One of those judges is Judge Edward Prado. Judge Prado happens to be \nin the same circuit as Judge Owen. Judge Owen is from the Fifth \nCircuit. So is Judge Prado. Judge Prado also happens to be Hispanic. \nThere have been numerous statements on both sides of the aisle with \nregard to the importance of Hispanic nominees, nominees of any \nminority. Cases have been made for improving the diversity on the \ncourts. It is in the interest of diversity and the interest of moving \nforward on those judges for whom there could be agreement that I wanted \nto come to the floor this afternoon and simply say: Let's take up those \nfor which there is overwhelming agreement. As I noted, Judge Prado is \none of those nominees.\n  I intend to ask unanimous consent that we agree at least on this \nnominee and many others. We may continue to disagree on the Owen \nnomination, and we will get into the reasons in the course of the \ndebate. But there is no reason to hold hostage those nominees for whom \nthere is agreement. So I thought it would be appropriate for us to set \naside the Owen debate for 3 hours this afternoon so that we can take up \nan Hispanic nominee who enjoys broad bipartisan support. I would guess \nif there were a rollcall on Mr. Prado this afternoon, it would pass, if \nnot unanimously, virtually unanimously.\n  We have a choice this afternoon. We have a choice of continuing this \ndebate, this divisive debate on Priscilla Owen, which we may be forced \nto experience, or we could at least take a reprieve from that divisive \ndebate and take up a qualified nominee, a Hispanic nominee on whom \nthere is virtually no disagreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to Executive \nCalendar No. 105, the nomination of Edward C. Prado of Texas to be a \nU.S. Circuit Court Judge for the Fifth Circuit; that there be 3 hours \nof debate on the nomination equally divided between the chairman and \nranking member; that at the conclusion or yielding back of the time, \nthe Senate vote, without intervening action, on the confirmation of the \nnomination; that the motion to reconsider the Senate's action be laid \nupon the table; and the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, I believe the majority \nleader realizes there is a way of doing this and a way not to do this. \nI will have to object to the unanimous consent request because \nPriscilla Owen has been nominated for the exact same court of appeals \nas Judge Prado. We all agree Judge Prado is an excellent candidate and \nnominee, and we intend to fully support him and to have him confirmed. \nWe also know there is the matter of seniority and a number of other \nmatters as well.\n  In addition, the majority leader has seen fit to bring the Owen \nnomination to the floor, because we hope to have a vote up or down on \nPriscilla Owen. We look forward to that particular vote. We would like \nto confirm her first.\n  I made it clear a short while ago, in fact early in the year, that we \nwould try on the Judiciary Committee, to the extent that we can, to \nbring people up in chronological order. Justice Owen has been sitting \nin the Judiciary Committee as a nominee on the Executive Calendar for 2 \nyears this May 9. So within a week and a half, she will have been \nsitting there for 2 solid years. It is only fair to ask that her \nnomination be acted upon first. We fully intend to do that although it \nhas no reflection at all on Judge Prado.\n  I have to object at this time. We will get to Judge Prado in due \ncourse in the way it should be done, not by bringing him up out of \norder and not by trying to upset the motions of the majority leader in \nthis body. I look forward to that. Having said all of that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just say how disappointed I am at \nthe decision made by our Republican colleagues. The distinguished chair \nof the Judiciary Committee made a comment that I may have \nmisunderstood. I think he said there really is no difference between \nthe Owen nomination and the Prado nomination with regard to Senate \nconsideration. There is a huge difference.\n  The Owen nomination, of course, came before the Judiciary Committee \nin the last Congress. Her nomination was defeated in the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is rare, almost unheard of, for a defeated nominee to be \nbrought back before the committee and then brought back before the \nSenate.\n  There is a significant difference between the Owen nomination and the \nnomination of Edward Prado. Edward Prado was before the committee and \nnow before the Senate in part because of his overwhelming support on \nboth sides of the aisle, because he came before the committee, \npresented his qualifications and, as a result of those qualifications, \nwas voted out unanimously. There is absolutely no reason to hold Mr. \nPrado hostage to other controversial nominees. If we wait until we \nresolve the Owen nomination, Mr. Prado will never be confirmed because \nI doubt that Ms. Owen will be confirmed. So that is a criterion I hope\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\nwill be reconsidered by our colleagues on the other side.\n  Again, let me express my disappointment and my hope that our \ncolleagues will reconsider as we bring this unanimous consent request \nback to the floor at a later date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have a perfect solution to the distinguished minority \nleader's suggestion. I would like to have Judge Prado brought up as \nwell. I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the Owen nomination, \nwhich was reported on March 27, there be 8 additional hours for debate \nprior to the vote on the confirmation of the nomination.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I modify my request to allow for 10 hours.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I noted before, there are many \nconcerns. This nominee was defeated before the Judiciary Committee in \nthe last Congress, and for many good reasons. We will have the debate. \nThere is no way that 10 hours will accommodate the debate that will be \nrequired on Ms. Owen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah retains the floor, and \nthe Chair has heard an objection.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the Senator from Nevada without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry: If Senator Daschle's request had \nbeen that we move to Prado without the conditions he set forth as to \ntime, is that a debatable motion? We are in executive session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, it would be a debatable motion.\n  Mr. REID. I don't want to do that because the Senator from Utah has \nthe floor, but I want everyone to understand, as soon as I get the \nfloor, I will move to Prado. That is debatable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may complete my statement, I think we \nwould be in a very strange situation where we would have the \nRepublicans filibustering our moving to Prado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, that is not only absurd, it is ridiculous. \nBut that is typical of what is going on here. Rather than give an \nhonest vote up or down, which is what advise and consent means under \nthe Constitution, they would prefer to try to take back the floor, \nalthough they are in the minority.\n  I have nothing against Judge Prado. In fact, I will vote for him. I \nthink he is terrific. But it is unseemly for them to try to interrupt \nthe Owen nomination, which has been brought to the floor in accordance \nwith the usual procedures around here, to try to justify their \nobstruction of not only Miguel Estrada but also Justice Owen by voting \nfor another nominee and making it look as if they are being reasonable \nabout these matters.\n  First of all, this is the first time in the history of this Republic \nthat a second nominee for a circuit court of appeals is being \nfilibustered.\n  To make it look like they are not filibustering, to make it look like \nthey are being reasonable, they are trying to overrule what the \nmajority leader has brought to the floor. I suspect if the \nParliamentarian continues to maintain that ruling, we will have to face \nthat problem.\n  Will our colleagues on the other side stop at nothing in their zeal \nto obstruct a vote up or down on President Bush's nominees? I think it \nshows even further how broken the Senate is, how broken this procedure \nand process is.\n  Now, my Democratic colleagues have brought up the fact that Priscilla \nOwen was defeated last year. Let us remember that she was defeated on a \nparty line, partisan vote, a vote of obstruction. After the first of \nthis year, she was brought up again in committee and passed through the \ncommittee with a majority vote--again, a straight partisan vote. All \nRepublicans voted for her and all Democrats on the committee voted \nagainst her.\n  Mr. President, I think it is unseemly what the Democrats are trying \nto do. I think they are trying to cover up their approaches. I think \nthey are trying to cover up their obstruction. I think it is an insult \nto Justice Owen, an insult to the President of the United States, and \nit is unfair. Unfortunately, I suspect we have to live with this type \nof unfairness.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Utah, earlier today, \nthe majority leader announced there would be no votes today. He has \nbeen always very cooperative with me. So I am not going to move to the \nnomination of Prado today. But I want to put my friend on notice, as \nwell as everybody else, that tomorrow, when we are going to be in a \nperiod of time where we can vote, I will do that.\n  I say to my friend from Utah, who is my friend, that I have respect \nfor him and his legislative abilities and his fine legal mind. But I \nbelieve we should not get bogged down with Miguel Estrada and Priscilla \nOwen. There are many other things we can do to move forward with lots \nof Judiciary Committee appointments, as was seen from the vote today. \nWe had 41 votes here. I think with Priscilla Owen and Miguel Estrada \nthere have been extraordinary circumstances that have caused us to do \nwhat we have done. There is no need to go over again why we feel as \nstrongly as we do with Miguel Estrada. The record is replete with that. \nWith Priscilla Owen, the record hasn't been made, but it will be. Here \nis a person we feel should not be on the court; as simple as that.\n  I see my friend who was chair and is now ranking member of the \nimportant Judiciary subcommittee which deals with judges. So I believe \nwe are fighting over issues that really are not helpful to the family. \nWe have heard a lot of talk here saying let's get Hispanic people on \nthe court. We have Prado; he is Hispanic. Let's move him this afternoon \nor tomorrow. Also, I am quite certain my friend from Utah did not mean \nthis. I understand why the majority wants to have an orderly process to \nhandle judicial nominations. It is understandable. But there are \ncertain times when you have to clean your house on Friday and not \nSaturday. Things come up. In this instance, I suggest that there has \nbeen a tentative agreement worked out, for example, on Roberts, who has \nbeen waiting a long time to become a circuit court judge. Using the \nlogic that I just heard from my friend from Utah, because Estrada is up \nahead of him, maybe we should not move to Roberts. But maybe because \nRoberts has been around longer, he would supersede Estrada.\n\n  The point is I think the seniority issue means a great deal in a \nlegislative body but very little in a judicial body. I know that one of \nthe fine people on the Ninth Circuit--I think my friend from Utah would \nunderstand he has been an outstanding jurist--Procter Hug, of Stanford \nLaw, served on the court a long time and became the chief judge of the \nNinth Circuit. That is based on seniority. But we are not here talking \nabout who is going to be the chief judge of the Fifth Circuit. We are \ntalking about trying to get judicial nominations filled as quickly as \nwe can.\n  The President said he wants them, and the majority leader said he \nwants more judges. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee said he \nwants more judges. We are here to please. We are willing to work. We \nhave approved 119, and there is no reason that by the end of this week \nwe could not get up over 120. We can do that, including Judge Prado. So \nI hope we can move beyond Priscilla Owen.\n  I say as respectfully as I can that Priscilla Owen is not going to be \napproved. Fact. I don't know everything, but one thing I do know is \nwhere the votes are most of the time. Priscilla Owen is not going to be \napproved. We should get off of her and go to something else.\n  If the majority wants us to go through lots of cloture votes on her, \nwe will march down here and do the same as we have done on Miguel \nEstrada. I am prepared to lay out why, and I will do that if necessary, \nand I am sure others can do it. That is why we should move to more \nsubstantive matters.\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\n  My friend from New York is here and he knows much more than I do \nabout this judge. I know plenty, but not as much as he does because \nthat is one of his obligations as a Member of the Senate--to take care \nof judges in the country.\n  Mr. President, let me just say again that we are not here picking \nfights that we don't feel are not essential to what we stand for. Not \nvery often do we choose to go to battle--very rarely. There are a lot \nof these judges I voted against because I don't think they are \nmainstream judges, but they are judges and they have lifetime \nappointments. The Democratic leader, supported by his caucus, said \nthere are two judges we are not going to let through: Miguel Estrada--\nand we know the conditions there that will not be met--and Priscilla \nOwen.\n  It is not as if we are stopping everything going on with judges. When \nI go home, it is amazing. It happens that people say things and people \nhave written editorials in opposition to my view saying: Isn't it \nterrible that he is holding up the judges? When I have had the chance \nto explain that we had approved 109 and turned down 1, that didn't seem \ntoo alarming. Now it is 119 to 2. That kind of quiets whole audiences.\n  The President of the United States was the owner of a baseball team. \nBoy, I will tell you, he would like to have a batting average with his \nteam members like that, where for every 119 times up to bat, they made \nouts on only 2 occasions. Not bad. Ted Williams could not match that, \nMr. President.\n  I would hope, again, everyone understands that we are not out \ncruising for a bruising. We are standing for what we believe is a \nprinciple, that we want a judiciary to be as good as it can be. It \ncannot be our judiciary--we understand that--but there are certain \ntimes when we draw a line in the sand. We have done it on two \noccasions. That is a pretty deep line we have drawn and people should \nunderstand that and not waste the time of the Senate.\n  We have so many other things to do. We have 13 appropriations bills \nto move. We have one new subcommittee on homeland security. It is going \nto be extremely difficult. We have a new chairman, a new ranking \nmember. The whole subcommittee is made up of new people. It is going to \nbe difficult to get that bill done. It is going to take some time. We \nshould be moving toward that.\n  I went to a press conference that was sponsored by the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, Hispanic Caucus, Native American Caucus, and Asian \nPacific Caucus. They asked me to drop by, and I was happy to do that \nbecause it, again, suggested to me that we have to do something about \nour health care crisis. Forty-five million Americans have no health \ninsurance, none. There are millions more who are underinsured. A \nsignificant number of those 45 million and those who are underinsured \nare people represented by those caucuses because of the diseases that \npeople have in their genes as a result of being of that ethnicity. That \nis what we should be working on.\n  The State of Nevada is in desperate shape financially, as are 42 \nother States in this country. The Republican Governor of the State of \nNevada has moved to increase taxes. He is no leftwing Socialist. He is \na man who is 65 years old, who spent his entire life helping kids and \nbeing an outstanding businessman in the State of Nevada. He said: We \nare desperate.\n  One reason they are desperate is the Federal Government has failed \nthe State of Nevada. We have required the State of Nevada to do all \nkinds of things in homeland security that they are paying for, and we \nare not helping.\n  In the Clark County School District there are about 260,000 kids. \nThey are desperate for money. They are talking about creating a 4-day \nschool week. Imagine that. They are talking about dropping band and \nsome athletic programs. People may laugh and say, good, get rid of \nthem, but the way I feel about it is those programs are some of the \nmost important programs young people have. They develop character. It \ngives them a sense of worth. That is what education is all about.\n  We passed this Leave No Child Behind Act. It was something that had \nbipartisan support, but we have not funded it.\n  Those are the things we should be doing, rather than spending days--\nnot minutes, not hours, but days--weeks, going into months on Estrada, \nand I guess Owen. I think it is wrong. We have too many other important \nthings to do.\n  We have an environment about which we should be concerned. We are not \ndealing with those issues. Do we need to improve the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act? Do we need to do something about Superfund? As a \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee, having been \nchairman of it twice, there are lots of things we can do, but it cannot \nbe done if we are spending all of our time on two judges who are not \ngoing to become the judges that they have been nominated to become. \nThat does not mean that we have ruined the judicial system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let's be honest about this. The Senator has \nbeen very blunt, very forthright and honest in his remarks that they \nintend to stop Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen. So now we are in the \nsecond filibuster. Let nobody have any illusions, we did not know until \nnow that literally they were going to filibuster Priscilla Owen. Now we \nhave two first-time-in-history filibusters against circuit court of \nappeals judges because the minority does not like these two judges, \neven though both of them have their gold standard imprinted upon them, \nunanimously well qualified, by their gold standard, the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  It is unseemly, and it appears to anybody who is a fairminded person \nthat there is no real desire to treat Miguel Estrada, with all of his \nqualifications, and Priscilla Owen with all of her qualifications, in a \nfair manner. It is also very apparent that the President of the United \nStates is not going to be treated in a fair manner as well.\n  I have no objection to Judge Prado. If that is what they want to do, \nwe will see about that, and we will see about it tomorrow. The fact is, \nthat does not negate the fact that for the first time in history we \nhave this type of obstruction rather than up-or-down votes of executive \nnominee judges for the circuit court of appeals.\n  I hate to think how this body has devolved from a body that works \ntogether to try to albeit argue and fight over certain nominees, but \nusually and always in the past we voted on them, how it has devolved \ninto this morass whereby two excellent people with the highest \nrecommendations from the American Bar Association and virtually \neverybody in their communities are being held up for no good reason at \nall, other than obstruction.\n  Now we at least know where we stand. I am willing to say I believe \nboth of these people will be confirmed in the end, and I believe our \ncolleagues on the other side are going to see that confirmation occur. \nAt least that is what I intend. I hope we can fully debate these \nmatters and then vote up or down. If my colleagues do not like Miguel \nEstrada, vote against him. If they do not like Priscilla Owen, vote \nagainst her. But do not do this anticonstitutional approach of \nfilibustering Executive Calendar circuit court of appeals nominees for \nthe first time in history.\n  We have been willing to put up with a certain amount of this, but \nthere is going to be an end to this type of obstruction. It has got to \ncome to an end, and I intend to see that it comes to an end if I can. I \nmay not be able to, but I think there is a way we can do that. I am \njust warning the other side that I believe sooner or later we are going \nto have up-or-down votes on these two jurist candidates.\n  I think it is pretty hard to make a case against Priscilla Owen that \ndoes not distort her record, that is factual and nondistortable. I \nthink it is going to be very difficult to make a case against her. For \nthe life of me, I do not understand why our colleagues on the other \nside are filibustering this excellent woman, who has such impeccable \ncredentials. They have plucked a couple of cases out of the air to \ncriticize her. I venture to say any judge who has been around for a \nconsiderable period of time, any of us could find some faults with that \njudge or we could find cases with which we do not agree. But relatively \nfew matters can they point to that would justify the kind of treatment \nPriscilla Owen is receiving at this time.\n  I think we should continue the debate. I intend to do so, and we will \nsee\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\nwhere we go from there. I hope my colleagues will be fair, but so far I \nhave not seen it. I think we are in the middle of an obstructive set of \ntactics that are beneath the dignity of the Senate.\n  Be that as it may, our colleagues do have certain rights. I respect \nthose rights and we will just see where we go from here. I believe \nPriscilla Owen ought to be confirmed, as I believe Miguel Estrada ought \nto be confirmed, as I believe Mr. Sutton, who is now confirmed, needed \nto be confirmed.\n  With regard to Roberts, I might as well make it clear we already have \na deal. We have made an agreement. So that should not even enter into \nthis question of whether one person should be confirmed ahead of \nanother. I agree that is a comme ci, comme ca type of thing, but we \nexpect to have a vote on Mr. Roberts. So we will revote him out of \ncommittee. We have a rehearing after 12 hours of hearings.\n  We were promised a vote on Justice Cook from Ohio. I hope that vote \nwill be tomorrow, or the next day, in accordance with the agreement we \nmade, because she was supposed to come up right away within a week. \nRoberts will be up for his second extensive confirmation hearing \ntomorrow. I intend to be there. Then he will be put on the markup a \nweek from this Thursday. We have had a good-faith assurance that they \nwill not try to put him over for another week.\n  So let's hope our colleagues live up to this agreement. It has not \nbeen an easy one for me to make, but we have made it. There have been \nsome pluses to us and some pluses to them. But it is done.\n\n  So Roberts is not part of the equation, nor should he be used as part \nof the equation.\n  It is the desire of the majority leader to have Owen approved first. \nOn the other hand, we will see what happens tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I enjoy listening to all of our \ncolleagues: Our leader from South Dakota, my friend from Nevada, and of \ncourse my good friend from Utah, who is just an excellent debater. I \nwould say he is indefatigable because he is on the floor all the time.\n  I am rising in opposition to Priscilla Owen, and I have a whole bunch \nof points I would like to make. But I would like to just answer my good \nfriend from Utah on two.\n  He constantly is using the word right now, ``obstruction.'' It would \nseem logical by his definition that nonobstruction is only when we \napprove every judge the President has nominated. The fact is that there \nare 119 who have been approved and only 3, if you include Judge \nPickering in this--that is, Miguel Estrada, Priscilla Owen, and Judge \nPickering--only 3 have been held up. Is it fair, I ask my friend from \nUtah, to call that obstruction?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will; 119 judges approved, 3 held up. That has been \ndone with greater speed than in any time that anyone has heard of, in \nterms of the period of time.\n  So I just ask my colleague, is the only way we can fail to be \nobstructionist by approving every single judge the President nominates? \nBecause we have come darned close. We only opposed three, and the word \n``obstruction'' flows like water from my good friend's lips.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the Senator yielding to me on that particular \nquestion because, yes, it is obstruction. For the first time in history \nto now, I understand from the Senator, he will be obstructing three \ncircuit court of appeals nominees: Miguel Estrada, Priscilla Owen, and \nJudge Pickering; three nominees filibustered for the first time in \nhistory.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator; I think there have been 119, \nwith Jeffrey Sutton, who have been confirmed. That is a good record. \nBut most of them are district court nominees who act as federal trial \njudges. There are a number of circuit court of appeals nominees. Five \nof them are still held over, as I recall it, from May 9 of 2001. Five \nof those original eleven are still not confirmed. There are all kinds \nof judicial emergencies out there that we are trying to take care of \nthat are being obstructed. Yes, I think it is obstruction.\n  I do not expect my colleagues on the other side to approve everybody \nthe President nominates. Vote against them. If you don't approve, vote \nagainst them.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would just like to reclaim my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. But I am saying if you don't approve of them, vote \nagainst them. We didn't obstruct yours. We voted. Everybody who came to \nthe floor was voted upon, and there was no filibuster conducted by us.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time, I would remind my colleague that \nwithin a single day, cloture votes were held on Judge Paez and Judge \nBerzon. There were attempted filibusters on the other side. They waited \nlarge numbers of years--more years than Priscilla Owen, Miguel Estrada, \nor Judge Pickering have waited. I didn't once hear my friend from Utah \ncall it obstruction.\n\n  What is good for the goose is good for the gander. There were cloture \nvotes held. There is only one difference--actually there is no \ndifference. Cloture was achieved eventually. But the bottom line is \nthis is not true. For Paez and Berzon I think it was the same day, it \nmay have been within a day of one another--cloture votes were held \nbecause a filibuster was being conducted.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield in a minute. It was run by a number of his \nfriends. I know my friend from Utah will say he worked out a deal and \neventually they were approved. So I ask him, when he answers that, to \nremind all of us how long they waited to be approved. Was it a year? \nWas it 2 years? No.\n  So, if my good friend from Utah would have the same patience, and \nsort of maybe we can come to an agreement 2 or 3 years from now--maybe \nafter 2004--then we would be being fair; we would be judging one side \nand the other with the same standard.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a double standard here, when my good \ncolleagues from Alabama and the now-Attorney General but then-Senator \nfrom Missouri and others launched filibusters----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Against two nominees for the Ninth Circuit. Those folks \nwaited years, longer times than any of the three we have mentioned. I \ndidn't hear the word ``obstruction.''\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Remember, on Judge Paez, I was the one who moved Judge \nPaez admittedly in the 4 years. But in that 4-year period he issued a \nnumber of hearings that were highly suspect, not only by people on our \nside but some on your side. We had other investigations that had to be \nconducted. Admittedly, it was too long; there is no question in my \nmind. That is a glaring example.\n  In the case of Judge Berzon, I was the one who pushed her through. \nWith regard to cloture votes----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would ask my colleague to yield for another question. \nHow long did Judge Berzon wait?\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't recall how long she waited.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe the record will show it was a longer time than \nany of these we are talking about.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't know if that is true or not. All I can say is I \nwas the one who put them through.\n  I also have to correct the record because there has never been a true \nfilibuster against President Clinton's nominees or any other Democrat \nPresident's nominees--never. There have been cloture votes. In most of \nthe cloture votes, those were time management approaches. Yes, we had a \nfew people over here who wanted to filibuster, but we were able to stop \nthem. There was no case--none, zero, nada, not ever--where a Democrat \nnominee who was brought to the floor was not ultimately voted on up or \ndown--never--until this year with Estrada and now Priscilla Owen, and I \npresume, from what you have said, perhaps Judge Pickering.\n  My contention is this. I know the distinguished Senator from New York \nis a good lawyer. He is a good friend. I value his friendship. But the \nfact is, I think there is much merit in having healthy debate, raising \nthe difficulties you have with a judge, but then having a vote up or \ndown. Vote whichever way\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nyou want to, for or against. But it is unseemly to start clogging up \nthe Senate with true filibusters for the purpose of trying to stop \nthese people from having a vote up or down. That was never done, not at \nany time during my tenure as chairman, and I made sure it wasn't done \nbecause I don't believe that is constitutionally a sound thing to do.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. But I say my good friend from Utah \nhad another method even more effective in bottling up judges, and that \nwas never bringing them up for a vote. I think it is hard to see how \nkeeping someone from a vote in the Judiciary Committee when there were \nvacancies on the bench, when those nominees waited and waited and \nwaited, is anymore commendable. To me, it seems certainly less \ncommendable than bringing them up for a vote and then having a large \nnumber of Senators--not a majority but certainly more than 40 percent \nof this body, as the rules of the Senate allow--not do it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am going to move on now.\n  I will be happy to yield. But the bottom line is that there is a lot \nof sophistry going on here in terms of argument--not in terms of \nindividuals. When you are forced to invoke cloture to get a vote, if \nthat is not a filibuster, I don't know what is. It seems to me it is. \nWhen you don't allow a nominee to come to the floor and get a vote and \nyou don't even bring them before the Judiciary to bring a vote, that is \nOK. But when they get the vote in Judiciary and then they come to the \nfloor and large numbers of Members feel so strongly that in only 2 \ncases out of 119 they say this is the only method we can use to stop \nit, that is wrong. It makes no sense.\n\n  Finally, I would say this: It is obstruction when you stop any one of \nthe President's nominees, because what our friend from Utah says he \nmust do when he says just have them come up for a vote is to pass every \nnominee because, for whatever reason, the discipline on that side is \nsuch that they will always get 51 votes.\n  I am proud of what we have done. I believe we are upholding the \nConstitution. I believe we are checking the arrogance in the White \nHouse, particularly with Miguel Estrada and his refusal to even answer \nany questions. I believe history will look very kindly on this effort. \nThey will look at it as courageous. They will look at it as right. They \nwill look at it as judicious because it has not been used willy-nilly. \nThey will look at it as fair.\n  I know my colleague from Utah is doing his job. He does it very well. \nMy hat is off to him. But ultimately all he wants us to do is spend a \nlittle time debating each nominee and then approving each one, no \nmatter what--whether they answer questions or not; whether he said, \nWell, Judge Paez had some bad cases that he ruled on.\n  Guess what. We think Judge Owen has a lot of bad cases. And some of \nthem were called bad by very conservative colleagues of my friend: The \nWhite House counsel, then-Judge Gonzales; and the junior Senator from \nTexas, then-Judge Cornyn, on the record--very rare--chastising Judge \nOwen for going way beyond the law. These were not liberal Democrats. \nThese were not even moderate Republicans. I don't think it is \ndisputable that in the eyes of many, Judge Owen has ``some bad cases.'' \nAnd if it was permissible to delay Judge Paez for 4 or 5 years because \nof some bad cases, then clearly we should just have begun on Judge \nOwen.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I think it is a credit \nto him. We don't have enough debates around here where we have \ninterchanges with each other. We stand up and make speeches, and \ngenerally they are written speeches. We don't have this type of high-\nquality debate.\n  Let me just answer the Senator on a few of his assertions that I \nthink are profoundly wrong.\n  First of all, they were not just a few bad cases. They were activist \ncases that were clearly outside the realm, in the eyes of many, \nincluding mine, of what good judicial conduct should be. Second, I \nthink there were other reasons--further investigation and so forth. But \neven more important than that, I would put my report record up as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee against any Democrat chairman--my \nchairmanship with a Democrat in the White House--against any Democrat \nchairman with a Republican in the White House with regard to how many \npeople were held over who didn't make it through the process.\n  For instance, when Joe Biden was chairman and the \nDemocrats controlled the committee in 1992 and President Bush left \noffice, there were 97 vacancies and 54 left holding. Two of the fifty-\nfour included Mr. Roberts--who is going to come up again for another \nhearing tomorrow in committee--and Judge Boyle from North Carolina, who \nhave been sitting there for over 12 years. We didn't complain about it. \nI think maybe somebody complained, but I didn't. We understand that \nthere are some holdups.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time----\n  Mr. HATCH. Please let me finish.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. They were never nominated by President Clinton.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand. They were nominated by a Republican \nPresident. Let me finish this. My colleague has been very generous with \nhis time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to have the debate, and I want to clear the \nrecord. They were not sitting for 12 years and not disposed of at the \nend of Congress and not renominated by a new President.\n  Mr. HATCH. They were nominated--both of them--three times by two \ndifferent Presidents. From the time they were first nominated to today, \nit has been 12 years. I will make that more clear.\n  With regard to the 54 holdovers when the Democrats controlled the \ncommittee and we had a Republican President, we didn't have the \nscreaming and mouthing off about that from our side. Compare that to \nwhen President Clinton left office and there were 67 vacancies, 30 \nfewer during my chairmanship and 41 left holding versus the 54.\n  By the way, of the 41, 9 were put up so late that nobody could have \ngotten them through no matter who the Judiciary chairman was. There \nwere really 32. If you take away those who had absolutely no \nconsultation with home State Senators--I mean none--then that reduces \nit some more. If you take away those who had further investigatory \nproblems, that reduced it some more. There were some--I have been \nhonest to admit this--whom I wish I could have gotten through who I \nthink deserved to go through. But there were many in the 54 who were \nleft by the Democrats who should have gotten through, too.\n  The point I am making is that it isn't the same because the Judiciary \nCommittee chairman can't get some of the holdovers through. I don't \nblame Senator Biden. I don't think I should be blamed. I did the best I \ncould. It isn't the same as when somebody is brought to the floor and a \nfilibuster occurs. The fact is there has never been a true filibuster \nup until Miguel Estrada--now Priscilla Owen--and from what the Senator \ntold me, it looks as if they are going to filibuster Judge Pickering \neven before we have his hearing this year. I hope that is not true. But \nit apparently is true with regard to Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen.\n  I think we have to break through this nonsense. Maybe we will approve \nall of these judges who are brought to the floor. That is what we \nshould do as Republicans with a Republican President, and we would \nhope--and, in fact, in every case we have had Democrats' support for \nthese judges--in every case, including Jeffrey Sutton today. It isn't \nas if it was a wholly partisan process. The Senator is probably right. \nIf we get these judges to the floor, presumably we will pass them. I am \nnot sure of that in every case, as I think we should. But if the \nSenator doesn't like them, and if others on this side don't, as they \ndid in the case of Jeffrey Sutton, vote against them.\n  It is true, Jeffrey Sutton is now confirmed and will receive his \ncertification to become a circuit court of appeals judge. But my \ncolleagues on the other side made this political point. They don't like \nsome of the things he has done as an advocate. That was their right, to \ndo so. I thought it wasn't the right thing to do myself. I believed \nthere was too much politics\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\ninvolved. But you had a right to do that. But he was confirmed. As \nSenator Reid, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, pointed out, there \nwere a number of Presidential candidates who were not here to vote on \nJeffrey Sutton's nomination. If they thought it was so important a \nvote, and that the judicial confirmation process is important, they \nshould have been here. I think we all would agree with that. They knew \nthis was the game that was being played to embarrass Mr. Sutton--not by \nthe Senator from New York, and not by a number of others.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will reclaim my time on that one. There are strong \nfeelings on this side, as the Senator knows. It has nothing to do with \ngames. To me, this rises to a sacred responsibility. And I don't use \nthose words lightly.\n  The bottom line is--again, I would first say to my friend from Utah, \nthis is not a referendum on his stewardship on the Judiciary. It is, \nagain, part of an extremely important process about who is on the \nbench, who is part of that third branch of Government and put there for \nlife.\n  But I would say to my friend--and he is the best in the business--the \nhigh dudgeon all of a sudden when a few nominees are held up for \nwhatever reason and sort of the muted signs when he was chairman and \nmany nominees were being held up, albeit not in exactly the same way--I \nwould say it is a difference that doesn't make a difference; it is sort \nof, well, inconsistent.\n  Again, that doesn't go to the personal integrity of my friend from \nUtah who did try in many instances but didn't succeed. And how we \nshould be judged, so to speak, is by who gets on the bench and who does \nnot because that is ultimately what the process is about.\n\n  I would mention, in my colleague's recounting, there were lots who \nwithdrew their nominations. You had the DC Circuit, the second most \nimportant circuit, for which both Miguel Estrada and Judge Roberts have \nbeen nominated, where there were no blue slip problems and there were \nno votes. So we can go over history. I am sure each side can point to \nwrongs on the other side.\n  The fact remains, of 119 judges who have been approved, there have \nbeen 3 we can be accused of holding up. As my friend from Nevada said, \nI have experienced the same thing. I go to parades and people say: What \nabout Estrada? What about the judges? Because they listen to talk \nradio. I say: I voted for 113 out of 119, and they just be quiet. They \nsay: Well, that is more than fair.\n  So this idea that we should roll over for every judge and allow them \nto be approved--and I would argue this with my friend from Utah--no \nPresident, certainly in my lifetime, and I think in the history of \nthese United States, has so nominated judges of an ideological cast. \nYou almost have to march lockstep and not be mainstream, not even be \nconservative but be way over, in case after case after case. That is \nwhat started this: no advise and consent, a desire to change America \nthrough the judiciary by creating an ideological litmus test for \nnominee after nominee after nominee. That is not what the Founding \nFathers intended. My guess is, if Jefferson or Washington or Madison \nwere looking down on this Chamber today, they would be approving of \nwhat we are doing because they would see that the balance in power--\nwhich they so carefully constructed between the President and the \nSenate, the President and the Congress, in terms of this awesome power \nto put people on the bench for life--is being eroded. That is why we \nare here. And we are going to continue to be here.\n  So my friend from Utah and the majority leader and others have a \nchoice: They can hold up all these other judges and say, well, until we \ndeal with Priscilla Owen we are not going to move anybody else. I would \nask a jury of 12 people, fair and true, nonpartisan, who is \nobstructing?\n  That is why I would hope we could bring the nomination of Judge \nEdward Prado to the floor. And one of the reasons we want to do it is, \nyes, from the mouth of my friend from Utah, there is this view that \nonly certain types of Hispanics would be approved or, from the mouths \nof others, that we are anti-Hispanic, a charge never leveled when Judge \nMoreno and Judge Rangel were not voted on to the same circuit by the \nother side.\n  But now we have Judge Prado, approved unanimously by the committee. I \nguess he is every bit as Hispanic as Miguel Estrada. There is one \ndifference: He answered questions. And his views were not so far over \nas many who know Miguel Estrada report them to be. Why don't we approve \nhim? Why don't we bring him up for a vote? Is he being used?\n  I will tell you what I think. I think the other side does not want us \nto approve a Hispanic judge who is within the mainstream. I think \nthat--\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think I will call on my colleague in a minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, if the Senator would yield, maybe I can satisfy--I \nhave no objection----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think it sort of shows that why Miguel Estrada is \nbeing held up has nothing to do with his ancestry but, rather, his \nconduct as he went through the nomination process in a unique refusal \nto answer questions.\n  I am going to tell my colleague one other story. President Bush has \njust nominated a woman to the district court in my State, Justice Dora \nIrizarry. She is Hispanic. She happened to be the Republican candidate \nfor attorney general in this last election. That does not bother me a \nbit. I called her to my office. I asked her many of the same questions \nI asked Miguel Estrada. She was forthright. I asked her for two Supreme \nCourt cases with which she disagreed. She named them, expostulated on \nthem. She did not say, canon 5 will not let her talk about them. She \ndid not say: I did not have the briefs, so I could not talk about \nthem--both absurd arguments, arrogant arguments, arguments that show \ncontempt for the Senate. And she is going to be approved, with my \nwholehearted support, even though she is Hispanic, even though she is \nmore conservative than I am, even though she is a Republican \nofficeholder.\n  So the bottom line is simple: We can fill the bench and increase the \nnumber of Hispanic nominees quickly, if we work together, if the \nnominees would take the process not with contempt but with the \nresponsibility that they should, given the awesome power that Federal \njudges have.\n  So I hope we will move to Judge Edward Prado. I hope we will move to \nhim soon. I would like, as my colleague from Nevada, for us to bring \nhim to the floor because there will not be a 2-week debate. There will \nbe a day debate, maybe a 6- or 3-hour debate, and he will be approved.\n  By the way, if we are worried about vacancies, it is the same circuit \nas Priscilla Owen. The reason the other side does not want to bring up \nJudge Prado is very simple; it shows the glaring inconsistency and \nfalsity of their arguments.\n  Our opposition to a few of these nominees has nothing to do with \ntheir ethnic background and nothing to do even with their political \nparty. It has to do with the fact that some of them are so extreme that \ntheir own Republican colleagues thought that.\n  Again, you have Judge Gonzales who is now counsel to the White House. \nHe said, in one of the cases that she dissented on, if the court went \nalong with her, it would ``be an unconscionable act of judicial \nactivism.'' That is from the Republican, conservative, White House \ncounsel. It could be an isolated case, as my good friend from Utah \nmentions, except that those who followed her on the courts say that was \nher MO. She constantly wanted to be a judicial activist and make law \nfrom the right.\n  I would be equally opposed to somebody who wanted to make law from \nthe left. I do not like nominees who are too far left or too far right. \nOn my own judicial committee, when those appointed distinguished \njurists from around my State have brought forth nominees and suggested \nnominees who were way over to the left, I have said no. Anyone who has \nwatched me interview judges knows that I am very weary of that because \njudges of the extremes make law. They do not do what the Founding \nFathers said, which is interpret the law.\n  And it was not just Judge Gonzales. We then have the situation in the \ncase of Weiner v. Wasson. This was a medical malpractice case. Again, \nJustice Owen wrote a dissent about an injured\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nplaintiff while he was still a minor, and the issue was the \nconstitutionality of a State law requiring minors to file medical \nmalpractice actions before reaching the age of majority or risk being \noutside the statute of limitations.\n  Then Justice John Cornyn, now our colleague in the Senate, said:\n\n       Generally, we adhere to our precedents for reasons of \n     efficiency, fairness, and legitimacy. First, if we did not \n     follow our own decisions, no issue could ever be considered \n     resolved. The potential volume of speculative relitigation \n     under such certain circumstances alone ought to persuade us \n     that stare decisis is a sound policy. Secondly, we should \n     give due consideration to the settled expectations of \n     litigants like Emmanuel Wasson, who have justifiably relied \n     on the principles articulated in [the case]. . . . Finally, \n     under our form of government, the legitimacy of the \n     judiciary rests in part upon a stable and predictable \n     decisionmaking process that differs dramatically from that \n     properly employed by the political branches of government.\n       According to the conservative majority on the Texas Supreme \n     Court,\n     --this is not a liberal court--\n       Justice Owen went out of her way to ignore precedent and \n     would have ruled for the defendants. The conservative \n     Republican majority followed precedent and the doctrine of \n     stare decisis.\n\n  So this is not a mainstream nominee. This is a nominee who has every \nindication of being an activist from the right, of being somebody who \nwishes to turn the clock back, of being somebody who sides over and \nover and over again with the larger corporate interests against the \nindividual. In my judgment, she does not belong on the Fifth Circuit. \nIf the only way we can stop her is to prolong this debate, so be it. \nThere are many other people in Texas, many other lawyers, many other \njudges, many others in the realm of the Fifth Circuit who are \nconservative and intelligent and qualified. If the President wanted to \ncome to some agreement with us, he would nominate them. In fact, one is \nbefore us--could be before us: Judge Prado. He will not have any issue \nwith us.\n  Is there a litmus test? Absolutely not. I have no idea what Judge \nPrado has ruled. He has been for 19 years on the court. I don't know \nwhat his position is on choice. I don't know what it is on gun control. \nI don't know what it is on gay rights. But his hearing and his record \nshow he is not out of the mainstream.\n  I have always had three watchwords with people I have supported, both \nin New York, where I am actively involved in the selection process, and \naround the country, where obviously I am one one-hundredth of the \nadvise and consent process. Those are ``excellence,'' ``balance,'' and \n``moderation.'' My three words are ``excellence,'' ``moderation,'' and \n``diversity.''\n  I have to give the President credit. On criteria one and three, his \nnominees meet the bill. They are legally excellent, by and large. These \nare not political hacks or people who don't have the brainpower to be \nexcellent judges. The President, to his credit, has gone out of his way \nfor diversity.\n  But on moderation, it is almost as if he is not even making an \neffort. It is as if he has over and over and over again nominated \npeople like Jeffrey Sutton, who we just approved, who are trying to \nchange the law, who are trying to turn the clock back, who have an \natavistic fear of the Federal Government and what it can do.\n  Again, it is our obligation to oppose such judges, just as it is our \nobligation to support those who are qualified.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side to realize they are not going \nto win every single case. They are going to lose a few. I think they \nshould have lost a few more than they did. I would have not liked to \nsee Jeffrey Sutton go to the Sixth Circuit. But to say we will not \nbring up another judicial nominee until Priscilla Owen is passed is the \nreal obstruction. I don't think it will stand up. We know there are \nsome on the other side who quietly have said this has gone too far, who \nhave urged the White House to moderate its stance, who have said, let \nus move on from Miguel Estrada or reveal his records. Unfortunately, \nthe White House seems to feel they want it all in every way. They want \nit all theirs.\n  That is not what the Founding Fathers intended. It is not even what \nthe Founding Fathers intended when there is a President and a Senate \ncontrolled by the same party, as we have today. We will oppose Judge \nOwen. We will continue to oppose her. We will proudly oppose her.\n  When we began this fight, which I guess I was one of the first people \nto get involved in in terms of moderating the judiciary and seeing that \nthere be some moderation, when I proposed to our good majority leader \nand our chairman of the Judiciary Committee that we not allow Miguel \nEstrada to go forward until he answered questions, I thought \npolitically it would be a loser. It is easy to get up and say: Just let \na majority vote and let the chips fall where they may. I think we had \nsome knowledge that illegitimate charges of not supporting someone \nbecause of his ethnic background would be hurled at us.\n  But do you know what has happened. As the debate has gone forward, \nfirst, our caucus is firmer and firmer and stronger and stronger in the \nbelief that what we are doing is right and rises to noble \nconstitutional principles. Second, the public is beginning to catch on.\n  I found, as I traveled across my State these 2 weeks while we were on \nEaster break, that people were saying: Why does the President want his \nway on every single nominee? As soon as people heard I had voted for \n113 of 119 of the President's nominees, they said: You have been more \nthan fair.\n  So anybody on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue who thinks they \nare going to take a two by four and break us, we have proven that that \nis not the case. The fact that in our caucus there is such strong \nsupport to block Priscilla Owen shows we are gaining strength.\n  I plead with my colleagues to go back to the White House once again \nand tell them they are not going to win every single fight, that they \nhave an obligation to advise and consent, that there is some degree of \ncompromise in making this government work, and that, most of all, the \nbench should not be filled with ideologs who have an atavistic, \ninstinctive preference to make law rather than interpret the law as the \nFounding Fathers intended.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Senate with \nsome regret and with somewhat of a heavy heart. I believe in the rule \nof law. Indeed, this Nation was built on the rule of law, the ultimate \nstrength of our institutions that make up our representative democracy. \nSo it saddens me, along with many of my distinguished colleagues, when \nI witness the abject failure of one of these institutions. Nowhere has \nthis institution met with greater failure than in the area of judicial \nnominations.\n  Nearly two years ago, President Bush announced his first class of \nnominees to the Federal court of appeals. Five of the eleven nominees \nhave not had a single vote in the Senate two years later. This list \nincludes Justice Priscilla Owen, with whom I served on the Texas \nSupreme Court, and whose nomination is now pending before this body.\n  Two years is too long. I believe the Senate has reached a new low in \nrecent months, with the unprecedented use of a filibuster of dubious \nmerit that blocks an exceptionally qualified nominee who enjoys the \nsupport of a bipartisan majority. If we were allowed to vote, I am \nconvinced that a bipartisan majority of the Senate would today vote to \nconfirm Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  This dismal political anniversary indicates the true range of the \nfailure of the judicial confirmation process in this body. This process \nhas become unnecessarily but increasingly bitter and destructive, and \nit does a terrible disservice to the President, to Senators, to \nnominees, and ultimately to the American people.\n  I do not know anyone who truly believes in their heart of hearts that \nthe process works now the way it should. I believe most reasonable \npeople looking at this process from the outside would agree with me \nthat the process is broken. But the question now becomes, is it broken \nwithout hope of repair?\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\n  Today I announced that the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the \nConstitution will convene a hearing on reform of the broken judicial \nconfirmation process. This hearing will allow distinguished Members of \nthe Senate, on a bipartisan basis, as well as the Nation's leading \nconstitutional experts, the opportunity to discuss the serious \nconstitutional questions raised by the obstruction of judicial \nnominations. We will address the problems facing the Senate and the \nFederal judiciary, and we will consider and debate potential solutions \nand reforms.\n  Yes, I believe two years is too long. Specifically, it is too long \nfor a candidate as worthy and as qualified as Justice Priscilla Owen. \nOf the nominees currently pending before the Senate, no one has waited \nlonger than Justice Owen for a vote on the Senate floor on a judicial \nnomination--no one. As a former state supreme court justice who served \nwith Justice Owen for three years, and now as a member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee which carefully considered and endorsed her \nnomination to the Federal bench last month, I firmly believe Justice \nOwen deserves to be confirmed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit. Of course, the Fifth Circuit covers my home State of Texas as \nwell as the States of Mississippi and Louisiana. If the Senate applies \na fair standard, if we continue to respect our Constitution, Senate \ntraditions, and the fundamental democratic principle of majority rule, \nshe will be confirmed.\n  The arguments of those who oppose Justice Owen's nomination can be \nsummed up in one phrase: Don't confuse us with the facts.\n\n  The facts are these: First, the American people are in desperate need \nof highly qualified individuals of the greatest legal talent and legal \nminds to fill the numerous vacant positions on the Federal bench, \nparticularly those on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, whose three \nvacancies are all designated judicial emergencies by the U.S. Judicial \nConference.\n  Second, we must ensure that all judicial nominees understand that \njudges must interpret the law as written and not as judges or special \ninterest groups would like them to be written. In other words, the \njudiciary must be a means by which the laws that are passed by Congress \nand signed by the President are implemented in the daily lives of the \nAmerican people. The Constitution does not comprehend nor is it \nappropriate for judges to serve as a super-legislative body or to serve \nas another legislative branch in a black robe.\n  Of course, when it comes to interpreting the law faithfully and \navoiding the pressure of special interest groups, Justice Owen \nsatisfies both of these standards with flying colors. She is quite \nsimply, by any measure, an outstanding jurist. The facts are testimony \nto her ability and her intelligence.\n  Justice Owen graduated at the top of her class at Baylor Law School \nand was an editor of the Law Review at a time when few women entered \nthe legal profession. She received the highest score on the bar \nexamination. And she was extremely successful in the private practice \nof law for seventeen years before joining the bench.\n  Since she has become a judge about eight years ago, she has served \nwith enormous distinction on the Texas Supreme Court. In her last \nelection to the Texas Supreme Court, she was endorsed by virtually \nevery major Texas newspaper, and most recently when she was reelected \nshe received the vote of 84 percent of those who cast a vote in the \nelection.\n  She has the support of prominent Texas Democrats and Republicans \nalike, Democrats such as former members of the Texas Supreme Court, \nChief Justice John Hill and Justice Gonzales, as well as a long list of \nformer presidents of the State bar, and leaders in the legal profession \nin my State. The American Bar Association that provides some analysis \nof judicial nominees, an objective analysis, has rated her well \nqualified, a rating that some of my colleagues used to refer to as \n``the gold standard,'' but which they now conveniently choose to \nignore.\n  I simply cannot fathom how any judicial nominee can receive all these \naccolades from opinion leaders, from constituents, from legal experts \nacross the political spectrum, unless the nominee is both an \nexceptionally qualified lawyer, a judge who respects the law, and a \nperson who steadfastly refuses to insert his or her own political \nbeliefs into the judging of cases.\n  Based on this remarkable record of achievement and success, of \neloquent and evenhanded rulings, it should come as no surprise that \nJustice Owen has long commanded the support of a bipartisan majority of \nthe Senate.\n  I would like to take a couple of moments to talk about my own \npersonal observations while serving with Justice Owen on the Texas \nSupreme Court. She and I served together on that court for three \nyears--from the time she joined the court in January 1995 until the \ntime I left the court after serving seven years in October of 1997.\n  During those three years, I had the privilege of working closely with \nJustice Owen. I had the opportunity to observe on a daily basis \nprecisely how she approaches her job as a judge, how she thinks about \nthe law, and what she thinks about the job of judging in literally \nhundreds, if not thousands, of cases. I spoke with and indeed debated \nin conference with Justice Owen on countless occasions about how to \nfaithfully read and follow statutes and how to decide cases based upon \nwhat the law is--not based on some result we would like to see \nachieved. I saw her taking careful notes, pulling down the law books \nfrom the shelves and studying them with dedication and diligence. I saw \nhow hard she works to faithfully interpret and apply what the Texas \nlegislature had written, without fear and without favor. Not once did I \never see her attempt to pursue some political agenda in her role as a \njudge, or try to insert her own belief as opposed to the intent of the \nlegislature or some precedent from a higher court in the case at hand. \nTo the contrary, I can tell you from my personal observation that \nJustice Owen feels very strongly that judges are called upon--not as \nlegislators or as politicians, but as judges--to faithfully read \nstatutes on the books and interpret and apply them faithfully in cases \nthat come before the court. I can testify from my own personal \nexperience, as her former colleague and as a fellow justice, that \nJustice Owen is an exceptional judge who works hard to follow the law \nand enforce the will of the legislature. She is a brilliant legal \nscholar and a warm and engaging person. To see the kind of disrespect \nthe nomination of such a great Texas judge has received in this body is \ndisappointing and really beneath the dignity, I believe, of this \ninstitution.\n  It is hard to recognize the caricature that opponents of this nominee \nhave drawn. Unfortunately, as a Member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee who has had a chance now to vote on a number of President \nBush's nominees for the Federal bench, I have seen that the practice of \nvilifying and marginalizing and demonizing President Bush's judicial \nnominees is becoming all too common. Indeed, I began to wonder whether \nthere are any good, honorable people with distinguished records in the \nlegal profession or in the judiciary who will submit their names for \nconsideration by this body, knowing that, regardless of the facts, \nregardless of the truth, they will be painted as some caricature not of \nwhat they really are, but of what others have cast them to be, when in \nfact the truth is far different, and with no justification.\n  It pains me to see what can only be called the politics of personal \ndestruction played out in the course of the judicial confirmation \nprocess. We can and we must do better.\n  The special interest groups, and the minority in this body--who \noppose even calling a vote on Justice Owen have no real arguments to \noppose her nomination, at least none based in fact or any that would \nwithstand scrutiny under any fair standard. Their past record shows \nthese groups who have cast aspersions on many highly qualified \nnominees--many of whom currently serve on the Federal bench--their \nattacks against judges are simply not credible.\n  For example, these opponents of a bipartisan majority who would vote \nto confirm Justice Owen today are the very same folks who predicted \nthat Justice Lewis Powell's confirmation would mean that ``justice for \nwomen will be ignored.'' Justice Owen's opponents are the same folks \nwho argued that Justice John Paul Stevens had demonstrated ``blatant \ninsensitivity to\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\ndiscrimination against women'' and ``seems to bend over backwards to \nlimit'' rights for all women. Justice Owen's opponents are the same \nfolks who testified that confirming David Souter to the United States \nSupreme Court would mean ``ending freedom for women in this country''--\nthe same folks who said they ``tremble for this country if you confirm \nDavid Souter''--who even described now-Justice Souter as ``almost \nNeanderthal'' and warned that ``women's lives are at stake'' if the \nSenate were to confirm him.\n\n  How many times must these irresponsible and baseless allegations be \nmade before we finally say these special interest groups have no \ncredibility when it comes to judicial confirmations? Their claims about \nJustice Owen are no more accurate and no less hysterical. It reminds me \nof the boy who cried wolf.\n  After these repeated charges and accusations and shrill attacks, \nwhich typically turn out--certainly in the cases I mentioned--to be \nutterly baseless and unfair, it makes you wonder just how credible \nthese groups think they really are, or how long their arguments will \ncontinue to have currency in this body or in the media.\n  It also makes you wonder whether these groups make their claims not \nbecause they actually believe they are true, but in order to achieve \ntheir own political aims--in order to defeat judges nominated by this \nPresident, who believe that a judge's role is not to be an activist in \na black robe or a super legislator. But I believe these shrill attacks \nare made with one purpose and one purpose only--to scare people and to \nsupport unsubstantiated and baseless attacks against highly qualified \nnominees like Justice Owen.\n  In the case of Justice Owen, their attacks are true to form. And they \nconform to their past patterns and practices--for they are like their \nattacks of the past, unfair and without foundation either in fact or in \nlaw. For example, some of Owen's detractors claim she rewrites statutes \nin order to further her own political agenda. That is a pretty \nincredible charge in light of her ABA rating of well qualified, which \nwas unanimous, her strong bipartisan backing, and her enthusiastic \nsupport from Texans, people who know her best. It is also a baseless \ncharge.\n  To ostensibly prove their point, Justice Owen's opponents point out \nthat on occasion, other justices on the Texas Supreme Court have \nwritten opinions saying Justice Owen sometimes was rewriting statutes \nin order to achieve a particular result. That is an absurd standard to \napply in a Senate confirmation, for reasons I will detail now. All \njudges of good faith struggle to read statutes and other legal texts \ncarefully, and faithfully.\n  In close and difficult cases--and the docket of the Texas Supreme \nCourt is chock full of them--judges will often disagree about the \nproper and most correct legal interpretation. Indeed, we establish \ncourts of multiple members--nine members--a collegial decision-making \nbody, believing that judges will sometimes disagree, but in that \ndecision-making process, that there will be a full and fair debate \nabout the various positions, about the various interpretations, and \nthat ultimately majority rule will win out and a case will be fully and \nfinally decided.\n  But when disagreements occur, a judge may naturally conclude that his \nor her own reading of a statute is correct. That is why they will \ndecide the case in the way they choose, based on a belief that their \ninterpretation of a statute is correct. And, of course, it only follows \nthat if I believe, in deciding a case, that my interpretation of the \nstatute is correct, that the interpretation of the statute by someone \nwho achieves a different result is not correct.\n  Now, that is not the final word. Obviously, the final word is the \ndecision of the majority of the court which decides, for all practical \npurposes, not necessarily in the abstract, but for all practical \npurposes, what the correct result is, so that the people in our States \nand across the country can know what the rules are and apply them with \nsome predictability.\n  I would point out that practically everyone with any significant \njudicial experience has faced the same criticism that Justice Owen has \nreceived in terms of rewriting statute. Yet if Justice Owen's opponents \nare to be taken seriously, any judge who has been criticized of \nrewriting a statute is presumptively unfit for the Federal bench. As I \npointed out at Justice Owen's confirmation hearing last month, such an \nabsurd standard would exclude practically all of her current and past \ncolleagues on the Texas Supreme Court.\n  Such an absurd standard would also disqualify numerous members of the \nU.S. Supreme Court, people with whom Justice Owen's opponents are known \nto agree. For example, in 1971, Justice Hugo Black and William O. \nDouglas sharply criticized Justices William Brennan, Harry Blackmun, \nand others, stating that the ``plurality's action in rewriting this \nstatute represents a seizure of legislative power that we simply do not \npossess.''\n  In a 1985 decision, Justice John Paul Stevens accused Justices Lewis \nPowell, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Byron White of engaging in ``judicial \nactivism.''\n  Countless other examples pervade the U.S. Reports.\n  Would Justice Owen's opponents and detractors apply the same standard \nand exclude those Justices with whom they tend to agree from Federal \njudicial service? Of course not. It is a double standard. It applies to \nJustice Owen but not to judges who they would prefer. But fairness only \ndictates that Justice Owen not be made to suffer from an absurd and \nunreasonable double standard.\n  I remind my colleagues that just last year, the Democrat-controlled \nSenate confirmed Professor Michael McConnell to the Federal court of \nappeals by unanimous consent, even though Judge McConnell, like Justice \nRuth Bader Ginsburg and liberal law professors and commentators, has \npublicly criticized the analysis of several Supreme Court rulings, \nincluding Roe v. Wade. That is not something, however, that Justice \nOwen has done.\n  Now, don't get me wrong. I am glad that Judge McConnell was \nconfirmed. He is an exceptional jurist who is already proving to be a \nfine judge on the Federal court of appeals. But his case illustrates \nthe inherent foolishness of using ideological litmus tests when \nassessing the abilities and evenhandedness of judicial nominees.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you from personal experience, when you put \nyour left hand on the Bible, and raise your right hand, and take an \noath as a judge, you change. Your job changes. No longer are you an \nadvocate for a particular position in a court of law that you hope some \ncourt will embrace. No longer are you a legislator--assuming you have \nbeen a legislator--used to making the law or affecting public policy in \na very stark and direct way.\n  Mr. President, when you raise your right hand, and put your left hand \non the Bible, and take a sacred oath to perform the duties of a judge, \nyou change. And, indeed, Justice Owen has been true to that oath and \nhas faithfully discharged her responsibilities as a judge, and will do \nso on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals if this body would simply vote \non her nomination.\n\n  I want to spend a few moments talking about filibusters.\n  Clearly, debate is important. In a body such as the Senate, this is \none place where we know if there is a difference of opinion on any \nissue, if there are competing points of view, that there will be a full \ndebate. Debate is, indeed, the only way to ensure we make known to each \nother our views and our values. It is the only way to ensure we have \nthe opportunity to make our arguments known and to respond to the \narguments of others; to appeal to the public and reasonable people who \nwill assess those arguments and achieve or arrive at a judgment on \ntheir own about what they believe, what they do not believe, which \narguments have value and which have no value, which arguments are \nsupported by facts or evidence and which are baseless. It is the only \nway to ensure that each of us can be convinced we have been given at \nleast the opportunity to persuade others and to appreciate the wisdom \nof our respective positions.\n  But for democracy to work, and for the fundamental democratic \nprinciple of majority rule to prevail, the debate must eventually end, \nand we must eventually bring matters to a vote. As Senator Henry Cabot \nLodge famously\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\nsaid about filibusters: ``To vote without debating is perilous, but to \ndebate and never vote is imbecile.''\n  So let's have a debate about this exceptional nominee. And after we \nhave had the debate, let's vote. There should not be a filibuster. A \nminority of the Senate should not try to impose what is in effect a \nsupermajority requirement for confirming judicial nominees, operating \nunder the constant threat of filibuster.\n  The Constitution makes clear when the Founders intended to require a \nsupermajority of this body to act. It specifies that two-thirds of each \nHouse shall be necessary to override a Presidential veto on \nlegislation, and that two-thirds of each House shall be necessary to \namend the Constitution, subject to the ratification by the people. It \nprovides that two-thirds of the Senate shall be necessary to convict an \nofficer pursuant to an impeachment trial, and that two-thirds of the \nSenate shall be necessary to consent to the ratification of treaties.\n  It does not say that a supermajority shall be necessary to confirm a \nPresident's judicial nominees. And it is well-settled and well-\nestablished law, as a matter of both Senate practice and Supreme Court \nprecedent, that majority rule is the norm, whenever the text of the \nConstitution does not expressly provide otherwise.\n  The Constitution vests the advice-and-consent function in the entire \nSenate, not just in the Senate Judiciary Committee. During the last \nCongress, the Senate Judiciary Committee refused to report Justice \nOwen's nomination out to the entire Senate. The committee, it should be \nobvious, does not speak for the entire Senate. Indeed, the committee \nitself could have reconsidered the nomination and could have reported \nJustice Owen to the floor even after it had previously refused to do \nso.\n  The Constitution requires elections to make sure that the Senate \nremains accountable to the people. To insist that a new Senate cannot, \nafter an intervening election, reconsider legislation or a nomination \nrejected by a previous Senate is to reject the very principle of \ndemocracy and accountability.\n  Accordingly, there is no Senate tradition that forbids the President \nfrom renominating an individual previously rejected by the full Senate, \nlet alone by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Quite to the contrary, \nthere is a wealth of precedent for such re-nominations.\n  As recently as 1997, the Senate Judiciary Committee refused to report \nBill Lann Lee to the entire Senate. Yet President Clinton not only \nrenominated Lee in subsequent sessions of the Senate, he even gave Lee \na recess appointment in 2000 without triggering substantial opposition \nfrom the Senate.\n  I am not asking for the Senate to depart from its traditions. Indeed, \nthe only departure from tradition that is occurring today is the \nfilibuster of Miguel Estrada and now Priscilla Owen, something that has \nnever happened before to a circuit court nominee.\n  I hope we have a good, vigorous debate on this nomination because I \nbelieve that by any measure Justice Owen is an exceptional judge and an \nexceptional human being who deserves confirmation.\n  I am confident that, at the end of the debate, if Members of the \nSenate really want to know what the facts are, as opposed to the \ncaricature that has been drawn of Justice Owen by special interest \ngroups intent on vilifying, marginalizing, demonizing a good and decent \nhuman being, that if we were allowed to have a vote, we would have a \nstrong bipartisan majority that would support her nomination.\n  I hope no matter what the outcome, we will come to an end of the \ndebate, and we will simply do what the people of our respective states \nsent us here to do, and that is to vote.\n  I would not ask the Senate to depart from its traditions of fairness \nin this case. By any fair measure, Justice Owen is an exceptional judge \nand exceptional nominee. I am confident she will not only maintain the \nstrong bipartisan majority she has in support of her nomination, but \nthat it will grow as Senators examine the record, test some of the \nallegations made against her, and find them without substantiation, \nwithout justification; that if what we are really interested in is \nfinding the truth about this nominee, and determining whether she will \nuphold the oath she has taken and that she will take as a judge on the \ncircuit court, she will be confirmed.\n  I hope this body will abide by the Constitution as written, and not \nimpose some supermajority requirement where the Constitution requires \nnone, and where the Supreme Court and Senate traditions and the \nfundamental principle of majority rule dictate a majority vote on this \nnominee, not a 60-vote supermajority.\n  As long as the Senate applies a fair standard to this nominee, I have \nno doubt Justice Owen will be confirmed. Now nearly two years have \npassed since she was nominated to the Federal bench. The Senate should \nvote to confirm her immediately.\n  We ask judges to be fair, to be impartial in deciding cases, to show \nneither fear nor favor. But certainly the requirement of fairness does \nnot end in the judicial branch. It also applies to the Congress and to \nthe Senate in performing our responsibilities. Certainly you would \nthink it is self-evident that it should apply in confirming judicial \nnominees. Our current state of affairs is neither fair nor \nrepresentative of the sentiment of a bipartisan majority of this body.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nevada has said that, when it comes to \nsetting the hours of debate, ``there is not a number in the universe \nthat would be sufficient.'' I say two years is more than sufficient.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to address \nthe issue about the qualifications of Priscilla Owen to serve on the \nFifth Circuit of the United States.\n  In considering this nominee, particularly in the wake of the recent \ncomments of my friend from Texas, it is worthy to point out that there \nhave been 119 nominations for the Federal bench, including the Court of \nClaims, either for the district or the circuit court, over the period \nof this President. We have had one, Mr. Pickering, who was defeated a \nyear ago and who was renominated by the President. There is Priscilla \nOwen now before the Senate. But there has only been one, according to \nmy calculations, Miguel Estrada, where sufficient questions have been \nraised as to his commitment to the core values of the Constitution, \nwhere that issue is still before the Senate.\n  That is an extraordinary response by the Senate in considering \nfavorably the series of nominees by this President. I don't know the \ncourse of our history, but this certainly has to be one of the most \nfavorable records, certainly of any recent times, of response by the \nSenate in approval of the President's nominees.\n  I listened to my friend and colleague talk about the importance of \nPriscilla Owen being able to finally get a vote on her nomination. I \nwas thinking about the recent history of the time when my friend from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. We had \nthree nominees for the Fifth Circuit: H. Alston Johnson, Enrique \nMoreno, and Jorge Rangel. All three individuals were never given a vote \nunder the Republican committee and the Republican Senate. These are \ntruly outstanding individuals.\n  It is important to have some understanding of history in terms of who \nhas permitted votes to take place and who has failed to permit even \nthese well-qualified individuals, in this instance, just on the Fifth \nCircuit. I am not taking the time of the Senate to list them all. I \nknow Senator Leahy has done this at other times.\n  I also refer to the history of the Senate to provide some awareness \nof background. The claim that it is unprecedented to filibuster a court \nof appeals nomination is false and hypocritical. Since 1980, cloture \nmotions have been filed on 14 court of appeals and district court \nnominations.\n  Recently, Republicans filibustered, in the year 2000, in an attempt \nto block the nomination of Richard Paez, a Hispanic, and Marcia Berzon, \nonto the Ninth Circuit. This is after Richard Paez had been waiting 4 \nyears due to anonymous holds by Senate Republicans. Bob Smith openly \ndeclared he was leading a filibuster, and he described Senator Sessions \nas a member of his filibustering coalition. Even Senator Frist was \namong those voting\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\nagainst cloture on the Paez nomination.\n  So requiring cloture on judicial nominations is not an \nextraconstitutional event. The Senate has the role of advise and \nconsent on judicial nominations, and the Constitution leaves it to the \nSenate to carry out its responsibility in accordance with its own \nrules. Requiring cloture to end debate on a nomination is permitted \nunder Senate rule XXII. The right of Senators to speak on the floor at \nlength is central to the Senate's role.\n  I ask the Senate to listen to the history of the Senate on \nnominations. In the first decade of the Senate's history, the Founders \nrejected a rule providing for a motion to close debate, and for the \nrest of our history, our rules have provided that debate, which is the \nlifeblood of our power, cannot easily be cut short. For 111 years, \nunanimous consent was required to end debate in the Senate. Until 1975, \na two-thirds majority was required. Now it is only 60 votes that are \nrequired. Until 1949, debates on nominations could not be cut off at \nall.\n  It is interesting to note the history of the rules as they have \napplied to nominations historically when we are considering \ncontroversial nominees. I daresay if we look at the record today--it is \nmy understanding that there is only one of President Bush's judicial \nnominations that we have so far blocked on the Senate Floor, and that \nis Mr. Estrada, which is because of the failure of the Administration \nto provide key documents from his time in the Solicitor General office \nso that we can be able to understand Mr. Estrada's commitments to the \ncore values of the Constitution.\n  It was interesting as well that earlier in the day our leaders \nrequested that there be an opportunity to consider Judge Edward Prado, \na nominee to the Fifth Circuit, who is on the registrar, to see whether \nwe could move ahead with that nominee. There was objection that was \nfiled, as I understand it, by the Republicans. He is a Republican. We \nmay not all agree with his views or his rulings, but in his time on the \nbench he has shown that he is committed to the rule of law and not to \nreshaping the law to fit a rightwing ideology. There is not a single \nletter of opposition against him, and he is ready to be voted on by the \nfull Senate. Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, and others have indicated--\nthe Judiciary Committee on our side has indicated--they were prepared \nto vote on him earlier today. But an objection was raised. Nominees \nsuch as Judge Prado should get our full support, but nominees such as \nPriscilla Owen should not.\n  There is also Judge Cecilia Altonaga. She would be the first Cuban \nAmerican woman on the Florida district court. I understand she could be \nconsidered favorably and passed as the first Cuban American woman to \nserve on the Florida district court. She had a unanimous vote of the \nJudiciary Committee. She could be approved this afternoon. That would \nbring the number up to 121.\n  Earlier today the Senate narrowly voted to confirm Jeffrey Sutton to \na lifetime appointment on the Sixth Circuit. Like far too many of \nPresident Bush's nominees, he was opposed by a broad array of citizens \nfrom across the country because there were many attempts to roll back \nrights and protections for people with disabilities, women, minorities, \nand older workers.\n\n  The drumbeat goes on. This afternoon we begin debate on yet another \nextremely controversial nominee--Priscilla Owen. It is shameful and \nshocking that the administration is so bent on packing the courts with \nnominees such as Jeffrey Sutton and Priscilla Owen, who are so clearly \nhostile to the rights and protections that are so important to vast \nnumbers of Americans.\n  Many well-qualified, fairminded nominees could easily be found by \nthis administration if they were willing to give up their rightwing \nlitmus test. I have mentioned two who are pending that we could be \nconsidering at this very moment.\n  Priscilla Owen, I don't believe should be favorably considered. Her \nrecord on the Texas Supreme Court is one of activism, unfairness, and \nhostility to fundamental rights. I am particularly concerned about her \nrecord on issues of major importance to workers, consumers, victims of \nracial discrimination or gender discrimination, and women exercising \ntheir constitutional right to choose.\n  Justice Owen is one of the most frequent dissenters on her court in \nTexas in cases involving workers, consumers, and victims of \ndiscrimination. That she dissents from this court so frequently is \nimmensely troubling. This court is dominated by Republican appointees \nand is known for frequently ruling against plaintiffs. Yet when the \ncourt rules in favor of plaintiffs, only one member of the court, \nJustice Hecht, has dissented more often than Justice Owen.\n  In her dissents, Justice Owen raises new barriers to limit the role \nof juries in product liability cases, personal injury cases, and \nnarrowly construes employment discrimination laws. She has limited the \ntime period for minors to remedy medical malpractice. She has limited \nthe ability of individuals to obtain relief when insurance companies \nunreasonably, and in bad faith, deny claims. Justice Owen's many \ndissents reveal a pattern of far-reaching decisions to limit remedies \nfor workers, consumers, and victims of discrimination or personal \ninjury.\n  What is also very striking is the level of criticism of Justice \nOwen's opinions by her colleagues on the court, and efforts to explain \nthese criticisms away are unconvincing.\n  We all know judges are often critical of the reasoning of their \ncolleagues, and occasionally these opinions can be strongly worded. \nWhat stands out here are the frequent statements by her own colleagues \non the court that Justice Owen puts her own views above the law, even \nwhen the law is crystal clear--she does this repeatedly in cases \ninvolving the rights of plaintiffs, or of young women seeking to \nexercise their right to choose.\n  Take Alberto Gonzales, her former colleague on the court, who is now \nPresident Bush's counsel in the White House. In one of her cases \ninvolving the interpretation of Texas' parental notification statute, \nJustice Gonzales accused Justice Owen of ``an unconscionable act of \njudicial activism.'' In these parental notification cases, Justice Owen \nrepeatedly grafts barriers to restrict a young woman's right to choose. \nShe inserts new standards that are based on her own views and not on \nthe clear language of the statute.\n  At her hearing, Justice Owen and some of my Republican colleagues \nsuggested, for the first time, that Justice Gonzales was not referring \nto Justice Owen and the other dissenters when he accused Justice Owen \nof ``unconscionable activism''\n  That isn't credible. Justice Gonzales wrote a separate concurring \nopinion specifically to defend the majority's opinion and to dispute \nthe positions taken by the dissenters. He emphasized that the \nmajority's opinion was based on the language of the Parental \nNotification Act as written by the Texas Legislature, and said:\n\n       [O]ur role as judges requires that we put aside our own \n     personal views of what we might like to see enacted, and \n     instead do our best to discern what the legislature actually \n     intended.\n\n  Justice Gonzales went on to say that, contrary to the legislature's \nintent:\n\n       [T]he dissenting opinions suggest that the exceptions to \n     the general rule of notification should be very rare and \n     require a high standard of proof. I respectfully submit that \n     these are policy decisions for the Legislature.\n\n  It is this narrow construction of the statute, put forward by the \ndissenters that Justice Gonzales criticizes as unconscionable activism. \nIt is obvious--beyond any reasonable doubt--that Justice Gonzales is \nreferring to the opinions of the dissenters, including Justice Owen.\n  Similar criticisms of Justice Owen appear repeatedly in other \nopinions of the Texas court.\n  A striking example of the lengths Justice Owen will take to narrow \nremedies for plaintiffs is found not in a dissent, but in a disturbing \nconcurrence in a case called GTE v. Bruce.\n  In this case, three employees sued GTE for intentional infliction of \nemotional distress because of constant humiliating and abusive behavior \nof their supervisor. The supervisor harassed and intimated employees, \nincluding through daily use of profanity; screaming and cursing at \nemployees; charging at employees and physically threatening them; and \nhumiliating employees by, for instance, making an\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nemployee stand in front of him in his office for as long as 30 minutes \nwhile he stared at her. The employees suffered from severe emotional \ndistress, tension, nervousness, anxiety, depression, loss of appetite, \ninability to sleep, crying spells and uncontrollable emotional \noutbursts as a result of his behavior. They sought medical and \npsychological help because of their distress.\n  GTE argued that the employees could not pursue an intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress claim in court. They said that the \nemployees' remedies were limited to worker's compensation. Eight \njustices on the Texas court agreed that the Worker's Compensation Act \ndid not bar the plaintiffs' claims. These justices concluded that the \nactions of the supervisor when looked at as a whole were so extreme and \noutrageous as to support the jury's verdict of intentional infliction \nof emotional distress. Justice Owen, alone, wrote a separate opinion. \nWhile she agreed that there was more than a ``scintilla of evidence'' \nto support the jury's finding that the supervisor intentionally \ninflicted emotional distress on the plaintiffs, she declined to join \nthe court's opinion because ``most of the testimony that the court \nrecounts is legally insufficient to support the verdict.'' Justice Owen \nthen lists all the supervisor's behavior that is not a basis for \nsustaining a cause of action.\n\n  Justice Owen, alone among all the justices, felt the need to write \nseparately to adopt as narrow a construction as possible of a \nplaintiff's right to recover for a supervisor's outrageous and \nharassing conduct. Justice Owen argued at her hearing last July, and \nagain at her most recent hearing, that she wrote separately simply to \nmake clear that no plaintiff could recover for any one of these \nindividual actions standing alone. This is not, however, what Justice \nOwen's opinion says. Her opinion draws no such distinction. \nFurthermore, it is clear from the majority opinion that the standard is \nwhether the supervisor's actions ``taken as a whole'' are sufficient to \nsustain a claim. Not only is Justice Owen's opinion troubling, but her \nanswers to the concerns raised seem less than candid.\n  Justice Owen's record is particularly troubling given the range of \nimportant issues that come before the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit \nis one of the most racially diverse circuits, with a large number of \nLatinos and African-Americans. The States in the Fifth Circuit are also \namong the poorest. It is vital on this court in particular that a judge \nis fair to workers, victims of discrimination, and the personal injury \nvictims that come before the court. Those who contend that we oppose \nJustice Owen simply because she is a Republican appointee miss the \npoint. I oppose her because I believe she will put her own view above \nthe law in cases regarding the basic and fundamental rights on which \nall Americans have come to rely, including the right to privacy and \nequal protection under law.\n  Not long ago, the Fifth Circuit was hailed as a brave court for \nprotecting civil rights. When Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in \n1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965, many States and localities in \nthe South resisted these measures. Federal judges such as Elbert \nTuttle, Frank Johnson, and John Minor Wisdom, all Republican \nappointees, helped to make real the promise of legal equality that was \ncontained in these important Federal statutes. It is particularly \nimportant that a judge appointed to this Court show a commitment to \ncivil rights and to upholding constitutional safeguards for all \nAmericans. I do not believe that Justice Owen is in that proud \ntradition of independence and fairness.\n\n  Justice Owen's nomination has incited a great deal of opposition from \na broad range of citizens and groups in her home State of Texas. Those \nindividuals who have observed her on the Texas court, who have been \nharmed by her rulings, have written to us in droves opposing her \nappointment to the Fifth Circuit. These include the Gray Panthers of \nTexas, the National Council of Jewish Women of Texas, the Texas AFL-\nCIO, the Texas Civil Rights Project, and the Texas Chapter of the \nNational Organization for Women. At least 20 attorneys who practice in \nTexas have written expressing their opposition. A broad range of \nenvironmental groups also oppose her nomination.\n  The issues at stake with Justice Owen's nomination go beyond partisan \ngames. This debate is about lifetime appointments of courts that decide \ncases that shape the lives of all American people. Our Federal courts \nhave made real the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution \nand by Federal laws. Federal courts are the backbone of our pluralistic \ndemocracy, helping to ensure that black children have the same access \nto education as white children, that a disabled woman has the \nappropriate workplace accommodation so that she can help provide for \nher family, and that our children can breathe clean air and drink clean \nwater in their communities. Because the Supreme Court takes less than \n100 cases, many of the cases most important to Americans are decided by \nlower court judges.\n  The basic values of our society--whether we will continue to be \ncommitted to equality, freedom of expression, and the right to \nprivacy--are at issue in each of these controversial nominations. If \nthe administration continues to nominate judges who would weaken the \ncore values of our country and roll back the laws that have made our \ncountry a more inclusive democracy, the Senate should reject them.\n  No President has the unilateral right to remake the judiciary in his \nown image. The Constitution requires the Senate's advice and consent on \njudicial nominations. It is clear that our duty is to be more than to \nrubber-stamp.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against Priscilla Owen's nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier today Senator Hatch asked \nconsent for a time certain for a vote on the pending Owen nomination. \nThere was an objection from the other side of the aisle.\n  I make further inquiry of the assistant Democratic leader if there is \nstill an objection to limiting debate on this nomination. I yield to \nhim for a response.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say through you to the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky, I don't think we can work out any time \nagreement. I have said so publicly. There have been a number of \nstatements on the floor today. As I told Senator Hatch, there simply \nwould be no time agreement ever on Priscilla Owen.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today we spent a good deal of time \ndebating the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen. Prior to today, we \ndebated her nomination for 2 other days, so for 3 days of valuable \nlegislative time our colleagues have had the opportunity to come to the \nfloor and debate. We intend to continue this debate for another 2 days. \nBut the debate must come to a reasonable end, so I am filing a cloture \nmotion this evening so we can vote to close debate later this week.\n  I think we will be ready to vote. After all, Justice Owen was \nnominated by the President 2 years ago next week. She has had two \nhearings before the Judiciary Committee, over 30 editorials have been \nwritten about her nomination, and nearly all in support of her \nconfirmation, including the Washington Post on three--three--separate \noccasions. There have been countless op-eds and news articles.\n  Senator Schumer asked earlier today if we on this side of the aisle \nexpected the Senate to be a rubberstamp for the President's \nnominations. The answer, of course, is we do not. We do expect the \nSenate to do what the Constitution contemplates, and that is to vote; \nto vote yes or no but to vote.\n  We also expect the Senate to do the right thing by the Constitution, \nby this nominee, and by the President of the United States who \nnominated her.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk a cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion having been presented under rule \nXXII, the Chair directs the clerk to report the cloture motion.\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the standing rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 86, the nomination of Priscilla R.

Mr. President, with the dramatic and precipitous fall \nof many Iraqi cities, including Baghdad, the military conflict in Iraq \nis all but officially over.\n  Isolated pockets of resistance still exist and there is the looming \nthreat of suicide bombings, as happened last Friday at an ammunitions \ndepot. But we can now proclaim that the barbarous regime of Saddam \nHussein and his Ba'ath Party has finally come to an end.\n  As the military aspect subsides, the number of casualties--United \nStates, coalition, and Iraqi--is also diminishing. And this, clearly, \nis wonderful news. Still, regrettably, there have been those over the \nlast few weeks who have made the ultimate sacrifice, some of them with \nclose ties to California. I would like to take a moment to honor these \nbrave and selfless individuals.\n  Marine Cpl Jesus Medellin: On April 7, 21-year-old Jesus ``Marty'' \nMedellin was killed when an enemy artillery shell struck his vehicle. \nThe second of four boys from a very close family from Fort Worth, TX, \nMedellin was remembered as a warm and relaxed family man who was active \nin local church.\n  As soon as he graduated from W.E. Boswell High School, in the year \n2000, he went straight to Marine boot camp, having decided to do so \nwhen only 12 years old. ``There's no prouder way of losing someone than \nthrough serving their country,'' said his father, Freddy Medellin, Sr., \nwho was prevented from joining the military because of physical \nproblems.\n  As part of the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, First Marine \nDivision, based in Camp Pendleton, CA, Cpl Jesus Medellin died doing \nwhat he had always dreamed of doing. Americans everywhere should be as \nproud of him as his family.\n  Marine Sgt Duane Rios: Remembered as a gentle giant, as a light-\nhearted person with an infectious laugh, 6-foot-3-inch Duane Rios was \nkilled in combat on the outskirts of Baghdad, on Friday, April 4. He \nwas a squad leader for the 1st Combat Engineer Battalion of the 1st \nMarine Division, from Camp Pendleton, CA.\n  Raised in Indiana by his grandmother, Rios graduated from Griffith \nHigh School in 1996. It was there that he met his future bride, Erica, \nwho, upon hearing of her husband's death, told the San Diego Union \nTribune that ``there's no way he'd leave me behind knowing I couldn't \ntake it. . . . He was a great guy, none better. . . . He did his job \nwith pride because it was something that he felt was right.''\n  She recalled how much they loved the view of the ocean at San \nClemente, walking their dog on the beach, and watching the sunset. Her \nstrength, along with her husband's sacrifice, should serve as an \ninspiration to us all.\n  Marine 1stSgt Edward C. Smith: A 38-year-old native of Chicago, Sgt \nEdward Smith had served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 20 years, and had \nserved for 4 years as a reserve officer for the police department of \nAnaheim, CA. His hope was to retire from the Marines and become a full-\ntime police officer. He died in Qatar, of combat injuries sustained in \ncentral Iraq, on April 5.\n  A veteran of Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield, Sergeant \nSmith received many commendations, including the Navy Commendation \nMedal and two Navy Achievement Medals\n  After graduating from the Palomar Police Academy with the ``Top Cop'' \naward, Sergeant Smith went on to receive such honors as the Rookie of \nthe Year for the Anaheim Police Department and the Orange County \nReserve Police Officer of the Year in 2001.\n  His coworkers in Anaheim remember Edward as a gentleman and a \nprofessional. He would send them e-mails and makeshift postcards made \nfrom empty MRE containers--one which promised that he would wear his \nSWAP cap into Baghdad.\n  Sergeant Smith leaves behind his wife Sandy and three young children, \nNathan, Ryan, and Shelby. At a news conference held at the Anaheim \npolice department, Ryan, an extraordinarily mature 10-year-old, talked \nabout how their father was always there when they needed help.\n  ``It made me feel so good,'' the boy said. ``He was the best dad you \ncould ever have. I miss him a lot.''\n  Police Sgt. Rick Martinez, one of 100 colleagues who turned out to \nsupport the Smith family, noted that ``we all fell in love with his \nchildren. Edward's got to be so proud right now.''\n  And so America is so very proud of Sergeant Smith. Army Pvt. Devon D. \nJones: Army Pvt. Devon Jones left for boot camp just a few weeks after \ngraduating from Lincoln High School, in San Diego, last June. He was \njust 19 years old.\n  It was only 3 years earlier that, after moving from one San Diego \ngroup home to another, the artillery specialist found a foster mother \nwho he called mom.\n  ``I'm honored to talk about him,'' his foster mother Evelyn Houston \nsaid. ``He was a strong spirit. He was cool, but compassionate, and \nalways concerned about everyone's well-being.''\n  He joined the military in order to pay for his education--his goal \nwas to be a writer and a teacher.\n  In a letter he sent to his family last month, Private Jones described \nhis life in the desert. ``Sometimes I just look into the sky at the \nstars and wonder what you all are doing, and smile.\n  ``Hold on, be patient,'' he concluded, ``and know there is a reason \nfor everything.''\n  GySgt. Jeffrey Bohr: 39-year-old Marine GySgt. Jeffrey Bohr, who was \nkilled in downtown Baghdad during a 7-hour shootout outside a mosque, \nhad been in the military his entire adult life. He joined the Army \nfresh of high school in Iowa, where he rode horses and played football, \nbut switched to the Marine Corps 5 years later.\n  A large, broad-shouldered man known for his boundless energy--he \ncould run all day with the younger Marines he commanded--Sergeant Bohr \nwas also quiet and down-to-earth.\n  He lived with his wife Lori in San Clemente, CA, and loved reading \nhistory and John Grisham novels and taking his two boxers, Tank and Sea \nCzar, on 10-mile runs. He was also a diehard Oakland Raiders fan.\n  The last time Sergeant Bohr called Lori was a little over a month \nago--he spoke of sandstorms and his belief that they would make good \nparents.\n  Lori's brother, Craig Clover, called Sergeant Bohr ``a stand-up guy--\ndo it by the rules. For a friend or family, he'd do anything . . . and \nhe loved the military.''\n  Marine LCpl Donald Cline Jr.: The same was true with 21 year-old LCpl \nDonald Cline, Jr., who was listed as missing in action just over 1 \nmonth ago, yet the Department of Defense confirmed last week that he \nhad died in combat outside the city of Nasiriyah, in southern Iraq.\n  Born in Sierra Madre, CA, Corporal Cline moved to the town of La \nCrescenta, where he attended the public schools there until moving to \nSparks, NV. It was there that he met his future wife Tina. They had two \nchildren together Dakota, 2, and Dylan, who is only 7 months old.\n  Sgt Troy Jenkins: On April 19, in an extraordinary act of heroic \nselflessness and sacrifice, 25-year-old Sgt Troy Jenkins threw himself \non a cluster bomb just before it detonated. As a result, he saved the \nlives not only of several soldiers in his regiment--the 187th \nInfantry--but of a 7-year-old Iraqi girl.\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\n  Raised by his father in Evergreen, AL, Sergeant Jenkins loved roaming \nthe woods, fishing, and music. He joined the Marines just before \ngraduating from high school, in 1995, and later transferred to the \nArmy. He also served in Afghanistan and was planning to leave the \nservice this summer, with the hopes of joining the California Highway \nPatrol.\n  His reason for wanting to leave the military was so that his wife \nAmanda and their two children, ages 4 and 2, wouldn't be alone again. \nAmanda was not surprised by the circumstances of his death. ``He didn't \nhave a selfish bone in his body,'' she said. ``He was always thinking \nof other people first.''\n  That was demonstrated, well beyond the call of duty, when he \nwillingly gave his own life to save those of his fellow soldiers and a \nlittle girl.\n  1LT Osbaldo Orozco: 1LT Osbaldo Orozco, just 26 years old, was killed \nin Tikrit, Iraq, when his Bradley tank, rushing to defend a checkpoint \nunder fire, flipped over as it moved into a position to return fire.\n  Strong, tall and fast, Lieutenant Orozco was a star football player, \nboth at Delano High School, in Delano, CA, and later at California \nPolytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. At college, he was voted \n``Linebacker of the Year,'' was named as a Division II All-American, \nand racked up over 300 tackles. He gave up the opportunity to go pro by \nchoosing to enter the Army.\n  He married his high school sweetheart Mayra in 2001. ``He commanded \nfour Bradleys and he loved it,'' she said. ``He was ready to go and do \nhis job. They all were.''\n  Lieutenant Orozco is also survived by his parents, Jorge and Reyes \nOrozco, and five brothers, all over 6 feet tall. Together, they spoke \nwith great pride of Osbaldo's many accomplishments--academic and \nathletic--and those special leadership qualities that so endeared him \nto the men he commanded.\n  SFC John W. Marshall: SFC John Winston Marshall was a 30-year veteran \nof the U.S. Army--a career soldier to the core. He grew up in Los \nAngeles and kept close family ties in the area. His parents, Odessa and \nJoseph, live in Sacramento.\n  It is worth noting that both his parents served in World War II, in \nmany ways as trailblazers for African Americans in the armed services. \nHis mother served as a nurse in England and his father as a \nquartermaster.\n  Because of his 30 years of distinguished service, Sergeant Marshall \nwas eligible to leave the Armed Forces with full retirement benefits \nand had, in fact, planned to retire last year. Yet he decided to stay \nbecause of looming hostilities in Iraq. He was struck and mortally \nwounded by rocket-propelled grenade launched in an ambush by Iraqi \ntroops.\n  Born in St. Louis, he moved with his family to Los Angeles when he \nwas only 3. An accomplished flute player and a self-taught mechanic who \nmade motor scooters out of lawnmower engines, Sergeant Marshall \ngraduated from Washington High School in 1972 and enlisted in the Army.\n  He went on to serve during the Vietnam war, in South Korea and \nGermany, and he was a veteran of Operation Desert Storm. At the time of \nhis death, he was commanding a platoon of 40 men from the 3rd Infantry \nDivision, based at Fort Stewart, GA.\n  According to his mother Odessa, ``He wasn't there to pass the time; \nhe was there to do a job.''\n  His wife Denise told the Los Angeles Times: ``He knew it was \ndangerous. He didn't run from anything.''\n  And we should also remember that 50-year-old Sergeant Marshall was as \ndevoted to his family as he was to his country. He leaves behind two \nsons and a daughter, ages 12, 13, and 14.\n  In one of the last e-mails he sent to his family, he noted: ``I am \nnot a politician or policy maker, just an old soldier.''\n  Well, we politicians and policymakers must not forget any of these \nheroes, regardless of their age, rank, religion, sex, or ethnic \nbackground. Together, they embody the diversity and consummate \nprofessionalism of America's Armed Forces.\n  We all hope and pray for the time when there will be no more casualty \nlists--when there will no longer be a need to recount stories of \ncourageous men and women who willingly sacrificed their own lives, and \nirrevocably changed the lives of their families, their spouses, and \nchildren, in order to overthrow Saddam Hussein and liberate the people \nof Iraq.\n  Clearly, this conflict was a signal military success, and the \ncasualties were kept relatively small. I could not be prouder of the \nstellar performance of our Armed Forces.\n  But we must never forget to honor every single loss, to pay our \ndeepest respects and offer our deepest sympathies to those left behind, \nto those whose worlds have been so completely changed--and changed \nforever.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we pray for all those who are in harm's \nway, I rise to pay tribute to seven additional young Americans who were \nkilled in the Iraqi war.\n  I have made it a priority of mine to come to the Senate Chamber to \nread the names of the fallen military personnel who were from \nCalifornia or were based in my State. So far, 41 individuals have died \nwho are connected in some way to California.\n  GySgt Jeffrey Edward Bohr, age 39, was killed on April 10 during a \nshoot-out in downtown Baghdad. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, \n5th Regiment, Alpha Company of Camp Pendleton, CA. He and his wife \nlived in San Clemente, CA. He was originally from northeast Iowa. He \nbegan his military career 20 years ago, serving in both the Army and \nthe Marine Corps. During his career, he fought in Operation Desert \nStorm, and took part in operations in Panama, Somalia and Granada.\n  Cpl Jesus Gonzalez, age 22, was killed on April 12 in Baghdad. He was \nassigned to the 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division, Twentynine \nPalms, CA. He was born in Mexico and moved with his family to Indio, \nCA, 10 years ago. He was known as ``Hugo'' by his friends and family. \nHe was a soft-spoken activist in his short life, marching in a Gulf War \nprotest in 1992 and organizing a walk-out at his high school to support \nimmigrant rights. However, when he was called to duty, he did not \nhesitate to fulfill his orders. He is survived by his wife, his 2-year-\nold daughter, and his parents.\n  SSgt Riayan A. Tejada, age 26, was killed on April 11 during combat \noperations in northeast Baghdad. He was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, \n5th Marine Regiment, Camp Pendleton, CA. He was from New York City. He \nmoved from the Dominican Republic to the United States in 1989. After \ngraduating from high school, he enlisted in the Marines. He is survived \nby his parents and two children.\n  LCpl David Edward Owens, Jr., age 20, died from a chest wound \ninflicted during combat on April 12 in Baghdad. He was assigned to the \n3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Camp \nPendleton, CA. He was from Winchester, VA. He graduated from James Wood \nHigh School in 2000. He loved hunting and athletics and was a wrestler \nand football player in high school. He joined the Marines with the \nlong-term goal of a career in law enforcement. At his funeral service, \nhe became the first person ever given an honorary appointment to the \nVirginia State Police. He is survived by his parents.\n  Cpl Jason David Mileo, age 20, was killed on April 14 in Iraq. He was \nassigned to the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine \nDivision, Twentynine Palms, CA. He was from Centreville, MD. He was a \n2000 graduate of Chesapeake High School in Pasadena, MD. He is survived \nby his parents.\n  Army SGT Troy David Jenkins, age 25, died on Friday, April 24, from \ninjuries sustained during combat. He was from Ridgecrest, CA. He was \nassigned to the B Company, 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, Fort \nCampbell, KY.\n  Army 1LT Osbaldo Orozco, age 26, was killed in Iraq on April 25. He \nwas from Delano, CA. He was assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 22nd \nInfantry Regiment, Fort Hood, TX. He was a star football player at \nDelano High School and later played football at Cal Poly San Luis \nObispo, where he attended on a full athletic scholarship. He was a \ncaptain for the Mustangs in 1999 and was named the team's Most \nInspirational Player. He was commissioned as an Army officer in 2001. \nHe was the second oldest of five sons of Mexican immigrants and the \nfirst in his family to graduate from college.\n  Forty-one individuals who were from California or based in California \nhave\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\ndied in the war. The people of California, as well as all Americans, \nmourn their loss.\n  May these beautiful young Americans rest in peace.\n  I continue to pray for those who have been injured in the war. I hope \nthat they and the rest of our brave young men and women serving abroad \nwill return home safely.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow \nIowan and a great American. It is with a sense of sadness but also \npride that I must call to the attention of the Senate the sacrifice of \nMarine GySgt. Jeff Bohr of Ossian, IA, who was killed April 10, 2003, \nwhile participating in the liberation of Baghdad. Jeff Bohr is the \nsecond Iowan to have died in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and hopefully the \nlast. Jeff Bohr served his country in the military for 20 years and had \nno reservations about putting his life on the line to protect American \nfreedom and to give freedom to the Iraqi people. His loss will be felt \nthroughout Iowa, and particularly in his hometown of Ossian. My \nthoughts and prayers are with Jeff's wife Lori as well as his father \nEddie and mother Jeanette, his brothers, and all his family and \nfriends. As they mourn his loss, they can know that they are not alone. \nMany people in Iowa and across the country share their grief and \nreflect on the life of Jeff Bohr, whether they knew him or not. At the \nsame time, Jeff's family can be very proud of his service to his \ncountry. Jeff Bohr's sense of patriotic duty is a source of inspiration \nto us all, and his sacrifice will not be forgotten. He paid the \nultimate price for our freedom and security. Words can scarcely convey \nthe debt of gratitude that we all owe Jeff Bohr, but I want to take \nthis opportunity to express my deepest respect and admiration for Jeff \nand what he did for America. Although his loss is tragic, Jeff Bohr \ndied fighting for his country and he died a true patriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5474-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5474-S5475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE ACCESSION OF CYPRUS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Republic of \nCyprus on its April 16 signing of an accession agreement with the \nEuropean Union, and also to bemoan the failure to reach an agreement to \nend the nearly three-decade-old division of the island.\n  The achievement of accession to the European Union marks the last \nphase of a 30-year enterprise by the Government and people of the \nRepublic of Cyprus, which began with an Association Agreement in 1973 \nand will culminate in May 2004 with full membership.\n  Celebration of this historic success, however, is tempered by the \nabsence of a settlement that would have allowed the island as a whole \nto join the EU. The failure of the parties to reach an agreement \nthrough the United Nations process was both regrettable and avoidable.\n  Although the Cyprus problem has been on the United Nations agenda for \nalmost 40 years, it was the Clinton administration's decision in 1999 \nto make finding a solution in Cyprus a high priority that brought the \ntwo sides of the island back to proximity talks under the good offices \nof the United Nations Secretary General.\n  Since 1999, Secretary General Kofi Annan and his special \nrepresentative Alvaro de Soto have engaged interested parties in an \nintensive peace effort with international support, including that of \nU.S. Special Coordinator for Cyprus Ambassador Tom Weston. They worked \nfeverishly with leaders in Nicosia, Athens, Ankara, and Brussels to try \nto persuade the parties to agree to a draft plan prior to the European \nUnion summit in Copenhagen last December, at which the EU invited \nCyprus and nine other countries to join the Union. While that effort \ndid not produce an equitable end to the tragic division of Cyprus, it \ndid produce a realistic framework and concrete text on which to \ncontinue discussions to resolve the remaining issues.\n  After years of frustration and disappointment, the people of Cyprus \nsaw a fragile but real possibility for settlement, and the overwhelming \nmajority of the population in both communities embraced the process.\n  In the first months of 2003, with the clock running out to reach an \nagreement before the date for Cyprus to sign the EU accession \nagreement, the UN Secretary General asked Tassos Papadopoulos, the \nnewly-elected President of the Republic of Cyprus, and Turkish Cypriot \nleader Rauf Denktash to submit the plan to a public referendum. On \nMarch 10, Mr. Papadopoulos in good faith conditionally agreed to do so. \nMr. Denktash refused.\n  In response, tens of thousands of Turkish Cypriots took to the \nstreets to express their support for the UN plan and to entreat Mr. \nDenktash to participate in the process. But Mr. Denktash did not \nrespond to these calls from the citizens whom he nominally represents. \nIn denying his own people a democratic vote, he bears the primary \nresponsibility for quashing the peace talks.\n  Since then, Mr. Denktash has chosen to discredit the UN process \nthough overheated rhetoric, calling the UN plan ``full of tricks'' and \nalleging that it did not take into account the non-negotiable \nrequirements and ``realities'' of the Turkish Cypriot people. He did \nfor the first time allow day-visits across the ``Green Line'' that \ndivides the island, but this welcome conciliatory gesture appears to be \nmore of a diversionary tactic than a return to the negotiating table.\n  The Turkish Cypriots do have genuine concerns about their status and \nsecurity, and these concerns must be reflected in any settlement \ndecision. The Greek Cypriots need to acknowledge that before 1974 there \nwas a Cyprus Problem and that members of both communities committed \nunpardonable violence and murder. Similarly, the Turkish Cypriots need \nto acknowledge that there has been a Cyprus Problem ever since the \nTurkish invasion of 1974, with mass human suffering. Both sides must \nrecognize that this is 2003, not 1974 or 1964, and that only a reunited \nCyprus as a member of the European Union would have ironclad, \ninternational security guarantees for all its citizens.\n  Yet Mr. Denktash seems incapable of seizing the moment by recognizing \nthat a negotiated settlement requires compromise. As Secretary General \nAnnan stated in his report to the UN Security Council, however, \n``except for a very few instances, Mr. Denktash by and large declined \nto engage in negotiation on the basis of give and take,'' thereby \ncomplicating efforts ``to accommodate not only the legitimate concerns \nof principle, but also the concrete and practical interests of the \nTurkish Cypriots.''\n  The window for achieving a settlement is not closed. Secretary \nGeneral Annan's plan remains on the table as a basis for negotiation. \nThe European Union has affirmed that there is a place in the EU for \nTurkish Cypriots. Upon the signing of the accession treaty, Cypriot \nPresident Papadopoulos restated his commitment to working toward a \nsettlement. Greek Prime Minister and EU Council Term President Simitis \ninvited Mr. Denktash and other Turkish Cypriot political leaders to \nNicosia to continue discussions toward a settlement, an invitation \nwhich Mr. Denktash to date has rejected. Turkish Prime Minister \nErdogan, with an eye toward his own country's future EU membership once \nAnkara has met the Copenhagen criteria, endorsed on April 17 the \ncontinuation of talks based on the UN plan. I hope that Prime Minister \nErdogan, Foreign Minister Gul, and other distinguished leaders in \nTurkey will prevail on Mr. Denktash to do what is right for all in the \nregion.\n  EU leaders at the April 16 accession ceremony in Athens declared that \nthe expanded EU represents a ``common determination to put an end to \ncenturies of conflict and transcend former divisions.'' The people in \nnorthern Cyprus should not be barred from ``the closer ties of \nneighborhood'' described by European Commission President Prodi. Nor \nshould they be excluded from the opportunity, now extended to their \nfellow-citizens in the south, to join the world's most powerful \neconomic association.\n  A lasting settlement would allow the Turkish Cypriot people to emerge \nfrom their isolation and become fully a part of Europe. It would bring \nopportunities for economic growth, for expanded trade, for travel and \nfor broader educational and cross-cultural exchanges. And it would end \nthe second-class citizenship of the Turkish Cypriot people in which \ntheir standard of living is at best one-third that of the people in the \nsouth.\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\n  If Mr. Denktash does indeed have the interests of the people of \nnorthern Cyprus at heart, he should step aside and allow the Turkish \nCypriot people to choose their own future. There is too much at stake \nto allow another opportunity to expire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5475-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE TROUBLED MEDIA ENVIRONMENT IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, later this week individuals around the \nworld will mark World Press Freedom Day. The functioning of free and \nindependent media is tied closely to the exercise of many other \nfundamental freedoms as well as to the future of any democratic \nsociety. The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which I \nco-chair, is responsible for monitoring press freedom in the 55 \nparticipating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, OSCE. Recently, I reported to the Senate on the deplorable \nconditions for independent media in the Republic of Belarus. Today, I \nwill address the situation of journalists and media outlets in Ukraine.\n  Several discouraging reports have come out recently concerning the \nmedic environment in Ukraine. These reports merit attention, especially \nwithin the context of critical presidential elections scheduled to take \nplace in Ukraine next year. The State Department's Country Reports on \nHuman Rights Practices in Ukraine for 2002 summarizes media freedoms as \nfollows: ``Authorities interfered with the news media by intimidating \njournalists, issuing written and oral instructions about events to \ncover and not to cover, and pressuring them into applying self-\ncensorship. Nevertheless a wide range of opinion was available in \nnewspapers, periodicals, and Internet news sources.''\n  Current negative trends and restrictive practices with respect to \nmedia freedom in Ukraine are sources of concern, especially given that \ncountry's leadership claims concerning integration into the Euro-\nAtlantic community. Lack of compliance with international human rights \nstandards, including OSCE commitments, on freedom of expression \nundermines that process. Moreover, an independent media free from \ngovernmental pressure is an essential factor in ensuring a level \nplaying field in the upcoming 2004 presidential elections in Ukraine.\n  In her April 18, 2003 annual report to the Ukrainian parliament, \nOmbudsman Nina Karpachova asserted that journalism remains among the \nmost dangerous professions in Ukraine, with 36 media employees having \nbeen killed over the past ten years, while beatings, intimidation of \nmedia employees, freezing of bank accounts of media outlets, and \nconfiscation of entire print runs of newspapers and other publications \nhave become commonplace in Ukraine.\n  The murder of prominent journalist Heorhiy Gongadze--who disappeared \nin September 2000--remains unsolved. Ukrainian President Kuchma and a \nnumber of high-ranking officials have been implicated in his \ndisappearance and the circumstances leading to his murder. The \nUkrainian authorities' handling, or more accurately mishandling of this \ncase, has been characterized by obfuscation and stonewalling. Not \nsurprisingly, lack of transparency illustrated by the Gongadze case has \nfueled the debilitating problem of widespread corruption reaching the \nhighest levels of the Government of Ukraine.\n  Audio recordings exist that contain conversations between Kuchma and \nother senior government officials discussing the desirability of \nGongadze's elimination. Some of these have been passed to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice as part of a larger set of recordings of Kuchma's \nconversations implicating him and his cronies in numerous scandals. \nTogether with Commission Co-Chairman Rep. Chris Smith, I recently wrote \nto the Department of Justice requesting technical assistance to \ndetermine whether the recordings in which the Gongadze matter is \ndiscussed are genuine. A credible and transparent investigation of this \ncase by Ukrainian authorities is long overdue and the prepetrators--no \nmatter who they may be--need to be brought to justice.\n\n  The case of Ihor Alexandrov, a director of a regional television \nstation, who was beaten in July 2001 and subsequently died also remains \nunsolved. Serious questions remain about the way in which that case was \nhandled by the authorities.\n  A Human Rights Watch report, Negotiating the News: Informal State \nCensorship of Ukrainian Television, issued in March, details the use of \nexplicit directives or temnyky, lists of topics, which have been sent \nto editors from Kuchma's Presidential Administration on what subjects \nto cover and in what manner. The report correctly notes that these \ntemnyky have eroded freedom of expression in Ukraine, as ``editors and \njournalists feel obligated to comply with temnyky instructions due to \neconomic and political pressures and fear repercussions for non-\ncooperation.'' To their credit, the independent media are struggling to \ncounter attempts by the central authorities to control their reporting \nand coverage of issues and events.\n  Another troubling feature of the media environment has been the \ncontrol exerted by various oligarchs with close links to the government \nwho own major media outlets. There is growing evidence that backers of \nthe current Prime Minister and other political figures have been buying \nout previously independent news sources, including websites, and either \nfiring reporters or telling them to cease criticism of the government \nof find new jobs.\n  Last December, Ukraine's parliament held hearings on ``Society, Mass \nMedia, Authority: Freedom of Speech and Censorship in Ukraine.'' \nJournalists' testimony confirmed the existence of censorship, including \ntemnyky, as well as various instruments of harassment and intimidation. \nTax inspections, various legal actions or license withdrawals have all \nbeen used as mechanisms by the authorities to pressure media outlets \nthat have not towed the line or have supported opposition parties.\n  As a result of these hearings, the parliament, on April 3rd, voted \n252 to one to approve a law defining and banning state censorship in \nthe Ukrainian media. This is a welcome step. However, given the power \nof the presidential administration, the law's implementation remains an \nopen question at best, particularly in the lead up to the 2004 \nelections in Ukraine.\n  I urge our Ukrainian parliamentary colleagues to continue to actively \npress their government to comply with Ukraine's commitments to \nfundamental freedoms freely agreed to as a signatory to the Helsinki \nFinal Act. I also urge the Ukrainian authorities, including the \nconstitutional ``guarantor'', to end their campaign to stifle \nindependent reporting and viewpoints in the media. Good news from \nUkraine will come not from the spin doctors of the presidential \nadministration, but when independent media and journalists can pursue \ntheir responsibilities free of harassment, intimidation, and fear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5475-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5475-S5476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I rise to talk about Child Abuse \nPrevention Month. Child Abuse Prevention Month was established 20 years \nago by Presidential proclamation and since then, this month has been \ndevoted to raising awareness about this tragic problem.\n  This year holds particular sadness for those of us from New Jersey. \nThis past January, 7-year-old Faheem Williams was found dead in a \nNewark, NJ, basement where he and his two brothers had been imprisoned \nfor weeks. He had been starved and beaten. With Faheem were his twin, \nRaheem, and 4-year-old brother Tyrone, both of whom were found to be \nmalnourished and dehydrated. All of this occurred under the supervision \nof the State agency that placed these three boys in foster care.\n  His death marks a tragic failure on the part of our State and \ncountry, as do the deaths of thousands of children each year. Mr. \nPresident, I was at Faheem's funeral. That day I said that it didn't \nmatter whether his death was due to neglect or direct abuse. We cannot \npermit another child to go through this ever again.\n  Across the country last year, 879,000 children were victims of child \nabuse and neglect, of whom approximately 1,200 died from maltreatment. \nAccording to the national organization, Prevent Child Abuse America, \nthree children die every day from abuse or neglect at the hands of \nthose who are supposed to care for them. I don't need\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\nto say that one is too many. Most disturbingly, confirmed reports of \nchild abuse and neglect rose 3 percent in the last year nationwide. \nThis is the second straight year child abuse has increased.\n  There is no doubt that child abuse and neglect continues to be a \nsignificant problem in the United States. Our children are our future, \nbut their health and safety in our society continues to decline. Every \none of us has a responsibility to work for the welfare of the Nation's \nchildren.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services runs a National \nClearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information, providing \nresearch and resources for prevention to individuals and communities. \nMany nonprofit organizations, State agencies, individual social \nworkers, counselors, teachers, and clergy work tirelessly to determine \nwhen children are in danger.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity today to pay \ntribute to a very distinguished servant of the legislative branch of \nthe Congress. In May 2003, Dr. John Hardt will end his official service \nwith the Congressional Research service after 32 years as a valuable \nresource to Congress in the field of international economics and \nforeign affairs. In many ways, Dr. Hardt's retirement symbolizes the \nending of an era for the Congress; he is the only remaining CRS Senior \nSpecialist now providing Congress with research and analysis in the \nfield of foreign affairs. He has been a great asset to the Congress and \nto CRS throughout his long career in public service.\n  Dr. Hardt received both his Ph.D. in economics and a Certificate from \nthe Russian institute from Columbia University. Prior to joining the \nCongressional Research Service, he had already had the kind of \nillustrious career that serves as a lifetime achievement for many \nothers. He served his country with distinction during World War II, \nreceiving ribbons and battle stars for both the European and Asiatic \nTheaters of Operations as well as the Philippine Liberation Ribbon. He \nhas been an educator--specializing in economics, Soviet studies, and \nSino-Soviet studies--at the University of Washington, the University of \nMaryland, Johns Hopkins University, the George Washington University, \nthe Foreign Service Institute, and American military service schools. \nHe has served in the American private sector, specializing in Soviet \nelectric power and nuclear energy economics for the CEIR Corporation in \nWashington, DC, and as a director of the Strategic Studies Department \nat the Research Analysis Corporation in McLean, VA, where he \nspecialized in Soviet Comparative Communist and Japanese Studies. He is \na widely published author, with hundreds of research papers, journal \narticles, technical memoranda, and books and book chapters to his \ncredit.\n  Dr. Hardt joined the Congressional Research Service as the Senior \nSpecialist in Soviet Economics in November of 1971. It is his work for \nCRS--and for us, the Members of this body--that I want to honor today. \nFor the past three decades, Dr. Hardt has served Members of Congress, \ntheir staffs, and committees with his considerable expertise in Soviet \nand post-Soviet and Eastern Europe economics, the economy of the \nPeople's Republic of China, East-West commercial relations, and \ncomparative international economic analysis. He has advised, among \nothers, both the Senate and House Commerce Committees on East-West \ntrade; the senate and House Banking Committees on the Export-Import \nBank and other U.S. government financing programs; and the Senate \nFinance and House Ways and Means Committees on U.S. trade policy. He \nfrequently has traveled with congressional committee delegations, \nserving as a technical adviser on visits to the former Soviet Union, \nPoland, Hungary, the former Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom, the Federal \nRepublic of Germany, Italy, and Sweden, and then preparing committee \nreports for these trips. On many occasions, Dr. Hardt has been called \non to advise directly Members of Congress and congressional staff on \nRussian Federation debt reduction and its relationship to \nnonproliferation concerns, and has provided support to the Russian \nLeadership Program, especially those events and activities that \ninvolved Members of Congress. The extent of his national and \ninternational contacts is breathtaking and includes senior members of \nforeign governments and leading multinational businesses.\n  His most lasting legacy for Congress may well be his service as both \neditor and coordinator of a long series of Joint Economic Committee \ncompendia on the economies of the PRC, Soviet Union, and Eastern \nEurope. The Congress can take pride in these important, well-known, and \nhighly respected JEC studies, to which Dr. Hardt devoted so much of his \ntalent and energies. The more than 70 volumes of this work include: \nChina Under the Four Modernizations, 1982; China's Economy Looks Toward \nthe Year 2000, 1986; The Former Soviet Union in Transition, 1993; East-\nCentral European Economies in Transition, 1994; and Russia's Uncertain \nEconomic Future, 2001. The series includes hundreds of analytical \npapers on various aspects of issues pertinent to Congress and to U.S. \npolicy, all written by internationally recognized government, academic, \nand Private sector experts, and all coordinated and edited by Dr. \nHardt. This work was not only a valuable source of analysis to the \nCongress but also to the policymaking and academic communities at \nlarge. For many years, these volumes were the most comprehensive \nsources of economic data and analyses on the economies of the Soviet \nUnion, China, and Easter Europe.\n  Let me make one final point to illustrate the loss that we, as \nMembers of Congress, will sustain with Dr. Hardt's retirement. That \npoint concerns one of the great strengths that CRS offers to Congress, \nand which Dr. Hardt's tenure and contributions at CRS epitomize \nperfectly: institutional memory. Of the 525 Members of the 108th \nCongress, only 11 were Members of the 92nd Congress when Dr. Hardt \nfirst assumed his official congressional duties. Most of the countries \nthat he has specialized in have undergone astounding transformation \nduring his working life--some, indeed, no longer exist. The members of \nthis deliberative body in which we serve has turned over many times. \nCommittees have come and gone. But through it all, John Hardt has been \na constant fixture, a strand of continuity in an environment of \ncontinual change--part of the collective institutional memory of CRS \nwhich is of such value to our work in Congress. We wish Dr. Hardt well \nin the new ventures on which he will be embarking. He will be greatly \nmissed by us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5476-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         CAPTAIN PENN HOLSAPPLE\n\n Mr. BURNS.

JAMES F. JOHNSON\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDr. James F. Johnson, an outstanding public servant, who is retiring \nfrom the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after an exemplary career \nspanning more than three decades. I want to extend my personal \ncongratulations and thanks for his many years of service and \ncontributions to improving both the water resources of our Nation and \nthe quality of Federal Government services.\n  Throughout his 32-year career with the Federal Government, Dr. \nJohnson has distinguished himself for his leadership, commitment, and \ndedication to public service, to making government work better, and to \naddressing some of our Nation's most critical water resource problems. \nBeginning in Corps of Engineers Headquarters as a program manager, he \nquickly advanced through the ranks to positions in senior management, \nincluding service as Chief of the Eastern Planning Management Branch, \nSpecial Assistant to the Chief of Planning, and Acting Assistant \nDirector of Civil Works for the Upper Mississippi and Great Lakes \nregion.\n  I first came to know Jim when he was selected as Chief of the \nPlanning and Policy Division at the Baltimore District in 1985. During \nhis 13-year tenure in Baltimore, I had the opportunity to work closely \nwith him and his planning team on a number of water resource \ninitiatives in the State of Maryland and the broader Chesapeake Bay \nRegion, including the restoration of the north end of Assateague \nIsland, the Coastal Bays of Maryland, and the Anacostia River. I know \nfirst hand the extraordinary leadership, vision and expertise Jim \nbrought not only to projects in this region, but equally important, to \nbuilding and encouraging one of the finest, most responsive and \ninnovative planning teams in the Nation.\n  Among his accomplishments, perhaps the one that stands out most and \nunderscores Jim's professionalism and creativity is the role he played \nin the planning, design and policy development process of one of the \nCorps' greatest success stories--the restoration of Poplar Island. This \nproject, which is taking clean dredged materials from the channels \nleading to the Port of Baltimore and using it to restore a chain of \nenvironmentally sensitive islands in the Chesapeake Bay, has become a \nnational model for habitat restoration and the beneficial use of \ndredged material. But developing and winning approval of the project \nwas no easy task. The size and scale of the project were unprecedented. \nFederal policies at the time greatly limited the funding and contained \nother disincentives to making this a viable option. Jim and his \nplanning staff put in countless hours helping to resolve these problems \nand develop innovative solutions that ultimately led to the \nconstruction of the project, relief for Maryland's dredged material \ndisposal problem and development of the largest environmentally \nrestoration initiative ever undertaken in the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Jim Johnson's contributions and accomplishments over the years have \nbeen recognized through many prestigious awards including the Army \nDecoration for Meritorious Civilian Service and the Secretary of Army \nAward for Publications Improvement, but perhaps no more so than by his \nselection in 1998 to return to Headquarters as Chief of the Planning \nand Policy Division of the Directorate of Civil Works. In this \nprestigious position, he has been responsible for managing some $200 \nmillion annually in water resource investments for navigation, \necosystem restoration, and flood and storm protection. He also \ndeveloped and implemented a new program to expand planner training and \nleadership skills.\n  Dr. Johnson has served the Nation with distinction. His efforts, work \nethic, and abiding sense of responsibility and commitment have earned \nhim the admiration of everyone with whom he has worked. I have enormous \nrespect for the professionalism, ingenuity, and integrity which he \nbrought to the positions in which he has served and greatly value the \nassistance he has provided to me and my staff over the years.\n  It is my firm conviction that public service is one of the most \nhonorable callings, one that demands the very best, most dedicated \nefforts of those who have the opportunity to serve their fellow \ncitizens and country. Throughout his career Jim Johnson has exemplified \na steadfast commitment to meeting this demand. I want to extend my \npersonal congratulations and thanks for his many years of hard work and \ndedication and wish him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5477-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5477-S5478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RETIREMENT OF JOHN B. BROWN III, ACTING ADMINISTRATOR OF THE DEA\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, James Bryant Conant once said that \n``each honest calling, each walk of life, has its own elite, its own \naristocracy, based on excellence of performance.'' I rise today to pay \ntribute to a man who is a member of the law enforcement elite, John B. \nBrown III, the Acting Director of the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  John Brown has spent more than three decades as a special agent in \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration. Last year he capped his law \nenforcement career when he was appointed deputy administrator of the \nagency. And when former Administrator Asa Hutchinson was appointed as \nunder secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, John Brown was \ntapped to be Acting Director of the DEA.\n  John Brown is a dedicated, hard-working government leader. He is \nknown at the DEA and in the larger law enforcement community as a \nthoughtful, personable administrator and a man of great humility.\n  His career at the DEA has been a distinguished one. As a young agent \nhe worked in Mexico where he was deeply involved in the investigation \ninto the murder of Kiki Camarena, the brave DEA agent who was tortured \nand killed by Mexican drug traffickers. During that time as in the rest \nof his career--whether it was in Miami, the Dallas field division, the \nEl Paso intelligence center or at DEA Headquarters--John Brown rose to \nthe challenge and excelled at each assignment.\n  But it was John Brown's first job as a teacher that really shaped him \nas an agent. John is known by the people who worked for him at DEA as a \ngreat teacher, someone who took the time to coach them, to motivate \nthem, to counsel them. For that reason, he is one of the most popular \nadministrators at DEA, and one of the most respected.\n  As a school teacher, John quickly found that many of the problems he \nsaw among students in his classroom involved learning the skills and \nattitudes and character to cope with life. Drug use was becoming \nwidespread in the early 1970s and prompted John to decide to join DEA \nas a special agent.\n  In truth, he never left the classroom. He has said many times that \none of his proudest moments at DEA came when a former student--someone \nwho as a young student had listened to one of his talks about the \nperils of drug use came up to him in an airport years later. He \nintroduced himself, said that he had a great job and a wonderful \nfamily--both of which he said would have been impossible had he joined \nhis many friends who used drugs in high school. He credited John \nBrown's talk on drugs with keeping away from a life of substance abuse.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention John's wife, Christine Brown, \nwho has been a source of tremendous support\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nand strength to John and their family. I know that she and their two \nchildren P.J. and Michael are incredibly proud of John and the superior \nand important work that he has done over the course of his career.\n  John Brown is a leader of integrity and total dedication. He has \nserved his country well and I wish him all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5478-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SOUTH DAKOTA SCHOOL OF MINES AND TECHNOLOGY TAKE FIRST PLACE IN ROCKY \n              MOUNTAIN REGIONAL CONCRETE CANOE COMPETITION\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology on earning \nfirst place for their remarkable display of ingenuity and design at the \n2002 Rocky Mountain Regional Concrete Canoe Competition in Logan, UT.\n  Under the supervision of their advisor, Dr. Marion Hansen, the team \nearned their 14th first place regional win within the last 16 years. \nThis win qualifies the team for the National Concrete Canoe Competition \nhosted by Drexel University in June. South Dakota School of Mines and \nTechnology's American Society of Civil Engineering program has a strong \nrecord of finding ingenious solutions to complex problems, and has \nplaced in the top five in the National Concrete Canoe Competition five \ntimes as well as winning the over all national competition in 1995.\n  Based on appearance, weight, presentation, and sprint and endurance \nraces for men, women, and co-ed squads, the South Dakota School of \nMines and Technology team defeated teams from Wyoming, Utah, and \nColorado for their first place win. To effectively implement their \nstrategy, students worked as a whole and within centralized teams, such \nas hull design, mix design, construction, and paddling, to bring the \nproject together as an award-winning canoe. This win reflects the work \nethic and dedication that is so visible in the state of South Dakota.\n  I want to acknowledge Dr. Richard J. Gowen, president of the South \nDakota School of Mines and Technology, as well as Dr. Marion R. Hansen, \nfor their guidance and support to help make this year's team so \nsuccessful. I also want to congratulate all of this year's team \nmembers: Steve Lipetzky, Andy Coats, Ryan Hamilton, Dave Lowe, Eric \nGassland, Jen Pohl, Mandy Kost, Katie Zeller, Tarar Boehmer, Wade Lein, \nand Marshall Cassady.\n  Again, congratulations to the South Dakota School of Mines and \nTechnology on winning their 14th regional concrete canoe \ncompetition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5478-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JIM WILDING\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a friend and \nan outstanding citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia, James A. \nWilding, on the occasion of his retirement from the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority. In the 25 years I have had the \nopportunity to serve in this body many Senators have come and gone. The \nfaces of industry and its leaders have changed as well. In changing \ntimes Jim Wilding has been constant--always a trusted advisor to me and \nothers for the more than 40 years he has served the Nation's capital \nairports.\n  In his role at the Authority, Jim is responsible for the management \nof two of our most important airports in the country--Washington Dulles \nInternational Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. He \nhas managed them through rapid growth, the transition away from Federal \noperation, and now into the new post 9/11 security paradigm. His vision \nis the result of strong knowledge, experience, and dedication to his \ncraft.\n  Mr. Wilding began his career with the Federal Aviation Administration \nsoon after graduating from the Catholic University of America in 1959 \nwith a graduate degree in civil engineering. At the FAA, he \nparticipated in the original planning and development of Washington \nDulles International Airport. I remember when that airport was being \nbuilt--many scoffed at the idea. They questioned the need for a \nfacility of that magnitude and objected to the seemingly rural \nlocation. Today we applaud the foresight that went into Dulles. Our \ntransportation system relies on the balance between Dulles and Reagan. \nJim Wilding has been an integral part of this visionary leadership.\n  Following the opening of Dulles in 1962, Mr. Wilding held \nprogressively responsible positions in all phases of engineering for \nthe two federally owned airports, eventually becoming the \norganization's chief engineer. He served as chief engineer until \nbecoming the airports' deputy director in 1975, and then its director 4 \nyears later.\n  Mr. Wilding served as the director of the FAA's Metropolitan \nWashington Airports organization from December 1979. In June 1987, the \nairports were transferred to the newly created Airports Authority, \nwhere he assumed his current position as president.\n  During his tenure as president and CEO of the Airports Authority, the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority passenger activity at \nNational and Dulles Airports nearly doubled to 31 million passengers in \n2002. With this growth, he has overseen and managed a massive capital \ndevelopment program at both airports totaling well over $3 billion \ndollars. Under his leadership, Reagan National Airport was modernized \nwith a new terminal building in 1997 which brought major improvements \nto airport traffic management and Metro system connections. At Dulles, \nhe directed the expansion and construction of new concourses, the \nbuilding of the airport's first parking garages, and is now managing a \n$3.2 billion capital improvement project. In addition, the Smithsonian \nwill open its new Air and Space Museum later this year located at \nDulles Airport.\n  Mr. Wilding's career is highlighted with many accolades, which, along \nwith his outstanding performance, have earned him a national and \ninternational reputation as an aviation industry expert.\n  I wish to extend my sincerest congratulations to Mr. James A. Wilding \non the occasion of his retirement. I am honored to recognize his many \naccomplishments to our region, applaud his service to our entire \nNation's aviation transportation system, and to call him a \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5478-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5478-S5479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING HENRY S. SCHLEIFF, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF COURT TV NETWORK\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on April 1, 2003, Henry \nSchleiff, chairman and CEO of Court TV, was awarded the Cable \nTelevision Public Affairs Association, CTPAA, President's Award. CTPAA \nis a national organization that focuses on public affairs issues within \nthe cable industry. I can think of no better person to be honored with \nthis award considering the efforts Mr. Schleiff has put forth to serve \nhis industry and the public community.\n  His career has featured an impressive array of both private and \npublic service. Since his career began with HBO, Mr. Schleiff has moved \nup the ranks of the entertainment industry--from senior vice president \nof business affairs and administration for HBO and head of HBO \nEnterprises in the 1980s, to executive producer for Viacom \nInternational Inc. and CEO of Viacom's Broadcast and Entertainment \nGroups in the early 1990s, to executive vice-president for Studios USA \nin the late 1990s. Mr. Schleiff has been the CEO of Court TV since \nDecember 1999 and has been the catalyst for its revival. Under his \nleadership, Court TV has become one of the most successful basic cable \nnetworks in the industry, growing from 30 million subscribers to nearly \n80 million in just 4 years.\n  Equally impressive are Mr. Schleiff's efforts for the public \ncommunity. He is vice chairman of the board of directors for the \nInternational Radio & Television Society Foundation, Inc. IRTS, and he \nserves on the board of directors of the International Council, The \nCreative Coalition, and Theatreworks. Court TV's Choices and \nConsequences education program, already in more than 100,000 schools, \nencourages children to make responsible decisions and positive \ncontributions to society. The ``Everyday Heroes'' program honors brave \nand courageous individuals who made personal sacrifices or significant \ncontributions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Schleiff's \naward acceptance speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\n\n       It is really a great honor to appear this evening with a \n     group of colleagues and friends, who I so admire and respect, \n     because they clearly share our network's vision . . . and, \n     our sense of duty to make a difference in the communities we \n     serve. I accept this year's President's Award with great \n     pride, as a validation of the important work done by our \n     network, Court TV--work that is very much unfinished and \n     ongoing--and, I accept this award with great appreciation on \n     behalf of the extraordinarily dedicated and talented team led \n     by Dick Beahrs and Scoot MacPherson in this area, at Court \n     TV.\n       It is, equally, a real privilege to appear with a gathering \n     of probably the most passionate, dedicated and caring people \n     anywhere in the media. I am proud to be a part of an industry \n     like cable that is recognized for its unequaled support for \n     diverse programs and initiatives providing valuable public \n     service outreach. Moreover, the suggestions and new ideas you \n     have shared over the past three days will, no doubt, \n     contribute significantly to our ability to maintain cable's \n     position as both the moral and financial leader, in the field \n     of telecommunications.\n       All of us in this room, tonight, know that we don't have to \n     do public service. We don't have to go into neighborhoods and \n     encourage better education, promote health care, or teach \n     tolerance and understanding. Why do we--why do you--\n     participate and pursue these causes: quite simply, because \n     you choose to. I have some idea of the sacrifice and effort \n     those here, tonight, make every day, and it is not \n     unreflective of Winston Churchill's observation that ``we \n     make a living by what we get, but we make a life . . . by \n     what we give.'' Those who received this award, in senior \n     management, like myself, do so merely on behalf of those, \n     in the field, like you, who make the real contributions. \n     It is we, who should give this award to you, because it is \n     we who should appreciate and, indeed, should be inspired \n     by what you do.\n       We must all recognize that public service is important from \n     a number of perspectives: its impact is felt in both karma \n     and dollars. Indeed, the legacy of the vast array of programs \n     represented here, tonight, will live on long after most, if \n     not all, of the shows and series that can be seen on any \n     given network. I particularly value what people do in this \n     area because, quite frankly, I am a product of the Kennedy \n     60's--I bought the ideal of contribution and, in fact, it has \n     served me well; it has served Court TV well, and hopefully it \n     serves you, because through your efforts, public service puts \n     this industry in the best possible light, especially in these \n     dark and troubled times.\n       In a world where we correctly criticize much of what we see \n     on television . . . and in a business where we are struggling \n     with customer service and competition, the one real, \n     indisputable Beacon (no pun intended) of success in every \n     corner . . . and, by any measure, is the diverse and \n     important work that people in Public Affairs do every day. \n     Cable, like any service industry, often gets a black eye. \n     But, because of your words and, more importantly, your deeds, \n     you are the people who ameliorate those complaints and put \n     this industry in the enviable position of being community \n     activists for positive social change.\n       Not only is what you do substantively important, but it is \n     also well communicated to our audiences--both viewers of our \n     programming and, more generally, subscribers who live in our \n     communities of service. Oddly enough, the only ones who \n     sometimes have trouble hearing your message and understanding \n     its importance, are, frankly, those often responsible for the \n     purse strings. The irony is that we must all do a better job \n     in communicating the legitimate success and importance of our \n     work not externally, outside our company, but rather, to \n     those in the executive suites. . . . Not only because all of \n     us here, tonight, are on the side of right (and, as we say at \n     Court TV, justice), but also because, in the end, this is \n     also very much in the best economic interests of our \n     companies. We can do well . . . by doing good; we can do \n     ``well'', financially . . . by doing ``good'', morally. In \n     that regard, public affairs efforts are among the most \n     distinctive and beneficial qualities of cable systems and \n     their programming. Why: because you live where the rubber \n     meets the road. You live where the cable operator or cable \n     network meets the customer or viewer, as the case my be . . . \n     you are part and parcel of the communities in which you serve \n     . . . and, given your work, this industry simply could not \n     ask for better representatives.\n       We take great pride in our commitment to public service at \n     Court TV, and, especially, the recognition it is receiving \n     tonight, because we have always understood the power of the \n     medium of television--and, the potential for good that a \n     network like ours can play. For example, I recently learned \n     that five-year olds, typically, have watched more than 5,000 \n     hours of TV before they even enter kindergarten--in most \n     families, today, that's more time than they have spent in \n     conversation with their parents--and, in all cases, that is, \n     statistically, more hours . . . than it takes to earn a \n     college degree. With our experience in creating quality \n     educational initiatives--and, with the support and \n     partnership of our cable affiliates, we are increasingly \n     focused on harnessing the power of television--both, on \n     and off air--for its use as an effective and engaging \n     public service tool.\n       In that regard, allow me to point out some of the recent \n     specific intiatives that Court TV's Public Affairs and \n     Corporate Communications people have introduced or otherwise \n     pursued and which provide me with the privilege of standing \n     here, tonight, on their behalf.\n       Principally, you know us for our Golden Beacon Award-\n     winning Choices and Consequences education programs, which, \n     in its five year existence, has reached more than 100,000 \n     schools with programs designed to keep our nation's youth . . \n     . out of our nation's courts, by teaching young people that a \n     poor choice made in a moment . . . can have devastating \n     consequences . . . for a lifetime. Through Choices and \n     Consequences, we aim to empower our children to make \n     responsible decisions and to contribute, positively, to \n     society. We have added educational programs like the \n     Forensics in the Classroom Curriculum, and the Mobile \n     Investigation Unit tour, which has made stops in 20 cities \n     last year and plans 23 this spring and summer. Tomorrow \n     afternoon, we celebrate the latest group of ``Everyday \n     Heroes,'' honoring those who demonstrate bravery and courage, \n     often through individual acts of personal sacrifice. As you \n     may be aware, an element of education and pro-social causes \n     runs, like a thread, through much of our programming. \n     Certainly, many of our investigative documentaries and \n     specials raise critical issues regarding tolerance, or the \n     fairness of our criminal justice system. This year, for \n     example, we will again focus on Robert F. Kennedy's legacy \n     and the Human Rights Award. And, finally, our original movies \n     attempt to raise important and relevant questions which lead \n     to informed debate about a variety of judicial and social \n     issues.\n       The poet Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ``to appreciate beauty, \n     to find the best in others, to leave the world a little \n     better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a \n     redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed \n     easier because you have lived. This is the meaning of \n     success.'' It is in that light, that we at Court TV share \n     with you in your passion, your vision and our mutual goal of \n     bringing about positive change through education and \n     understanding.\n       I accept this year's CTPAA President's Award, as a \n     validation of the public affairs work done by Court TV; I \n     accept the President's Award, on behalf of all of you, whose \n     tireless dedication has so contributed to tonight's . . . \n     success; and, finally, I accept this award as a reflection of \n     your values and ideals which are so important to the future \n     of this industry and . . . this nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5479-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5479-S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROFESSOR JOE WILKINS' RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Professor \nJoe Wilkins' contributions to the State of Illinois and our country.\n  Professor Wilkins will retire from the University of Illinois in May \n2003. He will officially become a ``University of Illinois Professor \nEmeritus of Management'' which is an accomplishment in and of itself, \nbut is only one facet of his career.\n  Professor Wilkins has been a very effective teacher. He received an \n``Outstanding Teacher'' award selected by a vote of the University \nstudent body. His graduate course in International Business was chosen \nby students in the College of Business and Management as their most \nvaluable class. Additionally, during 2002 Professor Wilkins received \nthe highest evaluation of all the faculty by students in the college.\n  Prior to his teaching career, Professor Wilkins served with \ndistinction as a captain in the United States Air Force. While serving \nhe was repeatedly decorated for heroism in combat. His many decorations \ninclude the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts, which were awarded for \nhis twice being wounded in combat. Despite being injured in combat, he \ncontinues to run at least one 26.2-mile marathon a year and enjoys \nscuba diving and sky-diving.\n  In addition to his teaching and service to many organizations, \nProfessor Wilkins has responded for over 30 years to the needs of his \nhome community--Springfield, IL. Some of the many services he has \nprovided to Springfield include being a regular blood donor and\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nproviding flights to needy persons requiring medical assistance. He has \ndonated more than 15 gallons of blood including 59 pints at the Central \nIllinois Community Blood Bank in Springfield.\n  Professor Wilkins has held positions with both the State of Illinois \nand the city of Springfield. As an operations research analyst for the \nState of Illinois he helped analyze managerial operations. \nAdditionally, he has served in many capacities and consulted on \nmultiple issues for the city of Springfield. Most notably, in 1982 he \ntook an academic leave from the university to serve for 13 months as \nComptroller of Springfield. On numerous occasions since then he has \nprovided management advice to the city of Springfield.\n  Professor Wilkins has been a teacher and role model to thousands of \nundergraduate and graduate students. I am sure the University of \nIllinois will miss him greatly. Professor Wilkins has had a lifetime of \ncommunity service in which he established a reputation of personal \nintegrity and demonstrated courage. He is a distinguished citizen and \ndeserves to be recognized for all of his contributions to \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5480-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN HONOR OF E.E. WARD MOVING AND STORAGE COMPANY LLC OF COLUMBUS, OHIO\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \npay tribute to the E.E. Ward Moving and Storage Company LLC of \nColumbus, OH, for 122 years of service to the great State of Ohio. \nRecently, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Congressional Black \nCaucus recognized the E.E. Ward Company as the oldest African-American-\nowned business in America.\n  The Ward family has longstanding roots in Ohio dating back before the \nCivil War. From 1842 to 1858, John T. Ward was a conductor on the \nUnderground Railroad which ran through Columbus, and the Ward home was \na well-known stop. During the Civil War, John T. Ward received \ngovernment contracts to haul munitions, supplies, and equipment for the \nU.S. Army.\n  After the Civil War, John's son, William Ward, began working for his \nfather, and then he went to work for the Union Transfer and Storage \nCompany. At Union Transfer, he moved up through the ranks serving as \nteamster, work supervisor, foreman, and rate clerk. In 1881, William \nWard rejoined his father John T. Ward and together they founded the \nWard Transfer Line, a wagon transportation business in downtown \nColumbus.\n  Since 1881 the company has evolved and changed with the times. In \n1889, the company changed its name to E.E. Ward Transfer and Storage \nCompany, when the youngest son, Edgar Earl Ward, assumed management of \nthe company. He was 18 years old. Twenty-five years later, in 1914, the \ncompany began its shift to motorized moving and retired its last horse \nin 1921.\n  Over the years, E.E. Ward has performed moves for schools, museums, \nlibraries, business, and homes. In the 1950s, the E.E. Ward Company was \nawarded two notable contracts in Columbus--from the Steinway Piano \nCompany and the Franklin County Board of Elections. During the course \nof those contracts, it is estimated that the company moved over 900,000 \npianos and hundreds of voting machines to various precincts in \nColumbus.\n  The Company's Chairman Emeritus is Eldon W. Ward, the grandson of \nWilliam Ward. He joined the company in 1945 and retired 51 years later \nin 1996. Mr. Eldon Ward has been recognized as an accomplished business \nleader and is admired by many. He was inducted into the Ohio Corporate \nHall of Fame in 1991 and the Central Ohio Business Hall of Fame in \n1992. Under his leadership, the E.E. Ward Company received the National \nTorch Award of Marketplace Ethics from the Better Business Bureau.\n  As a community leader, Eldon Ward served on the boards of over 40 \ncommunity organizations, including the local chapter of the American \nRed Cross, the Salvation Army, and the Chamber of Commerce. He served \nas board president of the Columbus Foundation, the Franklin County \nUnited Way, and the Central Ohio YMCA, which was renamed the Eldon W. \nWard YMCA in 1991.\n  Today, E.E. Ward Moving & Storage Company is an agent of Bekins Van \nLines and provides local and interstate household goods relocation \nservices and a variety of logistics services to residential, government \nand corporate customers. The company focuses primarily on residential \nand business moves and storage.\n  The longevity of the E.E. Ward Company is the result of its \ncommitment to excellent service. The current owners, Brian A. Brooks, \npresident and godson of Eldon Ward, and Otto Beatty III, co-owner, \nrecently purchased the company. Both are in their early thirties. They \nhave chosen to carry on the entrepreneurial torch of their parents and \ngrandparents and are wonderful examples to other young business owners. \nIn fact, the company was recently awarded the 2002 Super Service Award \nfrom Angie's List, a consumer and household rating company.\n  Brian Brooks and Otto Beatty are privy to a wealth of experience and \nwisdom from family members and community members. Like their forebears, \nthey focus on providing excellent service to their customers and giving \ngenerously to their community. Their dedication and commitment is a \nshining example of good corporate citizenship, something we need more \nof throughout America.\n  I am pleased that this year the King Arts Complex in Columbus will be \nthe recipient of a beautiful painting by famed Columbus Artist Aminah \nLynn Robinson that illustrates the history of the company and the Ward \nfamily's role in the Underground Railroad. We shall all pay tribute to \npeople like the John T. Ward family who helped America's enslaved \ncitizens gain freedom. That is why in my first year in the United \nStates Senate, I co-sponsored the bill to provide Federal funding to \nthe Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, the only \nnational center of its kind in the country. I hope the painting about \nthe Ward Family will inspire people of all ages to learn more about the \nsignificant role of the Underground Railroad in our history.\n  Recently, on the occasion of Ohio's bicentennial, I reminded a joint \nsession of the Ohio General Assembly in Chillicothe that our \nforefathers delivered for us and now the future of our great State is \nin our hands. Throughout Ohio's history, the Ward family has made major \ncontributions to the quality of life by creating jobs and opportunities \nfor countless Americans and we should all be grateful for their hard \nwork and dedication.\n  I believe Brian Brooks's and Otto Beatty's ancestors would be very \nproud of their work today. With the two of them at the helm of the E.E. \nWard Moving and Storage Company, I think its future will be bright for \nmany years to come.\n  I wish the E.E. Ward Moving and Storage Company the best of luck in \nall of its endeavors and I look forward to congratulating them on many \nsuccesses in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5480-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOHN C.

Today I join with the 12,000 students in the Mehlville \nschool district in celebrating his 31 years as a distinguished \neducator. I thank him for his hard work and dedication to the children \nand families of Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5480-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5480-S5481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of \nHolocaust Memorial Day, known in Hebrew as ``Yom Ha Shoa.''\n  Seventy years ago, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. \nIn\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\n1933, the German Government adopted numerous discriminatory policies \nagainst Jews. Jews were prohibited from working as newspaper editors or \nowning land, and many Jewish immigrants had their citizenship revoked. \nThese actions fueled anti-Semitic sentiments among the general public. \nSeventy years ago this month, German citizens marched through the \nstreets of Leipzig with signs that read: ``Don't buy from Jews--Shop in \nGerman businesses!''\n  It was a dark time for Germany, but many throughout the world thought \nthat the situation would improve. The 1936 Olympic Games were held in \nBerlin, even against the backdrop of the rise of Hitler, the Gestapo, \nstate-sponsored Aryan qualifications and the construction of the first \nconcentration camps at Dachau and Buchenwald. In 1939, Jews were \nrelocated into Jewish ghettos, placed under curfews and banned from \nmost professions. The world still ignored the problem; in May of that \nyear, a ship packed with 930 Jewish refugees was turned away by several \ncountries and forced to return to Europe. One of those countries was \nthe United States.\n  By late 1939, Polish Jews were forcibly placed in labor camps and \nrequired to wear yellow stars for identification at all times. Mass \nkillings--called pogroms--took tens of thousands of lives, and Jews \nfrom conquered states were deported to German concentration camps. \nFollowing the German invasion, France signed an armistice with Hitler \non June 22, 1940. Exactly 1 year later, Germany invaded the Soviet \nUnion.\n  All the while, the world ignored the extermination of the Jewish \npeople, and the United States wrapped itself in the flawed doctrine of \nisolationism. It took far too long for our Nation to grasp its \nresponsibility and stake in World War II. When the war ended, Germany \nhad murdered over 6 million Jews in the Holocaust. Pastor Martin \nNiemoller described his reluctance to stand up and help people in \nGermany, and I believe his critique can apply to individuals and \ncountries:\n\n       First they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out \n     because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the Communists, \n     and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist. Then \n     they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out \n     because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me and \n     there was no one left to speak out for me.\n\n  Today we remember those who suffered. We remember those who were \nmurdered. We remember those who spoke out. We will never forget them. \nThis history informs the difficult choices that we face today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5481-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate.\n\n       H.R. 6.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a \nprogram to reduce the risks from and mitigate the effects of avalanches \non visitors to units of the National Park System and on other \nrecreational users of public land; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I introduce, with Senators \nCampbell, Domenici, Hatch, Inouye, and Murkowski, the Federal Land \nRecreational Visitor Protection Act of 2003.\n  Across our State of Alaska, Western States, and areas of the \nNortheast, local governments and businesses struggle each year to \nremove potential avalanches or recover form the disastrous effects of \navalanches. The West Wide Avalanche Network calculated avalanche damage \ntotals for the Western U.S. between $600 thousand and $800 thousand \nannually. These costs do not include the economic losses from town cut-\noff by avalanches. In our state alone, the Safety Center estimates \nupwards of $18 million in direct damages both to private property and \neconomic losses over the past 5 years.\n  While such damage can bring hardships to many local communities, none \ncan compare with the loss of a friend or family member. The U.S. \naverages 30 deaths a year from avalanches, a majority of which are \nresults of recreational activities in unmitigated avalanche areas. Some \nStates set aside money for rescues prior to the winter season, knowing \nthat the resources required to clear all avalanche threats are not at \nhand.\n  This bill brings those resources to the entities that need them the \nmost, enabling us to significantly reduce the effects of avalanches on \nvisitors, recreational users, transportation corridors, and our local \ncommunities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. \n        Bunning):\n  S. 932. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for taxpayers owning certain commercial power \ntakeoff vehicles; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Fuel Tax \nEqualization Credit for Substantial Power Takeoff Vehicles Act. This \nbill upholds a long-held principle in the application of the Federal \nfuels excise tax, and restores this principle for certain single engine \n``dual-use'' vehicles.\n  This long-held principle is simple: fuel consumed for the purpose of \nmoving vehicles over the road is taxed, while fuel consumed for ``off-\nroad'' purposes is not taxed. The tax is designed to compensate for the \nwear and tear impacts on roads. Fuel used for a non-propulsion ``off-\nroad'' purpose has no impact on the roads. It should not be taxed as if \nit does. This bill is based on this principle, and it remedies a \nproblem created by IRS regulations that control the application of the \nfederal fuels excise tax to ``dual-use'' vehicles.\n  Duel-use vehicles are vehicles that use fuel both to propel the \nvehicle on the road, and also to operate separate, on-board equipment. \nThe two prominent examples of duel-use vehicles are concrete mixers, \nwhich use fuel to rotate the mixing drum, and sanitation trucks, which \nuse fuel to operate the compactor. Both of these trucks move over the \nroad, but at the same time, a substantial portion of their fuel use is \nattributable to the non-propulsion function.\n  The current problem developed because progress in technology has \noutstripped the regulatory process. In the past, duel-use vehicles \ncommonly had two engines, IRS regulations, written in the 1950's, \nspecifically exempt the portion of fuel used by the separate engine \nthat operates special equipment such as a mixing drum or a trash \ncompactor. These IRS regulations reflect the principle that fuel \nconsumed for non-propulsion purposes is not taxed.\n  Today, however, typical duel-use vehicles use only one engine. The \nsingle engine both propels the vehicle over the road and powers the \nnon-propulsion function through ``power takeoff.'' a major reason for \nthe growth of these single-engine, power takeoff vehicles is that they \nuse less fuel. And a major benefit for everyone is that they are better \nfor the environment.\n  Power takeoff was not in widespread use when the IRS regulations were \ndrafted, and the regulations deny an exemption for fuel used in single-\nengine, duel-use vehicles. The IRS defends its distinction between one-\nengine and two-engine, vehicles based on possible administrative \nproblems if vehicle owners were permitted to allocate fuel between the \npropulsion and non-propulsion functions.\n  Our bill is designed to address the administrative concerns expressed \nby the\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\nIRS, but at the same time, restore tax fairness for fuel-use vehicles \nwith one engine. The bill does this by establishing an annual tax \ncredit available for taxpayers that own a licensed and insured concrete \nmixer or sanitation truck with a compactor. The amount of the credit is \n$250 and is a conservative estimate of the excise taxes actually paid, \nbased on information compiled on typical sanitation trucks and concrete \nmixers.\n  In sum, as a fixed income tax credit, no audit or administrative \nissue will arise about the amount of fuel used for the off-road \npurpose. At the same time, the credit provides a rough justice method \nto make sure these taxpayers are not required to pay tax on fuels that \nthey shouldn't be paying. Also, as an income tax credit, the proposal \nwould have no effect on the highway trust fund.\n  I would like to stress that I believe the IRS' interpretation of the \nlaw is not consistent with long-held principles under the tax law, \ndespite their administrative concerns. Quite simply, the law should not \ncondone a situation where taxpayers are required to pay the excise tax \non fuel attributable to non-propulsion functions. This bill corrects an \nunfair tax that should have never been imposed in the first place, I \nurge my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deny any \ndeduction for certain fines, penalties, and other amounts; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, we are introducing the ``Government \nSettlement Transparency Act of 2003.'' Over the past several months, we \nhave become increasingly concerned about the approval of various \nsettlements that allow penalty payments made to the government in \nsettlement of a violation or potential violation of the law to be tax \ndeductible. This payment structure shifts the tax burden from the \nwrongdoer onto the backs of the American people. This is unacceptable.\n  The issue of tax deductibility is particularly relevant in the \nsettlement of various SEC investigations into violations or potential \nviolations of the securities laws. The corporate meltdown of the past \ntwo years has caused investors to lose confidence in the stock market. \nTo address investors' loss of faith, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct last July. However, Sarbanes-Oxley begins to address only part of \nthe corporate reform problem, as it applies solely to future corporate \nactivity. To more fully restore confidence in the markets, America's \nState and Federal regulators are also working to hold accountable the \ncorporate executives and others in corporate America responsible for \ndamaging investor confidence. With these efforts to achieve greater \naccountability in the business community and ensure the integrity of \nour financial markets, it is important that the rules governing the \nappropriate tax treatment of settlements be clear and adhered to by \ntaxpayers.\n  Section 162(f) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that no \ndeduction is allowed as a trade or business expense under section \n162(a) for the payment of a fine or penalty to a government for \nviolation of any law. The enactment of section 162(f) in 1969 codified \nexisting case law that denied the deductibility of fines and penalties \nas ordinary and necessary business expenses on the grounds that \n``allowance of the deduction would frustrate sharply defined national \nor state policies proscribing the particular types of conduct evidenced \nby some governmental declaration thereof.'' Treasury regulations \nprovide that fine or penalty includes an amount paid in settlement of \nthe taxpayer's actual or potential liability for a fine or penalty.\n  The legislation introduced today modifies the rules regarding the \ndetermination of whether payments are nondeductible payments of fines \nof penalties under section 162(f). In particular, the bill generally \nprovides that amounts paid or incurred, whether by suit, agreement, or \notherwise to, or at the direction of, a government in relation to the \nviolation of any law or the investigation or inquiry into the potential \nviolation of any law are nondeductible. The bill applies to deny a \ndeduction for any payment, including those where there is no admission \nof guilt or liability and those made for the purpose of avoiding \nfurther investigation or litigation.\n  An exception applies to payments that the taxpayer establishes are \nrestitution. It is intended that a payment will be treated as \nrestitution only if the payment is required to be paid to the specific \npersons, or in relation to the specific property, actually harmed by \nthe conduct of the taxpayer that resulted in the payment. Thus, a \npayment to or with respect to a class broader than the specific persons \nor property that were actually harmed, for example, to class including \nsimilarly situated persons or property, does\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\nnot qualify as restitution. Restitution is limited to the amount that \nbears a substantial quantitative relationship to the harm caused by the \npast conduct or actions of the taxpayer that resulted in the payment in \nquestion. If the party harmed is a government, then restitution \nincludes payment to such harmed government, provided the payment bears \na substantial quantitative relationship to the harm. However, \nrestitution does not include reimbursement of government investigative \nor litigation costs, or do payments to whistleblowers.\n  The bill would be effective for amounts paid or incurred on or after \nApril 28th, 2003, except that it would not apply to amounts paid or \nincurred under any binding order or agreement entered into before such \ndate.\n  We ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 936\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, Senator Hagel and I, and others \nintroduce ``The IDEA Full Funding Act of 2003.'' This bill will provide \nincreased mandatory funding for the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA, and meet the Federal Government's commitment to \npay 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditures. These additional \nfunds will ensure that every child with a disability gets a free, \nappropriate public education.\n  In 1975, when the IDEA was passed in the House and Senate, there was \nan agreement made by negotiators based on the understanding that the \nFederal Government's goal would be to provide 40 percent of the average \nper pupil expenditures in each local education area. There was no time \nframe placed on this goal, but since that time it has been understood \nthat ``full funding'' for IDEA means reaching that 40 percent goal.\n  For the past 28 years, we have put additional resources into IDEA but \nwe have not come close to full funding. This bill will put our money \nwhere our mouth is and say that the federal government will be full \npartners with states and local governments in meeting the needs of \nchildren with disabilities.\n  This bill fully funds the IDEA. It appropriates funds for the next 10 \nyears, gradually increasing the percentage of funds which are mandatory \nand increasing the amounts so that in year 8 we are at the level \nprojected to equal 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure. \nWhile we have seen welcome increases in IDEA spending over the past few \nyears, past year increases do not guarantee future increases. This bill \nguarantees full funding, phased in over 8 years.\n  This bill does not create a new entitlement program. It provides \nadvanced appropriations for the next 10 years, but it has a set amount \nfor each year, not an open-ended figure.\n  This bill also provides incentive for compliance with the \nrequirements of IDEA. If all of the IDEA-eligible children are getting \nthe services that they are entitled to, then local property taxpayers \nget relief.\n  Last year, the Senate passed an amendment to the reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act which would have required \nfull funding of IDEA. The full funding provision was not in the final \nconference report. Prior to that amendment, there have been 22 separate \nbills and resolutions in the House and Senate calling for full funding.\n  This year, the time has come for full funding to make it into law. It \nhas been 28 years since the Federal Government agreed to pay a share of \nIDEA and it is time to meet that goal.\n  The IDEA has been remarkably successful. In 1975, only \\1/5\\ of \nchildren with disabilities received a formal education and several \nStates had laws specifically excluding many children with disabilities, \nincluding those who were blind, deaf, or had mental health needs from \nreceiving such an education. The most recent data on the number of \nchildren served under IDEA indicates that over 6 million children are \ncurrently benefiting from the law.\n  Although IDEA has been successful, there is more work to be done. \nEvery time I speak to school districts in Iowa, they tell me that the \ncosts of special education are very difficult for them to manage. Some \nparents of children with disabilities also complain that their children \nare not getting the education promised by IDEA.\n  This bill will provide significant additional resources. In 2003, we \nare funding $17.6 percent of the cost at 8.8 billion dollars. Under our \nbill, this number rises steeply to 22 percent of the cost and 10.8 \nbillion dollars in 2004. The increases continue until 2011, when we \nreach 40 percent and an expenditure of 24.6 billion. Iowa sees its \nfunding rise from 96 million in 2003 to 278.3 million in 2011. We are \nmore than doubling the resources going to special education in Iowa and \nelsewhere.\n  I want to thank Senator Hagel for his ongoing leadership on this \nissue and for his work in achieving bipartisan support for this bill. I \nalso want to thank Senators Kennedy, Jeffords and Dodd for their \nlongstanding commitment to fully funding IDEA. In addition, I want to \nacknowledge all of the co-sponsors of this bill, who are joining me \ntoday in leading the way for Congress to finally pass full funding into \nlaw.\n  This is a win-win-win bill. With this advance appropriations, \nstudents with disabilities will get the public education they have a \nright to, school districts will be able to provide services without \ncutting into their general education budgets, and in cases where all \nIDEA-eligible children are getting the services they are entitled to, \nproperty taxpayers get relief.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the IDEA Full \nFunding Act of 2003. I'm so proud to cosponsor this important \nlegislation. This bill provides mandatory increases for IDEA funding \neach year, so that the Federal Government will be paying its full share \nof the cost of special education by 2011. This legislation is long \noverdue. I think it's shocking that the President is fighting for tax \nbreaks for zillionaires while delaying help for those who need it \nmost--the children with special needs and their parents and teachers. \nWe must fully fund IDEA to ensure that children with disabilities are \nreceiving the services they need to succeed with their classmates in \npublic schools.\n  In 1975, Congress promised to pay 40 percent of the cost of special \neducation when it passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct. Yet it has never paid more than 17.5 percent. That means local \ndistricts must make up the difference, either by cutting from other \neducation programs or by raising taxes. I don't want to force States \nand local school districts to forage for funds, cut back on teacher \ntraining, or delay school repairs because the Federal Government has \nfailed to live up to its commitment to special education. That's why \nfully funding IDEA is one of my top priorities.\n  Everywhere I go in Maryland, I hear about IDEA. I hear about it in \nurban, rural, and suburban communities, from Democrats and Republicans, \nand from parents and teachers. They tell me that the Federal Government \nis not living up to its promise, that special education costs about 18 \npercent of the average school budget, that schools are suffering, and \nthe parents are worried.\n  Parents today are under a lot of stress--sometimes working two jobs \njust to make ends meet, trying to find day care for their kids, and \nelder care for their own parents. The Federal Government shouldn't add \nto their worries by not living up to its obligations. With the Federal \nGovernment not paying its share of special ed these parents have real \nquestions in their minds: Will my child will have a good teacher? Will \nthe classes have up-to-date textbooks? Will they be learning what they \nneed to know?\n  Parents of disabled children face such a tough burden already. School \nshould not be one of the many things they have to worry about, \nparticularly when the laws are already on the books to guarantee their \nchild a public school education. The bottom line is that the Federal \nGovernment is shortchanging these parents by not paying its share of \nspecial ed costs.\n  This bill will give local governments the resources they need to \nimprove education for all children. It will free up money in local \nbudgets for hiring more teachers, buying new textbooks and technology, \nand repairing old school buildings. It will help the teachers who \nstruggle with teaching the toughest students. It will help students \nwith disabilities and their families by providing enough funding for \nspecial education programs so parents can have one less thing to worry \nabout, and students get the opportunities they deserve.\n  Full funding of IDEA is essential. It will give disabled children a \nchance to succeed in school and in life without\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nshortchanging other vital education programs. It will give parents \npeace of mind about their children's education. Let's pass this bill as \nsoon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina:\n  S. 940.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for improvements in access to services in rural hospitals and \ncritical access hospitals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, rural America has been depopulating at \nan alarming rate. The same is true for the rural counties in Kansas. In \nfact, over half of the counties in the State are losing population.\n  We are going to stop that trend.\n  Senators, like Ben Nelson and I, who grew up in small towns know a \nlittle secret. Rural America is a great place to live. However, for \nrural towns to compete with urban areas for talented young people, they \nhave to be able to provide the basics--like high quality health care.\n  For the hospitals represented here today to be able to provide high \nquality health care for rural America, they have to be able to count on \nMedicare for fair reimbursement. For quite a few hospitals in Kansas, \n70 and 80 percent of their caseload is paid for by Medicare. For the \ncommunities these hospitals serve, fair Medicare reimbursement is \nvitally important.\n  Unfortunately, much of the regulation that comes out of CMS is based \non economics of scale. The actuaries and accountants in Baltimore \nproduce payment systems and formulas for reimbursement. The assumption \nis that the hospitals that are the most efficient will be the most \nsuccessful. Unfortunately, efficiency is often a product of volume. If \nyou treat 5,000 stroke patients in a year, you are probably going to be \nmore efficient than if you treat only 5.\n  Efficiency is a laudable goal, but it shouldn't be the only goal of \nMedicare. Particularly, when it comes to providing health care in a \nhospital with fewer than 50 beds.\n  That is why Senator Nelson and I are introducing the ``Rural \nCommunity Hospital Assistance Act of 2003.'' Rather than rely on \nformulas calculated by CMS bureaucrats in Baltimore, the hospitals \ncovered under our bill will rely on cost-based reimbursement. In \naddition, the bill recognizes that these hospitals don't have the \nvolume to cover bad debt from patients and to keep up with growing \ndemands for new technology and infrastructure.\n  This bill will create a new Rural Community Hospital designation \nwithin Medicare for rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds.\n  These hospitals will be eligible for cost-based reimbursement for \nimpatient and outpatient services; a technology and infrastructure add \non; cost based reimbursement for home health services where the \nprovider is isolated; cost based reimbursement for ambulance services; \nand the restoration of Medicare bad debt payments at 100 percent.\n  And the cost of the bill, which we believe with stabilize health care \nin rural America, is less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of annual Medicare \nexpenditures.\n  This is an important bill for rural hospitals; and I don't think you \ncan overestimate the importance of rural hospitals to the communities \nthey serve.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I join Senator Brownback \nin introducing the Rural Community Hospital Assistance Act. This \nlegislation is intended to ensure the future of small rural hospitals \nby restructuring the way they are reimbursed for Medicare services by \nbasing the reimbursements on actual costs instead of the current pre-\nset cost structure.\n  Current law allows for very small hospitals--designated Critical \nAccess Hospitals, CAH, to receive cost-based Medicare reimbursements. \nTo qualify as a CAH the facility must have no more than 15 acute care \nbeds.\n  In rural communities, hospital facilities that are slightly larger \nthan the 15 bed limit share with Critical Access Hospitals the same \neconomic conditions, the same treatment challenges, the same disparity \nin coverage area but do not share the same reimbursement arrangement. \nThese rural hospitals have to compete with larger urban-based hospitals \nthat can perform the same services at drastically reduced costs. They \nare also discouraged from investing in technology and other methods to \nimprove the quality of care in their communities because those \ninvestments are not supported by Medicare reimbursement procedures.\n  The legislation would provide cost-based Medicare reimbursement by \ncreating a new ``rural'' designation under the Medicare reimbursement \nsystem. This new designation would benefit seven Nebraska hospitals. \nHospitals in McCook, Alliance, Broken Bow, Beatrice, Columbus, Holdrege \nand Lexington would fall under this new designation, and would have \nsimilar benefits provided to nearly sixty other Nebraska hospitals \nclassified under the CAH system.\n  The legislation would also improve the hospitals with critical access \nstatus. Nearly sixty existing CAH facilities in Nebraska already \nreceive cost-based reimbursements for inpatient and outpatient \nservices. The legislation would further assist these existing CAH \nfacilities by allowing them a return on equity for technology and \ninfrastructure investments and by extending the cost-based \nreimbursement to certain post-acute services.\n  Rural hospitals cannot continue to provide these services without \nhaving Medicare cover the costs. If something\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\nis not done, the larger hospitals may be forced to cut back on the \nnumber of beds they keep--and the number of people they care for, and \nothers may be forced to close their doors. These hospitals provide \njobs, good wages, health care and economic development opportunity for \nthese communities. Without access to these hospitals, these communities \nwould not survive. The Rural Community Hospital Assistance Act will \nensure that the community has access to high quality health care that \nis affordable to the patient and the provider.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reid, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 944. A bill to enhance national security, environmental quality, \nand economic stability by increasing the production of clean, \ndomestically produced renewable energy as a fuel source for the \nnational electric system; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Durbin, Reid, and Kerry, the ``Renewable Energy Investment Act \nof 2003.''\n  This legislation will guarantee that by the year 2020, twenty percent \nof our electricity will be produced from renewable energy resources. \nThese resources include wind, biomass, solar, ocean, geothermal and \nlandfill gas.\n  Again and again, I have heard members come to this floor and say how \nimportant renewable energy is to our environment, to our national \nsecurity, and to our domestic economic stability. I agree. But if we \nwant to achieve these great benefits, we must, as they say, ``put our \nmoney where our mouth is.'' It is time to pass realistic, achievable \nstandards to guarantee that renewable energy is produced.\n  The Renewable Energy Investment Act of 2003 is a very important step \nin that direction. It will create a renewable portfolio standard or \n``RPS'' under which utilities and others who supply electricity to \nretail consumers will be required to ensure that by the year 2020, \ntwenty percent of our domestic electricity is generated from renewable \nenergy sources. The RPS in this legislation provides a flexible, \nmarket-driven system of tradeable credits by which utilities can \nreadily achieve these renewable energy requirements.\n  Why twenty percent by 2020? Because the U.S. Department of Energy, \nthrough its Energy Information Administration, has repeatedly indicated \nthat requiring that twenty percent of our electricity come from \nrenewable energy by the year 2020 will actually lower overall consumer \nenergy costs, while at the same time achieving tremendous environmental \nbenefits.\n  According to the most recent estimates derived from the Department of \nEnergy, consumer electricity prices under a twenty percent renewable \nportfolio standard would be largely the same as without one. According \nto the Department of Energy, retail electricity costs by the year 2020 \nwithout an RPS would be 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour. If a 20 percent \nRPS is in effect, retail electricity costs would be approximately 6.7 \ncents per kilowatt hour.\n  However, the Department of Energy studies also indicate that because \nan RPS creates a more diverse and competitive market for energy supply, \noverall domestic consumer energy costs will actually decrease by almost \nnine percent.\n  Equally important, shifting to greater renewable energy production \nwill have dramatic impacts on human health and the environment. The \nDepartment of Energy has found that, as demand for energy grows, \nwithout changes to Federal law U.S. carbon emissions will increase \nforty seven percent above the 1990 level by 2020. However, with a \ntwenty percent renewables standard, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions will \ndecrease by more than eighteen percent by 2020.\n  Electricity production, primarily from burning coal, is the source of \nan estimated sixty six percent of sulfur oxide, SOx, \nemissions. These chemicals are the main cause of acid rain, which kills \nrivers and lakes, and damages crops and buildings. Burning fossil fuels \nto produce electricity also emits nitrogen oxides, NOx, \nwhich cause health-damaging smog. Ground-level ozone caused by nitrogen \noxide contributes to asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory problems.\n  Electricity produced from nuclear power, while not responsible for \nthe emissions associated with burning of fossil fuels, results in \nhighly toxic, and essentially permanent wastes for which no complete \ndisposal option currently exists.\n  Switching to renewable resources virtually eliminates these concerns. \nThe Renewable Energy Investment Act of 2003 will help reduce emissions \nof carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, mercury and \nparticulate matter, without creation of toxic wastes.\n  The twenty percent RPS established in this legislation will also \ncreate thousands of new, high quality jobs and bring significant new \ninvestment to rural communities. It will create an estimated $80 \nmillion in new capitol investment, and result in more than $5 billion \nin new property tax revenues.\n  It will bring increased diversity to our energy sector, creating \ngreater market stability and reducing the price spikes that so often \nplague our domestic natural gas markets.\n  Greater diversity also reduces the vulnerability of our energy \ninfrastructure to terrorist threats.\n  In a letter to Congress shortly after the attacks of September 11, \n2001, several national security experts endorsed congressional passage \nof an RPS. The letter, signed by former CIA director James Woolsey; \nformer National Security Advisor to President Reagan, Robert McFarlane; \nand former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Thomas Moorer, stated \nthat a strong RPS is an important component of addressing the \nsignificant challenges to America's new energy security.\n  Rapidly increasing the production of renewable energy is vital to \nAmerica's future. We must be willing to take the steps necessary to \nmake that happen. The Renewable Energy Investment Act of 2003 is an \nessential part of that goal and I urge my colleagues to join with me in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to improve the \nprocess for adjusting the rates of pay for members of the uniformed \nservices; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor the Military Pay \nComparability Act of 2003. In 1999, the Committee on Armed Services \npassed landmark legislation providing significant benefits to the \nentire Total Force. I believe we must improve upon this legislation so \nthat we not only eliminate ``pay comparability gap,'' but ensure that \nwe do not recreate one in the future.\n  Under the 1999 legislation, military raises will exceed growth in the \nECI by one-half percent per year through fiscal year 2006. However, \nstarting in 2007, military raises will revert to being capped one-half \npercentage point below the ECI.\n  As a former ranking member and long-time member on the Personnel \nSubcommittee when Senator John Glenn was the chairman, my experience \nwith capping military raises below ECI during the last three decades \nshows that such caps inevitably lead to significant retention problems \namong second-term and career service members.\n  Those retention problems cost our Nation more in the long run in \nterms of lost military experience, decreased readiness, and increased \ntraining costs. Since military pay was last comparable with private \nsector pay in 1982, military pay raises have lagged a cumulative 6.4 \npercent behind private sector wage growth--although recent efforts of \nthe executive and legislative branches have reduced the gap \nsignificantly from its peak of 13.5 percent in 1999. Our efforts in \n1999 increased pay raises, reformed the pay tables, took nearly 12,000 \nservice members off of food stamps, and established a military Thrift \nSavings Plan.\n  We have to improve upon the 1999 law to ensure future raises track to \ncivilian pay growth so we don't fall back into pay caps that will get \nus back in the negative retention/readiness cycle. Subsequent raises \nafter 2006 must sustain full comparability with increases in the ECI. A \nkey principal of the all volunteer force, AVF, is that military pay \nraises must match private sector pay growth, as measured by ECI. Our \naction in this area will send a strong message of support to our \nservice men and women and their families that will continue to promote \nhigh morale, better quality-of-life, and a more ready military force.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 945\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REVISED ANNUAL PAY ADJUSTMENT PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Annual Adjustment.--Subsection (a) of \n     section 1009 of title 37, United States Code, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(a) Requirement for Annual Adjustment.--Effective on \n     January 1 of each year, the rates of basic pay for members of \n     the uniformed services under section 203(a) of this title \n     shall be increased under this section.''.\n       (b) Effectiveness of Adjustment.--Subsection (b) of such \n     section is amended by striking ``shall--'' and all that \n     follows and inserting ``shall have the force and effect of \n     law.''.\n       (c) Percentage of Adjustment.--Subsection (c) of such \n     section is amended to read as follow:\n       ``(c) Equal Percentage Increase for All Members.--(1) \n     Subject to subsection (d), an adjustment made under this \n     section in a year shall provide all eligible members with an \n     increase in the monthly basic pay that is the percentage \n     (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) by which the \n     ECI for the base quarter of the year before the preceding \n     year exceeds the ECI for the base quarter of the second year \n     before the preceding calendar year (if at all).\n       ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), but subject to \n     subsection (d), the percentage of the adjustment taking \n     effect under this section during each of fiscal years 2004, \n     2005, and 2006, shall be one-half of 1 percentage point \n     higher than the percentage that would otherwise be applicable \n     under such paragraph.''.\n       (d) Publication of Adjusted Rates.--Subsection (e) of such \n     section is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(e) Notice of Allocations.--'' and \n     inserting ``(e) Notification and Publication Requirements.--\n     (1)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) The rates of basic pay that take effect under this \n     section shall be printed in the Federal Register and the Code \n     of Federal Regulations.''.\n       (e) Presidential Determination of Need for Alternative Pay \n     Adjustment.--Such section is further amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (h); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (f) the following new \n     subsection (g):\n       ``(g) Presidential Determination of Need for Alternative \n     Pay Adjustment.--(1) If, because of national emergency or \n     serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare, \n     the President considers the pay adjustment which would \n     otherwise be required by this section in any year to be \n     inappropriate, the President shall prepare and transmit to \n     Congress before September 1 of the preceding year a plan for \n     such alternative pay adjustments as the President considers \n     appropriate, together with the reasons therefor.\n       ``(2) In evaluating an economic condition affecting the \n     general welfare under this subsection, the President shall \n     consider pertinent economic measures including the Indexes of \n     Leading Economic Indicators, the Gross National Product, the \n     unemployment rate, the budget deficit, the Consumer Price \n     Index, the Producer Price Index, the Employment Cost Index, \n     and the Implicit Price Deflator for Personal Consumption \n     Expenditures.\n       ``(3) The President shall include in the plan submitted to \n     Congress under paragraph (1) an assessment of the impact that \n     the alternative pay adjustments proposed in the plan would \n     have on the Government's ability to recruit and retain well-\n     qualified persons for the uniformed services.''.\n       (f) Definitions.--Such section, as amended by subsection \n     (e), is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) The term `ECI' means the Employment Cost Index (wages \n     and salaries, private industry workers) published quarterly \n     by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n       ``(2) The term `base quarter' for any year is the 3-month \n     period ending on September 30 of such year.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 946. A bill to enhance competition for prescription drugs by \nincreasing the ability of the Department of Justice and Federal Trade \nCommission to enforce existing antitrust laws regarding brand name \ndrugs and generic drugs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last November, the Drug Competition Act \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent. This morning, I am proud to \njoin Senator Grassley, along with Senators Durbin, Feingold, Kohl and \nSchumer in re-introducing this important bill, I hope that in this \nCongress it is actually enacted into law. Prescription drug prices are \nrapidly increasing, and are a source of considerable concern to many \nAmericans, especially senior citizens and families. Generic drug prices \ncan be as much as 80 percent lower than the comparable brand name \nversion.\n  While the Drug Competition Act is small in terms of length, it is \nlarge in terms of impact. It will ensure that law enforcement agencies \ncan take quick and decisive action against companies that are driven \nmore by greed than by good sense. It gives the Federal Trade Commission \nand the Justice Department access to information about secret deals \nbetween drug companies that keep generic drugs off the market. This is \na practice that hurts American families, particularly senior citizens, \nby denying them access to low-cost generic drugs, and further inflating \nmedical costs.\n  Last fall, the Federal Trade Commission released a comprehensive \nreport on barriers the entry of generic drugs into the pharmaceutical \nmarketplace. The FTC had two recommendations to improve the current \nsituation and to close the loopholes in the law that allow drug \nmanufacturers to manipulate the timing of generics' introduction to the \nmarket. One of those recommendations was simply to enact our bill, as \nthe most effective solution to the problem of ``sweetheart'' deals \nbetween brand name and generic drug manufacturers that keep generic \ndrugs off the market, thus depriving consumers of the benefits of \nquality drugs at lower prices. In short, this bill enjoys the \nunqualified endorsement of the current FTC, which follows on the \nsupport by the Clinton Administration's FTC during the initial stages \nof our formulation of this bill. We can all have every confidence in \nthe common sense approach that our bill takes to ensuring that our law \nenforcement agencies have the information they need to take quick \naction, if necessary, to protect consumers from drug companies that \nabuse the law.\n  Under current law, the first generic manufacturer that gets \npermission to sell a generic drug before the patent on the brand-name \ndrug expires, enjoys protection from competition for 180\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\ndays--a headstart on other generic companies. That was a good idea--but \nthe unfortunate loophole exploited by a few is that secret deals can be \nmade that allow the manufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-\nday grace period--to block other generic drugs from entering the \nmarket--while, at the same time, getting paid by the brand-name \nmanufacturer not to sell the generic drug.\n  Our legislation closes this loophole for those who want to cheat the \npublic, but keeps the system the same for companies engaged in true \ncompetition. I think it is important for Congress not to overreact and \nthrow out the good with the bad. Most generic companies want to take \nadvantage of this 180-day provision and deliver quality generic drugs \nat much lower costs for consumers. We should not eliminate the \nincentive for them. Instead, we should let the FTC and Justice look at \nevery deal that could lead to abuse, so that only the deals that are \nconsistent with the intent of that law will be allowed to stand. The \nDrug Competition Act accomplishes precisely that goal, and helps ensure \neffective and timely access to generic pharmaceuticals that can lower \nthe cost of prescription drugs for seniors, for families, and for all \nof us.\n  I regret that some in the Senate stalled action on this worthwhile \nmeasure until very late in the last Congress and that the House chose \nnot to act at all, and I hope that the growing need for more cost-\neffective health care solutions will serve as a catalyst for quick \naction on this needed legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Leahy today \nin introducing the Drug Competition Act of 2003. This bill will help \nFederal regulators ensure that there is full and unfettered access to \ncompetition for prescription drugs under the law. As the past Chairman \nof the Special Committee on Aging and now as the Chairman of the \nFinance Committee, I want to make sure that American consumers--\nespecially our seniors--are able to get the life-saving drugs they need \nin a competitive manner.\n  Our patent laws provide drug companies with incentives to invest in \nresearch and development of new drugs. But the law also provides that \ngeneric drug companies have the ability to get their own drugs on the \nmarket so that there can be price competition and lower prices for \nprescription drugs. We have a legal system in place that provides for \nsuch a balance--the Hatch-Waxman law. Ultimately, we want consumers and \nseniors to have more choices and to get drugs at lower prices.\n  So, I was concerned when I heard reports that the Federal Trade \nCommission had brought enforcement actions against brand-name and \ngeneric drug manufacturers that had entered into anti-competitive \nagreements, resulting in the delay of the introduction of lower priced \ndrugs. This bill targets that problem.\n  Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, manufacturers of generic drugs are \nencouraged to challenge weak or invalid patents on brand-name drugs so \nconsumers can benefit from lower generic drug prices. Current law gives \ntemporary protection from competition to the first generic drug \nmanufacturer that gets exclusive permission to sell a generic drug \nbefore the patent on the brand-name drug expires. This gives the \ngeneric firm a 180-day head start on other generic companies.\n  However, the FTC discovered that some companies were exploiting this \nlaw by entering into secret deals, which allowed the generic drug \nmakers to claim the 180-day grace period and to block other generic \ndrugs from entering the market, while at the same time getting paid by \nthe brand-name manufacturer for withholding sales of the generic \nversion of the drug. This meant that consumers continued to pay high \nprices for drugs, rather than benefiting from more competitive and \nlower prices. So the FTC brought enforcement actions against these \ncompanies.\n  In addition, the FTC conducted a comprehensive review of agreements \nthat impacted the 180-day exclusivity period. The FTC found that there \nare competition problems with some of these agreements that potentially \ndelayed generic drug entry into the market. The FTC recommended:\n\n       Given this history, we believe that notification of such \n     agreements to the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. \n     Department of Justice is warranted. We support the Drug \n     Competition Act of 2001, S. 754, introduced by Senator Leahy, \n     as reported by the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n  The Drug Competition Act is a simple solution to the 180-day \nexclusivity problems that the FTC has identified.

A bill to establish a commission to assess the military \nfacility structure of the United States overseas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today Senator Feinstein and I are \nintroducing the ``Overseas Military Facility Structure Review Act'' to \nestablish a congressional panel to conduct a detailed study of U.S. \nmilitary facilities overseas. This bill creates a bipartisan \ncongressional commission charged with undertaking an objective and \nthorough review of our overseas basing structure. The commission will \nconsider a host of criteria to determine whether our overseas bases are \nprepared to meet our needs in the 21st Century. The commission will be \ncomprised of national security and foreign affairs experts who will \npresent their findings to the 2005 domestic Base Realignment and \nClosure, BRAC, Commission, providing a comprehensive analysis of our \nworldwide base and force structure.\n  We believe it is important to determine our overseas basing \nrequirements, assess training constraints, and provide recommendations \non future realignments. As a result, we are proposing legislation that \nwould create a congressional Overseas Basing Commission to review our \nbasing strategy to ensure that it is consistent with both our short- \nand long-term national security objectives. We believe the time is \nright to move forward with a more structured approach to reviewing \nthese overseas bases.\n  Such a review is timely. The 2005 BRAC is just around the corner and \nsome in the Pentagon have suggested it could result in the closure of \nnearly one out of every four domestic bases. Before we close stateside \nmilitary bases, we must first analyze our overseas infrastructure. If \nwe reduce our overseas presence, we need stateside bases to station \nreturning troops. It is senseless to close bases on U.S. soil in 2005 \nonly to determine a few years later that we made a costly, irrevocable \nmistake. A painful lesson we learned in the last rounds of closures.\n  Though our military force structure has decreased since the Cold War, \nthe responsibilities placed upon our service members have significantly \nincreased. While operational effectiveness is paramount, it would be \nirresponsible to build on an inefficient, obsolete overseas base \nstructure, as we face new strategic threats in the 21st century, taking \nvaluable dollars needed elsewhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5495-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 122--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nPRESIDENT SHOULD DESIGNATE MAY 1, 2003 AS ``NATIONAL CHILD CARE WORTHY \n                               WAGE DAY''\n\n  Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nKerry, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CHILD CARE WORTHY WAGE \n                   DAY.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should designate May 1, 2003, as \n     ``National Child Care Worthy Wage Day''.\n       (b) Proclamation.--The Senate requests the President to \n     issue a proclamation--\n       (1) designating May 1, 2003, as ``National Child Care \n     Worthy Wage Day''; and\n       (2) calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Child Care Worthy Wage Day'' by--\n       (A) honoring early childhood educators and programs in \n     their communities; and\n       (B) working together to resolve the early childhood \n     educator compensation crisis.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit, along with \nSenators Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, Kennedy, Kerry and Murray, a \nresolution supporting national Child Care Worthy Wage Day. It is my \nhope that it will bring attention to early childhood education and the \nimportance of attracting and retaining qualified childcare workers.\n  Every day, approximately 13 million children are cared for outside \nthe home so that their parents can work. This figure includes 6 million \nof our Nation's infants and toddlers. Children begin to learn at birth, \nand the quality of care they receive will affect them for the rest of \ntheir lives. Early childcare affects language development, math skills, \nsocial behavior, and general readiness for school. Experienced \nchildcare workers can identify children who have development or \nemotional problems and provide the care they need to take on life's \nchallenges. Through the creative use of play, structured activities and \nindividual attention, childcare workers help young children learn about \nthe world around them and how to interact with others. They also teach \nthe skills children will need to be ready to read and to learn when \nthey go to school.\n  Unfortunately, despite the importance of their work, the committed \nindividuals who nurture and teach our Nation's young children are \nundervalued. The average salary of a childcare worker is about $15,000 \nannually. In 1998, the middle 50 percent of childcare workers and pre-\nschool teachers earned between $5.82 and $8.13 an hour, according to \nthe Department of Labor. The lowest 10 percent of childcare workers \nwere paid an hourly rate of $5.49 or less. Only one third of our \nNation's childcare workers have health insurance and even fewer have \npension plans. This grossly inadequate level of wages and benefits for \nchildcare staff has led to difficulties in attracting and retaining \nhigh quality caretakers and educators. As a result, the turnover rate \nfor childcare providers is 30 percent a year. This high turnover rate \ninterrupts consistent and stable relationships that children need to \nhave with their caregivers.\n  If we want our children cared for by qualified providers with higher \ndegrees and more training, we will have to make sure they are \nadequately compensated. Otherwise, we will continue to lose early \nchildhood educators with BA degrees to kindergarten and first grade, \nlosing some of our best teachers of young children from the early years \nof learning.\n  In order to bring attention to childcare workers, I am sponsoring a \nresolution that would designate May 1 as National Child Care Worthy \nWage Day. On May 1 each year, childcare providers and other early \nchildhood professionals nationwide conduct public awareness and \neducation efforts highlighting the importance of good early childhood \neducation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing the importance of \nthe work and professionalism that childcare workers provide and the \nneed to increase their compensation accordingly. The Nation's childcare \nworkforce, the families who depend on them, and the children they care \nfor, deserve our support.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5496-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5496]]\nSENATE RESOLUTION 123--DESIGNATING APRIL 28, 2003, THROUGH MAY 2, 2003, \n      AS ``NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS WEEK,'' AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Frist, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \nCarper, and Mr. Bayh) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

I would \nalso like to thank Becky Mattson of Lakeside, Montana, who has taken \nthis cause to heart and championed it for so long.\n  In the aftermath of September 11th, Americans united in an \nunprecedented way. With the threat of terrorism still very real, it has \nnever been so important to remain unified and conscious of the concerns \nof our neighbors.\n  This resolution has a long history. This resolution was first \nproposed by a fellow Montanan, Senator Mike Mansfield, in 1971. \nNational Good Neighbor Day was then proclaimed by Presidents Nixon, \nFord, and Carter because, as President Nixon explained, ``the \nresponsibility for building a happier, livelier, fuller life in each of \nour communities must rest, in the end, with each of us.''\n  This bipartisan resolution will set aside a day to promote a better \nunderstanding and appreciation of our neighbors.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 125, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Gregg, Lieberman, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 125) designating April 28, 2003, \n     through May 2, 2003, as ``National Charter Schools Week,'' \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today my colleagues, Senators Lieberman, \nFrist, Alexander, Carper and Bayh, joined me in the introduction of S. \nRes. 125, a resolution to designate the week of April 28 through May 2, \n2003, as National Charter Schools Week. This year marks the 11th \nanniversary of the opening of the Nation's first charter school in \nMinnesota. In the last 11 years, we have come a long way since that \nauspicious moment when one teacher collaborating with parents started a \npublic school specifically designed to meet the needs of the students \nin the community.\n  Today, we have almost 2,700 charter schools serving nearly 700,000 \nstudents. Charter schools are immensely popular: two-thirds of them \nreport having long waiting lists, and there are currently enough \nstudents on waiting lists to fill another 1,000 average-sized charter \nschools. Survey after survey shows parents are overwhelmingly satisfied \nwith their children's charter schools.\n  Charter schools are popular for a variety of reasons. They are \ngenerally free from the burdensome regulations and policies that govern \ntraditional public schools. They are founded and run by principals, \nteachers, and parents who share a common vision of education, a vision \nwhich guides each and every decision made at the schools, from hiring \npersonnel to selecting curricula. Furthermore, charter schools are held \naccountable for student performance in a unique way--if they fail to \neducate their students well and meet the goals of their charters, they \nclose.\n  Since each charter school represents the unique vision of its \nfounders, these schools vary greatly, but all strive for excellence.\n  For example, the Jean Massieu Academy in Arlington, TX, was created \nin 1999 to serve deaf and hearing-impaired children and their siblings. \nAll instruction at Jean Massieu is in American Sign Language, \naccompanied by English text. For 2 consecutive years, the academy has \nearned the second-highest rating in the State's accountability system \nbased on its students' excellent performance.\n  Here in the District of Columbia, low-income fifth graders at KIPP \nDC/KEY Academy performed remarkably in reading and math on a national \ntest, increasing their scores by more than twice the amount children \ntypically gain from year to year. Students and teachers at the KEY \nAcademy log long hours, attending class from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. each \nweekday, half a day on many Saturdays, and for much of the summer, but \ntheir hard work is obviously reaping rewards.\n\n  These are but a handful of the success stories in the charter school \nmovement, which includes a wide range of schools serving a variety of \ndifferent learning needs and styles, often at a lower cost than \ntraditional public schools.\n  I expect that we will see the popularity of charter schools continue \nto grow. Last year, the President signed into law the No Child Left \nBehind Act, which gives parents in low-performing schools the option to \ntransfer to another public school. The act also provides school \ndistricts with the option of converting low-performing schools into \ncharter schools. I believe these provisions will strengthen the charter \nschool movement by creating more opportunities for charter school \ndevelopment. And, as parents exercise their right to school choice and \n``vote with their feet'', the demand for charters schools will grow.\n  I commend the more than 1.6 million people involved in the charter \nschool movement, from parents to teachers to community leaders and \nmembers of the business community. Together, they have led the charge \nin education reform and have started a revolution with the potential to \ntransform our system of public education. Districts with a large number \nof charter schools reported becoming more customer service oriented and \ncreating new education programs, many of which are similar to those \noffered by charter schools, and increasing contact with parents. These \nimprovements benefit all our students, not just those who choose \ncharter schools.\n  I encourage my colleagues to visit a charter school this week to \nwitness firsthand the ways in which these innovative schools are making \na difference, both in the lives of the students they serve as well as \nin the community in which they reside.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements related thereto be \nprinted in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

The \nitems under discussion include the State Department authorization bill, \nthe bioshield bill, the FISA legislation, and several judicial \nnominations. Therefore, Members should anticipate additional votes \nduring tomorrow's session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there was some discussion on the floor today \nthat the minority would move to the nomination of Prado tomorrow. That \nis a debatable motion when we are in executive session. We have been in \ncontact with the majority. In fact, the distinguished majority whip and \nI have been talking all afternoon to try to work something out. We \nunderstand the difficulty of our doing what we have said we would \nlikely do. We acknowledge it is better that the majority sets the \nschedule. But there are times when we have to try to protect our \nrights.\n  I am the one who said I would do this at the first opportunity. I am \nnot going to do that tomorrow until the ability we have to work out a \nfair proposal on a number of circuit court judges is exhausted. We were \nvery close to doing something on that tonight. I am confident the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky and I can work something out \ntomorrow, with the consent of both of our caucuses.\n  So I just want to put everyone on notice that I am not going to move \nto Prado tomorrow and that we are going to try to work things out on \nour own, and that would be the most expeditious and, I am sure, best \nway to go. I am confident and hopeful we can do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just add that the Senator from Nevada \nand I spent some considerable amount of time this afternoon trying to \nclear some additional votes for nominees for the circuit court, and we \nare going to continue that effort tomorrow in the hopes of reaching an \nagreement to dispose of some of these nominations that are going to be \nallowed to be voted on, on an up-or-down basis. We will continue that \neffort in the morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/29/senate-section/article/S5499-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
