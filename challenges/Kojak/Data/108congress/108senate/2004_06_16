Today the first 30 minutes of morning business will be \nunder the control of the minority, to be followed by 30 minutes under \nthe control of this side of the aisle. Following this morning business \nperiod, the Senate will resume consideration of the Defense \nauthorization bill. The agreement reached last night allows for 30 \nadditional minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the \namendment of Senator Dodd relating to the use of contractors and the \ncustody of prisoners. Therefore, that vote can be expected shortly \nafter 10:30 this morning.\n  Last night, Senators Warner and Levin began working through a list of \namendments and potential time agreements. Real progress was made. We \nwill continue those discussions this morning to see which amendments \nboth sides are prepared to vote on over the course of today. I hope we \ncan have another productive day today and dispose of a number of these \ndefense-related amendments prior to this evening's commitment.\n  Having said that, we are coming to the close of our third week of \nconsideration of this bill. We have had somewhere around 78 amendments \noffered, and we have disposed of 74 of those 78 amendments. I do \nappreciate the effort of my Democratic colleagues to facilitate moving \ntoward closure on this bill. I know they, working with Chairman Warner, \nare doing everything possible to narrow the list of remaining \namendments. Both sides are working hard in that regard. They must \ncontinue to do that because we have a number of amendments still before \nus.\n  I have not ruled out filing cloture on this Defense bill if it \nbecomes necessary, just from a management perspective. Obviously, it \nwould be easier if we could see an end point to the amendments and know \nthat we can complete this bill in a short timeframe. So, again, I \nencourage everyone to show restraint in the amendment process. Over the \ncourse of the day, the leadership on both sides will monitor the course \nof the bill.\n  We will likely revisit our situation on the bill later today and see \nif there is an end point that is near, something to which we can agree. \nIf not, then cloture may be necessary to bring the bill to conclusion.\n  As a reminder, we will stack judicial nominations for votes \nthroughout the day as well. As always, Members will be alerted as these \nvotes are set.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6823-7", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6823-S6824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VISIT TO IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a few remarks on leader time that \nhave to do with a discussion I began on Monday, and that is a followup \non a trip about 12 days ago to Iraq. Again, we awoke today to increased \nterrorist activity in Iraq, with assassination and with sabotage of the \noil supply lines there. I am saddened by the fact we see this terrorist \nactivity, but I will have\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\nto say, as I said on Monday, this increased terrorist activity was \nanticipated. It is unfortunate we have to anticipate this increased \nterrorist activity, but it was very clear from our discussions with the \nIraqi leadership, as well as with our civilians and military leadership \nin Iraq, that the terrorists' goal is to do everything possible to \nobstruct this rule of law, to obstruct this transfer of power, this \ntransfer to sovereignty, this transfer from us being an occupying force \nto a mission.\n  It is not aimed just at the United States or just the coalition, or \nnot just the new Iraqi interim government, but it is ultimately aimed--\nand this is from the Iraqi leadership perspective--at the Iraqi people.\n  The trip we took was with Senator Bennett and Senator Ensign. We did \nhave the opportunity just a few days after the appointment of the new \nPrime Minister to meet with the Prime Minister and have an extended \ndiscussion. The new Prime Minister is Dr. Ayad Allawi. He is a \nneurologist by training. He is someone who 3 weeks ago did not \nanticipate being the new Prime Minister.\n  As I said earlier in the week, what we found in our discussions with \nour leaders there, but even more importantly with the Iraqi leadership, \nis that in spite of this anticipated and actual occurrence of increased \nterrorist activity--really since late March, and it will likely extend \nuntil several weeks or maybe longer after passage of sovereignty on \nJune 30--was a lot of optimism and a lot of confidence in this new \ninterim government. That optimism was tempered with caution and hope, \nbut it was also paired with a real determination to succeed. Backing \ndown in response to these terrorists is simply not an option. That is \nwhat the Iraqis told us, what the new Iraqi interim government told us.\n  In addition, we were encouraged by the confidence that our civilian \nleaders, Ambassador Bremer and his colleagues, have in the new \nministers, or 33 of these new ministers who have been appointed, as \nwell as the new Iraqi leadership, the Prime Minister, the President, \nwho was here last week, and with whom the Democratic leadership and our \nleadership had an opportunity to meet. It is this interim government to \nwhom we will be passing sovereignty on June 30. So to hear this \nconfidence come from people who are on the ground in Iraq, the Iraqi \npeople, as well as our leaders, again, was very reassuring to us.\n  Dr. Allawi has been a longstanding opponent of Saddam Hussein's \nregime.\n  He is a man of great character, and he is widely respected throughout \nIraq. He made it very clear to us that he shares our strategic goals--\nstrategic goals which become a partnership in many ways.\n  In our meeting with the Prime Minister, he stated very clearly that \nwe--he spoke in terms of ``we,'' the Iraqi people, the Iraqi government \nand the United States and the coalition--must again and again come back \nto what we and they are fighting for; that is, freedom and human rights \nand the rule of law.\n  This fight on terrorism is one that he knows will be long. He says it \nis now an Iraqi responsibility, and if these acts of terrorism are acts \nof terrorism against the Iraqi people and their hope for prosperity and \ntheir livelihood--and he would be saying that again and again as Prime \nMinister, and indeed he has done that over the last several days. He \nsaid there are some in Iraq who want to destabilize Iraq, that tyranny \nworks hand in hand with terrorism. He said Iraq has a responsibility at \nthis point to confront this evil in the region and the world; that Iraq \nneeds help but it is Iraq's responsibility.\n  He was quite clear. The forces aligned against us understand that if \nIraq is successful and succeeds in establishing the rule of law, those \nforces are defeated, but if Iraq fails as a state, then terrorism may \nbe uncontrollable there--but also throughout the Middle East. He told \nus that a healthy Iraq will lead to a healthy and more stable Middle \nEast region.\n  He also made clear that Iraq cannot succeed without the assistance of \nthe United States, the international community, and the coalition \nforces.\n  He outlined to us various processes that must be worked in parallel \nif Iraq is to succeed in rebuilding the Iraqi institutions that were \nhurt, destroyed, and run in the ground by Saddam Hussein. We talked \nabout the court system, the police force, the transformation of Iraqi \nsociety, and ensuring that political reform leads to Iraqis choosing \ntheir own leaders.\n  He said these two goals are, No. 1, security, and No. 2, free \nelections.\n  As we all know, this interim government will serve for a period of \nabout 6 months at which time free elections will take place in January \nof next year.\n  A fourth point he made is to pursue economic development.\n  Again, he came back to the terrorists--that the terrorist activity \nthere and the fighting going on there discourages investment in Iraq.\n  A major goal of the Prime Minister is to build consensus so that in \nIraq a national identity will prevail. Their goal, though, continues to \nbe hindered by Saddam's policy of divide and rule that Saddam purposely \nused to fracture Iraq over decades.\n  The Prime Minister said we need to help the country in order to move \nforward, and to do that we need to put that Iraqi face on security, to \nput that Iraqi face on the reconstruction and other efforts to \nrehabilitate the country.\n  He assured us that under the new leadership of the interim Iraqi \ngovernment which will occur that it will be the Iraqis who will be \ntelling the Iraqi story.\n  The central part of the Prime Minister's policy will be to combat \nterrorism.\n\n  We very quickly moved into the importance of having a strong judicial \nsystem--a strong rule of law to support the system, as he described it.\n  He pointed out that Iraq must improve and expedite the training of \npolice and security forces in the country. He thanked us for providing \ntremendous assistance as they rebuild that police and security force.\n  Iraq needs to take steps with the help of its neighbors to tighten \nborder controls and stop terrorist trafficking.\n  The Prime Minister also intends to make clear to the Iraqi people \nthat the terrorist attacks we are seeing on this infrastructure--such \nas the tragedy of the sabotage of the oilfields over the last 24 \nhours--are attacks on the Iraqi people. He says this again and again--\nthat terrorism hurts the Iraqi people, and thus it is the \nresponsibility of the Iraqi people to come back and confront the \nterrorists.\n  As we wrapped up our meeting with the Prime Minister, he very soberly \nsaid that as Iraq moves closer and closer to democracy, the more the \nterrorists will attack. Indeed, that is exactly what we are seeing over \nthe last several weeks since late March, and again will likely continue \nfor the next several weeks.\n  He wanted us to understand that he and most Iraqis deeply appreciate \nthe sacrifices that the United States of America has made for his \ncountry, for freedom, for rule of law, and for that move toward \ndemocracy.\n  Thus, while the road ahead will be difficult, the Iraqi people we \nbelieve--having just been there--are fortunate to have such a dedicated \npublic servant with his vision and the will to work toward a free and \ndemocratic Iraq. The Iraqi people have a true leader in Prime Minister \nAllawi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6824-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, we have so much to do in this body and \nso much to talk about. But I can't think of anything more important for \nus to talk about than relieving the stress on working families and the \nAmerican people.\n  We had a joint session yesterday where we heard the President of \nAfghanistan who very joyously spoke of the brilliant spirit of the \nAmerican people. I think if we look at that brilliant spirit and what \ncomposes us as American people and the things we are able to do, it \nultimately depends on what makes us the kind of people we are.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to the American people. For well over 200 \nyears, the American people have proven their ability to overcome all \nmanner of obstacles. At times they have done so with the help of their \nduly elected government officials, and at times they have done so in \nspite of their duly elected government officials. But either way, in \nthe end, the spirit and character of the American people move this \nNation toward a greater realization of the principle written about by \nThomas Jefferson over 228 years ago.\n  I am not normally a betting person, but I say that putting your money \non the American people is about as close to a sure bet as you are going \nto get.\n  In 1945, when millions of soldiers came home from the war, this \nNation put its money on the American people, and it gave those who \nserved this country the GI bill so they could educate themselves and \nmake a better life for them and for their families. That investment \nhelped to create an economic boom the likes of which this Nation has \nnever seen--not to mention the talented minds that were nurtured and \nthose who were given the opportunity to reach their potential. Millions \nof families were able to raise their economic standing and take part in \nthe American dream. That economic expansion is one of the clearest \nexamples that investments in education can pay off.\n\n  As I mentioned, we have many issues to talk about, much to do for the \nsecurity of our Nation and the people. One of the key factors in making \nsure we deal with these issues and we have the ability to provide the \nsecurity--whether it be economic, whether it be social, or whether it \nbe the values and simple security of families in this country--depends \non the American spirit. It is simple. If we invest in the American \npeople, the American people always bring this Nation a good return.\n  Now we are faced with new economic realities and new challenges in an \ninformation age as well as an age where wars will be fought in many \ndifferent ways than what we have seen in the past. The question is, Are \nwe investing in the American people the way we once did in 1945? Are we \nproviding for another of the greatest generations of Americans, or are \nwe missing the opportunity to provide for the children of today who \nwill be the future of this country?\n  Last month I was in Garland County, AR, for the grand opening of the \nnew Head Start Center there. It was a proud day for me. The center was \nnamed in my honor, but it was not just because the center would be \nassociated with my name that I was proud, but more importantly because \nmy name would be associated with a center of learning. I remarked that \nday that programs such as Head Start were practical ways we could \nprovide opportunity for working mothers to raise their economic \nstanding, to eliminate some of the stress on these working families, \nthese working American families who are at the base of what this Nation \nis all about. Head Start can be the difference between a family \nbecoming part of the economic mainstream. When mothers have a nurturing \nplace to send their children, they can go to work or to school with the \nkind of confidence they need to reach their potential. They are not put \nin the terrible position of having to choose between employment and the \nsafety or health of their children.\n  With the rise we are seeing in both child abuse and neglect because \nof the cuts in so many vital assistance programs, the need for \nchildcare is at an alltime high in this country. More than just \nrelieving the stress of finding good childcare, a program such as Head \nStart helps to prepare children for a lifetime of learning.\n  Everyone knows the more you learn, the more you earn. In seeing the \nchildren in that Head Start Program walking by, all of those little 4-\nyear-olds with their Styrofoam cup, with their individual toothbrush in \ntheir hand, so proud they were learning something that was going to be \na part of their life forever--good dental hygiene. It is not just \nteaching reading, writing, and arithmetic; it is teaching these \nchildren how to be a person who can then contribute their whole \npotential to their community and Nation. They returned from having \nbrushed their teeth with this huge smile on their face about what they \nhad learned.\n  These are programs vital to this country and its well-being. Families \nin Arkansas recognize the hope that programs such as Head Start and \nchildcare assistance programs provide. Right now, 800-plus Arkansas \nfamilies are waiting for childcare assistance. Think of that. There are \n800 families in line for hope in reaching the American dream. However, \nfor some reason this administration does not want to give that hope a \nchance. In the President's budget request, almost 40 programs to help \nlow-income working families make that transition into the economic \nmainstream through programs such as Head Start were not adequately \nfunded.\n\n  In addition to cutting programs to help working families, this \nadministration has failed to fully fund the bipartisan No Child Left \nBehind Act. Last year, No Child Left Behind was underfunded by as much \nas $9 billion. I supported No Child Left Behind because I believed that \nwith proper funding it would give children an opportunity to reach \ntheir full educational potential. I still believe that it can be an \neffective engine of reform in our public education system. For that \nreform to be effective, it is going to require significant investment, \nwhich so far has not been forthcoming from this administration.\n  Unless we make education a priority, an entire generation of \nAmericans could miss out on the American dream. The fact is our economy \nhas changed, but our approach to supporting and funding education has \nnot. We are training our children to take on manufacturing jobs that no \nlonger exist or are quickly disappearing. Not only are we losing \nmanufacturing jobs, but now technical and highly skilled tasks are \nleaving our shores for cheaper highly educated workers. We can no \nlonger settle for doing what we have always done.\n  This administration believes we can have champagne for the price of \nbeer. The reality is, if you poorly fund education, you get a poor \neducational system.\n  But the good news is that if you properly fund education--from Head \nStart through high school--the chances of a world class education \nsystem go up exponentially.\n  If we are to give working mothers, fathers and their children an \nopportunity to live the American dream we must invest in their future.\n  As I said at the outset, every time we have put our money on the \nAmerican people it has paid off. Let's take that bet and make the \ninvestment one more time.\n  I believe the children of today who are the brilliant spirit of the \nAmerican people of the future, are worth the investment.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Florida, Senator \nNelson.\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6825-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6825-S6826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AMERICAN SPIRIT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

That investment \nhelped to create an economic boom the likes of which this Nation has \nnever seen--not to mention the talented minds that were nurtured and \nthose who were given the opportunity to reach their potential. Millions \nof families were able to raise their economic standing and take part in \nthe American dream. That economic expansion is one of the clearest \nexamples that investments in education can pay off.\n\n  As I mentioned, we have many issues to talk about, much to do for the \nsecurity of our Nation and the people. One of the key factors in making \nsure we deal with these issues and we have the ability to provide the \nsecurity--whether it be economic, whether it be social, or whether it \nbe the values and simple security of families in this country--depends \non the American spirit. It is simple. If we invest in the American \npeople, the American people always bring this Nation a good return.\n  Now we are faced with new economic realities and new challenges in an \ninformation age as well as an age where wars will be fought in many \ndifferent ways than what we have seen in the past. The question is, Are \nwe investing in the American people the way we once did in 1945? Are we \nproviding for another of the greatest generations of Americans, or are \nwe missing the opportunity to provide for the children of today who \nwill be the future of this country?\n  Last month I was in Garland County, AR, for the grand opening of the \nnew Head Start Center there. It was a proud day for me. The center was \nnamed in my honor, but it was not just because the center would be \nassociated with my name that I was proud, but more importantly because \nmy name would be associated with a center of learning. I remarked that \nday that programs such as Head Start were practical ways we could \nprovide opportunity for working mothers to raise their economic \nstanding, to eliminate some of the stress on these working families, \nthese working American families who are at the base of what this Nation \nis all about. Head Start can be the difference between a family \nbecoming part of the economic mainstream. When mothers have a nurturing \nplace to send their children, they can go to work or to school with the \nkind of confidence they need to reach their potential. They are not put \nin the terrible position of having to choose between employment and the \nsafety or health of their children.\n  With the rise we are seeing in both child abuse and neglect because \nof the cuts in so many vital assistance programs, the need for \nchildcare is at an alltime high in this country. More than just \nrelieving the stress of finding good childcare, a program such as Head \nStart helps to prepare children for a lifetime of learning.\n  Everyone knows the more you learn, the more you earn. In seeing the \nchildren in that Head Start Program walking by, all of those little 4-\nyear-olds with their Styrofoam cup, with their individual toothbrush in \ntheir hand, so proud they were learning something that was going to be \na part of their life forever--good dental hygiene. It is not just \nteaching reading, writing, and arithmetic; it is teaching these \nchildren how to be a person who can then contribute their whole \npotential to their community and Nation. They returned from having \nbrushed their teeth with this huge smile on their face about what they \nhad learned.\n  These are programs vital to this country and its well-being. Families \nin Arkansas recognize the hope that programs such as Head Start and \nchildcare assistance programs provide. Right now, 800-plus Arkansas \nfamilies are waiting for childcare assistance. Think of that. There are \n800 families in line for hope in reaching the American dream. However, \nfor some reason this administration does not want to give that hope a \nchance. In the President's budget request, almost 40 programs to help \nlow-income working families make that transition into the economic \nmainstream through programs such as Head Start were not adequately \nfunded.\n\n  In addition to cutting programs to help working families, this \nadministration has failed to fully fund the bipartisan No Child Left \nBehind Act. Last year, No Child Left Behind was underfunded by as much \nas $9 billion. I supported No Child Left Behind because I believed that \nwith proper funding it would give children an opportunity to reach \ntheir full educational potential. I still believe that it can be an \neffective engine of reform in our public education system. For that \nreform to be effective, it is going to require significant investment, \nwhich so far has not been forthcoming from this administration.\n  Unless we make education a priority, an entire generation of \nAmericans could miss out on the American dream. The fact is our economy \nhas changed, but our approach to supporting and funding education has \nnot. We are training our children to take on manufacturing jobs that no \nlonger exist or are quickly disappearing. Not only are we losing \nmanufacturing jobs, but now technical and highly skilled tasks are \nleaving our shores for cheaper highly educated workers. We can no \nlonger settle for doing what we have always done.\n  This administration believes we can have champagne for the price of \nbeer. The reality is, if you poorly fund education, you get a poor \neducational system.\n  But the good news is that if you properly fund education--from Head \nStart through high school--the chances of a world class education \nsystem go up exponentially.\n  If we are to give working mothers, fathers and their children an \nopportunity to live the American dream we must invest in their future.\n  As I said at the outset, every time we have put our money on the \nAmerican people it has paid off. Let's take that bet and make the \ninvestment one more time.\n  I believe the children of today who are the brilliant spirit of the \nAmerican people of the future, are worth the investment.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Florida, Senator \nNelson.\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6826-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          FLORIDA VOTING ROLLS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I call to the attention of the \nSenate the potential disaster in the making with regard to the \nPresidential election in the State of Florida. Everyone in the country \nknows what we went through 4 years ago in the Presidential election. It \nended up being the difference of 537 votes that then cast Florida's \nelectoral votes to decide the national Presidential election.\n  To the great surprise and dismay of many registered voters who \narrived at the polling places ready to cast their votes 4 years ago, \nthey were told their names had been struck from the voting rolls \nbecause they were convicted felons, when, in fact, they were not. They \nhad a similar name, like John Doe or Jane Doe, that was on a list of \n100,000-plus convicted felon names that had been sent out to the 67 \ncounty election supervisors. They had struck these names.\n  Members of the Senate, we have a disaster in the making again. The \nState of Florida has now sent out a list of 48,000 convicted felons \nwhose names are to be struck from the voting rolls when, in fact, the \nmatches are not guaranteed. To the contrary, several election \nsupervisors have already received the list and noticed, in fact, they \nhave employees in their own offices who were to be struck. They are not \nconvicted felons.\n  We simply cannot allow this to happen. This raises questions about \nour ability to cast our vote in a Presidential election.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I certainly yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the Senator bringing this matter to \nthe attention of the Senate and the country.\n  I have strong views that if someone has been convicted of a crime and \nhas fulfilled the terms of the sentence by that court and completed \ntheir probationary period or period of parole, that person should be \nable to vote. If a sentence is too short, give them longer sentences. \nBut if someone, in effect, has been punished and completed their terms \nof punishment--retribution, call it whatever you want--that person \nshould be able to vote.\n  It should be a national law that when someone completes the terms of \ntheir imprisonment, parole, probation, they should be able to vote. It \nis unfair to people who are trying to get back on their feet to not be \nable to be part of the American system. That is what we want them to \ndo. We send them to prison to be rehabilitated. Part of their \nrehabilitation is the ability to vote.\n\n  Would the Senator acknowledge there is some merit to my statement?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator has pointed out an underlying \nprinciple of fairness. Florida is only one of seven States that has a \nprocess whereby a convicted felon has to restore their voting rights.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n  I conclude by saying to the Senator from Nevada, it is important. \nThis is another principle that is about to be violated; that is, the \nprinciple of the right to vote--that if you are a registered voter, and \nyou get to the voting precinct, you find you cannot vote because your \nname has been mistakenly struck because it happens to be a match with \nthe name of a convicted felon under another Florida law.\n  So what I have done is filed a friend of the court brief, an amicus \ncurie, along with the CNN suit against the State of Florida that says \nthe public ought to have a right to inspect those voting rolls and \nthose lists of 48,000 names to be struck.\n  The State of Florida says, under a law, the public cannot inspect \nthose records and copy them. I hope the suit will be successful in \ndeclaring the law unconstitutional and remove this cloud from our \nability to vote.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from the great State of Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6826-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6826-S6828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HAMMERING THE MIDDLE CLASS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what we see happening in America today, \nafter 3\\1/2\\ years of this administration, is what I call the middle-\nclass squeeze, a squeeze which has been tightened incredibly by the \npolicies of the Bush administration. The truth really is, it is not so \nmuch they are being squeezed, the middle class is actually being \nhammered.\n  Think about it. Since Mr. Bush took office in January of 2001, nearly \n2 million private sector jobs have been lost, putting downward pressure \non wages and salaries. There has been some job growth over the last \ncouple of months, but just since the passage of the 2003 tax bill, 11 \nmonths ago, our economy created 1.2 million fewer jobs than the \nPresident's own Council of Economic Advisers predicted would be created \nwithout the tax bill. We have 2 million fewer jobs than what they \npredicted if they passed the tax bill.\n  Now, again, there have been a few jobs in the last couple months. Of \ncourse, when the glass is dry, a drop of water seems like an ocean. \nThat is what we have had. We have had a couple drops of water. We have \nhad a couple months of job growth, but you don't judge an \nadministration by 2 months, you judge it by 4 years, and over 4 years \nwe have lost almost 2 million jobs. That is not even the half of it.\n  Family income has fallen 2 percent. Housing prices have increased 18 \npercent. Health insurance premiums are up 50 percent. Utility bills are \nup more than 15 percent. Credit card fees have doubled. And, in large \nmeasure, because of the Bush tax cuts and their negative impact on our \nState budgets, college tuition, under the Bush administration, is up a \nwhopping 35 percent.\n  Do you know who pays college tuition? The middle class. Meanwhile, as \nthe middle class gets squeezed, Mr. Bush's base has never had it so \ngood. I refer my colleagues to an article in yesterday's Wall Street \nJournal titled ``U.S. Led a Resurgence Last Year Among Millionaires \nWorld-Wide.'' This article, in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, reports \nthat the number of North Americans with over $1 million in financial or \nliquid assets increased by 13.5 percent last year, and their assets \nincreased by 13.6 percent. At the same time, the wealth of the ultra-\nhigh net worth individuals--those with over $30 million in assets--grew \nto a total of $2.5 trillion.\n  In the last 3 years, corporate profits are up over fourfold--62 \npercent over the past 3 years--but private wages are actually down. \nWhen we look at all compensation, private wages are less than one-third \nof normal growth.\n  It says in this journal article that the number of millionaires in \nthe U.S. is up, as I said, 14 percent--actually 13.6 percent--and that \n``the U.S. and Canada together added more new millionaires last year \nthan Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East combined.''\n  Well, so much for the Bush tax breaks for the wealthy. That is \nexactly who they are helping. Clearly, the President's policies--tax \ncuts for the rich, lower taxes on investment income--are working for \nthose at the top, but it is not working for those on Main Street. This \nadministration is ignoring Main Street. It might be listening to Wall \nStreet, but it is ignoring Main Street. Quite frankly, what Main Street \nis telling us, loudly and clearly, is that their No. 1 concern is \neconomic security.\n\n  In the State of Iowa and across America, despite all the happy talk \nabout the economy, people fear losing their jobs, their retirement, \ntheir health care. They are also worried about losing their right to \ntime-and-a-half overtime. With the Labor Department's new overtime \nrule, people will be obligated to work 45, 50, 55, 60 hours a week with \nzero additional compensation. That is what is happening to the middle \nclass.\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\n  Basically, it is hitting women more than anyone else. This is one \ngroup disproportionately harmed by the proposed new overtime rules. \nWhy? Because the fact is, women tend to dominate in retail services and \nsales positions that would be particularly affected by this new \novertime rule.\n  Married women increased their working hours by nearly 40 percent in \nthe last 30 years. Consequently, their contribution to family income \nhas also risen. So you have the squeeze on the middle class, which is \nnow seeing the administration taking away their right to time-and-a-\nhalf overtime.\n  I have not even mentioned the discrimination against women in the \nworkplace in terms of wages. Millions of women are working in female-\ndominated jobs, as social workers, teachers, childcare workers, and \nnurses, with equivalent skill, effort, responsibility, and working \nconditions as similar jobs dominated by men, but these women are not \npaid the same as their counterparts in the male sector.\n  This is wrong and it must end. That is why I introduced the Fair Pay \nAct in April 2003 to make sure women who are in these jobs are treated \nfairly and equitably.\n  In summary, this President, George W. Bush, has presided over the \nlargest job loss of any President since the Great Depression. Yet he \nremains wedded to policies that are making the problem worse for the \nmiddle class. His administration has praised the outsourcing of jobs as \nsomething good for our economy. This administration opposes any \nincrease in the minimum wage. They oppose extending unemployment \nbenefits. They are trying to take away the overtime rights of millions \nof American workers. This administration has done nothing to help \nequalize pay for women in the workplace.\n  It all adds up to one thing: The middle class in America is getting \nhammered. It is time for a change. It is time to change our economic \ncourse. It is time to quit squeezing and hammering the American middle \nclass.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from the great State of \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, before I begin, let me compliment the Senator from \nIowa for addressing a topic on which I also want to speak. I think \n``hammered'' probably is the right term for what is happening to the \nmiddle class as opposed to ``squeezing.'' That would be more reflective \nof the real desperation that many families feel.\n  Twenty-five years ago, generally, one member of a family was working. \nNow it takes two just to get by. Real wages are not growing in this \neconomy. I think the Senator from Iowa points out very clearly how that \nis so painful in the lives of middle-class Americans.\n  Particularly apt is his reference to this overtime pay, which \nabsolutely goes to the heart of the middle class. The idea that we are \ntrying to squeeze down or hammer down the ability to generate real \nearnings for working Americans is just inconceivable.\n  I think the efforts of the Senator from Iowa are absolutely \nremarkable. We need to make sure America understands what is going on \nwith regard to putting pressure on the earnings of the middle-\nclass. That is what makes America great. It always has. It built \nAmerica.\n\n  As one can see from this chart, average weekly earnings are up 1 \npercent during the time the President has been in office. Those are the \nlost jobs about which the Senator spoke. In the last 4 months, real \nwages for working Americans have gone down. We saw another statistic \nyesterday that indicated they are declining.\n  In that context, as the Senator from Iowa pointed out, college \ntuition costs are up. He said 35 percent. The numbers depend on how one \ncalculates it. We have near 30 percent. Family health care premiums are \nup 36 percent. Gas prices are up 28 percent. At least in New Jersey, \nthere have been property tax increases of 7 percent-plus every year \nunder this administration's leadership. All we are doing is \ntransferring tax breaks to those who are already doing well, the 13-\npercent increase in millionaires who got the tax cuts, while the \nproperty tax on middle-class folks has gone up. That is why people \ndon't feel comfortable. That is why polls tell people the economy is \nnot working, even though we have seen some statistics in the last 3 to \n5 months that indicate it is working.\n  It is not happening for the breadth of America. People don't focus on \naverages; they focus on what happens in their lives. By the way, \nspeaking of averages, if we put together the 500 times earnings that \nCEOs make versus the low-wage earner in a company, we will come out \nwith a nice average. But what happens to the bulk of the people working \nat the company? They are not seeing wage growth. They are not seeing \ntheir income going up with these kinds of numbers. It translates into a \n``hammering.'' The Senator from Iowa picked the right term.\n  My effort today is to focus on dependent children and elderly family \nmembers because that is another part of where the squeeze is actually \nhappening. It is real. Under this President, we have seen increases in \nchildcare for a two-child family go up $2,050 over the last 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. For each individual child, it is about $6,000 a year to maintain \nchildcare. Today, 65 percent of all mothers who are in the labor force \nhave children under the age of 6. We have two partners working in a \nfamily to try to make ends meet, and childcare costs are going off the \ncharts. That is the squeeze. That is money that comes out of their \nability to have a positive quality of life.\n  There is a lot to be done. We had a bipartisan bill, the Snowe-Dodd \nproposal, to increase the welfare proposal by $6 billion worth of \nadditional funding for childcare. Instead, we are getting proposals \nfrom the administration to cut 300,000 kids from childcare. It makes no \nsense. This is a fundamental area. When talking about family values and \nthe importance of helping out communities, lifting them up and making \nends meet, childcare is fundamental. We have one group of folks who \nwant to actually invest in it so that we can make the quality of life \nfor Americans better, and we have another group that wants to take away \nthat ability and has cut 300,000 children from receiving childcare. \nThat makes no sense.\n  Only 1 in 10 children who are eligible to receive Federal assistance \ntoday are actually receiving it because they don't have the resources \nto match against the demand. That doesn't fit with this picture where \nwe are seeing real earnings not going up and the cost of living for the \nmiddle class going up and childcare costs going up and we are not doing \nanything but cutting what we do here.\n\n  Then is the issue of taking care of the elderly, making sure you have \nfamily care, a sick spouse, taking care of a senior, mothers and \nfathers who are retired. It is an incredible burden on all families, \nparticularly if both partners in the family are working. Estimates are \nthat there are about $250 billion worth of services provided by \nfamilies to their own families that have no recognition in our national \naccounts, no recognition by our Federal Government in providing support \nfor it. And 80 percent of home care services are provided by family \ncaregivers. That is good. That is a real family value. But what are we \ndoing to support them, and how does that fit into this whole process of \na middle-class squeeze? It is an important topic that is completely \nunderdescribed.\n  Let me tell you a story about a lady in Monmouth County, NJ. Her name \nis Bernadette Discon. She starts her 20-hour day at 3 in the morning. \nShe works from 3 to 7 a.m. doing medical transcription in her home. She \nwakes her husband who has advanced dementia, and drives him to daycare. \nIt costs $55 a day for her to do that--no support, no help at all. She \nalso has the responsibility of taking care of her 85- and 87-year-old \nmother and father. Neither drives. Neither is able to take care of \nthemselves completely. One must use a walker. Bernadette works all day \nafter she drops off her husband. She returns home at 6 o'clock, goes \nback to transcription work from 7 to 11 at night, trying to make ends \nmeet. This is the kind of story that is actually happening. Her wages \nare going up 1 percent on average across this country. And she is \nhaving to deal with the\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\nkinds of family care problems we talked about that actually happen with \nchildcare.\n  It is not right that America is not addressing some of these social \nneeds while we are seeing these kinds of costs go up. That is why we on \nthis side of the aisle--as well as Senator John Kerry--are talking \nabout a middle-class squeeze because it is real in people's lives. It \nis not the same as what is happening to the GDP or whether you are \nseeing disposable income which takes in dividends and capital gains at \nthe high end and mushes them together and comes out with an average \nresult.\n  What we need to do is look at what is actually happening in the lives \nof working men and women. Bernadette Discon's story is real. It shows \nhow the pressure impacts on an individual's life. If she had kids, \ncollege tuition is going up 28 percent. She is paying 30 percent more \nfor gas. That puts real pressure on a family.\n  It is time to recognize that economics is more than just statistics \nthat are announced on Friday morning at 8:30 to say whether employment \nis up or down. It is the quality of life that goes with those \nstatistics. A lot of people are feeling squeezed. As the Senator from \nIowa said, a lot of families are feeling hammered.\n  It is time for a change, and it is time to recognize the reality of \nwhat is happening in the lives of middle-class Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is recognized \nfor up to 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6828-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STRENGTH\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I intended to come to the floor to speak \nabout Iraq. I will do that. But I must make a comment or two about the \nspeeches that have preceded mine with respect to the economy and what \nis happening.\n  I remember 4 years ago when the Presidential election was in full \nheat. One candidate said the prosperity that we have been experiencing \nis starting to slow down, and the economy is showing signs of being at \nthe end of the business cycle and heading toward a recession. His \npolitical opponent said he was trying to talk down the economy for \npolitical purposes.\n  Well, it turns out he was right. We started a slowdown in the economy \nin the last two quarters of 2000. We ended up with a recession in the \nfirst three quarters of 2001. He was not trying to talk down the \neconomy just for political purposes. He was telling the truth. This \nwas, of course, Governor George W. Bush of Texas.\n  The fact is, the economy is doing extremely well, and there are those \nwho are trying to talk it down for political purposes. This is the \nfact, no matter who is elected President. Whether it is George W. Bush, \nJohn Kerry, Ralph Nader, or the Libertarian, or whoever else may be out \nthere seeking the Presidency, he or she will inherit an extremely \nstrong economy come January of 2005. And whoever it is, if it is not \nGeorge W. Bush, will take credit for that strength and say: See, \nbecause I got elected everything is now wonderful.\n  In fact, the business cycle does not operate that way. The business \ncycle does not pay attention to election days; it pays attention to \nlong-term policies put in place. We had the recession in the beginning \nof 2001 because of economic pressures that built up in the nineties. We \nhave the recovery now taking hold in 2004 that will come into play \nthrough the balance of this year and strongly into next year because of \npolicies that were put in place over the last several years. You cannot \nturn the economy around by a single election. You have to put policies \nin place and see them go forward.\n  It is very interesting to see those particular items President Bush's \nopponents are now focusing on to say this is terrible, this is \nterrible, this is terrible. They have changed now because the items \nthey used to be focused on as the bellwethers of economic activity have \nturned positive. They cannot use the old measuring sticks they said \nwere so important to make the case that the President's economic plan \nis a failure because those measuring sticks have all turned positive \nand now indicate the President's policies were the right ones, so they \npick up new measuring sticks and find an opportunity to blame President \nBush.\n  I am fascinated to know that the increase in property values in New \nJersey in the last few years is President Bush's fault; that when the \nNew Jersey officials increase property taxes to go along with that \nincrease in property values, it is President Bush's fault, and so on \nand so on. We will hear more of that in the months to come. Let us \nremember that the economy responds to a whole series of pressures. No \nPresident can wave a magic wand and create jobs, as one candidate is \npromising to do. Let us realize on that measure, which the President's \nopponents no longer use, jobs are being created now at a faster rate \nthan the President's opponent is promising he would do if he became \nPresident. If you like the rate that the Democratic presumptive nominee \nis proposing for job creation, you have to like the record of George W. \nBush because jobs are being created at a faster rate right now than \nthat proposed rate.\n  Well, Mr. President, I rose to discuss Iraq, and I will do that in \nthe time I have remaining. How much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It goes \nlike this:\n\n       God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot \n     change, the courage to change the things I can, and the \n     wisdom to know the difference.\n\n  I suggest that as we face the world today as the world's strongest \npower economically, militarily, culturally, educationally--in almost \nevery category--we should view our responsibilities through the prism \nof the alcoholic's prayer: Grant us the serenity to accept the things \nwe cannot change, the courage to change the things we can, and the \nwisdom to know the difference.\n  As I listen to the debate on Iraq, as I listen to the partisan and \npolitical comments, many of them well-meaning and properly addressed, I \npray for the third leg of that saying--the wisdom to know the \ndifference between the things we can change and the things we cannot \nbecause many of the things being raised with respect to our situation \nin Iraq are things we cannot change. Many of the complaints are against \nthings we can change, but we are not because we are wallowing in \ncomplaint and self-criticism when we should be moving ahead.\n  Let me give you an example. The first question we need to address \nwith respect to our military activity in Iraq and elsewhere in the \nregion is this: Are we engaged solely in a military exercise with \nrespect to Iraq or are we, in fact, in a world war against terrorism? \nWe need the wisdom to get the answer to that question and know the \ndifference because the difference is vast.\n  I am one who believes that we are, in fact, engaged in a worldwide \nwar against terrorism. We must have the serenity to accept the fact \nthat war is not going to go away if we ignore it. There are many who \nsay there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11; therefore, \nwe should spend all of our time going after those who dealt with 9/11 \nand not pay any attention to Iraq. Well, that may have been a \nlegitimate argument prior to the time we went into Iraq, but it is now \nirrelevant because we are there. We are there because this body, with \nover 70 votes, gave the President our support for going in there; and \nthe United Nations, by a unanimous vote in the Security Council, gave \nthe President support to go in. This body and the United Nations \noverwhelmingly, along with the House of Representatives, said this is \nthe right thing to do. We did it, and we must accept the fact that we \nare there, and complaining about maybe we made a mistake doesn't change \nthe reality that we are there.\n  I am one who thinks we made the right decision. I am happy that David \nKay, the inspector for weapons of mass destruction who went into Iraq, \nthinks we made the right decision. When I talk to audiences in Utah, I \nsay: How many of you know that David Kay discovered there were no \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq? Everybody raises\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\nhis hand. Then I say: How many of you know that David Kay said, based \non what he discovered, that Saddam Hussein was more dangerous than we \nthought? Well, we didn't know that. But that is a fact that we must \nrecognize and have the wisdom to go forward in the face of that fact.\n  Now, if indeed we are engaged in a worldwide war on terror, that \nmeans that our being in Iraq is not only for the sake of the Iraqis, it \nis for the sake of Americans. Some say we have no business being there, \nit is not our country, we don't care. Well, one of the realities we \nhave to face is we are involved in the world whether we like it or not. \nThose on the campaign trail who are saying bring the troops home are \nthe same people who are saying stop buying at any retailer who \npurchases goods abroad. Those who are saying don't have anything to do \nwith any company that has any employees abroad do not realize the \nfundamental truth that America is involved in the world whether we like \nit or not, and we cannot withdraw. We cannot become isolationists. We \ncannot hide behind our two oceans militarily or economically.\n\n  The world has fundamentally changed. It fundamentally changed when \nthe Berlin Wall came down and the ``evil empire'' ceased to exist. We \nare engaged around the world whether we like it or not. We must have \nthe wisdom to recognize that fundamental truth and act accordingly; we \nmust have the courage to act according to the truth.\n  I went to Iraq with the leader and my colleague Senator Ensign from \nNevada and spent a day with the commanders there. You can say that in \none day in Iraq, what do you learn? Obviously, you don't learn \neverything you need to in one day to know the whole situation, but you \nlearn a whole lot more in one day in Iraq than you do sitting in \nAmerica reading the newspapers.\n  I learned the forces that are opposed to us in Iraq have as their \ngoal civil war and a failed state. Ultimately, what they want to have \nhappen is for the Iraqi government that is being created now to fail. \nThey want the Iraqis in anarchy. They want the economy destroyed. Why \nwould they want such terrible things? They think out of that chaos they \ncan seize power and come back into control.\n  Most who are involved in this insurgency are former supporters and \nofficers of Saddam Hussein. They are hoping that through chaos they can \nrecapture that which they could not hold in the face of the American \nmilitary incursion into that country.\n  Grant us the wisdom to know the difference between a difficult \nsituation and an impossible one. There are those who are saying Iraq is \nBush's Vietnam. I do not think Iraq is Bush's Vietnam because Bush did \nnot go into Iraq with the same motives that President Kennedy went into \nVietnam, with the same naivete that President Kennedy and President \nJohnson pursued Vietnam.\n  We should have the courage to change the situation in Iraq by \npersistence, by holding the course steadily, and by recognizing that \nthere are people in the Middle East who do want freedom.\n  There are pessimists who say: No, come on, Bennett, you say to accept \nthe things you cannot change, and one of the things you cannot change \nis that the Muslim people do not want freedom.\n  I refuse to accept that. Maybe I do not have the wisdom to recognize \nthe difference, but I refuse to accept that.\n  Having visited with some of the Iraqis, I have found some who said \nthey clearly do, most particularly the new Prime Minister Allawi. We \nvisited with him. He struck me as a very clear-headed, careful guy who \nfully understood the situation.\n  As we were finishing our conversation, I said to him: Accept our \nthanks for your willingness to put your life on the line for this \neffort.\n  His life is in jeopardy. Two ministers of his government have already \nbeen assassinated, and he is clearly the chief target of those who \nwould plunge Iraq into civil war.\n  I was interested in his answer. When I thanked him for his \nwillingness to risk his life to make this government work, he looked at \nme and responded: It is my country.\n  There is an Iraqi leader willing to risk his life for his country. We \nhave the responsibility, I believe, to do everything we can to help \nhim.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, I rise today because, frankly, I am \nalarmed. I am alarmed by bottlenecks and barriers blocking the ability \nof our law enforcement and intelligence agents to fight terrorism. \nThese bottlenecks and barriers are hampering our law enforcement's \nability to use the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as the \nFISA statute. In setting up surveillance against foreign powers working \ninside the United States, all Americans should be concerned. All \nAmericans should be concerned, frankly, as the FISA statute is one of \nthe most important weapons we have to fight terrorism.\n  Bottlenecks in the Justice Department's process of FISA applications \ncould mean if there were a terrorist attack being planned against \nAmericans today, we might not know about it. We would not know about it \nbecause a FISA request simply did not get processed.\n  We would not know it because the bureaucracy in Washington, DC, \nsimply did not get to the application in time, did not have the time or \nthe people or the resources to process an agent's request allowing him \nor her to gather that pivotal piece of intelligence, that vital piece \nof information that very well could be the key to preventing a \nterrorist attack at home. That scares me, and that should scare every \nMember of this Senate, and that should scare every American.\n  Although the FBI has been more aggressive in submitting FISA requests \nsince the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Department of Justice has \nbeen unable to keep pace with the resulting surge in applications. Here \nis what the staff of the independent 9/11 Commission tells us:\n\n       The application process . . . continues to be long and \n     slow.\n\n  That process is still subject to ``bottlenecks.''\n  I was very concerned about that. So on May 20, the last FBI oversight \nhearing held by the Judiciary Committee, I asked Director Mueller how \nwell he thought the FISA statute was being utilized, and this is what \nDirector Mueller said:\n\n       We still have concerns. There is still frustration out \n     there in the field in certain areas where, because we have \n     had to prioritize, we cannot get to certain requests for FISA \n     as fast as perhaps we might have in the past.\n\n  What does this mean? Does that mean it is now taking longer post-9/11 \nto process certain FISA requests? If that is the case--and it is--that \nis a shocking statement and one that is certainly disconcerting and \nalso downright frightening.\n  Later in a Judiciary Committee hearing just last week, Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft made equally troubling statements. I told him I felt \nit was dangerous to have to prioritize FISA requests because we can \nnever know what kind of information we will get from these warrants. \nEven our best guess is still just a guess, and this is what the \nAttorney General said:\n\n     . . . we are prioritizing among FISA applications . . . so \n     that at least the most promising of those applications are \n     the ones that would be first attended to, but frankly, it is \n     not easy always to know where you are going to get the best \n     intelligence, and it is not a situation where I am \n     confident in saying, ``Oh, well, we do not have to worry \n     about that one.''\n\n  The Attorney General was very candid. He was very honest, and he said \nit very well. You never can be sure where a promising lead will take \nyou or which lead will be the one lead that uncovers the information \nthat will save many lives. They have to prioritize. To have to \nprioritize, to have to pick and choose among these leads, is very risky \nand dangerous business. It is almost this kind of Russian roulette. We \nshould not be in that business. We should not have to do it.\n  The Justice Department should be able to look at each FISA request \nindividually and do whatever is necessary to process that request, not \nprioritize it, not just put it higher up in the pile, but actually \nprocess it immediately so\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\nthat the court can issue a warrant and agents can go about the business \nof catching terrorists.\n  This is a very real problem we have. So I say to the Justice \nDepartment, you have to put more resources into this. You have to do a \nbetter job. Of all that you do in the Justice Department, what could be \nmore important? Do you need more FISA lawyers at Justice? Do you need \nmore people in this unit? If you do, then put them there. Do you need \nmore FISA training for agents?\n  Do you need more resources? How far behind are you in the FISA \nprocess? These are all questions that the Justice Department needs to \nanswer right now. No excuses. Our national security is at stake.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week the G8 summit was held in my \nState of Georgia, and I had the honor of serving as one of the hosts, \nalong with our Governor, the senior Senator from Georgia, Congressman \nKingston, and Congressman Burns in greeting the other seven members of \nthe G8. Together with President George W. Bush, we received the heads \nof state and government from Britain, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, \nJapan, and Russia, along with a number of other leaders of countries \nfrom the Middle East who were specially invited to the G8 summit, \nincluding the new President of Iraq, Ghazi al-Yawer.\n  I liked what I saw in the new President of Iraq. When I shook his \nhand, I shook the hand of a true Iraqi patriot who is determined to see \nhis country become secure, stable, prosperous, and free. He insists on \nfull sovereignty for the Iraqi people, and he is already an eloquent \nand tough defender of their interests.\n  This is why he has publicly stated, not once or twice but at almost \nevery opportunity he gets, that the Iraqi people are grateful for \nAmerica's sacrifice in freeing them from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.\n  He also made it absolutely clear that his new government will \ncontinue to need the help of America and other coalition forces as it \nregains its strength and fends off efforts by terrorists, thugs, and \nforeign enemies to strangle Iraq's democracy in its cradle.\n  President al-Yawer has a vision for Iraq, a nation with a history \nstretching back beyond the storied walls of Babylon to the mists of \nprehistory. He sees his nation gaining a position of leadership in the \nMiddle East and forming an example of democracy, peace, progress, and \nprosperity for the entire region.\n  He made it clear to me that Iraq very much sees the United States, \nthe United Kingdom, and the other nations in the coalition as partners \nand friends that took risks to free his nation from the tyranny of \nSaddam Hussein and are now working together to help rebuild Iraq.\n  President al-Yawer is a strong pragmatic leader who wants to put his \ngovernment on a sound fiscal footing. When it was proposed to destroy \nthe Abu Ghraib prison--and I was one, frankly, who advocated that \nfollowing the prisoner scandal--and to replace it, he made a poignant \nobservation about the symbols of Saddam's barbaric treatment of his own \npeople.\n  He told ABC's ``This Week'' that Saddam tortured people not just in \nprisons but in the basements of each and every government building, and \nit would not be prudent to destroy all government entities because of \nwhat happened in them. President al-Yawer said:\n\n       We are people that need every single dollar we have in \n     order to rebuild our country, instead of demolishing and \n     rebuilding.\n\n  This shows a practical approach to governance which is a very welcome \nchange to the grandiosity and extravagance which, along with cruelty \nand aggression, marked the reign of Saddam Hussein.\n  I know there is not one Senator in this Chamber who would begrudge \nIraq, its people, and President al-Yawer the assistance needed to \ncontinue the transition of Iraq to full sovereignty and democracy.\n  In my State, we know a real friend stays with you the whole way \nthrough difficult times and does not abandon you when the going gets \ntough. You do not lead someone halfway home and then abandon him to the \nwolves. And we know those wolves are baying at the door. Al-Qaida, the \nBaathists, and all the enemies of democracy are already stepping up \ntheir attacks to drive us from Iraq so they can rip apart this young \ndemocracy.\n  Only the cowardly, only those without a vision for a newer, better \nMiddle East would urge us to leave Iraq to its fate. History has left \nits inscriptions in Iraq from time immemorial, from cuneiform \ninscriptions on clay tablets to the stone pillar of Hammurabai. These \njudgments have been read and pondered by men in the centuries following \ntheir inscriptions.\n  In the distant future, let no traveler see inscribed in weathered \nstone the withering judgment of history that the United States had an \nopportunity to help democracy take root in the Middle East but failed \nto see it through. Let him read instead: They defeated the forces of \ndarkness so the people of Iraq could live in the light.\n  The Senate will surely debate what our national policies and \npriorities should be as we seek to provide assistance for Iraq. We will \ndebate the relative merits of the different ways we can help our \nfriends in Iraq. In fact, this is our job, and it is our duty. But I, \nfor one, will not entertain any policy option that would allow the \npeople of Iraq, so recently freed from the horror of despotism, to be \nsubmerged again into the darkness by a different set of tyrants.\n  Let me now touch on some international aspects of the Iraqi \nsituation. In addition to the forces from the United States, there are \n14 other NATO allies with us in Iraq. Military forces from Bulgaria, \nthe Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, \nLithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and the \nUnited Kingdom are all there with us. And we have great support from \nanother 17 countries, such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South \nKorea, and the Ukraine. Now the international support helping to secure \nthe future of Iraq is growing even more.\n  At the G8 summit, President Bush gained the unanimous support of the \nmember states to help Iraq. They agreed to form a ``Partnership for \nProgress and a Common Future with the Region of the Broader Middle East \nand North Africa'' to support political, social, and economic reform in \nthis region. This builds on President Bush's ``forward strategy of \nfreedom'' that he announced last November.\n\n  President Bush also secured a U.N. Security Council resolution \nsupporting the plan for handing sovereignty back to the Iraqi people. \nOn June 8, the Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1546 \nwhich supports free elections and authorizes a multinational security \nforce to help stabilize the security situation in Iraq.\n  The U.N. has done exactly the right thing in passing Resolution 1546, \nand I applaud them for taking this important step. However, I would be \nremiss if I did not mention a subject which hinders the effectiveness \nof the United Nations, not only in Iraq but in its dealings around the \nworld, and by this I mean the Oil-for-Food scandal.\n  The Oil-for-Food Program, established in 1995, was designed to \nalleviate the impact of the economic embargo on the people of Iraq, \nwhile continuing restrictions on military and technology sales. It was \na humanitarian program that was supported by the United States as a way \nto help average Iraqi citizens get basic food and medical supplies \nwhile Saddam Hussein was still in power.\n  The Oil-for-Food Program was administered by the United Nations \nAssistant Secretary General Benon V. Sevan who oversaw sales of $111 \nbillion worth of Iraqi oil. While under U.N. auspices, the U.S. \nGovernment Accounting Office estimates that over $10 billion of that \n$111 billion was stolen from the Iraqi people by Saddam's regime. While \nchildren were dying for lack of medicine or food, Saddam was importing \nMercedes limousines, weapons, and building his grand palaces. Skimming \noff this vast amount of money involved kickbacks and bribes to a wide \nvariety of foreign officials and businessmen.\n  When the new Iraqi oil ministry recently published a list of foreign \nofficials receiving bribes, kickbacks, and\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\nhidden oil allotments from Saddam, U.N. Assistant Secretary Sevan's \nname was on a list which included 11 French, 46 Russians, and many \nother names. These recipients of Saddam's largess were vocal opponents \nof freeing Iraq from Saddam's chokehold and also were bitter critics of \nthe effects of the embargo on Saddam's regime.\n  It is ironic that so many of the businessmen and officials who helped \nskim off the money designed to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi \npeople came from countries that complained the loudest about the U.S.-\nled effort to oust Saddam from power.\n  It is imperative that we monitor the U.N. investigation of the Oil-\nfor-Food scandal to make sure it is thorough and transparent. \nWrongdoers must be prosecuted, not simply bundled off to retirement. To \ndo any less would greatly compromise the ability of the United Nations \nto operate future programs with the confidence of the world community. \nPaul Volcker, who was named by Secretary Kofi Annan to head the \ninvestigation into the Oil-for-Food scandal, must receive sufficient \npersonnel, resources, and access to the relevant documents and U.N. \nofficials to carry out his responsibility.\n  A failed investigation will be a bitter indictment of the United \nNations and it would put it on a path that would lead to total--total--\nobsolescence and irrelevance. The United Nations can be a unifying \nforce in the world, and its resolution on the future of Iraq passed \nlast week is a positive example of this. However, it must also restore \nits credibility with the people of Iraq who were robbed of over $10 \nbillion in food and medicine while the Oil for Food Program was being \nadministered by the U.N.\n  It is a critical time for both the future of Iraq and the future of \nthe U.N. In Iraq, it is time to pull together to make it a successful, \nstable, and democratic country. At the U.N., it is time to show the \nworld that it can be a transparent, accountable, and efficient \norganization worthy of its noble charter.\n  We have the unique opportunity to help democracy take root in the \nMiddle East, and we are fortunate that President Bush, Prime Minister \nBlair, and others have the vision and the courage to recognize this and \nto do something about it.\n  Likewise, the United Nations has an opportunity to restore our \nconfidence in its ability to play a meaningful role on the world stage. \nI hope Secretary General Kofi Annan has the necessary courage to carry \nhis investigation of the Oil for Food scandal to its necessary \nconclusion, regardless of how difficult it might be.\n  Let future generations see that neither the United States, nor the \nUnited Nations, shirked from the challenges that face us today.\n  Mr. President, the Oil for Food scandal cannot be taken lightly. We \nmust take this issue seriously to restore credibility to the United \nNations, which is headed down a path of total obsolescence if we do not \nact appropriately and if we do not get to the bottom of this particular \nand potentially devastating issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending question is the Dodd amendment No. \n3313, as further modified, on which there shall be up to 30 minutes of \ndebate evenly divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. I further inquire of the Chair, at the conclusion of the \nvote on the Dodd amendment, the Senator from Virginia is to be \nrecognized for the purpose of laying down an amendment; am I not \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I be notified when 10 minutes have \nexpired so as to leave a few minutes at the end of the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do that.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from South Carolina, Senator Lindsey O. Graham, be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I am pleased to offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Graham, and Senator Levin this morning. We had a very good \ndebate a few days ago about this amendment. At the suggestion of my \nfriend, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, we modified the \namendment that is now before this body. The modification, very quickly, \ndeletes the prohibition on using private contractors in combat \nsituations. I will not belabor the point. There are existing statutes \nthat provide for such restrictions, but the suggestion of the chairman \nwas that that provision was going to be a rather complicated matter to \ndeal with here, so we have taken it out--it is no longer part of the \namendment. Instead, the amendment as modified would merely ask the \nSecretary of Defense to review and report to Congress on U.S. laws and \npolicies as they relate to the use of contractors by the Defense \nDepartment and the Uniformed Services in combat operations.\n  What is still part of this amendment is the prohibition on using \nprivate contractors for the purposes of interrogation of prisoners. It \nwould, however, give the President some flexibility in phasing in this \nprohibition by providing limited waiver authority for the use of such \ncontractors in interrogations--both as translators and as actual \ninterrogators. The presidential waiver for translators would be \nextended for 1 year, and for contractors acting solely as \ninterrogators, the waiver would be effective for 90 days from the date \nof enactment of this legislation.\n  Why do I offer this amendment? I didn't bring charts or photographs \nto the floor of the events that occurred in Abu Ghraib prison late last \nfall or early this winter. Those photographs are very disturbing and \ncan create their own sense of emotion. I am not interested in doing \nthat today. But suffice it to say, there is ample evidence. So today we \nknow at least that interrogations were conducted by private contractors \nhired by the Department of the Interior, of all agencies, to do \ninterrogations, intelligence work in Iraq and maybe elsewhere, on \nGuantanamo or Afghanistan as well. The military believes, I believe, \nand I think most of us believe that this job of interrogation ought not \nbe done by private contractors. This ought to be inherently a \ngovernmental function, and one that is not shopped out or outsourced, \nif you will, to others, where there is no accountability, no chain of \ncommand, no responsibility, and virtual immunity if they do anything \nwrong under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\n  I will cite briefly memos and directives from the Department of the \nArmy strongly urging that we not contract out this function. I strongly \nagree with these opinions because, first, we obviously have suffered \nterribly in the public relations field as a result of what happened, \nand we certainly know that private contracting was part of the problem; \nand, second, with 135,000 of our troops serving in Iraq, 20,000 serving \nin Afghanistan, and others serving around the globe today, we do not \nneed to have these young men, and women in many cases, be potentially \nsubjected to reprisals as a result of our mismanagement of the \ninterrogation process in Iraq and possibly elsewhere.\n\n  This is an important amendment. We have all been through this \nrecently. Again, I am not charting new ground. As we know, in fact, at \nhearings chaired last month by the chairman of the committee here, it \nwas made very clear, especially in the testimony and comprehensive \nreport of General Taguba, a number of contractors may have played \nsignificant roles as interrogators in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. \nTheir abusive practices have compromised our interests in Iraq, and it \nremains to be seen whether they will ever be held accountable. Military \npeople can. But contractors, such as those hired by the Department of \nInterior, may be outside the scope of legal jurisdictions.\n  Again, I am not the only one who believes that intelligence \nfunctions, particularly gathering intelligence through interrogations, \nshould be carried out by Government personnel rather than contractors.\n  A December 26, 2000, Department of the Army memo dealing with \nexempting Army intelligence functions from privatization came to the \nsame conclusion:\n\n       At a tactical level, the intelligence function under the \n     operational control of the Army performed by the military . . \n     . is an inherently Governmental function barred from private \n     sector performance.\n\n  They are exactly right. It ought to be an inherently governmental \nfunction. Outsourcing, where there is no accountability, where you \ndon't have any ability to subject them to criminal prosecution if they \ndo something wrong, I think, is dangerous business. It is dangerous \nbusiness in the intelligence area.\n  The report went on to say:\n\n       At the operational and strategic level, the intelligence \n     function performed by the military personnel and Federal \n     civilian employees is a non-inherently governmental function \n     that should be exempted from private sector performance on \n     the basis of risk to national security from relying on \n     contractors to perform this function.\n\n  Nor was this view limited solely to the previous administration in \n2000. Thomas White, former Secretary of the Army in the current \nadministration, also expressed his opposition to hiring contractors to \nquestion prisoners, stating in an interview that ``the basic process of \ninterrogation . . . should be kept in-house, on the Army side.''\n  He is right. That is exactly where it ought to be. This is dangerous \nbusiness to go through. I was stunned to learn that the Department of \nthe Interior the was actually the agency through which some of these \ncontracts were awarded. No one knew to whom these contractors reported, \nwhat the chain of command was, or what sort of supervision there was.\n  We are in a new age since 9/11. You have to get people who can speak \nthe language, who know what they are doing. We are in the world of \nterrorism. The President had it right last night. There is yet no \nhorizon in this war on terrorism. It is going to be here for a long \ntime. We better wake up, and if we need people to speak a language then \nwe ought to hire them and train them. It is almost 3 years since 9/11. \nThe fact that we need to put ads in the Washington Post to find people \nwho can speak Arabic is ridiculous. We ought to get about the business \nof hiring people and training them. We need interrogators. We need the \nhuman intelligence capacity. I am all for fancy satellites and \ntechnology, but if you don't have people on the ground who can talk to \nthese people and understand what they are saying, your intelligence is \ngoing to suffer.\n  Again, this practice of hiring contractors to perform interrogations \nis simply bad business. It goes beyond just the ugly photographs and \nthe outrageous behavior that has cost us terribly in Iraq and elsewhere \nin our efforts at winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.\n  And my amendment is limited in scope. It merely says that with \nrespect to interrogations, the Department of Defense would have to hire \npeople within the governmental framework to do the job.\n  On the translations, I will give you a year. You can use people \noutside if you want, but after a year let's get some people within the \noperations themselves who know what they are doing. The other sections \nof my amendment deal briefly with the transfer of prisoners.\n  In September, it will be 3 years since the horrific events of 9/11. \nIt is high time that the administration moved forward to build a \ncapacity, in-house, to ensure that our intelligence gathering capacity, \nincluding interrogation personnel, is adequate to meet the threats that \nwe confront.\n  Giving the administration unlimited access to contractors by \nextending the waiver for interrogators beyond 90 days does not serve \nour national interest.\n  I would remind my fellow colleagues that the world has changed \ndramatically over the past three years. Part of the current mission in \nIraq is a larger and absolutely critical mission that we are going to \nbe confronting every single day for the foreseeable future in \nAfghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Spain--and the list goes on \nand on--and elsewhere around the globe. In order to be prepared for \nthat war, we must have within our own governmental structure the \nexpertise to garner intelligence, including intelligence gleaned \nthrough interrogations.\n  The notion that we can simply outsource this critical responsibility \nwhen terrorist incidents spike the demand for interrogation skills by \nour Government seems to be the height of irresponsibility.\n  We were sidetracked a bit during the debate on Monday. As I said \nearlier, the chairman made a very good point in the area of combat \nmissions. It is not a clear line. So we put that aside. But on \ninterrogations, this is inherently a governmental function and we \nshouldn't be contracting out that function.\n  That is my point. I hope my colleagues will agree with us. I know the \nadministration has some problems with it, but the fact is, let us get \nabout the business of doing our job here and not endangering our own \ntroops--which is what I worry about. The bottom line, one that I \nbelieve I share with every parent, sibling, or child who has a relative \nor a friend serving in these dangerous zones. I don't want our brave \nmen and women, if they are apprehended, to go through what we saw \nhappen to some of these Iraqi prisoners. These abuses put Americans at \nrisk, in my view, if we don't get this business straight. I am \ndetermined to see that we fix this situation.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this. Let me withhold the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator engage in a colloquy with \nme?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, I would like to lay the predicate. The Senator has \nbrought forth an important concept. He asked for a study. I am prepared \nto support the study. But I urge my colleague, as I did the other day \non another part of the amendment--and he accepted my advice and took \nthat out--we have to look at this interrogation section. There is a \ntrigger mechanism, if you look at the amendment, which says in 90 days \nevery one of these contractors has to discontinue their work.\n  That is what it says. Am I not correct?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator is correct--90 days I think after the----\n  Mr. WARNER. It is signed into law.\n  Mr. DODD. Just interrogations.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that cripples America's intelligence \nsystem in the middle of a war in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and our \noperations in Guantanamo.\n  How can the Senate suddenly withdraw our U.S. military interrogation \nbase in the middle of a war in 90 days? There is no way in the world \nthe military--there is a greater burden on the Army--can hire and train \nin this short period of time all the replacements that would be \nrequired if the Senator's amendment became law.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, I don't believe necessarily that the \nmilitary doesn't have the capacity to do\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\nthis. But the idea that the Department of the Interior is contracting \nout to private firms to conduct this function, when we have seen \nalready the results when this matter gets out of hand because you have \nrogue elements doing it--we have suffered terribly as a result of this \ntremendous abuse that has gone on. I don't buy the idea that we can't \nget this straight. I think we can get it straight. There are plenty of \npeople within the military services who can perform this function. And \nI don't put the same limitations on translators. I am giving a year to \nget that in shape.\n  The idea that somehow the military shouldn't be doing this--I didn't \nmake this up; this isn't made out of whole cloth. The military \nthemselves, going back several years, has said that this function \nshould not be performed by outside contractors.\n  In fact, the most recent former Secretary of the Army said this.\n  Mr. WARNER. That has been stated twice by the Senator. Those are \nfacts and valid opinions. But I am looking at the very practical \neffect--that under this amendment when the President's signature goes \non the bill, in 90 days we are out of business.\n  Let me point out a few statistics. Take Guantanamo Bay: Right now we \nhave 140 translators of which over 100 are contractors.\n  Mr. DODD. Translators are not an issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Nevertheless, eventually they have to be taken inhouse.\n  Mr. DODD. That would be over a year from today.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that. That is the very point I wish to make. \nYou give us a year in which to cure that problem, but then you go to \nthe analysts and interrogators, 60 analysts of which 35 are \ncontractors.\n  Mr. DODD. Interrogators.\n  Mr. WARNER. They are part of the system--40 interrogators of which 20 \nare contractors. In 90 days, 50 percent roughly of the operation in \nGuantanamo ceases to function.\n  I will tell you that practically there is no way in the world the \nmilitary can go out and hire and recruit and put into uniform or \ncivilian capacity that number of individuals.\n  Mr. DODD. I don't ascribe to that. First, the analysts are not \nincluded; it is just the interrogators.\n  The idea that you are going to have people who are immune from \nprosecution, accountable to no one, with little supervision, or \nliterally none in many cases, I think is a far more inherently \ndangerous problem than the difficulty in finding 30 or 40 people within \nthe military structure to perform interrogations.\n\n  I would point out this job posting, which is from the Web site of \nCACI International, one of the companies that does interrogations for \nthe Department of Defense. This is what it says you ought to be: The \nposition requires a bachelor's degree, or equivalent, of 6 or 7 years \nof related experience--whatever that is--preferably in the intelligence \nfield; requires a clearance, strong writing and briefing skills, with \ncompetency in automation research in basic software.\n  This is hardly the job description of someone who is so unique that \nwe can't find the personnel within our own uniformed services.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is a problem. The Senator has \nidentified it. I acknowledge it. I do not think it is as great as the \nSenator portrays it, but nevertheless there is a problem.\n  What I am saying to my colleagues who are momentarily going to be \nasked to vote is that we cannot in any way possible solve it in the 90-\nday period, and we are in the middle of a war. The Senator is going to \nbasically dismantle 50 or more percent of our intelligence \ninterrogation, and it is from these interrogations that our troops \ntoday are getting valuable information to protect their lives on the \nbattlefronts primarily of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I say to Members, when you come and are asked to vote, if you vote in \nsupport of this amendment, then I simply say you are pulling the plug \non our intelligence system and the interrogation system and severely \ndealing them a crippling blow. It is as simple as that.\n  Does my colleague acknowledge that in 90 days the interrogation is \nout of business? Am I correct?\n  Mr. DODD. No. They are not out of business at all. The interrogations \nwould have to be done by governmental authorities. You can bring back \nmilitary people to do it. There are plenty of guys who can do it, if we \nput them back on active duty. This is not an overly burdensome problem.\n  The question is, here we are debating the Defense authorization bill \nand we have been confronted which a huge problem that galvanized the \nworld's attention only a few days ago. We know that part of the problem \nwas because we had people who were not being held accountable and who \nhave little or no supervision. At least we know that much already. In \nthe midst of this debate, should we step up and try to do something \nabout that problem?\n  If the argument is that we have no in-house capacity to fill 40 or 50 \nslots in Guantanamo, or maybe an equal amount in Iraq with 135,000 U.S. \nforces there and 20,000 in Afghanistan, the idea that we can't find \npeople within the military services to fill 40 or 50 slots, then I \ndon't accept it as a legitimate argument against this amendment.\n  They may want to keep contracting and have these contractors go \nthrough the Department of the Interior, but that is wrong, in my view, \nand I think it is dangerous. The military has said--I am not opposed to \nwhat their thinking is--categorically it ought not be done there. It is \ndangerous. It causes us problems and it is causing our military \npersonnel problems. It ought to be changed.\n  I don't buy for a single second, with thousands of people serving in \nthat theater, the idea we can't find people within our own ranks to do \nthis job.\n  Mr. WARNER. The simple reply is, you can't take an individual, no \nmatter how many degrees they might have, in 90 days, or less, and train \nthem to be an interrogator. Most of the contractors now performing this \nwork are former U.S. military individuals--people who served in the \ninterrogation field, primarily during the cold war when the U.S. \nmilitary had a significant requirement for interrogators, both in the \nEuropean theater and the Korean theater.\n  I see my colleague from Alabama. Does my colleague seek recognition?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to speak on this subject.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I share Chairman Warner's view.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as my colleague requires. Would the \nChair advise as to the time on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Virginia has \n6 minutes. The Senator from Connecticut has 5 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I need a minute or two to wrap up.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will try to keep it to 2 minutes.\n  I share the concerns of the Senator from Virginia, the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee. I note there is nothing inherently wrong \nwith using trained, skilled, and capable contractors. If there is a \nproblem, it may be that we did not supervise contractors well and maybe \ndid not select them well.\n  To prohibit the utilization of contractors to do interrogations in \nlife-and-death situations is a mistake. We may need the very best \ninterrogator in the United States of America to interrogate someone who \nhas the ability to give information that could save thousands of lives \nin this country. To say that we have to use the military personnel I \nbelieve is clearly wrong. A young MP who is just out of training school \nshould not be, in my view, as good an interrogator as a retired MP who \nworked in the detective division of the New York Police Department or a \nretired CIA agent or retired military person who did interrogations for \nyears and had experience and maybe even knows the language.\n  We cannot have everyone in the military perfectly trained to do all \nthese things and speak every language in the world and do these \ninterrogations.\n  This would be a terrible deal. We should not agree to this. We should \nnot limit the military from using contract employees. If we need to \ncontrol them better and do a better job of supervising it, I would \nsupport that.\n  I don't want to use any more time. I know others want to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say to colleagues we are putting on them a \nconsiderable burden in a very short period of time.\n  I ask a very clear question of the proponent of this amendment, the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nfrom Connecticut. In 90 days we have to dismantle a great deal of our \ninterrogation--in Afghanistan, in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay--right as \nthis country is in the middle of combat operations, right at a time \nwhen men and women of our Armed Forces, of our coalition forces, are at \ngreat personal risk.\n  A few interrogators at this point in time are implicated in the \ntragic events in the prison situation. As the Senator well knows, the \nArmed Services Committee is probing that as quickly as we can given the \nlimited time we have had. This bill has been on the floor of the \nSenate, but we had to temporarily set aside our work. We hope, once I \nconsult with the leadership and members of the committee, to resume \nthat. The point being, this is not the time to put a 90-day jackhammer \nthat severs our ability to continue our interrogation of prisoners with \nthe use of contractors. Several of them did perform in a manner that, \nhopefully, they can be brought to account in the Abu Ghraib situation, \nbut hundreds of other contractors are carefully and professionally \ndoing their work in interrogation. This amendment would stop that in 90 \ndays.\n  I see the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would like to be recognized to speak against the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I join my colleague from Virginia and my colleague from \nAlabama in opposing the Dodd amendment.\n\n  I will take one part of our interrogating process and look at \nGuantanamo Bay. We have 140 translators, of which 105 are contractors; \n60 analysts there, of which 35 are contractors; and 45 interrogators, \nof which 20 are contractors. If we pass this amendment, we shut off the \ninterrogation process and we lose the opportunity to gather vital \ninformation that could be valuable to what we are doing in Iraq. We \nwould lose 50 percent of intelligence. Generally, these individuals are \nwell qualified, and they have been carefully vetted as contractors.\n  I join my colleagues in opposing the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will reserve 1 minute to follow the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. First of all, let me respond to my friend from Colorado. My \namendment grants the President waiver authority in the case of \ntranslators for over a year.\n  We are about to graduate from the training school for Army \nintelligence in Arizona this year 539 interrogators within the Army. \nHere we are talking about 20 or 40 positions in Guantanamo Bay of \ninterrogators--but we have 539 people this year who are going to \ngraduate within the Army as interrogators. We know that at least some \nof the private contractors hired through Department of Interior \ncontracts for interrogations are not well trained. A bachelor of arts \ndegree will get you a job as interrogator. This situation is a mess. We \nknow it is a mess. We have 539 people--double the number from last \nyear--graduating this year. Why are we continuing a system that does \nnot work where the Army themselves have said, stop it? We need to \nlisten and stop it.\n  One of the most outrageous examples is the effort in Iraq. An \noutrageous situation occurred just days ago because the system has \nfallen apart. Do not tell me we will lose our capacity to interrogate \npeople. That is hyperbole when you have 539 people about to graduate in \naddition to the ones we have in uniform today to do the job.\n  We know that having private contractors participate in interrogations \nis a problem. The Army has said that it is a problem. The most recent \nSecretary of the Army said it is a problem, and to stop it. The \nquestion is, will we do it here, today? Do we understand what happened \nhere just a few days ago? Do we understand the problems it has caused?\n  A recent public opinion poll by the Coalition Provisional Authority \nin Iraq shows us that a majority of Iraqis believe that all Americans \nconduct themselves in the way they saw in the photographs taken at Abu \nGhraib. But that is not us.\n  I know people in uniform do a better job than someone who has been \nplucked off the street under a contract by the Department of Interior \nto do the job of intelligence. This is intelligence capacity. You do \nnot outsource and farm that out to an unaccountable contractor with \nlittle or no experience in interrogations. Don't Members understand \nwhat happened here a few days ago, how much trouble our country is in?\n  We have 539 people about to graduate in the military services to \nconduct interrogations, and you are telling me we do not have enough \nand we cannot train people in uniform to do the job? I don't believe \nit. The American people do not, the international community does not.\n  This is not a complicated amendment. Let's wake up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 49 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am voting today in opposition to Senator \nDodd's amendment, No. 3313 that would prohibit the Department of \nDefense from using contractors to carry out certain activities, mostly \nrelated to interrogations. While I believe that this amendment would \nnot solve the problems so vividly illustrated by the Abu Ghraib prison \nabuses, there should be no doubt that the issue it seeks to address is \nextremely serious. We are all concerned about the grave misconduct of \nanyone involved in interrogations of Iraqi detainees. The individuals \nwho committed atrocities have marred the reputation of our country and \nhave made the lives of American personnel in Iraq more dangerous and \ndifficult.\n  It is essential to ensure that there is proper oversight when \nemploying contractors in interrogations or any other military-related \nfunction. There must also be clear rules for bringing to justice those \nwho violate our laws or treaty obligations. And, ultimately, I believe \nthat interrogations and other functions should be conducted by \nuniformed personnel, working directly for the United States government \nand subject to the web of rules that governs military personnel.\n  While this should be our ultimate goal, I am concerned that this \namendment would bring to a halt a number of critical functions \ncurrently carried out by contractors. The reality is that the U.S. \narmed forces are currently dependent on contractor support to carry out \ntheir missions, including interrogations. The Army now has \napproximately 500 military interrogators, a number far below the number \nneeded to meet our requirements in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. \nOver the next five years, the number of trained interrogators will grow \nto over 1,200, but in the meantime, we rely on contractors to make up \nthe difference. In addition, over 50 percent of interrogator, \ninterpreter, and analyst positions at Guantanamo Bay are currently \nfilled by contractors. This amendment would cripple intelligence \ngathering operations there.\n  The abuses at Abu Ghraib prison did not occur only at the hands of \ncivilian contractors--soldiers have been implicated as well. It is \ncritical to ensure accountability for everyone who may have been \ninvolved, and prevent any reoccurrence of such abuses. Throughout the \nhearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee and in my review of the \nannexes and documents in the Taguba Investigation, I have observed a \nlack of sustained focus on the basic principles of leadership at Abu \nGhraib. While I believe that immediately prohibiting the use of \ncontractors is not the way to proceed, we need to look comprehensively \nat a number of facets of our military operations, including the long-\nterm use of contractors, failures of leadership, and the overall size \nof our armed forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask my colleague a question. This \ngraduating class to which the Senator refers, am I not correct it is \nenlisted and 18- to 20-year- olds?\n  Mr. DODD. All I have here is that the Pentagon has asked the school \nto boost its output dramatically and expects to graduate 539 \ninterrogators this year, up from 237 in 2003.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, there are basically young enlisted \nmen with no field experience, in no way a\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\ncomparison to the seasoned cadre of contractors now performing this \ninvaluable service.\n  I wish to move to table, but I will not do it until my colleague has \nthe opportunity.\n  Mr. DODD. Does my colleague from South Carolina want to take 15 \nseconds?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  I saw Senator Dodd this morning at breakfast. I am sympathetic to \nwhat he was trying to do. I said, put me down. I did not look at the \nsubstance. I apologize. The Senator is absolutely right in what he is \ntrying to do.\n  I agree with the chairman that these people coming out of school are \nnot ready to perform this work. But I promise the Senator from \nConnecticut you will have a Republican ally if we have a transition \nperiod that is more reasonable--if not on this bill, we will do it some \nother time. It bothers me greatly that our interrogation system is \nbeing outsourced. We do not know who is interrogating the people in \nprison because we do not know who they are and who they answer to.\n  I apologize to the Senator from Connecticut for not being able to \nlive up to my word. I told him I would support the amendment, but I did \nnot look at the amendment. I will never do that again. However, I do \nwant to help--if not on this bill, we will do it soon.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  I yield 30 seconds to my distinguished ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Connecticut. I \nthink this amendment is essential if we are going to make a statement \nabout who is going to do the interrogating of prisoners. We are bound \nby treaties, and when these treaties are ignored, this country is \ndamaged.\n  We cannot have contractors where there is no accountability. You can \nfire a governmental employee. You can demote a governmental employee. \nYou can discharge someone who is in the military who is doing the \ninterrogating. When a contractor does this, there is no accountability \nexcept criminal law with all of its difficulties.\n  An Army memorandum dated December 26, 2000, that is still in effect \ntoday, made the express determination that gathering tactical \nintelligence is an inherently governmental function. According to our \nlaw, ``Contracts shall not be used for the performance of inherently \ngovernmental functions.''\n  We must make a critically important statement here today: We are \ngoing to hold people accountable for the kind of abuse that occurred. \nThe only way you can do that is by having governmental employees--\neither uniformed or civilian--carry out these interrogations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I inquire of the desk, I think the \nother side has slightly gone over their time. I wonder if we might \naccommodate the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and ask that he \nbe permitted to speak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no objection to that. We have a \nlittle more time on our side. But I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDodd have 2 minutes to close following Senator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, and that the Senator from \nVirginia be recognized for the purpose of the tabling motion following \nSenator Dodd.\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Virginia will have 2 minutes and the Senator from \nConnecticut will have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield my 2 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman.\n  I rise to join the senior Senator from Virginia in opposing the Dodd \namendment. I agree with the concern raised by the Dodd amendment, but \nlet me point out that, as far as I am aware, no committee has held a \nhearing on how to lessen our reliance on contractors. Our armed \nservices and our other agencies do rely very heavily on contractors.\n  The distinguished chairman has held three open hearings in regard to \nall of the incarceration problems and the problems that have been so \nheavily publicized. We have had three hearings in the Intelligence \nCommittee that have been closed. We are going to follow up with a \nreport by General Fay and others. In the Intelligence Committee, we \nhave asked for the legal memoranda from the Justice Department on this \nwhole issue.\n  I think this amendment attempts to prejudge the important work we \nwould like to do on issues that are related to contractors and also \ndetainees; yes, the military police; yes, the military intelligence.\n  Now, let's not forget that while some contractors--or for that \nmatter, MPs, or military personnel--have been highly publicized in \nactions that nobody wants to see, contractors are saving lives right \nnow in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they are giving their lives in the war \non terrorism. So the problems that have come to our attention, it seems \nto me, my colleagues, are not necessarily inherent simply to \ncontracting, but they are resulting from very poor management and also \nsupervision.\n  We can address the problems as raised by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut, but we ought to do it in the right way. I do not \nthink the Senate should act hastily on an important area. We are on top \nof it. We are conducting oversight.\n  So I must oppose this amendment and urge other Members to do the \nsame.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think I have made the case. I will just \nsummarize it for you here.\n  Since September 11, we have been in a different world. Developing our \ncapacity and our ability to conduct interrogations, to be able to \nunderstand the languages of other peoples so we understand what is \ngoing on, is critically important.\n  And our ability to have inhouse, within our military services, the \ncapacity to conduct one of the most important functions--that is, to \nconduct interrogations and gather intelligence that protects our men \nand women in uniform--should not be outsourced to people whose major \nqualification is a bachelor of arts degree.\n  These young people who are being trained in the military may be \nyoung, but they are trained interrogators. That is what we ought to be \ndoing. We have 539 new ones, in addition to the ones who exist today, \ncoming out of school soon. We ought to be saying--as the military has \nasked us now for 4 years--do not contract this out. This \nadministration's most recent Secretary of the Army said: Do not \ncontract this out.\n  This ought to be an inherently governmental function: to conduct \ninterrogations, to gather intelligence, to protect our men and women in \nuniform, and to advance our cause. The idea, somehow, that this is \ngoing to slow us down or make us incapable of doing our job is \nfoolishness. We all know what is going to happen. If we have a partisan \ndebate here that rejects the idea that we ought to have an in-house \ncapacity in intelligence areas, then the Army, or some in the military, \nwill read that as a signal that they can continue doing what they are \ndoing.\n  That is dangerous, in my view, dangerous when you have a Department \nof the Interior agency actually doing the contracting out to private \ncompanies, where the desired capability, according to their own Web \nsite, is not much more than a bachelor of arts degree. That is it.\n  It is the 21st century. The war is on terrorism. Let's wake up. I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment and reject the tabling \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say, this is not a vote or debate \non a partisan issue. We both feel this issue has to be corrected. I \nsimply plead for\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\nreasonable time within which to do it, hopefully, to give greater \nsecurity to our fighting men and women.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

I \nwish to advise Senators we are making progress. We are working out a UC \nrequest right now, and I hope to resume the bill very shortly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the UC request is still under \nconsideration. Very clear and forthright efforts are going forward on \nboth sides. But in order to proceed on the bill, I ask unanimous \nconsent that we turn to the Senator from Illinois, who will speak for a \nfew minutes, and then it is my understanding a voice vote will be \nacceptable on his amendment. Following the adoption of that amendment, \nwe will turn to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky for the \nMcConnell-Bunning amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3386\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask at this point for consideration of \namendment No. 3386.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator \nWarner of Virginia, and my close friend and colleague on the Democratic \nside, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, for their support of this \namendment.\n  I think this amendment comes at the right moment in history. All \nacross the world, many who are our friends and those who are not \nquestion whether the United States is abandoning its time-honored \ncommitment to oppose torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment \nof detainees and prisoners.\n  The scandal at Abu Ghraib touched the heart of every American because \nit sent entirely the wrong message about the values of this country. We \nare not a country that will look the other way when it comes to this \nsort of horrific treatment. This amendment is a reaffirmation of our \nstatement as Americans that we are committed, as every administration \nhas been going back to President Abraham Lincoln, to oppose torture and \nthe kind of inhuman conduct and treatment that we saw at Abu Ghraib \nprison.\n\n  I think this amendment also makes it clear to the Department of \nDefense that we want them to take this seriously, to establish \nguidelines consistent with our Constitution, with the laws of the land, \nand with the treaties that have been signed by Presidents, Democrat and \nRepublican alike. These guidelines will be clear signals for every \nmember of the U.S. military in terms of acceptable conduct when it \ncomes to the interrogation and treatment of detainees.\n  The third step in this amendment says that any violations that are \nnoted by the Department of Defense will be reported to Congress \nconsistent with national security. Should there be a circumstance where \nclassified or secret information would jeopardize the security of this \ncountry, it can be reported in that context to the appropriate \ncommittee and in no way diminish the security of this Nation.\n  I hope this overwhelming support for this amendment at this moment in \ntime will say to those of us across America who feel it is important to \nsend this message, and to those listening around the world, that the \nUnited States still stands strong by its commitments to oppose torture \nand the cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners and \ndetainees.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for his cooperation in this regard. \nI thank the Senator from Michigan for cosponsoring this along with \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania.\n  Madam President, I ask that the Senate, at this point, accept the \namendment which I have offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senator from Illinois and myself and \nothers were here well into the night last night as the Senator gave a \nvery detailed dissertation on this subject.\n  I find the amendment basically recites this administration's policy. \nThe unambiguous policy of this and preceding administrations is to \ncomply with and enforce this Nation's obligations under international \nlaw. These obligations are embedded in American domestic law, including \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice, which explicitly incorporates the \nlaw of war.\n  President Bush has recently stated:\n\n       We are a nation of law. We adhere to laws.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld, on June 13, stated:\n\n       There is no wiggle room in my mind or the President's mind \n     about torture. That is not something that's permitted under \n     the Geneva Conventions or the laws of the United States. . . \n     . It's required that people in custody be treated in a humane \n     way.\n\n  So I think it is very appropriate that we do the codification, as the \nSenator recommends. I am hopeful that in the conference status Senator \nLevin and I can work to incorporate basically this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, let me congratulate our good \nfriend from Illinois for his leadership and determination to offer an \namendment which will reflect our best instincts, our best values and \nour laws, both domestic and international laws to which we have \nsubscribed. This amendment reaffirms the military's high standards, \nwhich are embodied in the Army's own field manual. Army regulations, \nwhich are cited in the ``findings'' sections of this amendment, \nexplicitly require that all prisoners will receive humane treatment. \nThey prohibit, among other things, torture and all cruel and degrading \ntreatment.\n  The high standards in the manual, which are reinforced by this \namendment, protect American soldiers. It is not just the right thing; \nit is not just\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\nrepresenting our own values. This protects American soldiers. If we \nlower our standards, it is only going to encourage others to engage in \nthe torture or mistreatment of American prisoners of war in enemy \ncustody.\n  The reaffirmation of our commitment to treat detainees humanely \npreserves our ability to demand full protections for American prisoners \nof war. This amendment is a clear way of reaffirming to the American \npeople and to the world that the United States recognizes it is legally \nbound by international agreements. Indeed, we have promoted, we have \nbeen the leader in producing many of those international agreements \nrelative to torture. We are going to comply with those obligations. \nThere is one rule that applies to all. It applies to us. It applies to \nevery other country. And we accept--indeed, we promote and proclaim--\nthe wisdom of that rule.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLevin, Specter, Feinstein, Leahy, and Kennedy be added as cosponsors of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3386.\n  The amendment (No. 3386) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3438\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. Bunning. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning], for Mr. McConnell, \n     for himself and Mr. Bunning, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Domenici, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Talent, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3438.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment \ncosponsored by Senator Bingaman and 16 other Senators including \nSenators Grassley, Clinton, Domenici, Kennedy, Stevens, Cantwell, \nVoinovich, Schumer, Alexander, Murkowski, Murray, DeWine, Talent, \nDurbin, Bond, and Feinstein.\n  This amendment will fix the problems with the Department of Energy's \ncompensation program for sick and injured cold-war workers at Energy \nsites throughout the country.\n  Since the end of World War II, workers at Department of Energy sites \nacross the country helped our Nation face threats from our enemies by \ncreating and maintaining our Nation's nuclear weapons.\n  Many of these workers sacrificed their health and safety and were \nexposed to harms unknown at the time in their work to preserve our \nfreedoms.\n  In 2000, as part of the DOD authorization bill, Congress enacted the \nEnergy Employee Occupational Illness Compensation Act.\n  This act was intended to give timely and reasonable compensation to \nDepartment of Energy employees suffering from diseases caused by \nworking in the nuclear weapons program.\n  This program was split into two parts.\n  Subtitle B of the program is run by the Department of Labor for those \nworkers with diseases from radiation and beryllium; and\n  Subtitle D of the program is currently run by the Department of \nEnergy for those workers made ill from toxic substances.\n  Subtitle B of the program has been running well. The Department of \nLabor has completely processed more than 95 percent of the 54,000 cases \nit has received.\n  Subtitle D of the program, however, is completely broken and the \nDepartment of Energy has done an abysmal job running it.\n  For almost 4 years now, the Department of Energy has failed to \nprocess and pay claims of workers who were made ill by their work.\n  The Energy Committee has held 3 hearings on this issue which revealed \nthe DOE's failure at administering this program. I should note that \nboth the chairman and the ranking member of the Energy Committee are \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  GAO has also studied this issue and found the DOE's performance \nsubpar.\n  More than 24,000 workers or survivors have filed claims with the DOE \nfor compensation for their illnesses.\n  DOE has now received $95 million for this program from Congress and \nonly four claims have been paid.\n  Further, the program under the DOE has an uncertain process for \ncompensating workers. Even if a worker is found to have an eligible \nclaim, DOE has not identified an entity for all claimants who will pay \nthose claims and serve as a ``willing payer.''\n  DOE's miserable job with this program is particularly troubling \nbecause of the Kentucky workers at the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant, \nwhere the uranium shipped to sites throughout the country was refined.\n  Under DOE's program, out of almost 3,000 former Paducah workers who \nhave filed for compensation for their illnesses. Zero workers have \nreceived any compensation for their illnesses.\n  The Department of Energy's current track record for slow processing \nof claims makes me believe that it lacks the capability to handle the \ncompensation program effectively.\n  The amendment transfers subtitle D claims processing operations from \nthe Department of Energy to the Department of Labor, who is currently \nhandling thousands of similar claims under subtitle B of the program.\n  The Department of Labor is one of the largest and most efficient \nclaims operations in the country.\n  Payments will be made directly by DOL to the worker or survivor. This \nsolves the current issue of no willing payer for all eligible claims.\n  The funds continue to be subject to annual appropriations as they \ncurrently are today.\n  CBO anticipates only minor costs associated with the transfer of the \nprogram to DOL.\n  This amendment fulfills the promise that Congress made to DOE workers \nin 2000 to provide payment and benefits for their illnesses due to \ntoxic substances.\n  Many of these workers are dying and should not have to wait any \nlonger for the Department of Energy to get its act together to process \nand pay the valid claims in a timely manner.\n  The current DOE program's lackluster performance is not what Congress \nenvisioned when it passed this act in 2000.\n  It is imperative that we protect those workers who risked their \nhealth and safety to help us win the cold war.\n  I urge you to support this amendment and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise to speak in strong support of \nthe Bunning-Bingaman amendment, of which I am a proud cosponsor.\n  At the outset, I want to thank Senator Bunning and Senator Bingaman \nfor their leadership and hard work on this amendment, and in bringing \nthis to the floor. I also want to thank Senator Grassley, Senator \nDomenici and the many other members who have worked on this amendment. \nThe full list of cosponsors is a long, bipartisan list: Bunning, \nBingaman, Grassley, Clinton, Domenici, Cantwell, Voinovich, Schumer, \nAlexander, Kennedy, Murkowski, Murray, DeWine, Feinstein, Talent, \nDurbin, Stevens, and Bond.\n  The purpose of our amendment is simple: We're here to help fulfill \nthe promise that Congress made 4 years ago to some of our Nation's cold \nwarriors. In 2000, thanks to the leadership of Senators Voinovich, \nKennedy, and many others, Congress passed the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Act as part of the FY\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\n2001 Defense Authorization Act. That law was both a recognition of the \nGovernment's responsibility for exposing energy program workers to \ndeadly radiation, and a promise that the Government would provide \ntimely assistance and compensation to workers who were harmed by \nexposure to radiation and other toxic substances.\n  I think it is worth briefly revisiting some of the findings of that \n2000 act, because I think it sets the context for this amendment. The \nfindings of that act stated:\n\n       Since the inception of the nuclear weapons program and for \n     several decades afterwards, a large number of nuclear weapons \n     workers at sites of the Department of Energy and at sites of \n     vendors who supplied the Cold War effort were put at risk \n     without their knowledge and consent for reasons that, \n     documents reveal, were driven by fears of adverse publicity, \n     liability, and employee demands for hazardous duty pay.\n       Many previously secret records have documented unmonitored \n     exposures to radiation and beryllium and continuing problems \n     at these sites across the Nation, at which the Department of \n     Energy and its predecessor agencies have been, since World \n     War II, self-regulating with respect to nuclear safety and \n     occupational safety and health. No other hazardous Federal \n     activity has been permitted to be carried out under such \n     sweeping powers of self-regulation.\n       The policy of the Department of Energy has been to litigate \n     occupational illness claims, which has deterred workers from \n     filing workers' compensation claims and has imposed major \n     financial burdens for such employees who have sought \n     compensation. Contractors of the Department have been held \n     harmless and the employees have been denied workers' \n     compensation coverage for occupational disease.\n       Over the past 20 years, more than two dozen scientific \n     findings have emerged that indicate that certain of such \n     employees are experiencing increased risks of dying from \n     cancer and non-malignant diseases. Several of these studies \n     have also established a correlation between excess diseases \n     and exposure to radiation and beryllium.\n       To ensure fairness and equity, the civilian men and women \n     who, over the past 50 years, have performed duties uniquely \n     related to the nuclear weapons production and testing \n     programs of the Department of Energy and its predecessor \n     agencies should have efficient, uniform, and adequate \n     compensation for beryllium-related health conditions and \n     radiation-related health conditions.\n\n  Although the findings of the 2000 act still stand, its promise of \nefficient, uniform and adequate compensation simply has not been met. \nThat is what this amendment is about--Congress needs to make good on \nthe promise it made in 2000.\n  Before I describe the amendment in detail, I want to make it clear \nthat this amendment is a compromise. It does not contain everything \nthat I would have liked to include, and I know that it reflects \ncompromises on both sides. But there is no question in my mind that it \nwill help workers in New York, and virtually everywhere else that our \nnuclear weapons production facility workers are found, and therefore I \nstrongly support it.\n  As Senator Bunning has described, Subtitle D of the 2000 act required \nDOE to review evidence to determine if a worker's illness was caused by \nexposure to toxic substances in their DOE work. Claimants with positive \nfindings from the DOE physician panels were to be assisted by DOE in \nfiling for and receiving State workers' compensation benefits due to \nthem.\n  Processing of claims by DOE has been extremely slow. In 4 years, only \n3 percent of claims have been processed by DOE. Eighty percent of \nsubtitle D claims are languishing in the DOE system at the very \nearliest stages of development or with no work begun on them at all. \nThere have been three Senate hearings in recent months examining the \nDOE's failed operation of Subtitle D of the EEOICPA program. GAO has \nstudied DOE's efforts under subtitle D and found significant problems \nwith both DOE's claims review process and DOE's ability to pay valid \nclaims.\n  The bottom line is that after 4 years and more than $90 million in \nadministrative funding, DOE admits that they have only provided \ncompensation to four claimants of the more than 24,000 that have \napplied for assistance under the Subtitle D program. Our amendment \naddresses this problem by transferring claims processing operations to \nthe Department of Labor, one of the largest and most efficient claims \noperations in the country. DOL is already processing thousands of \nsimilar claims under Subtitle B of EEOICPA and has already processed \nmore than 90 percent of their claims. Our amendment assures that \nbenefits due to workers or survivors will be paid according to the \nState laws covering the worker or survivor. The payments will be made \ndirectly by DOL to the worker or survivor. Benefits will be paid with \nappropriated funds, just as they would have been had DOE performed as \nexpected. The Department of Labor's operation of this program is likely \nto be significantly more efficient and less expensive than DOE's \ncurrent claims processing operation.\n  Although I would have preferred to see a uniform benefit established \nunder subtitle D in this amendment, I believe that moving the subtitle \nD program to the Department of Labor will be a very significant \nimprovement.\n  The amendment also corrects a significant problem associated with \nsubtitle B of the 2000 Act. Under subtitle B of the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program Act, workers are eligible for \na payment of $150,000 and medical coverage for expenses associated with \nthe treatment of certain illnesses resulting from exposure to radiation \nat atomic weapons plants. This part program is administered by the \nDepartment of Labor, and though its administration has been far better \nthan the subtitle D program administered by DOE, it has had its share \nof problems as well. One of the problems is that workers who became \nsick from working in contaminated atomic weapons plants after weapons \nproduction ceased are not eligible to apply for benefits under subtitle \nB of the Act.\n  Recognizing that this was a potential oversight in the 2000 act, \nCongress directed the National Institute of Occupational Safety and \nHealth to study the issue and report back to Congress. In 2003, NIOSH \nfinished its study, entitled ``Report on Residual Radioactive and \nBeryllium Contamination in Atomic Weapons Employer and Beryllium Vendor \nFacilities.'' The report concluded potential for significant residual \nradioactive contamination existed in many of these plants for years and \ndecades after weapons production ceased, posing a risk of radiation-\nrelated cancers or disease to unknowing workers.\n  In fact, the report found that: 97, 44 percent, covered facilities \nhave potential for significant residual radioactive contamination \noutside of the periods in which atomic weapons-related production \noccurred; 88, 40 percent, such facilities have little potential for \nsignificant residual radioactive contamination outside of the periods \nin which atomic weapons-related production occurred; and 34, 16 \npercent, such facilities have insufficient information to make a \ndetermination.\n  In my State of New York, 16 of 31 covered facilities were found to \nhave the potential for significant contamination, 10 had little \npotential for significant contamination, and 5 of the 31 had \ninsufficient information. In other words, more than half of the New \nYork Atomic Weapons Employer Facilities in New York were contaminated \nafter weapons production ceased. As a result, workers were exposed to \nradiation, and deserve to be eligible for benefits under EEOICPA.\n  But this is not just a New York issue. The 97 facilities where NIOSH \nfound the potential for significant residual radioactive contamination \noutside the periods during which weapons-related production are spread \nacross 16 States. I want to briefly list these States for the benefit \nof my colleagues. They are California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, \nIndiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Missoiuri, New \nJersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.\n  Once the NIOSH report came out, it was clear that the law needed to \nbe changed. The fact is that many of the facilities remained \ncontaminated after weapons production ceased, and workers continued to \nbe unwittingly exposed to radiation. That is why I introduced the \nResidual Radioactive Contamination Compensation Act, RRCCA, earlier \nthis year, and I am pleased that with some modifications, it has been \nincorporated into this amendment.\n\n  The most important change that this provision will accomplish is that \nit will provide eligibility for benefits under subtitle B to workers \nwho were employed at facilities where NIOSH has found potential for \nsignificant radioactive contamination. This just means that these \nworkers will be eligible to\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\napply for benefits like the workers who were exposed to radiation \nduring weapons production. We are not automatically granting them \nbenefits. We are just saying that they ought to be eligible to apply. \nAnd that is only fair.\n  In addition to expanding eligibility to workers employed at \nfacilities where NIOSH has found potential for significant radioactive \ncontamination, the amendment would require NIOSH to update the list of \nsuch facilities by 2006. This addresses the fact that there was \ninsufficient information for NIOSH to characterize a number of sites in \nits 2003 report.\n  As I pointed out earlier, fixing this so-called ``residual \ncontamination'' oversight in the 2000 act will be very helpful to a \nsmall number of deserving workers in my State, particularly in western \nNew York. And it will be similarly helpful to workers in the other 15 \nStates that I mentioned.\n  Due to the efforts of Senator Schumer, the amendment would also \nestablish a center in western New York to help people navigate the \nclaim system. I want to applaud his work on this provision which will \nalso be extremely helpful to New Yorkers. These are steps forward, and \npaired with the changes to the workers compensation portion of the \nprogram that Senator Bunning has outlined, represent significant \nimprovements.\n  Before I close, I want to make several additional points.\n  First, this is a modest amendment. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that making workers who were exposed to residual \ncontamination eligible for benefits under subtitle B of the act, as I \nhave described, will cost only $2.9 million per year over 10 years. The \nchanges to subtitle D, the workers' compensation component of the \nprogram, are also relatively inexpensive. CBO anticipates the program \nwill need an appropriation of an additional $2 million in FY 05 from \nthe current program to pay for these changes, and that annual costs in \nfuture years will be on the order of $25 million per year annual costs. \nThis is very close to the current scored amount for this portion of the \nprogram. All of these costs are fully offset in the amendment. This is \na very small price to pay to help fulfill the promise that Congress \nmade to weapons workers in 2000. It is not everything that I and others \ninvolved in the negotiations would have wanted, but it will make a \nsignificant difference.\n  Finally, I note that last week we celebrated the life and service of \nRonald Reagan. Many of the tributes to President Reagan focused on his \nrole in ending the cold war. Ronald Reagan was a commander in chief in \nthat war--one of the last in a line of commanders in chief that \nstretched back to the end of World War II. As we all know, the cold war \nwas a different kind of war--one that relied on deterrence, the \ncredible threat of a massive retaliatory attack by the U.S. In a very \nreal sense, the foot soldiers of that cold war included the men and \nwomen who toiled in the weapons production related facilities run by \nDOE and its contractors. These people were true cold war heroes, \nworking in hazardous conditions, and in some cases, paid a heavy price \nin terms of their health. We owe it to them to fix the glaring flaws in \nthe Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky explained, the purpose of the program in \n2000 was to remedy and provide compensation for workers who had been \nthe warriors during the cold war. It was not a hot war. It was a cold \nwar.\n  One of the commitments made by our Nation in passing the legislation \nin 2000 was to recognize our responsibility to workers who were exposed \nto radiation and to help them with medical and living expenses all \nthese years later. One of the problems is that workers who became sick \nfrom working in contaminated atomic weapons plants or their \ncontractors, after weapons production ceased, were not eligible to \napply for benefits under the act. Recognizing that this was a potential \noversight, the Congress directed the National Institute of Occupational \nSafety and Health to study this issue and report back to Congress.\n  In 2003, NIOSH--the national institute--submitted a report entitled \n``Report on Residual Radioactive and Beryllium Contamination in Atomic \nWeapons Employer and Beryllium Vendor Facilities.'' That is a long way \nof describing that the NIOSH investigators found that some of the \nplants people have worked in were contaminated for years after the \nactual weapons production ceased or after the actual components for the \nweapons production in the contractor's plant ceased. The report \nconcluded there was a potential for significant residual radioactive \ncontamination that posed a risk of radiation-related cancers or \ndiseases to unknowing workers. In fact, the report found that 44 \npercent or 97 of the facilities that fell into the category of being \npotentially residually contaminated did have evidence of such \ncontamination; 88 such facilities have little potential for such \ncontamination; 34 had insufficient information on which to base a \ndetermination.\n  In New York, 16 of 31 facilities that could have been considered \nresidually contaminated were found to have significant contamination. I \nam not satisfied with the NIOSH findings because I think we now know \nmore about where to look for and how to discover this residual \ncontamination. The bottom line is that, even under the NIOSH report of \n2003, we had workers in New York who were found to have been exposed to \nradiation and beryllium because of the work they did for our country \nthrough the contracting in order to produce the weapons needed in the \ncold war.\n  This is not just a New York issue, obviously. There are 16 States \nwhere this residual contamination has been found. So out of the NIOSH \nreport it became clear that we needed to amend the law. I introduced \nthe Residual Radioactive Contamination Compensation Act. I am pleased \nthat, with some modifications, it has been incorporated into this \namendment.\n  The most important change is we now will provide eligibility for \nbenefits under subtitle B of the original act to workers who were \nemployed at facilities where NIOSH has found potential for significant \nradioactive contamination. That means they will be able to apply for \nbenefits just like the workers who we know were directly exposed to \nradiation during weapons production. They are not automatically \neligible for benefits, but they now have a right to apply. That is only \nfair.\n  In addition to expanding eligibility for workers employed at \nfacilities where the potential for residual contamination was \ndiscovered, my amendment requires NIOSH to update the list of such \nfacilities by 2006. I have met with these men who worked in these \nplants. They came home from World War II--the vast majority of them--\nand they went to work in the industrial plants that were all over \nwestern New York in the late 1940s and 1950s, and they worked hard. \nThey have distinct memories of rolling big coils of uranium around the \nfloor of the plants, and uranium residue was falling into the fires of \nthe steel mills. It is a very touching experience because they did what \nthey were supposed to do. Many of them fought in Europe, in the \nPacific, and came home after the war to lead their lives, raise their \nfamilies. They worked hard for years, and now they are sick. So we need \nto fix this.\n  I am grateful for this amendment moving us forward. I am going to \nfocus hard on NIOSH as they continue their work to meet the 2006 update \ndeadline that this amendment imposes because I think there are other \nfacilities--certainly in my State--where it is indisputable that they \nwere contaminated by residual radioactive materials.\n\n  We are also establishing a center in western New York to help people \nnavigate the claims system. As the Senator from Kentucky pointed out, \nthe DOE has not done the job. We need to have a place where all of \nthese workers, many of whom are in their seventies and eighties now, \ncan go and get the information about this new law and they can get \ntheir claims expedited accordingly.\n  This is a modest amendment. The CBO estimates that making workers who \nwere exposed to residual contamination eligible for benefits under \nsubtitle B of the act will cost only $2.9 million per year over 10 \nyears. The changes to subtitle D, the workers' compensation component \nof the program, are also relatively inexpensive. CBO anticipates the \nprogram will need an appropriation of an additional $2 million in \nfiscal year 2005 from the current program to pay for these changes, and \nthat annual costs in future years\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\nwill be on the order of $25 million per year. This is very close to the \ncurrent scoring amount for this portion of the program. The difference \nis we are not only going to do the program better and take care of more \npeople, these costs are fully offset in this amendment.\n  Madam President, this is a very small price to pay to fulfill the \npromise Congress made to weapons workers in 2000 and that Americans \nmade to these men over decades as they labored in these facilities. It \nis obviously not everything some of us would wish for, but it is a very \nhonorable compromise, and the sponsors of the bill have worked very \nhard to bring it about.\n  So I hope that, in the wake of dedicating the World War II Memorial \nand the week of honors to President Reagan and his legacy, we recall \nthat during the cold war we relied on deterrence. What that meant is we \nhad to have a credible threat of a massive retaliatory attack by the \nUnited States against the Soviet Union in the event that they were to \neven consider acting against us.\n  In a very real sense, the soldiers of the cold war were also the men \nand women who toiled in these weapons production facilities run by DOE \nand the contractors, many of whom were in western New York and \nthroughout my State. These were people who worked in hazardous \nconditions; many have paid a heavy price in terms of their health.\n  I am very pleased that today we are taking a step to fix the glaring \nflaws in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \nProgram, and I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the Bunning-\nBingaman amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I want to join all of my colleagues, \nincluding my good friend, the Senator from Kentucky, my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Clinton, Senator Bingaman, and so many others who are \nin support of this bipartisan amendment, which would not only improve \nmany of the unsuccessful provisions of the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program Act, but it would also \naddress critical areas of concern important to workers that were not \nproperly dealt with in the original legislation.\n  For decades during the cold war, thousands of New Yorkers labored in \nhazardous conditions at DOE and contractor facilities, unaware of the \nconsiderable health risks. Workers at these facilities handled high \nlevels of radioactive materials and were responsible for helping create \nthe huge nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent to the Soviet Union \nduring the cold war.\n  Although Government scientists knew of the dangers posed by \nradiation, workers were given little or no protection, and many have \nbeen diagnosed with cancer.\n  During the cold war, New York alone was home to 36 former atomic \nweapon employer sites and DOE cleanup facilities. In the 8 counties of \nwestern New York--in the Buffalo and Niagara region, where this is \nparticularly a problem--there were 14 facilities that participated in \nthe manufacture of America's nuclear arsenal.\n  Despite having one of the greatest concentrations of facilities \ninvolved in nuclear weapons production-related activities in the \nNation, western New York continued to be seriously underserved by the \nEnergy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, not just \nfor a year or two but for many years. Many constituents from my State \nwent unaware of the program entirely or were not provided with \nsufficient information about how the claimant process worked. In the \nopinion of my constituents, this program was completely ineffectual in \nits ability to address their questions and concerns properly.\n  Despite statutory language in section 3631 of the original \nlegislation, which required DOL to provide outreach and claimant \nassistance, the only assistance applicants received when applying for \nthis program was from a traveling resource center that came to the area \ntoo infrequently to serve the public.\n  Today I am happy to say that the Bunning-Bingaman amendment would \nsubstantially improve the effectiveness of outreach and claimant \nassistance to applicants from the New York region by recognizing the \nneed for a resource center in western New York. This is something we \nhave been pushing for years. This would be a substantial step toward \nimproving services for workers in my home State.\n  Upon successful passage of this legislation, I look forward to \nworking with the newly established Office of the Ombudsman to locate a \nresource center in the western New York region. A permanent facility \nwould not only increase awareness of the program among residents but \nwould help serve workers throughout the claimant process.\n  Furthermore, this legislation would repair the definition of an \n``atomic weapons employee'' to assure that those exposed to residual \nradiation after a facility finished processing radioactive materials \nfor nuclear weapons programs would qualify to apply for benefits--a \ntruly fundamental expansion on which my esteemed colleague Senator \nClinton has been a leader.\n  In a report released at the end of 2003, NIOSH identified 86 atomic \nweapons employer facilities across the country where there was a \npotential for significant residual radiation outside the period in \nwhich weapons-related production occurred, and 14 of those are in my \nhome State of New York.\n  Passage of this new legislation would provide a significant \nopportunity for sick nuclear workers from across New York and the \ncountry who were formally excluded from this program to receive the \ncompensation they deserve.\n  While the act was enacted to provide compensation to employees of the \nDepartment of Energy and its contractors who were exposed to radiation \nor other toxic substances, a significant portion of this program \nutterly failed--utterly failed--in its obligations to thousands of \nAmericans who dutifully acted as soldiers on the front lines of the \nnuclear arms race.\n  After 4 years and more than $90 million in administrative funding, \nDOE admits they have only provided compensation to 4 claimants of the \nmore than 24,000 who have applied for assistance under subtitle D. \nThere have been multiple Senate hearings examining the failures of this \nprogram and particularly of subtitle D. GAO has studied DOE's efforts \nunder subtitle D and found significant problems with both DOE's claims \nreview process and the ability to pay valid claims.\n  Today we owe it to those who sacrificed their health and safety for \nthe security of America to pass the Bunning-Bingaman amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Kentucky, and the Senator from New Mexico as well. The \nSenator from Kentucky has worked diligently, consistently, \npersistently, and made certain that this amendment saw the light of \nday.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for permitting it to be considered \nin this way.\n  I only have a brief comment to make, but this is an important \ncomment. As the Senator from New York said, this amendment will fulfill \nthe intent of the act in 2000 which intended to provide for our cold-\nwar veterans, our sick workers. The Senator from Alaska, who is in the \nchair, has been one of those who have spoken eloquently about this in \nthe Energy Committee on which we both serve.\n  Over 24,000 of our Nation's cold-war veterans have filed claims with \nthe Department of Energy, and over 18,000 of those claims are still \nbeing developed or awaiting development. There are more than 4,800 \ncold-war veterans in Tennessee who are sick and are getting the \nrunaround from the Department of Energy. It needs to stop. We should be \ntreating our cold-war veterans with the same respect they have treated \nour country.\n  As of March 18 of this year, 60 percent of these cases were still \nawaiting development--60 percent. The Department of Energy has had, as \nhas been said already, nearly 4 years to get its act together and has \nyet to do so. This amendment will transfer the responsibility of claims \nfrom the Department of Energy to the Department of Labor. The \nDepartment of Labor currently\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\nruns several workers' compensation programs and is well equipped to \nhandle those claims. The changes will provide uniform medical benefits \nand allow a large number of claimants in the process to receive \ncompensation much sooner.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Bunning and Bingaman and the other supporters of this \nlegislation, to support this very important amendment. This amendment \nwill improve an existing program which provides financial and medical \ncompensation to workers who were made ill as a result of their \nemployment at the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons facilities.\n  Since the end of World War II, at facilities all across America, tens \nof thousands of dedicated men and women in our civilian Federal and \ncontract workforce helped keep our military fully supplied and our \nNation fully prepared to face any threat from our adversaries around \nthe world by developing and building our Nation's nuclear weapons \nstockpile. The success of these workers in meeting this challenge is \nmeasured in part with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the \nSoviet Union. However, for many of these workers, their success came at \na very high price. They sacrificed their health and even their lives, \nin many instances without knowing the risks they were facing, to \npreserve our liberty. I will not go into the details, but I saw the \nmemoranda and all the other items they should have had available to \nthem but which were kept from them. What happened to these workers was \nworse than what happened to the workers in the movie ``Erin \nBrockovich'' that many of us saw.\n  I believe these men and women have paid a high price for our freedom, \nand in their time of need this Nation has a moral obligation to provide \nsome financial and medical assistance to these cold-war veterans. That \nis what they are--cold-war veterans.\n  To meet that goal, I worked with a bipartisan group of my colleagues \n4 years ago to create a program that would provide financial \ncompensation to Department of Energy contract workers whose impaired \nhealth has been caused by exposure to beryllium, radiation, or other \nhazardous substances. I have been pleased to be involved with this \nprogram from the beginning. In fact, the passage and creation of this \nlegislation in 2000 was one of my proudest moments as a Member of the \nSenate. It took monumental efforts by a bipartisan group of my \ncolleagues, many of whom cosponsored this amendment we are debating \ntoday. I said at that time the Holy Spirit was working because, without \ndivine help, this would never ever have gotten done.\n  Under the current program, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program, workers suffering from beryllium disease, \nsilicosis, or cancer due to radiation exposure because of their work in \nour national security programs are eligible for Federal compensation. \nThe Department of Labor was assigned primary responsibility for \nadministration and adjudicating these claims under part B of this act.\n  Under part D, the Department of Energy would assist claimants filing \nfor compensation through State workers' compensation programs if a \nphysicians panel found an occupational illness caused by chemical or \nother toxic exposure at a DOE site. Claims were not to be contested by \ncontractors, and any compensation was to be paid by the Department of \nEnergy.\n  This compromise package that was ultimately agreed to by Congress and \nsigned into law was not what I originally supported in 2000. I \nintroduced a bill which called for a Federal program administered \nentirely by the Department of Labor, but during congressional \nnegotiations on the language authorizing the program, I agreed to this \nmultiagency concept in order to reach a compromise creating the \nprogram. The fact is, if we did not agree to that, we would not have \ngotten a bill out of conference. So I agreed to it.\n  I have been pleased with the excellent program the Labor Department \nis running. Over 3 years after enactment, we have seen over 13,000 \nclaimants receive compensation from DOL. On the other hand, I am \nbecoming extremely frustrated with DOE's administration of part D of \nthe program. More important than my frustration, however, is the fact \nthat claimants who deserve answers and compensation are experiencing \nendless delays. I visited with some of those people. They cannot \nunderstand why this bureaucracy in Washington does not work.\n  While over 24,000 claims have been received by the Department, only \n646 final decisions have been sent to claimants. Think about that: Out \nof 24,000, only 646 have been sent to claimants.\n  Even more shocking is that only four claimants have any compensation \nat all from the DOE portion of this program. I have always been \nskeptical of the capability of the Department of Energy to administer \nthis because of their lack of experience in administering workers' \ncompensation programs. I could have told them that when we started out, \nbut no one would have listened.\n  Additionally, I was concerned about the role of State workers' \ncompensation programs outlined in part D. As a former Governor, I was \ndoubtful that a Federal program such as this would be able to work in \neach of the individual State programs.\n  There are two inherent problems within the existing program: \ncontinued delays and slowness in processing claims, and the so-called \nwilling payer issue.\n  This amendment addresses both of those issues. In order to speed up \nclaims handling and processing, this amendment moves administration of \npart D from the DOE to the DOL. I believe DOL is better suited to \nadministering this program because they have significant experience in \nadministering workers' compensation programs, including part B of the \nprogram.\n  This amendment also addresses the willing payer issue, another very \nimportant aspect. Under the current program, I understand it will be \ndifficult for DOE to fulfill congressional intent in Ohio because there \nis not a contractor in place at the sites that can be compelled to pay \nthe claims. They are no longer there. Many other workers nationwide are \nfacing the same shortcomings in this program. In fact, the Ohio Bureau \nof Works' Compensation has tried unsuccessfully to work with DOE to \nensure that this program works in Ohio.\n  The current administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation \nis probably the best public administrator I have met in my life. He \nstarted with me when I was Lieutenant Governor, worked with me when I \nwas mayor, and came to work with me as Governor of the State of Ohio. I \nwould like to just quote from his letter to me and Senator DeWine. He \nstated:\n\n       I understand DOL's and DOE's concern with this amendment, \n     but BWC must ultimately look at what is best for the \n     customer, in this case, the injured workers; consequently, we \n     feel the changes proposed by the amendment will result in \n     positive developments. Since the program's inception, DOE has \n     failed (for whatever reasons, some of which may not be the \n     department's fault) to process its claims in a timely \n     fashion. A recent General Accounting Office report stated \n     that DOE had only processed 6 percent of the 23,000 received \n     claims. Clearly, the current system is not working. We \n     believe throwing more money into a system that does not work \n     will only compound the problem.\n\n  The amendment we are considering today enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. It is also supported by many State compensation \nsystems and local labor organizations, including the Ohio Bureau of \nWorkers' Compensation, the PACE locals at Mound and Portsmouth, and the \nFernald Atomic Trades and Labor Council in my home State of Ohio.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. It simply \nfulfills the promise that we made to these veterans of the cold war. We \nhave kept them waiting too long.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter from Administrator Conrad \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\n\n                                                   The Ohio Bureau\n\n\n                                      of Workers Compensation,\n\n                                       Columbus, OH, June 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. George Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine and Senator Voinovich: I write today to \n     express the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation's (BWC's) \n     support for the pending Bunning-Bingaman amendment to reform \n     portions of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Act of 2000. As you know, portions of this \n     program, especially Subtitle D, have failed to process claims \n     and assist injured workers with receiving their rightful \n     benefits in a timely fashion. As stated in our previous \n     letters, the Department of Labor (DOL) has found success \n     implementing its part of the program (Subtitle B); however, \n     the Department of Energy (DOE) has not met with the same \n     results. Over the past two years, BWC has actively sought a \n     positive solution to this problem with DOE and we are \n     prepared to support the Bunning-Bingaman amendment to help \n     move this program in the right direction.\n       I understand DOL's and DOE's concern with this amendment, \n     but BWC must ultimately look at what is best for the \n     customer, in this case the injured workers; consequently, we \n     feel the changes proposed by the amendment will result in \n     positive developments. Since the program's inception, DOE has \n     failed (for whatever reasons, some of which may not be the \n     department's fault) to process its claims in a timely \n     fashion. A recent General Accounting Office report stated \n     that DOE had only processed 6% of the 23,000 received claims. \n     Clearly, the current system is not working. We believe \n     throwing more money into a system that does not work will \n     only compound the problem.\n       We believe the Bunning-Bingaman amendment will reform the \n     system to speed up claims processing and benefit payouts. It \n     will allow states to serve as consultants to advise the \n     federal government on the benefit levels eligible injured \n     workers should be receiving. In effect, the federal workers' \n     compensation program outlined in this amendment offers fewer \n     limitations and easier access to benefits for the injured \n     workers of Ohio than did the previous system that was in \n     place. The states will serve as guides to the federal \n     government to help determine the correct benefit levels.\n       In addition, by shifting causation determinations and case \n     development from DOE to DOL, it removes subjecting similar \n     injured workers from having to go through multiple federal \n     and state jurisdictions for approval. Injured workers \n     receiving Subtitle B benefits are determined to be eligible \n     for Subtitle D benefits, which will speed up claims and \n     benefit distributions since 50% of all Subtitle D claims have \n     already been awarded Subtitle B benefits.\n       In sum, we believe the amendment will help steamline the \n     program and take the burden off the states while speeding up \n     the process for the injured workers. It is our belief that \n     the Bunning-Bingaman amendment will help resolve this problem \n     and help bring relief to injured and ill Ohio workers and \n     their families. As has been our history with this program, \n     BWC stands ready to assist the process in any way possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James Conrad,\n                                                Administrator/CEO.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment offered by Senators Bunning and Bingaman. This amendment, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor, makes significant and much needed reforms to \nthe Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act of 2000.\n  Congress passed this law to provide timely, uniform, and adequate \ncompensation to sick nuclear workers. These Department of Energy \nemployees or contractors were made sick from exposure to toxic \nsubstances or radiation while assembling our nuclear deterrent. This \nlaw required DOE to help these former workers compile employment and \nmedical records to assist in the filing of State workers compensation.\n  There are two facilities in Iowa that are covered under this law. \nOver 600 claims have been filed by former workers of the Iowa Army \nAmmunition Plant located in Middletown, IA. These patriots served on \nour Nation's homefront during the cold war, putting themselves at risk \nbuilding nuclear weapons. The least our Government can do is provide \nthe necessary assistance to ensure that those eligible for compensation \nreceive it.\n  However, one thing has been made perfectly clear. The Department of \nEnergy does not have the capability or expertise to fulfill their \nresponsibilities under this act. I began to question DOE's ability to \nprocess these claims in April of 2003, when I noticed they had received \nover 15,000 claims and only a handful had been fully processed.\n  I questioned Secretary Abraham on this point. I followed up with \nUnder Secretary Card a few months later. I was told on both occasions \nthat all DOE needed was more time and more money. I was skeptical, to \nsay the least.\n  Then, last fall, the General Accounting Office confirmed my \nsuspicions. Their conclusions, in a report I had requested, were \nstunning. Of the more than 19,000 claims filed with the Department of \nEnergy, only 6 percent had been completely processed, and over 50 \npercent remained untouched. Even more, GAO concluded that more money \nalone would not result in more timely processing.\n  Becasue it was clear that DOE had a substandard operation in place to \nimplement this important program, Senator Lisa Murkowski and I took \naction. We offered and had accepted an amendment to the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill to transfer the claims processing from DOE to \nthe Department of Labor.\n  We knew at the time that DOE was not on the right track, and that DOL \nhad the experience and expertise to handle this compensation program. \nWhile we were successful in the Senate, the Department of Energy and \ntheir contract had their way, and our amendment was stripped in \nconference.\n  Since that time, I have testified before Chairman Domenici's Energy \nCommittee twice to outline the abysmal performance of the Department of \nEnergy. It was at the second hearing where I shared information I had \nuncovered about the contractor that DOE had hired to do this work.\n  While only 6 percent of claims had been fully processed, DOE believed \nit was perfectly reasonable to pay the program manager of their hired \ncontractor $401,000 annually. The head of DOE's contractor costs the \ntaxpayer more than the salaries of Secretary Abraham and Secretary Chao \ncombined.\n  Today's bipartisan amendment is a comprehensive approach to finally \nput an end to the perpetual delay in claims processing and address the \nlack of a willing payor to pay valid claims in Iowa.\n  It is my understanding that the administration opposes our amendment \nbecause they believe it will create an unworkable process and delay the \nprocessing of claims. This is precisely the same position they held \nlast October when Senator Murkowski and I pushed similar reforms.\n  It is unfortunate that the administration hasn't realized during this \ntime that the unworkable process and unnecessary delay is not a result \nof our efforts here in Congress but the result of 4 years of \nineffectiveness at the Department of Energy. This amendment simply \nmakes the original law work.\n  I hope my colleagues can support our efforts on behalf of the \nthousands of sick nuclear workers across the Nation. Through this \namendment, these sick workers will finally receive the compensation \nthey so richly deserve.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to offer my support for \nthe amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Bunning, to reform the \nEnergy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act.\n  The purpose of this act was straightforward when enacted in 2000: to \ncompensate sick workers at Department of Energy facilities, and \nindustrial sites, who performed work involving radioactive and \nhazardous materials associated with nuclear weapons. More importantly, \nit was to compensate them quickly, and with a minimal amount of \nbureaucracy, given that many of these workers are dying.\n  Unfortunately, 4 years later that does not appear to be the case for \nsubtitle D of this act, as administered by the Department of Energy, \nwhich handles claims that are to go forward to State compensation \nboards.\n  Let me cite some statistics that indicate to me that there appears to \nbe a structural problem with subtitle D. As of June 4, 2004, the \nDepartment of Energy has 24,354 cases pending to determine whether \nworking at a DOE facility was the cause of their illness. Yet as of \nJune 4, 2004, only four of the cases have received a favorable \ndetermination from State Worker Compensation Boards. The amount paid \nout for these four cases is approximately $139,000.\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\nOver the past 4 years, the administration of this program has cost the \ntaxpayers $95 million.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee has held two hearings on \nthis program to explore solutions to the problems we face under \nsubtitle D. The first hearing was on November 23, 2003. It had seven \nwitnesses, including Senator Grassley and Under Secretary Card from the \nDepartment of Energy. The other five witnesses were experts in the \nfield of injured worker compensation; all had worked on this program \nsince its inception. At that hearing, the expert witnesses confirmed \nthere were major problems processing the claims under subtitle D. Dr. \nDavid Michaels, the former DOE official who developed this program, \ntold the committee that subtitle D, as administered by the DOE, was a \nfailure.\n  The second hearing on March 30, 2004, included Senator Grassley, DOE \nUnder Secretary Card and officials from the GAO, Department of Labor \nand NIOSH. At this hearing, the DOE proposed several legislative \nchanges to the processing of the claims, such as reducing the physician \npanels from 3 to 1 and increasing the pay for qualified physicians. In \nmy opinion, these administration proposals fell short, yet these \nproposals are in the current Department of Defense bill the Senate is \ndebating.\n  Because of these two hearings, Senator Bunning and I are now \nproposing this amendment, which we believe will help fix some of the \nproblems found under subtitle D. The amendment has undergone many hours \nof bipartisan staff discussion over several months.\n  The most significant element of the amendment is the shift of \nsubtitle D from the DOE to the Department of Labor, which specializes \nin handling such claims. If the claim is found to have been caused by \nemployment at a DOE site, the Department of Labor then pays the sick \nworker his lost wages at the time of his employment plus medical \nexpenses, according to their State compensation formula at the time of \nemployment.\n  This payment scheme is a positive step forward. It eliminates an \nadversarial adjudication in front of a State compensation board, which \nin some cases, even if positively adjudicated, will have no willing \npayer as the contractor has long since vanished. Sick workers who \nperformed inherently unique governmental functions associated with \nnuclear weapons should not be subjected to this adversarial \nadjudication process.\n  I believe the remedy that Professor John Burton of Rutgers University \nproposed is the better approach. Professor Burton is the Nation's \nleading expert on workers compensation, and he has given advice on this \nlegislation since it was first enacted. At the March 30 hearing, \nProfessor Burton recommended a single formula modified according to the \ndegree of disability. In this way, the Department of Labor is not tied \nto each State's compensation formula as in this amendment.\n  Nevertheless, I think this amendment reflects a bipartisan effort, \nand in doing so, compromises had to be struck by all parties.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nin support of the New Mexico Workers' Compensation Administration for \nfixing the program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  New Mexico Workers' Compensation Commission Statement About EEOICPA \n                          Reform--June 2, 2004\n\n       The NM Workers' Compensation Administration strongly \n     supports concrete steps by the federal government to provide \n     meaningful implementation of the EEOICPA. By meaningful \n     implementation, we mean federal monetary compensation and \n     medical care for workers made ill by exposure to radiation \n     and toxic substances while performing jobs related to atomic \n     weapon production and Cold War efforts. Our state, along with \n     others, dedicated its most valuable resource, human lives, to \n     the strengthening of the nation. New Mexico citizens are \n     proud to have served. Many dignified New Mexicans, including \n     our friend and beloved state Representative Ray Ruiz, have \n     tragically passed away from work related illnesses while \n     waiting for the federal government to fulfill promises \n     contained in the Act. These fine people are patriots that \n     were seriously injured while working on federal priorities. \n     They are still waiting for federal help. The NM Workers' \n     Compensation Administration stands ready and willing to \n     assist in any way it can, and certainly will not stand in the \n     way of federal authorities finally fulfilling the promises \n     made to these citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan M. Varela,\n        Director, New Mexico Workers' Compensation Administration.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me note that even though this amendment proposes to \nmove subtitle D from the DOE to the Department of Labor, the DOE will \ncontinue to play a vital role in locating and interpreting the workers' \nemployment and medical records. This move will let the DOE concentrate \nsolely on performing this important function without trying to \nadminister a large claims processing program.\n  I conclude by thanking those who have contributed to this effort. I \nthank Ms. Kate Kimpan from Senator Bunning's Office, who has provided \nnever-ending technical support on a complicated subject. I also thank \nMr. Richard Miller of the Government Accountability Project, Mr. Jay \nPowers of the AFL-CIO, and others of the building trade unions. Richard \nMiller and Jay Powers have worked to help sick atomic workers since \nthis program was initiated, and have continued to make Congress aware \nof its failings 4 years later; we owe both these gentlemen a debt of \ngratitude.\n  These workers and their families have suffered the pain of serious \nillnesses for so long--we should not make them suffer the indignity of \ntrying to navigate Government red tape a moment longer. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on June 10, the Las Vegas Review-Journal \npublished an editorial about the program my friend from Kentucky seeks \nto fix. As the editorial noted, this program was created to compensate \nour cold war veterans who are sick from their work at nuclear \nfacilities around the country, including the Nevada Test Site, during \nthe cold war.\n  These brave men and women were not told that they were exposed to \ndangerous levels of radiation and other toxic substances. In fact, for \nyears the Department of Energy knew the deadly effects of these \nsubstances but still resisted workers' attempts to seek compensation \nfor their work-related illnesses.\n  The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, which \nbegan in 2000, was created to remedy the decades of stonewalling and \ndeception by the DOE. When we worked to create this program in 2000, we \nput part of it under the auspices of the Department of Energy. We \nintended to provide relief to sick workers and their widows who are \nstrapped with medical bills. As of April, only one worker in Washington \nState had received any compensation through the DOE program. Three more \nworkers have now received compensation.\n  More than 24,000 workers have filed claims with the Department of \nEnergy. After 4 years and about $74 million worth of work, exactly four \nof these workers have received compensation. The Review-Journal calls \nthe DOE's program a ``boondoggle.'' I couldn't agree more. Many of \nthese workers, if not most of them, are very sick. They are aging. If \nthey have to wait much longer, they may not live long enough to receive \nthe compensation they deserve. That isn't fair, and it isn't right.\n  My colleague from Kentucky is offering his amendment because these \nworkers' illnesses will not wait for the DOE to fix this program on its \nown. This program has another serious problem that his amendment seeks \nto correct: some workers who file claims and deserve compensation have \nno entity to pay their claims.\n  In Nevada, for example, 482 workers have filed for compensation. If \nthey were exposed to toxic substances at the Nevada Test Site before \n1993, they would have no so-called ``willing payer'' of workers' \ncompensation.\n  For 3 years, Congress has asked the Department of Energy to suggest a \nway to fix this problem. The best answer we have received is, we are \nlooking into it.\n  In its last hearing on this program, the DOE said it had no \nresponsibility to help workers through their State workers' \ncompensation programs. The bureaucrats at DOE are missing the point of \nthis program. Yes, DOE is finally beginning to admit to some of its \nworkers that their jobs made them sick. That is a step in the right \ndirection. But admitting responsibility for\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\nthese illnesses, and then declining to offer any help, is not in the \nspirit or the letter of the law we passed 4 years ago.\n  The Department of Energy was given a huge opportunity with this \nprogram to rectify its previous mistakes that caused these workers to \nbecome sick. I am very disappointed with what the DOE has done with \nthat opportunity, but I am not surprised considering how they have \nbotched our nuclear waste program.\n  I hope our action today will move us toward fulfilling the promises \nwe made to these workers. Just as we would never leave a soldier on the \nbattlefield, we must not leave behind these Americans whose work in the \nnuclear industry helped our Nation win the cold war.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam. President, I support Senator Bunning's amendment \nto improve the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \nProgram Act. The program, for all its growing pains, is becoming a \nlong-awaited success. It has now provided benefits to over ten thousand \nemployees or their surviving family members.\n  Four years ago, I joined my colleagues Senators Thompson, Bingaman, \nand Voinovich to pass this program to compensate workers for the \ndangers they have faced from chemicals and radioactivity in their work \nin producing nuclear weapons many years ago. Many of them suffered \ndebilitating and often fatal illnesses directly related to their \nexposure. The health and safety hazards they faced were not as well \nknown as they are today, but in many cases, the government decided that \nproduction of the weapons was more important than the safety and health \nof the workers.\n  The compensation program was intended to right this wrong, and many \nof its goals have been achieved in the past 4 years. The Department of \nLabor has processed over 30,000 out of 55,000 claims, and made payments \nof over $870 million in compensation and medical bills.\n  Unfortunately, not all parts of the program have been as successful. \nThe part handled by the Department of Energy is not functioning as it \nshould. The Department has moved very slowly. After four years and more \nthan $90 million in administrative costs, 80 percent of the 24,000 \nclaims the Department has received have still not been fully processed.\n  Even workers who do make it through the system are not being paid. \nBecause the payments are funneled through State workers' compensation \nsystems, even persons who we acknowledge were made sick by their work \nhave to fight for the compensation they are owed. At this point, we \nknow of only four claims that have been paid.\n  This is why this amendment is needed, and I commend Senator Bunning \nand Senator Bingaman for their leadership in developing this bi-\npartisan solution. I also commend the many other colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle who have been working on this amendment for several \nmonths in order to guarantee that the relief the workers and their \nfamilies deserve as soon as possible.\n  The amendment will transfer the administration of claims from the \nDepartment of Energy to the Department of Labor, which will pay these \nclaims directly. This step will make it substantially easier for \nthousands of deserving workers, retirees, and surviving family members \nto obtain the compensation and medical care they are owed. The \namendment also expands eligibility to include workers exposed to \nresidual contamination. I commend Senator Clinton for her work on this \nspecific problem, which is critical to many workers in Western New \nYork.\n  The use of a State workers' compensation formula to calculate \nbenefits should not be taken as a model in other cases. This was a \nunique compromise we reached in order to achieve timely payment of \nthese claims, and is in no way an endorsement of a change in the \nbenefit levels or structure of other Federal workers' compensation \nprograms.\n  Clearly, we should be using a uniform Federal compensation formula to \ncompensate these workers, because they were performing work for the \nfederal government. A uniform formula is in keeping with the structure \nof other federal workers' compensation programs. It would also be far \neasier for the Department of Labor to administer, and I know the \nDepartment shares my views on this point.\n  In addition, other aspects of the compensation program deserve our \nconcern. Thousands of workers are seeking entrance into a Special \nExposure Cohort under another part of the program, and the rules for \nadmission have just been issued by the National Institute of \nOccupational Safety and Health. Also, the dose reconstruction estimates \nstill await processing for some workers in the building and \nconstruction trades. I urge the Institute to give high priority to this \ntask so that further legislation will not be necessary.\n  This amendment is a needed step to carry out the compensation \nprogram. I welcome this bipartisan compromise and I urge my colleagues \nto approve the amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is an honor to come to the floor \ntoday to speak in support of this amendment to the Department of \nDefense Authorization Act on behalf of nuclear workers. I am proud to \ncosponsor this amendment. Why am I am honored to speak on behalf of \nthis amendment? Simply put, because it is the right thing to do. The \nnuclear workers who will receive compensation under this amendment \nhelped America win the cold war. They worked in our nuclear research \nfacilities, our weapons facilities or, in the case of Alaskans, at the \nsite of the largest nuclear test our country ever conducted. It was \nthrough their hard work and courage that our Nation was able to triumph \nin the most significant challenge we faced during the second half of \nthe 20th century.\n  Will the compensation to be provided nuclear workers under this \namendment really repay our Nation's debt to them? Of course not. It \nwill not come close. Sylvia Carlsson is the widow of an Amchitka \nworker. Her husband was a mine shaft workers on the Project Cannikin at \nthe Amchitka, AK, nuclear test site in 1971. Project Cannikin was our \nNation's largest nuclear bomb test. He was exposed to ionizing \nradiation during the course of his employment. He died of colon cancer \nbefore his 41st birthday. Bev Aleck and Nancy Woodward-Tremper are two \nof a number of other Alaskan widows with similar stories. Other former \nAmchitka workers, such as Andrew Akula, are still living but are \nsuffering from life-threatening conditions. Ask any of these Alaskans \nwhether this compensation will make up for lives lot or a lifetime of \ndebilitating disease. It wouldn't. However, the compensation they have \nearned will at least show that a grateful Nation acknowledges their \ncontribution to our national security.\n  Let me briefly talk about what this amendment actually does. First, \nand perhaps most importantly, my colleagues should recognize that this \namendment does nothing more than cure deficiencies in Energy Employees \nOccupational Illnesses Compensation Program Act that Congress passed in \n2000. It is narrow, focused legislation. It certain is no brand new \nentitlement program.\n  The Energy Employees Act of 2000 established two programs for \ncompensating nuclear workers. The program under subtitle B of the act \nis administered by the Department of Labor. Numerous claims have been \nprocessed and many claimants found eligible have received compensation \nunder the Department of Labor program. Indeed, the Department of \nLabor's implementation of subtitle B has been universally recognized as \na success.\n  In sharp contrast to the Department of Labor's record, the processing \nof claims under subtitle D of the Act by the Department of Energy has \nbeen unacceptably slow. In 4 years, only 3 percent of claims have been \nprocessed by DOE. The great majority of claims remain unprocessed by \nDOE.\n  DOE's failure to successfully implement its portion of the Energy \nEmployees Act has been the subject of two recent Senate Energy \nCommittee hearings. The record of these hearings unequivocally reflects \nboth DOE's dismal claims processing record and its failure to develop \nany plan to provide funds to a significant percentage of nuclear \nworkers found eligible for compensation.\n  In addition to the Senate hearings, the GAO recently issued a report \non DOE's implementation of subtitle D of the Energy Employees Act. It \nfound numerous problems with both DOE's\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\nclaims processing efforts and confirmed the findings of the two Senate \nCommittee hearings concerning DOE's ability to assure that claimant's \nfound eligible would actually receive compensation.\n  I try to stay away from dry statistics when discussing issues that \nhave such a direct impact on so many Americans' lives and health. \nHowever, I think that in this instance one statistic starkly \nillustrates the need for this legislation. After 4 years and more than \n$90 million in administrative funding, DOE has provided compensation to \nonly 4--yes, 4--of more than 24,000 individuals that have applied for \nassistance under the subtitle D program.\n  There is nothing new or difficult about this legislation. There is \nnothing that requires lengthy reflection or consideration. This \namendment simply implements legislation Congress passed 4 years ago. \nUnfortunately, what Congress intended in the 2000 Energy Employees Act \nhas not occurred. This amendment addresses that failure.\n  I close my remarks as I began. Our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to \nthe nuclear workers. It is well past time that we provided Alaskans and \nother Americans the compensation they have earned in service to our \ncountry. The workers and their survivors deserve no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the Senator from Kentucky wish to modify his \namendment?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I will, following the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I ask my colleague to be able to wrap up this very \nimportant debate shortly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Shortly.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are anxious to move on, and there will not be a \nrequirement for a rollcall vote. I appreciate very much the cooperation \nbecause given the bipartisanship on this matter, it will be a timesaver \nas we move ahead on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nalso agreeing to modify his amendment with a provision of mine that \nwould shorten the period of time that Congress has to review an \nadministrative determination to add a class of nuclear weapons workers \nto a ``Special Exposure Cohort'' entitling them to automatic \ncompensation from 180 days to 60 days. I appreciate the willingness of \nthe Senator from Kentucky to accept that and to shorten that period of \ntime to 60 days which will speed the process of compensating workers.\n  Senator Bunning has worked very hard on this amendment. It takes some \nvery important steps toward addressing very serious defects in an \nexisting compensation program, and I hope that my colleagues will \nsupport the amendment today and hopefully we will not even need to have \na rollcall vote.\n  In my State of Iowa, between the years of 1947 and 1975, almost 4,000 \npeople were employed assembling, disassembling nuclear weapons. So \ngreat was the secrecy surrounding the facility, which was located \ninside an existing ammunition facility, that I did not even learn of \nits existence until late in 1997. I might add that when I was informed \nby certain workers that they had been exposed to dangerous radiation, I \nthen submitted this to the Department of Army.\n  The Department of Army denied that they had ever worked on nuclear \nweapons at this facility. Well, I thought that was the end of it. I \nthought surely the workers must have been mistaken. Then I found out \nthat it was the Army that was mistaken and, in fact, thousands of \nworkers had worked at this plant in Iowa. Five and a half years later \nwe are still trying to learn the full extent of the weapons activity \nand the radioactive materials to which Iowa workers were exposed.\n  During this same period, as the realization sank in that the cold war \nreally was over, it became clear that nuclear weapons workers all over \nthe country had been exposed to extremely dangerous radioactive \nmaterials without their knowledge and without adequate protection. As a \nresult, many of the workers developed cancer and related occupational \nillnesses. That is why in 2000, Congress acted to create a compensation \nsystem for former atomic weapons workers.\n  The compensation system that we created had two distinct parts. The \npart addressed by the Bunning amendment today applies to workers who \nshow that they have an illness that was more likely than not caused by \nthe work they performed in these nuclear weapons facilities, and that \nthey have been disabled by that illness.\n  Since the creation of the compensation program, this part has been \nadministered--or I should say, quite frankly, has been NOT \nadministered--by the Department of Energy. There are 23,000 workers who \nhave filed claims with the Department of Energy. As of April of this \nyear, exactly one person has received compensation.\n  When confronted with this appalling record, the Department of Energy \ncontinued to assert that it was making improvements and would have all \nthe claims through the first stage of the process in no less than 5 \nmore years! Of course, even if the Department had done a better job of \nprocessing the claims, not one single worker in Iowa would ever have \nbeen able to get paid. That is because the program was totally \ndependent on the existence of a current Department of Energy contractor \nwho would be available to pay the claims.\n  This is a catch-22 situation for Iowa workers because Iowa has not \nhad a DOE contractor since 1975. So as the program stands today, there \nis no way that any former Iowa atomic workers will be able to get \ncompensation for their illness.\n  So I welcome the Bunning amendment, which transfers this program \nknown as Title D from the Department of Energy to the Department of \nLabor and permits the Department of Labor to pay the claimants \ndirectly. This will mean that Iowa workers can actually receive \ncompensation and medical benefits under this program. The Bunning \namendment simply carries through on our original commitment in the 2000 \nbill that Congress believes that former nuclear weapons workers made \nill by their employment are entitled to compensation.\n  I do believe this amendment should be a little bit better, and I will \ntalk about an amendment that Senator Bond and I will be offering at \nsome other point later on. First, the amendment continues to require \nthat the amount of compensation under this program be determined based \non the State compensation formulas. That means if a worker in Iowa and \na worker in Kentucky or New Mexico had the exact same illness, they \ncould nonetheless be receiving very different compensation awards. That \nmakes no sense and creates a ridiculous burden on the Department of \nLabor in attempting to get these claims processed and paid.\n  In addition, the level of compensation paid under this program is in \nmy opinion inadequate. The amount that a former worker can receive is \ncalculated based on his or her wage at the time of the disability. In \nIowa, this means that the absolute best case scenario is that a worker \nwould receive eighty percent of a 1975 wage, a wage from almost 30 \nyears ago, with no adjustment for interest or inflation.\n  Under the absolute best case scenario, where a worker is determined \nto be 100-percent disabled by an injury, that worker would receive \nabout $105 a week, or about $5,000 a year. That is the best case \nscenario. Most will receive much less.\n  I think every atomic worker in America who can show they have been \ninjured ought to receive the same pay, whether they worked in Kentucky, \nOhio, New Mexico, Colorado, Iowa, Alaska, or Missouri. Basing this on \nworkers' comp wages in each State, again, skews it that way. I believe \nthe amount they are being paid is too low. To base it on a wage of 30 \nyears ago is totally inadequate.\n  But nonetheless, I believe this amendment is a major step forward for \nworkers in Iowa and across the country. I just wish we could find a \nmore simple and uniform and more generous method for awarding this \ncompensation.\n  In addition, this amendment essentially leaves untouched the other \nhalf of the energy workers compensation program. Basically, we are \ntalking about two titles: Title D, which the\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\nBunning amendment addresses, and then there is Title B. That provides a \nflat sum of $150,000 and medical benefits to workers with cancer and \nberyllium disease.\n  There are two ways for a worker to qualify for this compensation \nunder Title B. The first is to qualify for automatic compensation as a \nmember of a special exposure cohort. When we originally passed the \nbill, workers from Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Alaska were \ndesignated for this automatic compensation. My question is, Why not all \nthe other atomic workers around the country? Why were they left out? \nWhy should they not be included in part B? Why should those who worked \nin Iowa who were exposed not be included? So that is the special \nexposure cohort.\n  The second way to qualify for the title B, the cancer and beryllium \ntitle, and the only method available to the workers in Iowa at the Iowa \nArmy ammunition plant and at facilities in Missouri and at other \nfacilities across the country, is to go through a process where a \nworker's dose of radiation is reconstructed based on all the documents \nand information gathered from the site.\n  At the time the bill passed Congress in 2000, Congress recognized \nthere would be situations where it was simply not feasible to \nreconstruct workers' doses because relevant records of dose are lacking \nor do not exist, or because it might take so long to reconstruct a dose \nfor a group of workers that they will all be dead before we have an \nanswer to who is eligible.\n  That, unfortunately, is precisely the situation in which we find \nourselves in Iowa. The Iowa Army ammunition plant facility was in \noperation, as I said, from 1947 to 1975. The people who worked there \nwho are still alive are elderly, and they are ill. Many have died since \nwe first passed the bill. Bob Anderson, the gentleman who first wrote \nto me about the fact that they made nuclear weapons in Iowa at this \nfacility, will undergo surgery for thyroid cancer this week. That is in \naddition to the lymphoma from which he already suffers. Yet almost 4 \nyears into this program, only 38 Iowans have received compensation, and \nthat 38 does not include a single person who suffers from cancer--not \none.\n  These people cannot afford to wait any longer. That is why I will be \noffering an amendment with Senator Bond to allow workers from our \nfacility to receive automatic compensation as part of a special \nexposure cohort, the same as the workers in Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, \nand Alaska.\n  Why should Iowa workers be added to the category entitled to this \nautomatic compensation? Because what we have learned since 2000 is that \nIowa has the single worst record of any facility in the country \ninvolved in nuclear weapons production. After 3 years of hard work by \nresearchers at the University of Iowa and by the National Institute of \nOccupational Safety and Health, they have concluded there are no \nrecords anywhere that document the level of internal radiation exposure \nto which workers in Iowa were exposed--none, no records.\n\n  With regard to external doses, which are measured by having workers \nwear badges, between 1948 and 1958 not one single worker in Iowa wore a \ndose badge--not one. So how can you reconstruct it when, for 10 years, \nthey didn't even wear a dose badge? And, when they did begin wearing \nbadges, it was minimal. Between 1959 and 1965, somewhere between 8 and \n35 workers a year wore badges out of a workforce of 800 to 1,000 at \nthat facility. This is despite the fact that just this week, at a \nmeeting of former workers, they told my staff that based upon the way \nthe plant was set up, at least 156 workers a year were exposed to the \nhighest levels at the plant.\n  Listening to these workers, some of whom worked side by side while \none wore a badge and the other didn't, gives a sense of just how \ntotally lacking the facility was in terms of monitoring the radiation \nthat these workers received. Up until 1968, the highest percent of the \nDOE employees who were monitored was 7 percent, and I am told that \nthese were badges that workers wore on their collars while they were \nworking with nuclear material at waist level.\n  Just in the last couple of months, NIOSH, the National Institute of \nOccupational Safety and Health, has completed a ``site profile'' of the \nIowa Army Ammunition Plant that acknowledges these grossly inadequate \nrecords. But what is their approach now? They believe they can \nreconstruct this dose that Iowa workers got by looking at an entirely \ndifferent facility in Texas during an entirely different time period. \nThis is not fair and it is not right. It is time to admit that Iowa is \na site where it simply is not possible to perform dose reconstruction. \nThe Government simply doesn't know what went on at the facility and to \nwhat the workers were exposed. That makes it impossible to perform \ntimely dose reconstruction based on science.\n  For example, in a site profile, NIOSH assumed that the entire work of \nthe facility consisted of assembly work where the workers were \nprotected from the most virulent types of radiation because the \nneutrons were already shielded with a hard coating when they arrived at \nthe plant. But in a meeting with former workers, they spoke of how \nweapons were regularly disassembled. The protective outer coat was \nremoved, exposing them to high doses of neutron radiation.\n  I know the chairman is anxious to get on, but this is extremely \nimportant to hundreds of people in the State of Iowa who are sick today \nwith cancer, who are sick today with other diseases, who worked in \nthese plants, who never were told to what they were exposed. We have \nbeen fighting, I say to my friend from Virginia, we have been fighting \nfor years to get these poor people covered and they are dying every day \nand they are not being compensated.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have personally observed the Senator \nfrom Iowa and the Senator from Kentucky for years, and finally they \nhave brought it to fruition. We are ready momentarily to act and accept \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I know. I am supporting the amendment. What I am trying \nto say here on the Senate floor is that even with this amendment there \nare certain people in Iowa who, because of the way it is structured, \nwill not be adequately compensated. What I am saying to my friend from \nVirginia and others on the Senate floor is there is a special program \nthat exists in about four different States where if workers have cancer \nor beryllium illness, they are automatically compensated. In Iowa, \nbecause we have no records of dosages and these people have cancer from \nberyllium, they should have also been put into that special program. \nWhy should atomic workers from one State be put into that and atomic \nworkers from another State exposed to the same kind of radiation not \nbe?\n  That is the case I am making here. I support the amendment. It takes \nus a long way. It gets us out of the Department of Energy into the \nDepartment of Labor. But it does not address the part of the \ncompensation program that provides for people with cancer. I am saying \nNIOSH cannot do it, cannot reconstruct the radiation doses of people \nsuffering from devastating cancers. These people in Iowa I believe are \nbeing discriminated against. They cannot reconstruct valid doses.\n  This is exactly the type of situation Congress foresaw when we passed \nthis legislation in 2000. Former weapons complex workers in Iowa are \nold, they are sick, and they are dying. I mentioned one who just had a \nlymphoma operation, and he is now undergoing a thyroid operation this \nweek. He was exposed year after year to deadly radiation.\n  I will close by saying that at a meeting of workers in Burlington, \nIA, earlier this week we heard from a number of workers--one who worked \nwith weapons for 3 years in the 1960s. Two of her children were born \nwith very serious birth defects which the doctors themselves attributed \nto radiation exposure. She herself has now developed cancer. We heard \nfrom workers who talked about the hair on their legs and arms standing \non end when they were near the weapons even though the weapons were \ncool to the touch. We heard from children whose parents had died when \nthey were young because of lung cancer, kidney cancer, and other \ncancers, and who worked for years in this facility.\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\n  What these people are seeking is not just about money; it is about an \nacknowledgment that they were put in harm's way without their \nknowledge. They are seeking an acknowledgment that they made a \nsacrifice on behalf of the good of this country and for the protection \nof this country. To require these workers to continue to wait for that \njustice is not fair and it is not right.\n  I thank Senator Bunning and Senator Bingaman for their hard work on \nthis amendment. This amendment, as I say, fixes one-half of the \ncompensation system. This is a major step forward. I also say to my \ncolleagues that we are not doing justice for all these workers.\n  Senator Bond and I will be offering an additional amendment as we \nproceed on this bill.\n  There is no reason we should not add the workers from these two \nfacilities to the special exposure cohort. When we originally passed \nthis bill, we created a fund with mandatory spending in the Department \nof Labor. The Congressional Budget Office analysis devotes almost $700 \nmillion for payment of compensation to workers included in the special \nexposure cohorts--the cancer cohorts. Today, even though the vast \nmajority of claims by workers in those four States who are eligible for \nthis cohort have been paid, just over $400 million has been spent. But \nthe Congressional Budget Office devoted $700 million. The money is \nthere. The money has already been accounted for. We just ask that these \nworkers be acknowledged for the sacrifices they made for their country \nand that they be included in the special cohorts.\n  I again thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 3438\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be modified by the language currently at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       At the end insert:\n\n\nREVIEW BY CONGRESS OF INDIVIDUALS DESIGNATED BY PRESIDENT AS MEMBERS OF \n                                 COHORT\n\n       Section 3621(14)(C)(ii) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 10 \n     7384l(14)(C)(ii) is amended by striking ``180 days'' and \n     inserting ``60 days''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before this amendment is agreed to, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Washington be allowed to speak \nfor up to 3 minutes on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise as a sponsor of the Bunning \namendment, and I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his hard work--\nboth on the Energy Committee and here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Obviously, we are taking a giant step forward in moving major \nresponsibility for the Energy Employee Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program at the Department of Labor.\n  There are thousands of people in Washington State who have been \nimpacted by exposure while working at the Hanford Reservation. The \nissue is that in 2000, with passage of the original act, as my \ncolleague from Iowa stated, we set up specific exposure cohorts that \nallowed workers in particular regions of the country to get \ncompensation based on their exposure to beryllium. But where we are \ntoday is there are still thousands of workers who have not had their \nclaims processed.\n  One of the reasons why claims haven't been processed is specific \ninformation doesn't exist or was not kept by the various employers at \nthese reservation sites across the country to show what exposed \nemployees endured. The issue then becomes that they have been left to \nfight their own battles--to fight to get compensation, to fight to \nprove they actually had exposure, and to fight to pay their medical \nbills.\n  With thousands of people in Washington State affected by this, I have \nbeen a big supporter of those responsibilities over at the Department \nof Labor. Besides that, this great ombudsman program is where \nindividual employees can go to ask for help and support in moving their \ncases.\n  It also helps in establishing a willing payer. Some of the companies \nthat have been involved in the cleanup process throughout the U.S. no \nlonger exist. We have had employees who wanted to get compensation, and \nhave proven their cases, only to find that no employer existed. This \nhelps in establishing a willing partner and payer.\n  But the most specific and positive aspect of this legislation is the \nstep forward in saying, let us do site profiles. Site profiles are \nspecifically the responsibility of the Department of Labor to go to a \nplace such as the Hanford nuclear reservation and say, even though some \nof the employers may not have kept day-to-day logs and details about \nevery specific employee and how they were exposed--and my colleagues \nhave articulated on the Senate floor already how so many people in \ntheir States did not have records kept and went to get records by the \nDepartment of Energy only to find they didn't exist for the individual \nemployee. When the Department of Labor does a site profile, it will \nhelp us when we come back and say that a large class of people at the \nHanford Reservation and possibly these other sites around the country \nnow qualify for compensation. This will help expedite that.\n  The amendment that was modified by the Senator from Kentucky, which \nthe Senator from Iowa worked on, is a very helpful amendment because it \nactually helps speed up that process of those site profiles.\n  I don't think it is lost on my colleagues that many of these people \nare dying. Many of these people, by the time this program under the DOE \nwas going to be finished, were never going to get the help they \ndeserved.\n  This amendment takes a very positive step forward in getting site \nprofiles done, getting the information needed to prove that these \npeople have been impacted, that they have had illness due to exposure \non the job, and that they will not get some help.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The question is on agreeing to the \namendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3438) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will address the Senate with regard to a unanimous \nconsent which has been crafted carefully on both sides of the aisle.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Graham now be recognized to call \nup his amendment No. 3428, and that it be further modified with the \nchanges at the desk. I further ask consent that there be 15 minutes for \ndebate equally divided on the amendment, and that following that time \nthe amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  If further ask that following disposition of the Graham amendment, \nLeahy amendment No. 3292 be the pending question, and that I be \nrecognized to send up a second-degree amendment, No. 3452.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3428, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I send my modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself \n     and Mr. Crapo, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Alexander, proposes an \n     amendment 3428, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 384, line 15, strike ``by rule in consultation'' \n     and all that follows through page 385, line 21, and insert \n     ``by rule approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;\n       (2) has had highly radioactive radionuclides removed to the \n     maximum extent practical in accordance with the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission-approved criteria; and\n       (3) in the case of material derived from the storage tanks, \n     is disposed of in a facility (including a tank) within the \n     State pursuant to a State-approved closure plan or a State-\n     issued permit, authority for the approval or issuance of \n     which is conferred on the State outside of this Act.\n       (b) Inapplicability to Certain Materials.--Subsection (a) \n     shall not apply to any material otherwise covered by that \n     subsection that is transported from the State.\n       (c) Scope of Authority To Carry Out Actions.--The \n     Department of Energy may implement any action authorized--\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\n       (1) by a State-approved closure plan or State-issued permit \n     in existence on the date of enactment of this section; or\n       (2) by a closure plan approved by the State or a permit \n     issued by the State during the pendency of the rulemaking \n     provided for in subsection (a).\n\n     Any such action may be completed pursuant to the terms of the \n     closure plan or the State-issued permit notwithstanding the \n     final criteria adopted by the rulemaking pursuant to \n     subsection (a).\n       (d) State Defined.--In this section, the term ``State'' \n     means the State of South Carolina.\n       (e) Construction.--(1) Nothing in this section shall \n     affect, alter, or modify the full implementation of--\n       (A) the settlement agreement entered into by the United \n     States with the State of Idaho in the actions captioned \n     Public Service Co. of Colorado v.

The Graham amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. We have 7\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I would like to speak \nfor 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, many thanks to a lot of \npeople for resolving an issue important to South Carolina. This \namendment is a work product of Senators Crapo, Craig, myself, and \nothers. Senator Crapo has been terrific to work with, along with \nSenator Craig.\n  We have now put into place an amendment that well defines what we \nwere trying to do. I am trying to clean up 51 tanks of 37 million \ngallons of high-level nuclear waste in South Carolina, 23 years ahead \nof schedule, saving $16 billion. My intent has been to do just that and \nno more.\n  The Crapo-Craig-Alexander amendment clearly says the agreement \nbetween DOE and South Carolina is South Carolina specific. Senator \nAlexander's language says the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will always \nretain the power to determine what high-level versus low-level waste \nis. The $350 million in question will flow to Idaho and Washington \nregardless of an agreement or the lack thereof. The Crapo-Graham \namendment has been worked with Senator Cantwell, and it does not \nprevent the disposition plan that has been agreed to in South Carolina.\n  I thank all Members. There will come a day when Idaho and Washington \nwill need like help, and I will be there. I want the people in South \nCarolina to know without the help of Washington and Idaho, this would \nnot have happened. There will be a day when they need our assistance, \nand I will be there. This is a win-win. There is nothing in this \namendment that will prevent section 3116 from moving forward.\n  I yield back any time I have.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to the Senators \nfrom Idaho, and the Senator from South Carolina for working with me on \nthis amendment. I voted against the Cantwell motion to strike because \nSenator Graham agreed to work with me in making some modifications to \nthe underlying bill.\n  I am not opposed to reclassification of radioactive waste. What I \nbelieve is that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must have a central \nrole in this process.\n  The bill as it stands now grants the Department of Energy the right \nto reclassify nuclear waste from high-level to low-level waste. Under \ncurrent law, only the NRC has authority to define high-level and low-\nlevel radioactive waste. Congress gave the NRC that authority in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The NRC's authority should be \nmaintained. We should keep that authority in the hands of one \nregulatory agency.\n  This perfecting amendment ensures that the NRC has the final say in \nany re-classification criteria. One amendment would modify Section 3116 \nof the bill to require the NRC to approve the criteria that the DOE \nuses to determine whether waste incidental to reprocessing is high-\nlevel or low-level radioactive waste. This would maintain the NRC's \nauthority over defining radioactive waste.\n  I hope my colleagues will support quick adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this amendment. I \nappreciate the hard work of all those involved as we have negotiated \nthese very important issues to the Nation, particularly to the States \nof South Carolina, Idaho, and Washington.\n  When we put together the South Carolina language last week and \ndebated it in the Senate, there was a question raised whether that \nwould cause any impact with regard to agreements that had been reached \nor to negotiations that were underway between the State of Idaho and \nthe Department of Energy and Washington and the Department of Energy.\n  This amendment makes it very clear that there is no precedent value \nof the South Carolina language that would impact or in any way alter or \namend the agreements of the State of Idaho and the State of Washington \nthat they have with the Department of Energy, or create any precedent \nfor any negotiations now underway between those two States.\n  The language says that nothing in the section shall alter, affect, or \nmodify the full implementation, and it lists the various agreements for \nIdaho, most important of which is the Batt agreement.\n  Then it says:\n\n       (2) Nothing in this section establishes any precedent or is \n     binding on the State of Idaho, the State of Washington, the \n     State of Oregon, or any other State for the management, \n     storage, treatment, and disposition of radioactive and \n     hazardous materials.\n\n  It is very clear by statutory language now--if it was not already \nclear before, which we believe it was--that the South Carolina \nagreement stands by itself. The States of Idaho, Washington, and all \nother States will be free to negotiate their own arrangements and \nrelationships with the Department of Energy.\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Craig, Senator Alexander, and Senator Graham \nfor working so closely with me. Senator Cantwell from Washington has \nworked closely with us on this issue. I appreciate everyone coming \ntogether with a strong resolution to resolve these critical issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Defense \nAuthorization Committee for his cooperation and the ranking member for \nallowing Idaho and Washington and South Carolina to resolve what was \nand has been, at some points along the way, a contentious issue. But \nforemost, I thank my colleague from Idaho, Mike Crapo, for the \ndiligence that he has put into making sure that Idaho remains whole in \nits agreement, that Washington remains whole in its agreement, and that \nSouth Carolina be allowed to gain an agreement with the Department of \nEnergy, and, if you will, to wipe away the fog that had been created by \na court decision that did not, in the opinion of the Department of \nEnergy and the OMB, allow them a clear path forward to continue to \nspend money for the purposes of cleanup.\n  We think this language allows that clear path forward while allowing \nthe State of South Carolina to arrive at an agreement different from \nthat which the State of Idaho or the State of Washington has.\n  I agree, the language is not precedent-setting. Idaho is still very \nwhole in the relationship it has currently with the Department of \nEnergy. My goal, and the goal of the other Senator from Idaho, Mike \nCrapo, has always been to assure that cleanup goes forward without a \nhitch, and this language will allow that to happen, for the $90-plus \nmillion that was dedicated to cleanup in Idaho for this coming year to \nbe allowed to be applied for that purpose. We think that is critically \nimportant as we move down this path.\n  We have worked closely with the State of Idaho. We think this does \nmeet the concern of the State of Idaho. They have vetted this language \nand understand it clearly. We hope we have now resolved any question \nanyone might have as to Idaho's role and primacy as it relates to its \nrelationship with the Department of Energy for the purposes of cleanup.\n  I say to the chairman, thank you for your willingness to be flexible \nas we have worked out these difficulties.\n  I appreciate the positions and concerns of the Senator from \nWashington. We hope this language keeps Washington as whole as we \nbelieve it does and as we believe it keeps Idaho, while allowing the \nState of South Carolina to proceed down a path that could be somewhat \ndifferent from that which we might choose.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wish to express my gratitude to the \nSenator from Idaho and the Senator from South Carolina for working with \nme on this amendment and allowing me to be a cosponsor. I voted against \nthe Cantwell motion to strike because Senator Graham agreed to work \nwith me in making some modifications to the underlying bill.\n  I am not opposed to reclassification of radioactive waste. What I \nbelieve is that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must have a central \nrole in this process.\n  The bill, as it stands now, grants the Department of Energy the right \nto reclassify nuclear waste from high-level to low-level waste. Under \ncurrent law, only the NRC has authority to define high-level and low-\nlevel radioactive waste. Congress gave the NRC that authority in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. I think the NRC's authority should be \nmaintained. We should keep that authority in the hands of one \nregulatory agency.\n  This perfecting amendment ensures that the NRC has the final say in \nany reclassification criteria. Our amendment would modify Section 3116 \nof the bill to require the NRC to approve the criteria that the DOE \nuses to determine whether waste incidental to reprocessing is high-\nlevel or low-level radioactive waste. This would maintain the NRC's \nauthority over defining radioactive waste.\n  I hope my colleagues will support quick adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, are we ready to vote on this matter?\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining for \ndebate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3428) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I had wished to speak on the previous \namendment. I thought that was part of the agreement, but I will be more \nspecific now, since the amendment has just been adopted by voice vote; \nand that is to say, the amendment allows us to do a study, it allows \nthe Department of Energy to receive information from the National \nAcademy of Sciences in the future about the ground water conditions and \nenvironmental conditions from any kind of proposal or plan on which the \nDepartment of Energy would like to move forward.\n  I think my colleague from South Carolina said it best when he said \nour colleagues in the Senate have probably learned more in the last few \nweeks about nuclear waste and our responsibilities as the Federal \nGovernment than they have at any previous time.\n  But I guess I disagree with my colleagues. This debate is far from \nover. I do not agree with the underlying bill or where it is going in \nchanging the definition of nuclear waste. No State in America should be \nallowed, on the Environmental Protection Act, on the Clean Water Act, \non any legislation, to cut a deal behind closed doors with the Federal \nGovernment and think they are going to stick the American consumer with \nwaste in their backyard.\n  While this particular amendment that we just voice-voted will allow \nus to say that we want this to look no further than what South Carolina \nis proposing, and that we want DOE to do its job in providing an \nenvironmental study and analysis of this issue, this issue is far from \nover for the American people.\n  This issue not only impacts my State, and the States of Oregon and \nIdaho, it affects every Western State. The reason it affects every \nWestern State is because the Department of Energy has been trying to \nreclassify waste all over the West, push it into New Mexico, cut it \nacross Arizona, and demand that waste from South Carolina be accepted \nin Washington State. We just had to file suit recently because high-\nlevel waste from South Carolina was illegally sent to Washington State.\n  So while I support my colleagues' efforts today to clarify that, more \nstudy and analysis should be made. This debate is far from over, and \nthis body needs to understand that it is reclassifying the definition \nof high-level waste to a lower level, which will make all Americans \nless secure, and certainly the drinking water in South Carolina and in \nWashington State, if this is not resolved, less secure for people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, very briefly, the \namendment has been adopted, and I would like to make a comment or two \nfor those who may still be listening.\n  The membership has been challenged for 3 weeks now to find a way to \ndeal with the problem. Here is the simple problem: For over a year, \nSouth Carolina, Washington, and Idaho have been trying to negotiate \nwith DOE a way to clean up tank farms that have a lot of high-level \nwaste.\n  In my State, there are 37 million gallons of high-level liquid waste \nin tanks that are over 50 years old. There are only 51 of them. For \nabout a year now we have been negotiating with DOE to define what is \n``clean'' and how we can best close up those tanks. We have been able \nto take the liquid out of two of the tanks and come up with a plan that \nhas been approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that says that \nthe inch and a half of waste left in those two tanks is no longer high-\nlevel waste because of scientific treatment.\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\n  We want to apply that same concept to the other tanks. What I am \ntrying to do in South Carolina is good for South Carolina's \nenvironment. It has been approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nas being safe. It has been approved by the Defense Waste Policy Board \nas being safe. It does not prejudice Idaho or Washington that have \nsimilar problems.\n  I do appreciate the fact that the body has allowed this agreement to \ngo forward. South Carolina will save $16 billion, and it will allow the \ntanks to be closed up 23 years ahead of schedule.\n  I am willing to work with any Senator from any State who has similar \nproblems. I am not willing to sit on the sidelines and disallow my \nState to move forward in an environmentally and economically sound \nfashion to address a real problem South Carolinians face. We have done \nnothing to prejudice anybody else. We have not changed any standards, \ngiven any authority to DOE at the expense of the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission.\n  A lot of demagoguery is going on here, but it is time to clean up \nthese sites and stop demagoguing. I hope one day Washington can find an \nagreement to clean up the tanks and alleviate their ground water \nproblems. If they need help from Congress, I will be there. But I urge \nIdaho and Washington and other States to try to work to get these \nmatters behind us.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his hard work.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3452 To Amendment No. 3292\n\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senate is ready to turn its attention to \nthe amendment from the distinguished Senator from Vermont. Am I correct \nin that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The clerk will report the second-degree amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3452 to amendment No. 3292.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To extend jurisdiction and scope for current fraud offenses)\n\n       On page 1, strike line 2 and all that follows through page \n     4, line 11, and insert the following:\n       (a) Statements or Entries Generally.--Section 1001 of title \n     18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Jurisdiction.--There is extra-territorial Federal \n     jurisdiction over an offense under this section.\n       ``(e) Prosecution.--A prosecution for an offense under this \n     section may be brought--\n       ``(1) in accordance with chapter 211 of this title; or\n       ``(2) in any district where any act in furtherance of the \n     offense took place.''.\n       (b) Major Fraud Against the United States.--Section 1031 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(i) Jurisdiction.--There is extra-territorial Federal \n     jurisdiction over an offense under this section.\n       ``(j) Prosecution.--A prosecution for an offense under this \n     section may be brought--\n       ``(1) in accordance with chapter 211 of this title;\n       ``(2) in any district where any act in furtherance of the \n     offense took place; or\n       ``(3) in any district where any party to the contract or \n     provider of goods or services is located.''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is that the second-degree \namendment from the Senator from Virginia is now before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I understand it, there is no time \nagreement on the second-degree amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Nor do I think there will be. I realize the second-degree \namendment is designed--whether intentionally or otherwise--to protect a \nnumber of the major corporations now working in Iraq, some of which \nhave been involved with overcharging our military and profiting on the \nwar. It is unfortunate that we would try to protect those who are \ngouging the American taxpayers.\n  After World War II and after the Korean War, we put in a war \nprofiteering amendment similar to what I offered, and I would say to my \ndistinguished friend from Virginia, we passed a similar war \nprofiteering amendment on the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill \nlast year. But when it came up in conference with the other body, even \nthough they are independent Members of the House, several of them were \nvery candid and told me they had been directed by the White House to \nremove it and had heavy pressure brought by Halliburton and others. So \nthey had to remove the war profiteering amendment.\n  I actually thought we were elected not by corporations, whether it is \nHalliburton or anybody else, and not appointed by the White House, but, \nrather, are here to do the American people's business.\n  Now, be that as it may, I would hope that at some point we would get \nto the underlying amendment, and it would actually be the law today \nexcept that the White House and Halliburton and others told the \nRepublican majority, the leadership in the other body, that they had to \ntake it out, which they did.\n  I commend the majority of Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, \nwho supported it originally and have been willing to resist the \npressure of the White House.\n  Over the last few weeks, the news has been dominated by events in \nIraq. We are still trying to figure out exactly what went wrong in Abu \nGhraib prison as well as other detention centers around the world. \nThere has been some disagreement on this issue, but I think we have \nalready learned a couple of lessons.\n  We need to improve transparency. We need to improve accountability. \nWe need to put in place strong measures to prevent illegal and immoral \nacts. The reason for doing this is simple. Bad behavior by a few can \nlower morale among American soldiers. It can undermine support at home \nfor the mission, and it could damage the work of the vast majority of \nbrave men and women who are trying to do the right thing, trying to \nmake life better, and are putting themselves in harm's way every day. \nBy all means, we ought to take action in this body to make sure that no \ncorporation or group can come in and make obscene profits or engage in \nwar profiteering while our American men and women are putting their \nlives on the line for their country. We should not have anybody come in \nand say: Here is a great way to make some huge profit off their \nsuffering and off the suffering of the Iraqi people.\n  So my amendment does not have anything to do with the recent prison \nabuses in Iraq, but it does address the serious issues I mentioned. It \naddresses the serious and sinister problem of war profiteering that can \nharm our mission there and around the world.\n\n  Senator Harry Truman served with distinction in this body and \nconducted Senate committee investigations into war profiteering during \nWorld War II. Then-Senator Truman, later President, said on this issue:\n\n       No one objects to a fair profit . . . [I]t is our duty . . \n     . to protect the patriotic majority of war contractors \n     against a stigma of profiteering generated by the self \n     seeking minority. We intend to see that no man or corporate \n     group of men shall profit inordinately on the blood of the \n     boys in the fox holes.\n\n  Today we have both men and women on the frontlines. And we have a lot \nof companies over there who are putting their own people in harm's way. \nThey are doing it with the best interests of our country and the best \ninterests of the Iraqi people. They are doing it very bravely. They are \nnot doing it to profit from the war. As Harry Truman said: We have to \ntake care; we have ``to protect the patriotic majority of war \ncontractors against the stigma of profiteering generated by the self \nseeking minority.''\n  All my amendment says is that while most of the people over there \nwill be playing by the rules, for those who are not, we are going to \nhold you accountable.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know nothing focuses the minds of those who \nare committing crimes more than knowing somebody can put them in prison \nfor a long time. I will give you an easy example. If you have five \nwarehouses lined up and four of them have heavy locks on the doors and \none doesn't, that is the one that usually gets burgled. In this case, \nmost people are going to be very honest. But without the locks on the \ndoors, there are going to be some who try to get away with ripping off \nthe American taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S6851]]\n\n  I would hope that everybody in this body, Republican and Democrat, \nwould agree with what President Truman said. I am concerned because we \nhave seen one bad headline after another--the Wall Street Journal, the \nWashington Post, the New York Times, and others--about Government \ncontracts in Iraq.\n  In addition, Time magazine recently reported on an e-mail sent by a \nPentagon official that raises serious questions involving Vice \nPresident Cheney's office, the White House, and the Vice President's \nformer employer, Halliburton. This is what the e-mail says: A \nmultibillion-dollar Halliburton contract was approved ``contingent on \ninforming White House tomorrow. We anticipate no issue since action has \nbeen coordinated with Vice President's office.''\n  And right on schedule, 3 days later, the Army Corps of Engineers gave \nHalliburton a multibillion-dollar contract, and they did it without \nseeking any other bids. This does not look like a typical heads-up \nmemo, as the Vice President's office is now claiming. To this former \nprosecutor from Vermont, it looks like a coordinated scheme to enrich \nHalliburton at taxpayer expense with no-bid contracts.\n  This latest revelation underscores the need to address this issue. \nEven if there is a reasonable explanation for this outrageous e-mail--\nand I am still waiting to hear what it is--we have to put in place \ntough measures to address this issue. I think we have to send a clear \nmessage that lining one's pockets, especially while our troops are in \nharm's way, is simply unacceptable.\n\n  I hope my amendment, if we are allowed to vote on it, will put a stop \nto these scandals. This amendment should pass unanimously. I am sorry \nthat the Republican leadership has decided to put what I could only \ncall ``a hold Halliburton harmless'' second-degree amendment in here. I \nhope that those majority of Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, \nwho voted for this amendment last year will vote against the second-\ndegree amendment and vote for this amendment. Vote against the ``hold \nHalliburton harmless'' amendment and vote for the war profiteering \nprevention amendment.\n  The war profiteering prevention amendment, if it becomes part of law, \nwill send a very clear signal. I don't care what the corporation is, \nwhether the corporation is from Vermont or anywhere else, it will send \na very clear signal: Play by the rules. But if you don't play by the \nrules, just as Harry Truman said after World War II, we are going to \nhold you accountable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, at the request of the \ndistinguished chairman, that we be allowed to go into a quorum call \nuntil the hour of 2 p.m.; that then, by consent, the call of the quorum \nbe rescinded and the Senator from Vermont be recognized again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent request, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the concern of the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia in trying to find a way \nthrough this.\n  I want to make it very clear about what we have. The war profiteering \nbills President Truman spoke of after World War II were civil bills. \nThis is a criminal statute. Actually, the criminal statute is more \nprotective of the contractors because it requires a higher level of \nproof. As a former prosecutor, I much prefer the idea that someone \nthinks they are not just going to pay a fine, they might face prison.\n  Second, this passed in almost exactly this form in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. It was debated and passed as a separate measure in \nthe committee. The amendment then became part of the Supplemental which \npassed the Senate by a wide margin. The amendment we are considering \ntoday is different only in two respects. This one applies to all \ncountries; at that time, it applied only to Iraq. Second, the amendment \nthe Senate passed earlier contained a sunset. The amendment here today \ndoes not.\n  When we went to conference, the House did not have a similar piece of \nlegislation. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens, proposed they accept ours. They had a \nrollcall vote and, by party line, refused it. Senator Stevens had \nmodified it with, I believe, a 7-year sunset. That was not accepted.\n  Several Republicans were very forthright in saying they were under \npressure from the White House not to accept it. Some suggested they \nwere under pressure from corporations that were major contributors. I \nsuggested if there is a bad case of war profiteering, they may come \nback to regret it.\n  Senator Stevens very correctly wanted to make it clear that all \nRepublicans and all Democrats on the Appropriations Committee, in the \ncommittee of conference, had supported this. It had been part of a bill \nwe passed overwhelmingly, if not unanimously, in this body early. \nBecause the House would not accept it, it was dropped.\n  Obviously, every Senator has to vote the way he or she wants, but as \nwar profiteering goes on, it is something each Senator has to answer to \nhis or her constituents.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator said this, but I believe it should be \nrepeated. Is this not the same issue we have voted on before? Did the \nSenator from Vermont offer earlier an amendment which would have \ncreated criminal penalties for those companies which are illegally \nprofiting from the war in Iraq? Did the Senator offer a similar \namendment last year?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might retain my right to the floor, \nthe senior Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct; I did. I \noffered it. We had a debate within the Appropriations Committee to \naccept it within the Appropriations Committee and it became part of the \nbill.\n  My earlier statement may have left confusion, and I apologize. There \nwas no intention of doing that. It was part of the appropriations bill \nand thus not voted on by the Senate although there was not a single \namendment to strike that provision. There were various amendments, as \nthe Senator may recall, that were proposed during the appropriations \nbill on the Senate floor, but no one moved to strike this. It passed \n93-0. About the only difference in that bill, as I recall, was the \namendment spoke only to Iraq. This includes other countries besides \nIraq.\n  Yes, we voted on it, we passed it, and then the Senate offered it as \ntheir position. Both Republicans and Democrats offered it as our \nposition to the other body, which rejected it on a party-line vote at \nthe request of the White House.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask, through the Presiding Officer, if the Senator from \nVermont would further yield for a question, if I am not mistaken, the \nSenator from Vermont came to Members initially and said creation of a \ncriminal penalty for companies that profiteer illegally from the war in \nIraq is modeled after a similar law proposed and enacted during the \ntime of Harry Truman when he was looking at the very same question \nrelative to World War II.\n  I recall during the course of that debate--and I will ask the Senator \nif my recollection is correct--that the Senator said, when we were \nasked to vote for this amendment, we were really trying to establish \nthe same type of standard we used in every war when some individuals \nand some companies exploited the situation in a war to make an illegal \nprofit. We do not want that to occur. It is not the fair to the \ntaxpayers, it is not fair to the soldiers, it is not fair to America, \nand they should be held criminally accountable.\n  I ask the Senator from Vermont, if this amendment passed so \noverwhelmingly before, why is there any hesitation today to take this \nHarry Truman precedent and say those who misuse a war, where American \nlives are at stake, and profiteer should be held criminally liable for \ntheir misconduct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might, the Harry Truman proposal, \ncourse, was civil. This is a criminal law.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is very important. Harry Truman was civil.\n\n[[Page S6852]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator would let me finish.\n  The Harry Truman amendment was civil. This is criminal. Thus, this is \nmore protective of a defendant because, as the distinguished Senators \nknow, and certainly those who have been prosecutors know all too well, \nin a criminal case you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. A civil \ncase can often be the preponderance of the evidence. This is more \nprotective of both sides. But it holds the hammer of a criminal \nproposal. This has tough criminal penalties for individuals who defraud \nthe American taxpayer. It provides a maximum criminal penalty of 20 \nyears in prison and fines of up to $1 million.\n  The reason we did criminal rather than civil, there was a time when \nif you proposed a $10 million fine back at the time of Harry Truman, \nthat was a lot of money. We have had at least one company that has \nalready had to pay back money on overcharging and profiteering. They \nspend more than that $10 million on a weekend running ads saying how \ngood they are at feeding the troops. But if you are facing a criminal \npenalty and might go to the slammer, then you think about it.\n  I will state why this is necessary. For example, if we wanted to use \ncurrent law, which is basically what the second-degree amendment is, \ncurrent law does not specifically outlaw war profiteering. My \namendment, which the Senator from Illinois has spoken about, does \nspecifically outlaw war profiteering. We wanted to go as a second-\ndegree amendment. Current statute does not say that U.S. courts have \nexplicit and uncategorical jurisdiction over fraud and profiteering in \nIraq. My amendment does. If we tried to just take current law, where \nare we? My amendment eliminates unnecessary thresholds, for example, to \nprove mail and wire fraud, and the current statutes do not. And, of \ncourse, a 20-year felony.\n  There really are no laws on the books that address war profiteering. \nThere are laws on the books for murder, laws on the books for rape, \nlaws on the books for armed robbery, but there is nothing that goes \nspecifically into war profiteering. Frankly, what I want to do is not \njust to throw people in the slammer; I want to stop them from doing it \nin the first place.\n  This is a real deterrent. If you have a prosecution that says you can \ngo to jail, not just pay a fine, which is small change for some of \nthese companies, but you might actually go to jail, somebody is going \nto say: Wait a minute. We can't triple charge for this. We can't triple \ncharge for these hotels. We can't triple charge for these cars--and so \non.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Vermont will further yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nVermont about three specific reports that have come out in the news \nrecently about Halliburton and about their practices with sole-source \ncontracts in Iraq, where they literally are not competing with any \nother company for these contracts, and they are cost-plus contracts.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont if the amendment which \nhe is proposing might apply with a criminal penalty in these cases. It \nwas reported last week that Halliburton and its subsidiaries were \nliterally driving empty trucks back and forth on the highway, billing \nthe Federal Government for each trip, when in fact they were not even \ntransporting any supplies or equipment for our troops.\n  It was reported this morning that this same Halliburton operation, if \nthey had a flat tire on a truck, they would abandon the $85,000 truck \nby the side of the road or torch the truck rather than try to get it \nrepaired because each and every truck was just another cost-plus item \non a Federal contract.\n  And then it was further disclosed they were incorrectly billing the \nFederal Government, charging for 240,000 cases of soda pop--if you can \nimagine--but they were delivering 240,000 cans of soda pop. So it was a \ndramatic overstatement of what they were supposed to be providing for \nthe troops.\n  I ask the Senator from Vermont, when you consider the fact that we \nhave 138,000 of our finest men and women risking their lives literally \nin Iraq, how can we possibly turn our backs on this type of outrageous \nprofiteering that has been alleged? Why would it not be a crime? And \nwhy would this Senate even hesitate from establishing a criminal \npenalty when we have a situation that is costing the taxpayers over $1 \nbillion a week to sustain our war effort in Iraq?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois raises the exact \nright point. You read these accounts in the press. I referred to the e-\nmail traffic which has just come out about a multibillion-dollar \nnoncompetitive contract given to Halliburton after they had sent e-\nmails saying it was being cleared by the Vice President's office or it \nwas OK with the Vice President's office, and there are the things you \nhave talked about, the obvious things about war profiteering.\n  Now, had the other body left the amendment in, the amendment that was \npart of the appropriations bill that we passed overwhelmingly--I think \n87 to 12 here in the Senate--had they left that in the final bill, had \nthey stood up to the White House and not allowed them to convince them \nto strip it out, then the kinds of actions the Senator from Illinois is \ntalking about would be prosecutable.\n  I would suggest they probably never would have happened. The \ntaxpayers would have saved those millions upon millions of dollars \nbecause somebody would have told them back at corporate headquarters: \nHey, guys, you can go to jail if you do this. It is not just the case \nthat if you get caught, you might have to pay the money back, but you \ncan go to jail if you do this. And that would stop it.\n\n  Now, if we pass this today, it still has to be signed into law, and \nit would be prospective. Unfortunately, because the other body \nbasically gave in to the importunings of the White House and took out \nthe amendment, the war profiteering amendment which had been part of \nthe bill that every one of us on this floor voted for, we cannot do \nanything about that. Had that been put into law, as it should have \nbeen, I suspect the activities that the Senator from Illinois has \ntalked about would not have occurred because whoever is on the ground \nis going to call back and say: Hey, guys, it might sound good to you \nback home there, but I am not going to go to jail. I am not going to go \nto jail just to raise a little more money. I am not going to go to jail \njust because you say if you get caught you may have to pay it back, and \nit wouldn't happen.\n  What I am saying is this: When companies, especially some companies \nthat have been accused of this, will spend more money in a few days \nhere in Washington running ads to convince 535 Members of Congress how \nwonderful they are than they could possibly pay in fines, they do not \ncare. You could leave whatever laws are on the books now. You could \nleave the possibility of paying it back. Because what happens? If you \nare a company and you go ahead and profiteer, you do war profiteering, \nyou overcharge, you do whatever these other things are, and you do it \n10 times, and you get caught 3 times, and they say: You are going to \npay back those millions you overcharged--you say: Gosh, almighty, you \ngot me. Gee, I'm sorry. Gee whiz. Here it is. And you tell your \nbookkeepers: They didn't find the other 7. We are ahead of the game.\n  On the other hand, if you do it 10 times, and you get caught on 3 of \nthem, and suddenly people start going to jail, these other companies \nare going to say: Wait a minute, no-bid contracts or not, I am not \ngoing to take the chance.\n  If we want to stand up for the American taxpayers, if we want to say \nwe are tough on crime, let's say criminals go to jail. That is all \nthere is. Let's try this law. Let's see. Maybe if this is on the books \npeople will stop profiteering.\n  What drives me up the wall is we have 140,000 very brave men and \nwomen--American men and women--over there under arms who are trying to \ndo their best and getting shot at every day. I was at a funeral in \nVermont this week for one of them, as I have been on several other \noccasions. They are putting their lives on the line. They are getting \npaid what a corporal or a sergeant gets paid, and they should not have \nto be putting up with companies back here making obscene profits on \nwhat they do. They put their lives on the line.\n\n[[Page S6853]]\n\n  What I am saying is, some of the people who are making these obscene \nprofits, they ought to at least go to jail. They ought to at least go \nto jail. I was thinking of that this week when I was at that funeral in \nVermont. These are brave American men and women. I know every one of us \nhere applauds their bravery. But I do not want to see companies, \nwhether they are American companies or any other companies, making \nmoney on our sons and daughters who are over there putting their lives \non the line.\n\n  That is why I want this amendment. That is why we should have kept it \nin the bill before. Frankly, we ought to keep it in now. Now, I fully \nunderstand that the White House comes out here and says: We don't want \nto tamper with these people. We don't want to put the brakes on them. \nThey can get the votes to knock down this amendment, but it is wrong. \nIt is wrong. And I suggest that some of those who lobby against this \nkind of amendment go to some of these funerals--go to some of these \nfunerals--and tell them we will protect the people who are \nprofiteering. It is wrong. It is wrong. We ought to be protecting them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield without losing my right to the \nfloor, of course.\n  Mr. WARNER. A question: Is there some opportunity such that I can \npresent the Senate with an explanation of why I felt there should be a \nsecond degree? I would like to do it in just a dispassionate, \nstraightforward manner, and let the Senate then make its decision. So I \nwould like to have the opportunity. I hope in due course to present my \nside of this issue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, regaining my right to the floor, of course \nI am willing to offer the appropriate courtesy, very soon, to the \nSenator from Virginia. He is one of the most distinguished Members of \nthis body, and, more importantly, he and I have been close friends for \nover a quarter of a century.\n  I say to the Senator, I wonder if you might consider this: have a \nvote on your amendment, and have a vote on my amendment separately, and \nlet the Senate work its will. The distinguished senior Senator from \nVirginia is going to be the Senate chairman in the committee of \nconference. It gives him that much more control. But why not let the \nU.S. Senate vote on each amendment separately and then see where it \ngoes from there?\n  I will say this very frankly. I think the reason nobody moved to \nstrike my amendment out of the appropriations bill was that--I heard \nthis from both sides--they said: OK, we understand this is not a bad \namendment, and we don't want to be on record as saying we are against \nit.\n\n  I think the reason both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate urged \nit upon the other body was for them. I think the obvious embarrassment \nby some, not all, but the obvious embarrassment by some who had to vote \nagainst it on the other side was they wished they had not. They wished \nthey could have kept it in. So I would ask my dear friend from \nVirginia--and he is truly my dear friend--what do you think of that \nidea? Let's vote on both of them?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as the Senator well knows, the \ndistinguished leaders on both sides are now looking at that while I am \nengaging in debate with him. We are looking at that proposition.\n  I would like to have the opportunity at the earliest convenience to \nstate the purpose for which I initiated the substitute amendment. And I \nthink it is going to meet the majority of objections the Senator from \nVermont has with his proposal.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, certainly, if the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia wishes to speak, I am not going to withhold the floor \nfrom him. He has accommodated me when I have wanted to speak. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I will not try and \nmake reference to the consideration of language similar to this \nunderlying amendment and what occurred in the appropriations cycle and \nwhat occurred or didn't occur in the conference. I was not there. I \ndon't have the specific knowledge. I am pleased that the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, when I did discuss with him privately some of the \nearlier statements, has now corrected them. And I accept at face value \nwhat you have said about what took place in the appropriations cycle.\n  But we are now, at this point in time, on this bill, presented with \nthis amendment and a second-degree submitted by myself.\n  First, the Senator observes that there is a need for legislation to \nimpose criminal penalties on persons who commit wrongdoing in \ncontracting in the course of our military operations. I concur with \nthat very simply. So how best to do it, I think, is as follows.\n  My amendment would strike the language of the Leahy amendment and \nsubstitute language which would make it explicitly extraterritorial, \nwhich means we can reach out to these companies that are alleged to \nhave done wrong and make applicable existing criminal statutes, \nstatutes which have been on our books for a long period of time, which \nhave been tested in the courts, and we know precisely what the language \nmeans.\n  My amendment would do the following. There are two existing Federal \ncriminal statutes. The first is 18 USC 1001 dealing with false \nstatements; and, secondly, 18 USC 1031, dealing with major frauds \nagainst the United States.\n  Those are the statutes, the body of law, which Congress put in place \nto deal with problems such as may be occurring in our operations in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and, as the Senator said in his amendment, any other \ncountry in which members of the United States Armed Forces are engaged. \nSo we have reached out not just to those two countries, Afghanistan and \nIraq, but we have reached out to accommodate all of those areas. And \nthese companies or individuals can be held accountable.\n  So the second-degree amendment takes care of the potential problems \nin covering overseas contracting without the problems inherent in the \nLeahy amendment.\n  I turn now to the Leahy amendment. This was the primary reason I put \nforward the second-degree amendment because you have added language. \nFrankly, I say with some modesty, I was a lawyer and a criminal \nprosecutor. But if I could draw your attention to section D in which \nyou apply all of the penalties of your amendment, D says: Knowingly and \nwillfully an individual or a contractor or an entity or corporation \n``materially overvalues any good or service with the specific intent to \nexcessively profit from the war, military action, or relief or \nreconstruction activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, or such other country. \n. . .''\n  I say to my good friend, I am not sure what the derivation of that \nlanguage is and the extent to which the courts have addressed that \nlanguage in the context of not a civil but a criminal prosecution. So I \npose that as a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might respond to that, they have. The Senator from \nVirginia asked whether they have done it in a criminal prosecution. No, \nthis is not a criminal statute. They have done it in a civil case, and \nthere is a huge amount of case law on this in civil cases. The only \ndifference is, if the Senator is worried about the rights of \ncontractors and others, in a criminal case, of course, you have to \nprove specific intent. In civil cases, you have to prove it with a \npreponderance of the evidence. Here you have to prove it beyond a \nreasonable doubt. But these are words of art: ``overvalues a good or \nservice with specific intent to excessively profit from the war, \nmilitary action. . . .'' Those are words of art. They have been \ninterpreted by the courts.\n  The difference, again, as I said, if you are doing it in a criminal \ncase, as the Senator from Virginia well knows, you have to prove it \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n  ``Excessively profit'' is taken from the renegotiation act, which is, \nas I said, a civil act. The constitutionality of that was upheld; I \nbelieve it was in the Lichter case.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. Let me bring to his attention that \nwe are quite fortunate as a nation to have literally several thousand \ncontractors engaged in supporting the men and women of the Armed Forces \nof the United States in many areas of the world. And now we are about \nto take\n\n[[Page S6854]]\n\nlanguage which, as the Senator said, perhaps was a basis for a civil \npenalty and subject these thousands of contractors and individuals to \nthe following language in your amendment: They ``shall be fined under \nparagraph (2), imprisoned not more than 20 years.''\n  I say to my good friend, we were taught in law school the difference \nbetween civil and criminal law. We were taught the tremendous burden of \nproof and so forth that is associated with depriving one of one's \nfreedom and liberty. You are about to subject these contractors to \nthat, up to 20 years, using only civil standards. I understand you have \nspecific proof in there.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It has to be beyond a reasonable doubt. And I have \nprosecuted thousands of cases, tried hundreds of them as a prosecutor. \nI know that is one high hurdle.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I can't remember. It has been too long. \nThat is one of a senior citizen's benefits. But I spent 5 years as an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the criminal and appellate divisions of the \ncourts here in the Nation's Capital. I point out to the Senator, I \nrecognize the high bar. I am just saying I think the Congress should \ndeliberate very carefully a criminal penalty of up to 20 years for \nthese thousands upon thousands of companies that are currently engaged. \nCarefully, first go through a series of hearings, and then floor \ndebate, rather than come up here and in a matter of an hour or two of \ntime try and make the decision to impose criminal law on an existing \nframework of contractor support at the very time we are engaged in \ncombat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and, to a lesser extent, in \nother parts of the universe.\n  The Senator is asking the Senate to take a very serious step. That is \nwhy the substitute amendment would incorporate, if adopted, a statute--\nbasically existing law--and extraterritorial ability to reach the \ncompany under existing law in title 18.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Vermont have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia controls the floor \nand has yielded only for the purpose of allowing an inquiry to be made \nthrough the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Democratic whip wishes to address the Senate, I am \nmore than happy to allow that.\n  Mr. REID. I will wait my turn.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. My question to the distinguished senior Senator from \nVirginia probably reflects my confusion. He was concerned about the 20-\nyear penalty to which this might subject some of these contractors. \nObviously, thousands of contractors are not going to be subjected to \nthat. It is only going to be the most grievous ones.\n  He is proposing, if I am correct, a statute that would subject \noverseas contractors to a 30-year penalty. I thought I was a tough \nprosecutor. The Senator from Virginia complains about my 20-year \npenalty; he is proposing 30 years. I don't mean to get into a bidding \nwar on penalties, but if my 20 years is too Draconian, 30 years sounds \neven more so.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will reply to that. My criminal penalty \nis under existing statutes, which were carefully debated by the \nCongress and have been on the lawbooks for a number of years. I will \nsoon address the Senate as to how long these statutes have been in \nplace. That is the basic difference.\n  My statutes don't have in it ``materially overvalues any good or \nservice.'' I say to my good friend, that is too vague on which to send \nsomeone, as we used to say, as an old prosecutor, ``up the river.'' I \ndon't care whether it is 20 or 30 years. I don't know how the burden of \nproof of ``materially overvalues'' is reached. You are asking for a \ncriminal penalty predicated on that phrase.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I may respond without the Senator losing \nhis right to the floor, he is relying on a statute--if I recall, \nwithout hearings; there was an amendment to the Sarbanes-Oxley bill a \ncouple years ago on the floor. If we are talking about criminal \nstatutes and changing them by whim, that is one that said no more \ndebate on this. I am bringing up something that was debated rather \nthoroughly in the Appropriations Committee, including a bill the \nSenator from Virginia and I voted for last year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator could point to the \nRecord in which the Senate--in the course of the deliberation on the \nAppropriations bill in which his amendment is included--debated that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Vermont is \nyielded to for the purpose of answering a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It was debated, of course, in committee. It was well noted \nhere before all Senators. Nobody, either Republican or Democrat, made \nthe normal motion to strike that was done when you have a part to which \nyou object. The Senator from Virginia is right that this is slightly \ndifferent. That one was just for Iraq. This includes Afghanistan and \nelsewhere and does not contain a sunset provision.\n\n  I must admit that we are somewhat inclined to do that, especially \nafter hearing of these e-mails that have just been made public. We are \nnot talking about somebody who shows up and provides five dozen \nbaseball caps to one of our military groups somewhere around the world. \nWe are talking about people getting a billion dollars, with no-bid, no-\ncompetition contracts. I think we ought to at least be able to look at \nthem and make sure they are spending our money correctly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my colleague has challenged me on the \nunderlying statute that I include in my amendment. I draw his attention \nto the title 18, section 1001. That statute was put on in 1948.\n  Now, the second statute I utilize is 1031, which was adopted in 1988. \nSo the first was in 1948; the next was in 1988.\n  I question my friend, who challenged me that they were just adopted, \nit seems to me that both of these Federal laws have been on the books \nfor a sufficient time to have been examined by the courts and others.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am confused by the response. Is the \nSenator saying that section 1001 of title 18 was not amended by the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act about a year and a half ago?\n  Mr. WARNER. It might have been amended.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Whatever it was----\n  Mr. WARNER. On October 11, 1996, there was one amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It was not increased back in--if the Senator tells me the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act was not amended on section 1001 at all, I will \naccept that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am reading from the Federal Criminal Code, 2004 \nedition. I imagine it supersedes the 2003 edition.\n  The point is that the statute, 1001, originated on June 25, 1948. \nThis shows the last amendment to be October 11, 1996. Very clearly, I \nthink my good friend has to acknowledge that this is proof that the two \nstatutes upon which I rely have clearly been on the books for a \nconsiderable period of time and have been presumably tested in the \ncourts and otherwise. That is the basic difference.\n  I can find no reference in the Criminal Code to the use of the \nlanguage that my good friend uses here, ``materially overvalues.'' I \nthink that is too vague a standard upon which to send anybody up the \nriver. I don't care whether it is 20 or 30 years, or whatever period of \ntime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is it the position of my friend from \nVirginia that the kinds of things we have heard about--and he sees it \nmore than I do as chairman of the Armed Services Committee--about the \nhundreds of millions of dollars being overcharged in meals, and \nhundreds of millions of dollars being overcharged on vehicles, housing, \nand construction. Any of those would be covered by his statute.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a legitimate question. I answer in the \naffirmative, that the anecdotal types of things we have discussed on \nthe floor would be covered by the existing criminal statutes, provided \nthey found the requisite level of ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''\n  I challenge my friend, I cannot find any criminal law that employs \nthis type of verbiage that he seeks here. There is reference in civil \nstatutes to that type of language, but the Senator from Vermont is now \nasking that these words become a part of the criminal statute.\n  I think what is going to happen, if your amendment will be adopted, \nis\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\nthat this infrastructure of tens of thousands of individuals and \ncompanies out there right now is going to say: We are out of this; we \nare not going to subject our people, we are not going to subject our \nbusiness to the risk of this type of prosecution under these vague \nstandards of ``materially overvalues any good or service.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might, obviously the statutes on the \nbooks have not stopped them from overcharging, have not stopped them \nfrom the kinds of things we have seen.\n  Nobody wants to use the word ``Halliburton'' around here, but we \nconstantly pick up the paper and read about a number of these \ncompanies. They are obviously overcharging, and nothing is happening to \nthem. I am just one frustrated American who wants them to stop.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have a very quick and simple answer to the Senator's \nquestion. Adoption of the amendment by the Senator from Virginia would \nbe the first time the jurisdiction of these two titles is extended \nbeyond the shores. Criminal convictions could be brought against \ndefendants, if my amendment is adopted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Let me ask the Senator from Virginia this: Suppose we have \nan item, and one of these contractors about which we are talking \ncharges $2,000 for an item. It cost him $5. We remember back to the \ndays of the $500 hammer. He charges the Government $2,000 for an item \nthat costs $5, but he does not lie about this. He does not conceal the \ncost. He simply says: Here is my bill.\n  He says: OK, it is $2,000. He paid $5. He does not conceal that cost. \nHe does not lie. He just says: Here is the bill for $2,000. He has not \nlied. He did not conceal--the bill is not hidden somewhere else. It is \na straight-out bill, but he is obviously gouging the Government, \ncharging $2,000 for a $5 item. Does the Senator's statute cover that \nsituation?\n  Mr. WARNER. Section 1031 of title 18, ``Major fraud against the \nUnited States'':\n\n       Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, any \n     scheme or artifice with the intent to defraud the United \n     States--\n\n  That is fairly broad.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is not a scheme. He said: I just delivered this \nwidget. Here is your bill for $2,000. And there are so many other \nthings going on, the Government says: Here is your 2,000 bucks. It is \nnot a scheme. It is not an artifice. He is not hiding the fact at all. \nHe said: Here is your bill for $2,000 and somewhere gets paid in the \nbureaucracy. He has obviously gouged. He has not lied about it. He is \nup front about it. Does the Senator's statute cover that because that \nhappens a lot?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this framework of laws embraces enough \nprovisions that they could establish a case of fraud using the example \nthe Senator from Vermont stated because the contract will have \nprovisions in it with regard to the amount of profit, and there would \nhave to be some reasonable examination of that. The contract is not \ngoing to be silent on that issue.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is the Senator from Virginia saying, then, \nit would require fraud?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am reading the statute. That is what it says here:\n\n       Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, any \n     scheme or artifice with the intent to defraud the United \n     States--\n\n  And the contract is going to set the profit margins.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We are getting a lot of no-bid contracts with basically \nthe company, as we found in these e-mails, saying: Here is what it is \ngoing to be.\n  There are no bids. There is nothing else. The Government says: OK, go \nforward. But there is no question there has been war profiteering \nthere. There has been no fraud, no artifice, nothing else. He just sent \nthe bill, and the bill gets paid. It is profiteering, but I do not see \nwhere your statute covers that situation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would that be in the nature of some sort of trick they \nwere trying to perform?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I may respond, they realize there are \nnot going to be bids on this contract. They realize it is going to be \nOK'd as soon as they send it in. They have not done any tricks at all. \nThey just say: Here is our bill. There is nobody else bidding, and it \ngets passed.\n  Some may say that may be fraud; that may not be. Mine does not say \nmaybe. It just says to do it is a crime.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's look at section 1001:\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in \n     any matter within the jurisdiction--\n\n  So forth--\n\n     knowingly and willfully--\n       (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, \n     or device a material fact;\n       (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \n     statement, or representation; or\n       (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the \n     same to contain--\n\n  I say to my good friend, these statutes cover most of the situations, \nif not all, in which there could be a wrong perpetrated, a wrong of the \ntype you say is profiteering.\n  To bring this to a conclusion, the very fact that the two of us have \nhad some experience and cannot reconcile differences on the meaning of \nthe language of the Senator from Vermont brings home the fact we should \nnot be asking our colleagues to make that the law of the land on a vote \nthis afternoon after this short debate. The Senator is bringing a \nbrandnew dimension into the Criminal Code.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might respond to that, it is not a \nbrandnew dimension. It is basically what we had in the Appropriations \nbill last year.\n  Secondly, it is completely appropriate to apply this new law to Iraq \nwhen we see these huge cost overruns on no-bid contracts, and nobody \nseems to be held accountable. Defense offered by lawyers for the \ncontractor might be that there are no false statements and, therefore, \nno crime, even though one is ripping off the taxpayers.\n  It is similar to the guy who comes in and says: I will sell you this \nhammer for $2,000. He is not claiming it is a $2,000 hammer. He is not \nclaiming he paid more than $5 for it. He says: I will sell it for \n$2,000. Has he made excess profit? Of course, he has. But when it comes \nto the point when our men and women are putting their lives on the line \nwhile others sit back in the boardrooms in America, I think every \nsingle lawyer in these boardrooms is going to know exactly what this \namendment does, and it will be a strong deterrent.\n  Mr. President, as the White House proved last year when this \namendment was debated during the Iraq supplemental conference, I am \nsure the Senator can pull up the votes to defeat me. I think it is a \nmistake. Frankly, I will keep on trying to bring up commonsense \namendments to prevent war profiteering. Maybe sooner or later some of \nthese people in the same boardrooms who are involved, who are getting \nno-bid contracts, may think: Maybe we better slow up because maybe one \nday the Senate will actually say we are going to hold you accountable \nif you engage in this sort of activity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia controls the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we are at the point, unless there are other \ncolleagues who desire to discuss this--does the Senator from Alabama \nwish to speak?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will just make a few brief comments, if that is \nappropriate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Virginia yield for a \nquestion from the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I was wondering if the Senator from Virginia had yielded \nthe floor, but he has not.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was hoping I could yield to the Senator from Alabama \nfor a question or observation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I want to make a comment or two unless the debate \nis basically finished, in which case I have an amendment that will \nhopefully come up a little later that covers some of these same issues. \nI have some observations that I would like to share about this \nparticular amendment. I would not be able to support it, and I wish to \nexplain why, but if the Senator is ready to move along, I am willing to \nyield the floor and move along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are trying to complete this Defense bill. \nThe\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\nSenator from Vermont has made his case. The Senator from Virginia has \nmade his case. The record should be spread with the fact that Senator \nLeahy is going to get a vote on his amendment before we finish this \nbill, and I would hope we could move on. As far as I am concerned, the \nissue is very clearly defined. I have heard people ask all during the \nday, What is happening with this bill? Why can we not move it more \nquickly?\n  The Senator from Michigan, the manager of this bill on the side of \nthe minority, and I have worked very hard the last 24 hours to try to \nclear amendments, and on our side there are a definite number of \namendments. As I understand it, this is our 11th day on this bill. We \nhave spent weeks on these bills in the past. We know the importance of \nthe Senate agenda. There are so many other things to do. We have just \nwasted a tremendous amount of time, obviously for the reasons the \nmajority does not want to vote on Senator Leahy's amendment. So I would \ncertainly hope that everyone understands that anything that is being \nslowed down on this bill is not because of us.\n  There are a number of issues we need to debate on a Defense bill. \nCertainly, we should have an amendment that deals with end strength; \nthat is, what should be the troop levels. The person who is offering \nthat amendment is a graduate from West Point, a retired major from the \nArmy. Certainly, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island is qualified to \noffer that amendment. We should do that. We should get to that.\n  Another issue that we need to debate is the missile defense system. \nSome feel very strongly that it is an important program on which we \nshould spend lots of money. Others believe we are spending too much \nmoney on it. That is an issue that should be debated.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Delaware wishes to offer an \namendment to cut some of the higher tax cuts that were given and have \nthose moneys spent on Iraq.\n  We have a number of important issues. There are a number of issues \nthat may not seem important in the overall scheme of things, but to the \nindividual Senators they are extremely important.\n  I repeat, I want everyone to understand we are doing everything we \ncan to move this bill along. In the last several days, we have heard \nthreats of filing cloture because we are slowing the bill down. We are \nnot slowing the bill down. Nothing can be guaranteed around here, but I \nwould certainly suggest if there is a cloture motion filed on this \nbill, I do not think the majority is going to get cloture on this bill. \nWe want the opportunity to offer a few amendments.\n  Now, we all understand that President Reagan died. There is never a \ngood time for someone to pass away. We all felt so strongly about \nPresident Reagan, and we joined in the celebration of his life last \nweek. But we should not be punished on this bill because of that. So I \nwould hope that we could move this bill along.\n  As everyone knows, tonight we are not going to be able to go very \nlate. We can finish this bill, but we are not going to finish the bill \ntomorrow. We cannot finish the bill tomorrow.\n  I have said on this floor so many times--but when something is good, \nit has to be repeated--there are no two finer people in the Senate than \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Virginia and the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Michigan, the two managers of this bill. But we \nhave to move on.\n  Through the Chair, I say to my friend, the chairman of this most \nimportant committee, we are not trying to slow this bill down. We have \ndone what we can to move it forward, but I have stated there are some \nissues that we must address. We are going to continue to work. I have \ntalked to the Democratic leader on many occasions. He is, of course, \nalways aware of what is going on on the floor. He wants this bill \ncompleted as much as the rest of us. So I would hope that we could get \na vote on the amendment of Senator Leahy as rapidly as possible and \nmove on.\n  I do not know if this is true, but I have been told the majority \nwants to vote on some judges tonight. That is also going to take some \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in reply to the distinguished Democratic \nwhip, I certainly commend him. I would say to him that practically as \nlong as I have been in the Senate he has been on the floor for the \nSenate authorization bill all these many years and has been a \ntremendous help to us, and he continues at this moment. I assure him we \nare working on a UC which I hope will accommodate the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont and his requirements. So I am simply asking for a \nfew minutes on which this matter may be presented to the Senator, \nunless someone wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if my friend from Virginia would yield for a \nquestion relative to his amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I listened to most of the debate--I had to leave for a \nmoment.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand the position, or the statements of the \nSenator from Virginia. Much of his opposition to the language of the \nSenator from Vermont is that it is in the form of a criminal statute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, not exactly. We will just have a colloquy. Mine is \nlikewise a criminal statute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand that.\n  Mr. WARNER. They are both criminal, except mine uses the underlying \nstatutes and legislation adopted into law after the normal process \nthrough the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do understand that. There is no reason both of these \namendments should not be adopted. They are perfectly consistent with \neach other.\n  Mr. WARNER. Oh, no, I cannot buy off on that. There is one portion of \nthe amendment of the Senator from Vermont which is a brandnew concept \nbeing introduced of standards for criminality, and I cannot accept \nthat.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is my question to my friend from Virginia. My \nquestion is, Is the objection to his language that it is a criminal \nstatute--if this, for instance, simply restored the civil penalty for \nthis material overvaluation of a good and service, would the Senator \nfrom Virginia still object to it?\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I would have to look at it. At this late hour, with \nvotes momentarily to occur, I would not want to conjecture. My \npredicate is that criminal penalties deserve the most exhaustive \nconsideration by the legislature, be it State or Federal. This new \nstandard that my colleague from Vermont has raised has a legislative as \nwell as a judicial history in civil penalties. It does not have a \ncomparable record in any Federal system.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Which is the reason--if I can be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The reason I sought the floor to ask the Senator from \nVirginia the question is because the argument he makes seems to be \nbased on a premise that there is a civil penalty history to this \nlanguage but not a criminal penalty history. It would seem to me that \nwould be greater protection for any potential defendant or contractor \nbecause there is a higher standard of proof.\n  But putting all that aside, my question is, then, would there be any \nobjection to simply restoring the civil penalty for that violation, \nmaterial overvaluation of any good or service? Since the Senator says \nthere is a history in terms of civil penalties for that activity, then \nI was very curious to find out whether he might object if we simply \nrestore the civil penalty for that violation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a situation I would want to examine \nwith great care and see how it is phrased. I think right now we have \ntwo very distinct pieces of legislation before this body. This is \nlegislation proposed by the Senator from Virginia which is predicated \non statutes that have been in existence for a number of years--one, \n1948 is the origin; the second is 1988. We simply extend the \njurisdictional reach of those statutes to areas in which these \ncontractors are performing beyond the continental boundaries. It is a \nvery clear way of bringing to justice those operating beyond our \nshores. To me, that does it. I am firmly opposed to the introduction \ninto the criminal statutes a standard of criminality which I feel is \nfar too vague to support the extreme of deprivation of\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\nlife, liberty, and freedom--not life, perhaps, but liberty and freedom.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could reclaim the floor, what the amendment of the \nSenator provides, and I have no objection to it although I don't \nbelieve it adds much to existing law--I don't have any objection to the \nSenator's amendment making clear there is this extraterritorial \njurisdiction. That is fine. But what it leaves out is the language \npreviously in the law providing for a civil penalty for material \novervaluation of a good or service. What it says is ``with the specific \nintent to excessively profit.'' That is a specific intent which is \nappropriate, I believe, either to civil or criminal law. From my \nperspective, this can be either civil or criminal. But the key point is \nthat the amendment of the Senator does not include that subsection \n1(d), which, it seems to me, is essential if we are going to get to \nthat profiteering issue which the amendment of the Senator from Vermont \ngets to.\n  But I would be interested, if the amendment of the Senator from \nVermont is defeated, and I hope it is not, as to whether then the \nSenator from Virginia might accept a civil penalty for this exact same \nlanguage which was previously a civil penalty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Virginia \nis recognized to answer the question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. In reply, I think you framed the question very clearly. \nMy response I hope is equally clear. I could not make a proffer as to \nwhat I might do until I have looked at it. I want to know how this \nparticular language is employed in those civil penalty provisions. It \nmay have added words in it. I haven't read any of those clauses, so I \nwould have to wait. But you have accurately stated there is a very \nsignificant difference between the legislation proposed by the Senator \nfrom Virginia and the legislation proposed by the Senator from Vermont.\n  I think at this point we are about ready to receive the unanimous \nconsent proposal; am I not correct?\n  Mr. REID. Close.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have been informed by the distinguished Democratic whip \nthat we are close, in which case I suggest the absence of a quorum, at \nwhich time we can all draw a breath.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the leadership has been working with the \nmanagers and has worked out a unanimous consent request which I would \nlike to propound to the Senate at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 4:30 today, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Warner amendment No. 3452, which \nis to be modified to be in the form of a first-degree amendment, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the Leahy amendment No. 3292, with no \namendments in order to the amendments prior to the votes; I further ask \nconsent that following those votes, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession and immediate votes on the confirmation of the following: \nExecutive Calendar No. 567, William Duffey; No. 590, Lawrence Stengel; \nNo. 607, Paul Diamond.\n  I further ask consent that following those votes, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume \nlegislative session.\n  I finally ask consent that following those votes Senator Sessions be \nrecognized in order to offer his amendment No. 3372, which is to be \nfurther modified with changes that are at the desk; provided further \nthat following 10 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form, \nthe amendment be agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I would ask the \ndistinguished Senator to modify the request to allow 2 minutes prior to \nthe votes on Mr. Duffey, Mr. Stengel, and Mr. Diamond.\n  Mr. WARNER. So modified.\n  Mr. REID. I would also ask the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, we understood there would be an up-or-down vote on the \nsecond-degree amendment offered by the chairman and also an up-or-down \nvote on the amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is, that is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the managers of the bill are grateful to \nthe leadership for the cooperation we are getting in moving this bill \nalong, as well as all Members. We have had a preliminary meeting with \nregard to tomorrow's schedule. I would like to acquaint the Senate with \nthe thinking at the moment with the leadership.\n  We would start off the morning with no morning business, proceeding \npromptly to the bill at the hour of 9:30, with the first amendment to \nbe brought up on our side, the Bond-Harkin amendment. Am I correct on \nthat?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will try to establish time agreements during the \ncourse of the votes today. That is to be followed by the Reed amendment \nwhich goes to end strength, a very significant issue. That amendment \ncurrently has an amendment in the second degree, not an amendment which \nis a substitute but just an amendment. That is under consideration and \nwill be debated at that time and then, in all probability, a voice \nvote, not on that, a voice vote on the first one I hope, but on the \nsecond there would likely be a rollcall.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. In our conversation on the floor, we talked about what we \nwanted to do. We did talk about Bond-Harkin, Reed end strength. I ask \nthe two distinguished managers of the bill, because of the difficult \nschedule that the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee and \nthe minority leader have on Friday, if we could have one amendment that \nthe Senator from South Dakota is going to offer dealing with health. He \nwould take a very short time agreement on that. And the Senator from \nDelaware wishes to offer an important amendment dealing with taxes, and \nhe will take a relatively short period of time. He has to decide that. \nBut we are talking about this before we get to missile defense. They \nsay they would certainly like to get that done because, as you know, \ntheir schedules are extremely difficult in the next day or two.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a new dimension which I have not had the \nopportunity to review.\n  Mr. REID. At least we got it down a little ways.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will take that into consideration. I cannot commit at \nthis point in time, but I do know there is an amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware regarding taxation.\n  Mr. REID. That is the one.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see.\n  Mr. LEVIN. After Daschle.\n  Mr. REID. And Senator Daschle would take a very short time agreement. \nWe have not had the opportunity to fully vet this with Senator Biden \nother than he wanted to get up early because of his schedule on Friday, \nbut we will discuss this with them.\n  Mr. WARNER. I defer to my colleague here with regard to the very \nimportant amendments on missile defense.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before I make reference to the missile defense amendments, \nwhich it is our hope that we would be able to take up and dispose of \ntomorrow, the reference that the chairman made to the end strength \namendment, I understand the Senator from Rhode Island, his end strength \namendment at the moment could lead to a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is at the desk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But there is still an effort being made, as I understand \nit, to see if there can't be a resolution to that.\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island \napproached the Senator from Virginia earlier today, and he said he \nwould provide some language. Thus far, we haven't had that opportunity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are also hoping to dispose of either three or four \namendments tomorrow relative to missile defense. We would like to talk \nto the Senators involved in that during these votes. But I believe the \nlogical order here is that the Boxer amendment be first and then Reed, \neither one or two amendments on missile defense after the Boxer \namendment, and then I would have an amendment after the Reed \namendments. That is the current informal intention. We would talk to \nthose Senators to see if they agree that that is the logical order, try \nto get time agreements on all of these amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to conclude this brief colloquy, I am not \nable to speak to the Daschle amendment or the Biden tax measure. I will \nhave to engage people on the tax committee to look at that. The others, \nI would say, as chairman and I hope you as ranking, if we are able to \nget through the agenda we have outlined, this bill is really down in \nits final stages; would you not agree?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, there are a lot of outstanding amendments.\n  Mr. REID. If the distinguished chairman will yield, Senator Daschle \nwould be happy to wait until Monday with a very short time agreement. \nBut we do have some other amendments on this bill.\n  Every year, as you know, there are a few abortion amendments. They \ndon't take a lot of time because we have debated a number of them on \nprevious occasions. We have a number of other issues. But as we talked \nabout earlier today, if we do end strength and missile defense, we get \nSenator Biden's amendment out of the way, the others should go fairly \nquickly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, in fairness to our colleagues, \nwe do have listed a number of amendments from a number of colleagues \nwho expect--and I think reasonably so--their amendments would be \naddressed before this bill goes to final passage. I wouldn't want to \ngive an assessment that we are near the end because there are many \nSenators. We are, by the way, successfully reducing the number of \namendments. We want to give credit to Senator Reid as always for his \nHerculean efforts in this regard. We have, under his leadership on our \nside, been able to successfully reduce the number of outstanding \namendments, but there are still many left.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would say in response to that, we have likewise \nsuccessfully reduced and I think have only one left on our side \ncompared to what you may have before you.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I don't usually deal in the minutia of things, rather \nbroader issues. But I just wanted to say something to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader of this important committee, I do believe we are near \nthe end. I say that because we have been on this bill 11 days. If we \nspend a few more days on it, we are near the end.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we spend a couple more days, yes, we are near the end.\n  Mr. WARNER. Wait a minute, let's just leave it ``we are near the \nend.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. I subscribe to my leader's comment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Democratic whip and my \ncolleague from Michigan. The unanimous consent agreement is in order. \nThe vote should start momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished manager, I \nunderstand that the measure that Senators Harkin, Talent, Grassley, and \nI have proposed is in order for 9:30 tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. Could the Senator, in the interim, talk to his \ncosponsors on both sides of the aisle and give me an estimate of the \ntime that would be required?\n  Mr. BOND. We hope it will be brief. We will talk with you. We hope \nthat perhaps it may be accepted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Without a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I would like to spare the body a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 3452 \nis modified to be a first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Two minutes on each side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Two minutes is fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I do not want to start until the Senate \nis in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I voted, as did others, for the Warner \namendment even though I see it as only the tiniest step toward \naddressing what we read about in the paper every single day, and that \nis war profiteering in Iraq. His amendment does not cover war \nprofiteering; mine does. In fact, his, I believe, removes my \nprohibition against war profiteering. What I have in here is an \namendment, very similar to what we passed in the appropriations bill \nearlier, about real war profiteering.\n  This Monday I was at the funeral in Vermont of a young sergeant who \nwas killed in Iraq, just as my wife and I have been at other funerals \nof Vermonters killed over there, and I suspect most Members of the \nSenate have. They are over there defending their country. They are over \nthere doing what their country asked them to, being paid as corporals \nand sergeants, and dying.\n  We have a lot of other people sitting in boardrooms back here in \nAmerica, watching enormous profits, watching the American taxpayers pay \nfor things that are never delivered, for trucks that are never there, \nfor meals that are never there, and we can't stop them. My amendment \nwould stop them. My amendment would put, if not patriotism in them, it \nwill put the fear of going to jail in them.\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\n  Let us stand up for our American men and women over there. Let us \nstop the war profiteers. Let us say no to them, and let us say, if you \ncontinue, you are going to go to jail because that is where you belong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, my amendment does everything that my \ncolleague stated as a desired goal. His amendment goes a step further. \nThis is the reason we have two votes. He establishes a new criterion \nfor a crime that could result in incarceration up to 20 years. It is so \nvague that I assure you it could not get through the first year of law \nschool. It says you could go to jail if ``you materially overvalue any \ngood or service.'' There is no regulation, no criterion by which to \njudge that. As a consequence, this body would be enacting a new \ncriminal statute without any hearings, without any thoughtful process, \nand would subject the contracting community, which numbers in the tens \nof thousands of individuals supporting the men and women of the Armed \nForces all over the world, to this very vague proposed criminal \nstatute.\n  I urge strongly that you vote against the Leahy amendment.\n  I regret that, I say to my good friend, but we cannot put on our \nbooks this statute. It would be wrong.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my amendment very simply says to the \nHalliburtons all over the country that you can't profit on the backs of \nour men and women in Iraq or Afghanistan. We all know that is what it \nis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Does the Senator from Virginia yield his remaining 35 seconds?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, Madam President. I yield it knowing that the good \nwisdom and sound judgment of this body will follow my views.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this afternoon, while debating my amendment \non war profiteering, we became mired in a debate about what is or what \nis not in the criminal code.\n  I will not revisit that issue now. However, I will say to the senior \nSenator from Virginia, who asked from where the language in my \namendment originated in the criminal code, that I have more information \non that issue that should be to his satisfaction.\n  First, the term ``material'' appears in terrorism laws prohibiting \n``material'' support. In fact, all falsity in the criminal code must \n``material''. Pursuant to a Supreme Court ruling, part of proving a \nfalse statement must be ``material.''\n  Second, the term ``overvaluation'' is in Title 15 prohibiting \n``criminally overvaluation'' of securities.\n  Third, with respect to ``intent to excessively profit,'' this is \ntaken, in part, from ``significantly profit'' in 12 U.S.C. 1297 which \ncriminalizes bank crimes. ``Significantly profit'' is, in fact, a lower \nstandard that ``excessively profit.'' We erred on the side of caution \nand raised the standard.\n  Although I made this point clear during the debate, this should leave \nno doubt that my amendment is carefully constructed legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, my understanding is we will now go off \nthe bill. We will remain off the bill for the remainder of the evening. \nWe now have three votes on judicial nominations. I stand corrected. \nAfter the votes on the three judicial nominations, there is a short \nmatter with Senator Sessions. It is in the UC.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes for the three \njudicial nominations be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6859-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6859-S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF WILLIAM S.

Duffey, Jr., \nof Georgia, to be United States District Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be a period of 2 minutes evenly \ndivided on the nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nWilliam Duffey, who has been nominated to the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of Georgia.\n  Mr. Duffey is a cum laude graduate of South Carolina University Law \nSchool, where he had been a member of the Order of the Coif. His \nillustrious legal career includes a tour of duty in Turkey with the \nU.S. Air Force; deputy and associate independent counsel with the \nOffice of the Independent Counsel's Whitewater investigation; and a \nlong, successful law practice with the prestigious firm of King & \nSpalding.\n  Mr. Duffey is a gifted and experienced attorney whose familiarity \nwith Federal trial procedure will benefit him immensely on the Federal \nbench. I am confident that he will make a fine jurist on the Federal \nbench.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise in support of the confirmation \nof William S. Duffey to be a district judge for the North District of \nthe State of Georgia.\n  Bill Duffey is a well-respected lawyer in our State, one of the best \nlawyers in the State of Georgia. He has served in private practice. He \nserved in the Judge Advocates Corps of the United States Air Force. He \nserved in the Office of the Independent Council.\n  For the last 4 years, Bill Duffey has served as the U.S. attorney for \nthe Northern District of Georgia. He comes highly recommended by his \npeers, by those who have appeared before him, as well as those who have \nbeen on the other side in cases.\n  He is a true gentleman in every sense of the word, an outstanding \nadvocate for the judiciary. He will make an excellent judge, and I ask \nfor his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is interesting, I think I heard one of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\nRepublican campaign committees talking about Democrats treating the \nSouth unfairly on judges. Southern States comprise about 25 percent of \nthe States, but 60 of the nominees, about one-third of the nominees, \nhave come from the South. With my colleagues, I have moved to get \nvirtually all of them through.\n  Today we are asked to consider the nomination of William S. Duffey, \nJr., to the Northern District of Georgia. The ABA found Mr. Duffey to \nbe well-qualified to be a district court judge. He also has the support \nof both of his home State Senators.\n  Mr. Duffey is currently serving as the United States Attorney for the \nNorthern District of Georgia. Prior to this Presidential appointment, \nhe was in private practice and served for a number of years under the \nOffice of the Independent Counsel during the 1990s. In this capacity, \nMr. Duffey had administrative and general oversight responsibility for \ninvestigative activities and staffing in Arkansas. I questioned Mr. \nDuffey about two speeches he gave about his involvement in the \nWhitewater investigation. For example, while serving as the United \nStates Attorney in northern Georgia and using the seal of that office, \nMr. Duffey recently gave a speech entitled ``Whitewater, White Powder \nand White Paper'' at a local university. Despite his use of pejorative \neditorial cartoons, Mr. Duffey claimed that this speech was really \nabout the value of public service. I am somewhat reassured by Mr. \nDuffey's answers to my questions and hope that if he is confirmed, he \nwill avoid appearances of impropriety and conduct himself in a manner \nbeyond reproach.\n  I would also note that some have falsely alleged that Democratic \nSenators have treated Southern nominees unfairly. That is simply \nuntrue. The truth is that Democrats have treated judicial nominees from \nthe South very fairly: Southern States comprise about 25 percent of the \nStates in the Nation, yet out of the 184 judicial nominees of President \nBush that we have confirmed as of this vote, 60 nominees, or about one-\nthird, have been appointed to judicial seats in the South. With this \nvote there will be no vacancies in the entire State of Georgia. \nSenators on this side of the aisle worked to fill the last vacancy in \nGeorgia. Judge C. Ashley Royal was confirmed December 20, 2001, under \nDemocratic leadership to be United States District Judge for the Middle \nDistrict of Georgia.\n  It is very unfortunate that some extreme partisans have tried to \ndivide the American people for political gain with their false \naccusations that Democratic Senators are anti this group or that group. \nDemocrats have been fair to judicial nominees from all parts of the \nNation. We have been far more fair to this President's judicial \nnominees than Republicans were to the last Democratic President's. \nRepublican Senators blocked more than 60 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees, including several southerners.\n  I congratulate Mr. Duffey and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof William S. Duffey, Jr., of Georgia, to be United States District \nJudge for the Northern District of Georgia?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

STENGEL TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Lawrence F. Stengel, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be a period of 2 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nsupport of the nomination of Lawrence F. Stengel for the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Lawrence Stengel, who is currently a State common pleas judge in \nLancaster County, PA, comes to this nomination with an outstanding \nbackground. He has a bachelor's degree from St. Joseph College in 1974 \nand a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1980. He has an \noutstanding record in the practice of law, having maintained a practice \nas a sole practitioner for some 5 years, which is something in this day \nand age.\n  For the past 14 years, he has been a State court judge and has \nestablished an enviable reputation in Lancaster County. In addition to \nhis judicial duties, he serves as an adjunct professor at Franklin and \nMarshall, and also as an adjunct professor at Millersville University, \ndemonstrating his versatility and capability.\n  I have every reason to expect a strong vote.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the nomination of Judge Lawrence F. Stengel for the United States \nDistrict Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judge Stengel \nhas an impeccable record as both a jurist and practitioner, and this \nbody would be wise to confirm him to the Federal bench.\n  Judge Stengel comes to the floor with not only my strong support, but \nalso the unanimous support of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. \nBefore consideration in the committee, Judge Stengel received a ``well \nqualified'' rating from the ABA--the oft quoted ``gold standard'' for \njudicial nominees. An alumnus of my alma mater, University of \nPittsburgh Law School, Judge Stengel has served with distinction for \nnearly fourteen years as a Court of Common Pleas Judge in Lancaster, \nPA. His service on the Court was preceded by 10 years of legal \npractice, where he focused primarily on civil litigation matters.\n  Judge Stengel exemplifies excellence in judicial decision making, yet \nhis commitment to enhancing the legal profession does not merely begin \nand end at the courthouse door. He has had an incredibly positive \nimpact on the legal community outside of the courtroom as well. As \npresident of the Lancaster Bar Association, Judge Stengel formed a \ndiversity task force to investigate ways to increase the number of \nminority attorneys practicing in Lancaster County. Additionally, Judge \nStengel appointed a committee for the creation of the Lancaster Bar \nAssociation Foundation--a foundation whose\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\nprimary purpose is to raise funds for enhancing the delivery of \nservices to underprivileged clients.\n  I applaud the President for nominating Judge Stengel and am confident \nhe has the requisite judicial temperament, integrity, compassion, and \nlegal expertise to serve with distinction on the Federal bench. I urge \nmy colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, I vote to support Lawrence Stengel \nto be a United States District Court Judge for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. Judge Stengel has served for more than 13 years as a \nJudge on the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas, where he has \npresided over hundreds of civil and criminal cases. In light of his \nsignificant judicial experience, it is not surprising that a \nsubstantial majority of the American Bar Association found him ``Well-\nQualified'' for a lifetime position on the Federal court.\n  A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania demonstrates yet \nagain that President Bush's nominees have been treated far better than \nPresident Clinton's and shows dramatically how Democrats have worked in \na bipartisan way to fill vacancies, despite the fact that Republicans \nblocked more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. With \ntoday's confirmation, 18 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal \ncourts in Pennsylvania will have been confirmed, more than for any \nother State.\n  With this confirmation, President Bush's nominees will make up 18 of \nthe 43 active Federal circuit and district court judges for \nPennsylvania--that is more than 40 percent of the Pennsylvania Federal \nbench. On the Pennsylvania district courts alone, President Bush's \ninfluence is even stronger, as his nominees will hold 15 of the 34 \nactive seats--or more than 44 percent of the current active seats. With \nthe additional Pennsylvania district court nominees pending on the \nfloor and likely to be confirmed soon, nearly half of the district \ncourt seats in Pennsylvania will be held by President Bush's \nappointees. Republican appointees will outnumber Democratic appointees \nby nearly two to one.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were \nleft unfilled during Republican control of the Senate when President \nClinton was in the White House. Although Republicans now decry \nDemocratic filibusters of a mere handful of the most extreme nominees, \nRepublicans denied votes to 10 judicial nominees, 9 district and 1 \ncircuit court nominees of President Clinton in Pennsylvania alone. \nDespite the efforts and diligence of the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure the confirmation of all of the \njudicial nominees from every part of his home State, there were 10 \nnominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies who never got a \nvote. Despite how well-qualified these nominees were, many of their \nnominations sat pending before the Senate for more than a year without \nbeing considered. Such obstruction provided President Bush with a \nsignificant opportunity to reshape the Federal bench and the law.\n  News articles in Pennsylvania have highlighted the way that President \nBush has been able to reshape the Federal bench in Pennsylvania. For \nexample, The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that the significant number of \nvacancies on the Pennsylvania courts ``present Republicans with an \nopportunity to shape the judicial makeup of the court for years to \ncome.'' Despite this, I do hope Judge Stengel will be fair to all who \ncome before him.\n  Madam President, I yield back my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Lawrence F. Stengel, of Pennsylvania, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Paul S. Diamond, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes equally divided on the \nnomination.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Paul Diamond is a distinguished \nPhiladelphia attorney who holds a bachelor's degree from Columbia magna \ncum laude, demonstrating an excellent academic background, a law degree \nfrom the University of Pennsylvania, 2 years experience in the \nPhiladelphia district attorney's office, a law clerk to a supreme court \njudge in Pennsylvania, a partner in a very distinguished law firm, \nObermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel, for more than a decade, and is \ncurrently an adjunct professor at Temple University.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I was tied up in a meeting for the prior \nvote on Judge Stengel. I have the highest respect for the two gentlemen \nand urge the confirmation of Judge Diamond.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nMr. Paul S. Diamond, who has been nominated to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He is a fine \nchoice for the Federal bench.\n  Mr. Diamond received his bachelor of arts degree, magna cum laude, \nfrom Columbia University, and his juris doctor from the University of \nPennsylvania School of Law. Following law school, he spent several \nyears working in the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office as a \nAssistant District Attorney. He then served as a law clerk to the \nHonorable Justice Bruce W. Kauffman of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, \nnow a judge serving on the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. At the conclusion of his clerkship, he \nreturned to the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office.\n  In 1983, Mr. Diamond joined Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish & Kauffman LLP., \nas an associate and in 1986, he was made a partner. Paul S. Diamond is \ncurrently a partner in the venerable Philadelphia law firm of \nObermayer, Rebmann, Maxwell & Hippel LLP., where he practices in the \narea of complex criminal and commercial litigation. He is also \nadministrative partner of the firm's litigation department.\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\n  Since entering private practice, Mr. Diamond has specialized in the \nrepresentation of clients in grand jury related litigation throughout \nthe country. In fact, he authored a comprehensive text and several \narticles on the work of the grand jury. This area of expertise assisted \nhim as he served on the American Bar Association's Grand Jury and \nAmicus Curiae Briefs Subcommittee where he drafted amicus curiae for \nthe American Bar Association on the novel issue of the propriety of \nsubpoenaing criminal defense attorneys.\n  In between his many responsibilities, Mr. Diamond has found the time \nto serve on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's Lawyers' Fund for Client \nSecurity Board. This board helps clients recover some or all losses of \nmoney and/or property stolen from them by their attorneys.\n  Mr. Diamond has also received numerous awards and accolades. I am \nparticularly impressed that Mr. Diamond is listed in Who's Who in the \nWorld, Who's Who in America, Who's Who in American Law and Who's Who \nAmong Emerging Leaders. He also received the ABA's highest rating of \nunanimously well qualified.\n  I applaud President Bush for his nomination of Mr. Diamond and am \nconfident that he will serve on the bench with compassion, integrity \nand fairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the nomination \nof Paul Diamond to be a United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. Mr. Diamond has a unanimous rating of ``well-\nqualified'' from the American Bar Association and significant \nexperience serving as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia \nfor 6 years and serving as a litigator in private practice for over 20 \nyears. He is supported by the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, for \nwhom I have great respect.\n  With the three confirmation votes today, the Senate will now have \nconfirmed 17 judicial nominees this year alone. Seventeen is the total \nnumber of judges who were confirmed under Republican leadership in all \nof 1996. However, in 1996, the first confirmation did not even occur \nuntil July.\n  With these three confirmations today, the Senate will have confirmed \na total of 86 judges this Congress and 186 of this President's judicial \nnominees overall. With 86 judicial confirmations in just a little more \nthan 17 months, the Senate has confirmed more Federal judges than were \nconfirmed during the 2 full years of 1995 and 1996, when Republicans \nfirst controlled the Senate and President Clinton was in the White \nHouse. It also exceeds the 2-year total at the end of the Clinton \nadministration, when Republicans held the Senate. With 186 total \nconfirmations for President Bush, the Senate has confirmed more \nlifetime appointees for this President than were allowed to be \nconfirmed in President Clinton's entire second term, the most recent 4-\nyear presidential term. We have already surpassed the number of \njudicial appointments won by President Reagan in his entire first term \nin office.\n  A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania demonstrates yet \nagain that President Bush's nominees have been treated far better than \nPresident Clinton's and shows dramatically how Democrats have worked in \na bipartisan way to fill vacancies, despite the fact that Republicans \nblocked more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. With \nthis confirmation, 19 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal \ncourts in Pennsylvania will have been confirmed, more than for any \nother State.\n  With this confirmation, President Bush's nominees will make up 19 of \nthe 43 active Federal circuit and district court judges for \nPennsylvania. That is more than 40 percent of the Pennsylvania Federal \nbench. On the Pennsylvania district courts alone, President Bush's \ninfluence is even stronger, as his nominees will now hold 16 of the 35 \nactive seats. In other words, nearly half of the district court seats \nin Pennsylvania will be held by President Bush's appointees. Republican \nappointees will outnumber Democratic appointees by nearly two to one.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were \nleft unfilled during Republican control of the Senate when President \nClinton was in the White House.\n  Republicans denied votes to ten judicial nominees, nine district and \none circuit court nominees of President Clinton in Pennsylvania alone. \nDespite the efforts and diligence of the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, to secure the confirmation of all of the \njudicial nominees from every part of his home State there were 10 \nnominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies who never got a \nvote. Despite records that showed these to be well-qualified nominees, \nmany of their nominations sat pending before the Senate for more than a \nyear without being considered. Such obstruction provided President Bush \nwith a significant opportunity to shape the bench according to his \npartisan and ideological goals.\n  New articles in Pennsylvania have highlighted the way that President \nBush has been able to reshape the Federal bench in Pennsylvania. For \nexample, The Philadelphia Inquirer, observed that the significant \nnumber of vacancies on the Pennsylvania courts ``present Republicans \nwith an opportunity to shape the judicial makeup of the court for years \nto come.''\n  I would note that the Republican leadership has decided to depart \nfrom the order of the executive calendar to confirm Mr. Diamond today \nrather than Juan Ramon Sanchez, a well-qualified Hispanic nominee to \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District in Pennsylvania. That \nis their choice. I do not want to see the Democrats blamed for any \ndelay in confirmation of Mr. Sanchez. I support that nomination and \nbelieve it will be supported by all Democratic Senators.\n  I congratulate Mr. Diamond and his family today on his confirmation.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Paul S.

I will continue to discuss our options with \nthe managers of the bill and hope that we can proceed in a balanced way \nto finish the bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  I send the cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Alabama is recognized to \noffer an amendment on which there will be 10 minutes of debate.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 5 minutes and be notified at the conclusion of the 5 \nminutes, and the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3372, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, for decades, civilian employees of the \nUnited States working overseas were shielded from prosecution for \ncriminal acts that were committed abroad. These persons were outside \nthe scope of military justice, and they were beyond the jurisdiction of \nFederal courts in the United States, and also our State courts. Often, \nforeign countries, when incapable of investigating and prosecuting the \ncases, or they didn't have adequate laws, or they were not even \ncriminal offenses in the foreign country, did not prosecute. Maybe the \nforeign country had no interest in prosecuting a fraud against the \nUnited States.\n  In 1999, one of my constituents approached me with a terrible story \nof how two innocent children were molested while living overseas with \ntheir father, who was an Army service person. Because the perpetrator \nof the crime did the act overseas, he was beyond the scope of \njurisdiction in the United States. Moreover, German law didn't cover \nthis, so the person was completely unprosecutable at that time.\n  After hearing this story, I began to work on and introduce the \nMilitary Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which was signed into law \neventually in the year 2000.\n  It provided U.S. Federal courts with jurisdiction over civilian \nemployees, contractors, and subcontractors affiliated with the \nDepartment of Defense who commit crimes, and would have subjected that \nperson to at least 1 year of prison had the offense occurred in the \nUnited States.\n  We worked with the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, \nand the Department of State and produced legislation which I think was \nvery helpful.\n  Now, in the war on terrorism, the Department of Justice is finding \nthis statute very helpful. In fact, the contractors involved in the Abu \nGhraib prison would probably not be prosecutable had we not passed this \nlaw some time ago.\n  But as we have looked at it, we understand there are some gaps that \nstill exist.\n  Senator Schumer raised this issue in the Judiciary Committee, and I \nbegan to work on dealing with those loopholes.\n  This act will deal with what our previous act dealt with--those who \nwere directly related to the Department of Defense, either contractors \nor civilian employees. But the abuses in Abu Ghraib involved private \ncontractors who may not have in every instance been directly associated \nwith the Department of Defense, and as such, perhaps those people--or \nsome of them at least--might not be prosecutable under this statute. So \nit highlighted our need to clarify and expand the coverage of the act.\n  I offer an amendment today, and I am pleased that Chairman Warner and \nRanking Member Levin have agreed to it. I believe it has been cleared \non both sides and accepted by the managers.\n  This amendment would give the Justice Department authority to \nprosecute civilian contractors employed not only by the Department of \nDefense but by any Federal agency that is supporting the American \nmilitary mission overseas.\n  The number of private contractors working in Iraq is about 10 times \nas great as it was in the Persian Gulf conflict.\n  Private contractors are necessary to rebuilding a healthy Iraq. Yet \nwe cannot allow them to escape justice for crimes they may commit \noverseas.\n  I am not sure right now the Iraqi government has the ability or the \ninterest in prosecuting a contractor who may have defrauded the United \nStates. It clearly remains true that if they are to be prosecuted, it \nneeds to be done here.\n  Our mission overseas is an honorable endeavor. It should not be \ntainted by illegal acts by any, particularly a few, who embarrass our \ncountry. Recent events have brought to light the need to ensure that \nthose acting improperly are held accountable in a court of law.\n  This amendment clarifies existing precedent and leaves no doubt \nwhether wrongdoers can be brought to justice. This includes physical \nacts against personnel by contractors. It also includes frauds that \ncould be committed against the Department of Defense such as \novercharging. Fraudulent activities of any kind could be prosecuted \nunder this act.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New York, who, \nhaving suffered the blows of terrorism firsthand, has taken an interest \nin these matters for some time now. I am delighted to work with the \nSenator on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is an important amendment \nto this bill. It is passing with bipartisan cosponsorship, both the \nHouse and the Senate unanimously. It shows we can get things done in a \nbipartisan way. In good part that is because of my colleague from \nAlabama. I salute him for his leadership on this issue. He originally \ndiscovered the loophole about contractors who work for DOE, that they \ncould not be prosecuted should they commit crimes abroad. He \nsuccessfully passed a law last year about this issue.\n  When we discovered all the problems in the prisons in Iraq, it was \nclear that not all the contractors were contracted to by DOD. Other \nagencies contracted them. It made sense to me that we prosecute them as \nwell. I believe it\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\nmade sense to everybody. So I suggest to my colleague from Alabama that \nwe work together to expand the amendment to include all contractors who \nwork abroad who commit crimes or potential crimes.\n  As usual, we worked very well together on this. I thank the Senator \nfor his leadership in passing the original bill, now law, and now \namending this to broaden it.\n  The amendment Senator Sessions and I are offering today will close a \ndangerous loophole in our criminal law that would have allowed civilian \ncontractors who do the crime to escape doing the time. As I mentioned, \nSenator Sessions closed part of this loophole a few years ago when he \npassed the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act and showed a \ngreat deal of foresight with that legislation.\n  The problem is that aside from Senator Sessions' bill there are \nnegligently few provisions that give DOJ the power to go after civilian \ncontractors. In short, if they do not contract with DOD, there is too \nstrong a likelihood they will escape prosecution. Nothing in this \namendment should be interpreted as undermining ongoing DOJ \ninvestigations or providing a basis for argument that DOJ does not have \njurisdiction to prosecute contractor crimes in Iraq. Title 18, section \n7, of the Criminal Code clearly confers such jurisdiction. This \namendment covers contractors and territory for which title 18, section \n7, does not confer jurisdiction.\n  I am proud to have worked with my colleague from Alabama to get this \ndone. By passing this amendment today, this body gains stature because \nan important amendment is passed in a bipartisan way, and our country \ngains stature because the world sees when a crime is committed, unlike \nin so many other places in America, it is prosecuted.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself and \n     Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 3372, as \n     modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To extend military extraterritorial jurisdiction to cover not \n only personnel and contractor personnel of the Department of Defense, \n but also personnel and contractor personnel of any Federal agency or \n   provisional authority supporting the mission of the Department of \n               Defense overseas, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CONTRACTOR ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\n       Section 3267(1)(A) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(A) employed as--\n       ``(i) a civilian employee of--\n\n       ``(I) the Department of Defense (including a \n     nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department); or\n       ``(II) any other Federal agency, or any provisional \n     authority, to the extent such employment relates to \n     supporting the mission of the Department of Defense overseas;\n\n       ``(ii) a contractor (including a subcontractor at any tier) \n     of--\n\n       ``(I) the Department of Defense (including a \n     nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department); or\n       ``(II) any other Federal agency, or any provisional \n     authority, to the extent such employment relates to \n     supporting the mission of the Department of Defense overseas; \n     or\n\n       ``(iii) an employee of a contractor (or subcontractor at \n     any tier) of--\n\n       ``(I) the Department of Defense (including a \n     nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department); or\n       ``(II) any other Federal agency, or any provisional \n     authority, to the extent such employment relates to \n     supporting the mission of the Department of Defense \n     overseas;''.\n\n     SEC. __. DEFINITION OF UNITED STATES.\n\n       Section 2340(3) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     to read as follows:\n       ``(3) `United States' means the several States of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United \n     States.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 4 years ago, I worked with Senators \nSessions and DeWine to pass the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction \nAct, MEJA, which established Federal jurisdiction over crimes committed \nby civilians employed by, or accompanying, our military overseas. The \nSessions-Schumer amendment further extends the jurisdictional authority \nwe created in MEJA by closing a possible jurisdictional gap that could \nallow persons who commit crimes while accompanying our military \noverseas to escape justice. I support this amendment, and am pleased \nthat the Senate has adopted it today. In addition, I thank the sponsors \nfor accepting my addition to their amendment, which closes a similar \njurisdictional loophole in Federal law.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft referred to this loophole last week, during \nhis annual appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, while \nattempting to defend the Administration's position on torture. \nInterestingly, this loophole was created by legislative language that \nwas proposed by the Department of Justice as a means of broadening, not \nshrinking, Federal criminal jurisdiction. This language, enacted as \npart of the USA PATRIOT Act, redefined the ``special maritime and \nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States'' to include U.S. \nmilitary bases and other U.S. Government properties in foreign States. \nThe administration's summary of its proposal explained that it would \n``extend'' Federal jurisdiction to ensure that crimes committed by or \nagainst U.S. nationals abroad on U.S. Government property did not go \nunpunished.\n  Unfortunately, the administration drafters of this proposal neglected \nto mention to Congress how it would impact on the Federal anti-torture \nstatute. That statute prohibits torture committed ``outside the United \nStates'' by persons acting under color of law, and defines the term \n``United States'' to include the ``special maritime and territorial \njurisdiction of the United States.'' By extending the special maritime \nand territorial jurisdiction of the United States, the PATRIOT Act \neffectively narrowed the reach of the anti-torture statute. Post-\nPATRIOT Act, the anti-torture statute may not allow for the prosecution \nof an individual who commits torture on a U.S. military base outside \nthe United States.\n  My addition to the Sessions-Schumer amendment corrects this problem \nin a simple and straightforward way. It extends the anti-torture \nstatute to apply, without exception, to acts committed outside the 50 \nStates, the District of Columbia, and the commonwealths, territories, \nand possessions of the United States.\n  It may be that we should go further. Arguably, the anti-torture \nstatute should be extended to apply anywhere in the world--both inside \nand outside the United States. I would welcome the views of the \nDepartment of Justice on this question. In the meantime, there are \nother Federal statutes that prohibit violence or excessive force by \nthose acting under color of law within our borders.\n  Torture is one of the most serious crimes imaginable. I can think of \nno reason why the Federal Government should create safe havens for \ntorturers anywhere in the world. To the contrary, we should use every \nmeans available to track them down and bring them to justice. The \nlanguage that I have proposed, and that the Senate has accepted, will \nassist the Justice Department in doing just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3372) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I rise to thank Chairman Warner and Ranking Member \nLevin for their acceptance of a very important amendment last evening \nthat was offered by me along with Senators Smith, Corzine, Kennedy, and \nAkaka to clarify the important role that the Department of Defense \nVaccine Healthcare Centers Network plays in increasing training and \ncompetency in understanding vaccine associated adverse events, their \ndiagnosis, treatment and medical exemption management.\n  My amendment, No. 3392, expands upon the language that originally \ncreated the Vaccine Healthcare Centers, or VHCs, in 2001, to better \nreflect their current function and mission, and recognize the growing \nimportance the Network will play in the future with the recent passage \nof the BioShield Act.\n  As one example, the original language referenced only the anthrax \nvaccine program but the VHCs have played a fundamental role in \ndeveloping and\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\ntesting the DoD Smallpox Vaccine Program with clinical and research \nfollow-up. These functions should be reflected in the authorization of \nthe VHCs and the Bingaman-Smith-Corzine-Kennedy-Akaka amendment does \nthat.\n  Mr. President, Congress created the Vaccine Healthcare Centers, VHC, \nNetwork as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2001, but \nfocused the VHCs on establishing ``a system for monitoring adverse \nevents of members of the armed forces to the anthrax vaccine.''\n  The Vaccine Healthcare Center at Walter Reed Army Medical Center was \ncreated in 2001 to respond to that congressional requirement. \nSubsequently, with the creation of three additional regional centers at \nNaval Medical Center Portsmouth in Virginia, Womack Army Medical Center \nin North Carolina, and Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air \nForce Base in Texas, the VHC Network today provides educational and \nclinical support services that are available to 2.4 million Active Duty \nand Reserve servicemembers and over 6 million family members for all \nimmunizations--not just the anthrax vaccine.\n  The importance of the VHCs to both servicemembers and the military \ncannot be understated. The VHCs, particularly the one at Walter Reed \nArmy Medical Center, has established itself as an unbiased, objective \nsource of clinical vaccine-related information to servicemembers, \nproviders, the military and Congress, which is rather a remarkable \naccomplishment.\n  In fact, there are strong feelings with respect to the anthrax and \nsmallpox vaccines, and it is no secret that I have grave concerns with \nthe military's policies with respect to the mandatory nature of those \nvaccines at this time. However, regardless of how you feel about the \npolicy, few would disagree that the VHCs have provided a strong \nscientific, and unbiased clinical perspective that all sides respect \nand appreciate.\n  As the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, or AFEB, found in a report \nit published on April 14,2004, ``The VHC Network has become an integral \ncomponent of the referral and consultation services available on \nvaccine adverse event issues for the DoD and can play an important role \nin the study and evaluation of cases or clusters of possible rare \nvaccine-induced adverse events.''\n  Furthermore, in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee \non February 25, 2004, Dr. William Winkenwerder, Jr., Assistant \nSecretary for Defense Health Affairs stated, ``And we are delighted to \nsay we now have on-site in the Vaccine Healthcare Center Network, a \nnetwork of specialty clinics to provide the best possible care in rare \nsituations where serious adverse events follow vaccination. In all our \nvaccination efforts, we focus on keeping individual service members \nhealthy, so they can return home safely to their families and loved \nones.\n  Although I do not always agree with Dr. Winkenwerder on force \nprotection policy, I do on the importance of the Vaccine Healthcare \nCenters Network. My amendment with Senators Smith, Corzine, Kennedy, \nand Akaka updates and recognizes the importance of the VHCs to our \nNation's servicemembers.\n  The original stated purpose of the language in 2001 was narrowly \nfocused on the creation of a DoD Center of Excellence treatment faculty \nfocused on providing treatment and follow-up as part of a system of \nmonitoring adverse events of servicemembers for the anthrax vaccine. In \nfulfilling that original mission, DoD found that the VCH Network was \nneeded to improve vaccine safety and efficacy for all vaccines, and not \njust limited to the anthrax vaccine.\n  To achieve this purpose, VHCs provide education, expert consultations \nand problem resolution, medical exemption management, disability \nassessments, and clinical research. These functions are not adequately \nrecognized in the current DoD authorization language and my amendment \nreflects these expanded roles on behalf of our Nation's sevicemembers.\n  In fact, during fiscal year 2003 alone, the VHCs responded to over \n160,000 contacts and provided case management for over 600 complicated \nvaccine-related cases for servicemembers. Moreover, just 4 days ago, \nthe Chicago Tribune reported that a study by a researcher at Walter \nReed Army Medical Center in conjunction with the Vaccine Healthcare \nCenter there has conducted research that indicates ``military personnel \ninoculated against smallpox face a seven to eight times greater risk of \nheart inflammation'' than those who had never been vaccinated.\n  The study finds that, since the smallpox vaccination program was \nresumed in 2002, 615,000 servicemembers have been inoculated and that \nthere have been 77 confirmed or suspected cases of heart inflammation, \nincluding at least one in my state.\n  As exemplified by the myopericarditis issue with smallpox vaccine, \nthe VHCs also provide a place to identify uncommon adverse events and \nhelp provide early recognition and interdiction which drives policy \nchanges in real time to protect the health and well-being of our \nNation's military personnel.\n  Mr. President, vaccines are a prescription drug and, like any \nprescription drug, carry risk and side effects. We, as a Nation, cannot \nask our servicemembers to continue with a vaccination policy and not \nrecognize this critical fact. The VHC Network serves everybody by \nproviding objective clinical education, services, and research into \nthese matters that better inform all parties, including policymakers, \nof both the risk and benefits vaccines carry. Moreover, the Network \nserves to minimize those risks as best as they can.\n  Army Surgeon General, Lt. General James Peake, urged repeatedly in a \nmemorandum dated February 10, 2004, to commanders and regional medical \ncommands that clinicians utilize the VHC Network resources, while \nnoting the ``U.S. Army lost a valuable Soldier, Rachel Lacy, in April \n2003, a month after receiving five vaccinations during mobilization.''\n  Unfortuantely, this critical resource could have been lost or \nseverely limited without the passage of our amendment. That would be \nunacceptable, particularly in light of the high praise from Dr. \nWinkenwerder, Lt. Gen. James Peake and the Armed Forces Epidemiological \nBoard for the critical work VHCs perform. To that end, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks \nthe memorandum from Dr. Peake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. And finally, as the use of passive immune globulin and \nother immune modulators increases, complex interactions and expert \nevaluation of adverse events will be needed more than ever in support \nof both our Nation's servicemembers and to guide both military \nreadiness and homeland defense policy. The VHCs are a critical \ncomponent in that endeavor.\n  So again, I thank the mangers of the bill, Chairman Warner and \nRanking Member Levin, for agreeing to the Bingaman-Smith-Corzine-\nKennedy-Akaka amendment to appropriately reflect and confirm \ncongressional support for the activities undertaken by the VHC Network, \nas their role is critical to the health and well-being of our Nation's \nservicemembers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              (Exhibit 1.)\n\n         Department of the Army, Headquarters, United States Army \n           Medical command,\n                          Fort Sam Houston, TX, February 10, 2004.\n\n          Memorandum for Commanders, Regional Medical Commands\n\n     Subject: Learning from Adverse Events After Vaccination--\n         Action Memorandum.\n\n       1. Immunization is one of the most valuable tools available \n     to keep Soldiers healthy. The overwhelming majority of \n     immunizations are followed by mild symptoms, such as soreness \n     at the injection site; severe adverse reactions are extremely \n     rare. Unfortunately, the U.S. Army lost a valuable Soldier in \n     April 2003, a month after receiving five vaccinations during \n     mobilization. Although the evidence was inconclusive, medical \n     experts determined that vaccination may have contributed to \n     her death (Tab A). Additional information about the case is \n     available at www.vaccines.mil/panelreport.asp.\n       2. Please relay this message to clinicians in your command, \n     noting these key points: Remind vaccinees to seek medical \n     care if they experience medical problems, or they can call \n     the DoD Vaccine Clinical Call Center at 866-210-6469; Remind \n     clinicians to take a vaccination history during patient \n     assessments. Be particularly alert in post-vaccination cases \n     of fever, chest symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, chest pain), or \n     clinical findings such as pleural or pericardial \n     inflammation;\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\n     In conditions not responding to antibiotics, consider the \n     possibility of autoimmune disease and appropriate treatments \n     for such conditions; Seek specialty consultation as \n     clinically appropriate. Consider the unique consultation \n     resources within the Vaccine Healthcare Center (VHC) Network \n     (www.vhcinfo.org, 202-782-0411 (DSN: 662); \n     askVHC@na.amedd.army.mil); Continue to report adverse events \n     after vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting \n     System (VAERS, www.vaers.org); Continue to follow guidelines \n     for managing adverse events after vaccination \n     (www.vaccines.mil/pdf/cpguidelines.pdf). Note there are new \n     guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of \n     myopericarditis after smallpox vaccination; Grant medical \n     exemptions when clinically appropriate. When needed, use \n     consultation services for a second opinion (e.g., Vaccine \n     Healthcare Center Network);\n       3. For more vaccine resources, take advantage of the \n     experts at the Vaccine Healthcare Center Network \n     (www.vhcinfo.org) and the Military Vaccine Agency \n     (www.vaccines.mil).\n       4. My points of contact for this action are COL John \n     Grabenstein at 703-681-5101 and COL Renata Engler at 202-782-\n     0411.\n                                                   James B. Peake,\n                                   Lieutenant General, Commanding.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the Department of \nDefense authorization bill, Senators Warner and Levin, for their \nassistance earlier this week in adopting an important amendment. I \noffered the amendment, now a provision of this bill, to express the \nsense of the Senate concerning programming on American Forces Radio and \nTelevision Service, AFRTS.\n  As my colleagues know, for American service members and their \nfamilies stationed in more than 177 countries and U.S. territories \naround the world, as well as for DOD civilians and their families, \nAFRTS is intended to broadcast a ``touch of home'' by providing \nprogramming that reflects a cross section of what is widely available \nto stateside audiences. According to the AFRTS website, its programming \nis meant to ``represent what is seen and heard in the United States.''\n  I support AFRTS in its mission. Making U.S. entertainment and news \nprogramming available to American service members wherever they are \nlocated is important for their morale and to keep them informed. I \nbelieve the fiscal year 2004 funding level of $47 million for AFRTS is \njustified.\n  Several weeks ago, however, it came to my attention that the \nprogramming on one AFRTS service--its ``uninterrupted voice,'' or talk \nradio, service--has what I consider to be a political bias in its \nsocial and political commentary.\n  For the information of my colleagues, the radio broadcast component \nof AFRTS, which is American Forces Radio, consists of 13 channels, or \n``services.'' Seven of these radio services focus on music, with news \nbriefs at the top of every hour. Two are continuous news information \nservices. One service broadcasts National Public Radio 24 hours a day, \n7 days a week. Two services are continuous sports talk. The final \nservice is what the network calls uninterrupted voice service, or talk \nradio service.\n  Based on conversations between my staff and personnel at AFRTS, I \nbelieve the bias that exists in the social and political commentary \nportions of this talk radio service is not intentional. I commend the \nopenness of American Forces Radio officials in the dialogue we have now \nbegun on this topic. But in my view the bias in this programming is \nreal.\n  Public criticism of American Forces Radio content has focused on the \nfact that Rush Limbaugh's commentary is carried daily on the talk radio \nservice. I generally do not agree with Rush Limbaugh's commentaries. \nBut I do not object to the fact that they are run on a daily basis on \nthis service. Some people do object. However, what I do take issue with \nis the fact that there is no commentary on the service that would even \nbegin to balance the extreme right-wing views that Rush Limbaugh \nroutinely expresses on his program.\n  Critics have specifically cited Rush Limbaugh's use of his show to \ncondone and trivialize the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. guards at \nthe Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. As many of my colleagues know, and as \nhas been pointed out previously here on the Senate floor, Mr. Limbaugh \nreportedly likened the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. guards at Abu \nGhraib to a fraternity initiation. He called some of the abusive \ntactics a ``brilliant maneuver.'' I think the critics are right. \nLimbaugh's remarks--and there are many more offensive remarks by Mr. \nLimbaugh on this topic than I have mentioned here--are repugnant. They \ndo damage to the American image when they are heard around the world. I \nwould guess that Limbaugh's comments on Abu Ghraib also probably offend \na large majority of American service members.\n  Still, I am not calling for American Forces Radio to pull Rush \nLimbaugh's commentaries from their talk radio service. I am asking, and \nI am pleased that the Senate is now on record asking, that AFRTS meet \nits own mandate, as generally articulated in Department of Defense \nRegulation 5120.20R. That regulation calls for AFRTS political \nprogramming that is ``characterized by its fairness and balance,'' as \nwell as news programming guided by a ``principle of fairness'' that \nrequires ``reasonable opportunities for the presentation of conflicting \nviews on important controversial public issues.''\n  Liberals, moderates and independents contribute to funding for \nAmerican Forces Radio through payment of their taxes, just like \nconservatives do. There is no reason that American service members \nshould receive lengthy right-wing commentaries with regularity on \nAmerican Forces Radio's talk service, without some balance from \ncompeting views as part of that same service. For the good of its \nlisteners, and to meet its own mandate, American Forces Radio needs to \nmake a greater effort to give a balanced, fair representation of \nvarying political viewpoints on its talk radio service.\n  In conversations with my staff, individuals at AFRTS have said that \ntheir programming of Rush Limbaugh on the talk service is driven \nstrictly by national ratings here in the States. That was not the \nposition taken by a DOD official on CNN earlier this month, however. \nAccording to news coverage posted on CNN.com, Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense Allison Barber has said that the appropriateness \nof content is a factor in deciding what commentaries are broadcast on \nAmerican Forces Radio.\n  I agree with the Deputy Assistant Secretary's statement. Content is a \nfactor in deciding which commentaries to run on American Forces Radio. \nAt the same time, I also agree with stated AFRTS policy. There should \nbe fairness and balance in political programming on American Forces \nRadio.\n  My amendment in no way prescribes specific content or programming at \nAFRTS. That is not the role of the Senate. What my amendment does do, \nappropriately, is state that it is the sense of the Senate that the \nSecretary of Defense should ensure that AFRTS policies of fairness and \nbalance are being fully implemented. The amendment calls on the \nSecretary to develop appropriate methods of oversight in this regard. I \nlook forward to working with the Department and others to see that \nAFRTS meets these proper goals.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe amendment adopted yesterday to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill that would strengthen Federal hate crime laws.\n  This amendment would strengthen Federal hate crimes law in two \nimportant ways. First, it would remove the requirement that the victim \nbe engaged in a federally protected activity when the crime occurs. \nThis change will make it easier for hate crimes to be prosecuted and \nlocal officials to be assisted when the hate crime is based on race, \nreligion, or national origin. Second, the current statute is expanded \nto cover hate crimes based on gender, sexual orientation, and \ndisability.\n  Since the Federal Bureau of Investigation began to track hate crimes \nin 1991, the incidents of hate crimes based on sexual orientation have \nmore than tripled. If the changes to the Federal hate crimes statute \nincorporated in this amendment are enacted, it will allow the Federal \ngovernment to prosecute these crimes and assist local law enforcement \nofficials in dealing with these violent hate crimes.\n  Any crime hurts our society, but crimes motivated by hate are \nespecially harmful. Many States, including my own State of Vermont, \nhave already passed strong hate crimes laws, and I applaud them in this \nendeavor.\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nAn important principle of the amendment is that it allows for Federal \nprosecution of hate crimes without impeding the rights of States to \nprosecute these same crimes.\n  The adoption of this amendment by the Senate is an important step \nforward in ensuring that the perpetrators of these harmful crimes are \nbrought to justice. The American public knows that Congress should pass \nthis legislation, and I call upon the conferees to retain this \nimportant provision during the conference on this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will ask unanimous consent the resolution relative to \nthe Detroit Pistons victory be introduced in 1 minute, but first I ask \nunanimous consent that I temporarily turn the floor over to Senator \nBiden. Then I will introduce this unanimous consent resolution, Senator \nStabenow will be recognized for 5 minutes, I will be recognized for 5 \nminutes, and then Senator Miller will be recognized for 8 minutes after \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6867-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A TRIBUTE TO BETTY STRONG: THE POLITICS OF DECENCY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nincredible woman. There are a number of benefits that flow, as my \nfriend, the Presiding Officer, knows, even from failed Presidential \nefforts seeking to get the nomination as he and I have both done. We \nmeet some extraordinary people who put their lives on hold for you \nbecause they believe in what you are trying to do. There was such a \nwoman who just passed away in Iowa, in Sioux City. Her name is Betty \nStrong.\n  Theodore Roosevelt said:\n\n       The most practical politics is the politics of decency.\n\n  There was none more practical or more decent than Betty Strong, the \nmatriarch of the Democratic politics of Iowa. She was a wonderful woman \nwhose friendship and memory I will always cherish and whose friendship \nwith her husband I still cherish.\n  Anyone who knows Iowa politics--and I know the Presiding Officer \nknows Iowa politics at least from the Republican side of the effort--\nknows the name Betty Strong. Senator Harkin and I have been reminiscing \nall day with wonderful stories we have about her. Time will not permit \nme to speak to all of these, but she was a master political craftsman. \nShe understood grassroots organizational politics better than anyone. \nShe was a community leader in the best sense of the word. She brought \npeople together around the process and around the issues.\n  She was a woman of uncanny insight and extraordinary good sense, \nbasic honest judgment, and something that seems altogether too uncommon \nthese days: a depth of good will, unmatched by anyone I have met in \npolitics.\n  We can find thousands of examples of strong, tough-minded, powerful \nwomen in our history who have left their mark, big and small, on our \nlives, from Helen Keller to Eleanor Roosevelt. All of them inspired a \nNation. All of them gave us hope. But few have had as much of a \npersonal impact as Betty Strong of Iowa, who just followed her heart, \ngot involved, did what she wanted to do, and did what she believed was \nright for the community.\n  She was tough, strong, and smart. She started in politics in the \nearly 1950s at a time when back rooms were still smoke filled and the \nsound of a woman's voice was a cause for heads to turn. I can only \nimagine that Betty did not hesitate to cut through that smoke and speak \nher mind, even back in the 1950s, and when she did, I imagine she \ncaused those old party bosses to turn their heads on more than one \noccasion. When she spoke, everyone listened. I know I did.\n  Margaret Thatcher said:\n\n       Success is having a flair for the thing that you are doing, \n     and knowing that it is not enough, you have to work hard and \n     have a sense of purpose.\n\n  Betty was a success because she worked as hard as anyone I have ever \nhad the pleasure to work with and she had a powerful sense of purpose. \nShe absolutely loved politics as much as she absolutely loved Iowa. She \nloved the process, and everyone respected her for that.\n  She was a rare woman who had the depth of an abiding commitment to \nthe rough and tumble of organizational door-to-door politics. Boy, did \nshe know how to work a room. You had to see her work. She could read \npeople. She had, as my mother would say, the sixth sense about how to \npersuade and bring people to her side, how to convince them she was \nright. She was, indeed, a very persuasive woman. There was no doubt \nthat when you were with her, you wanted to be on her side.\n  But I don't think winning was Betty's real goal. It was not what \ndrove her. I think she cared deeply about the fact that people need to \nbe engaged and they contribute to making things better, they find a \ncause and take a side, they fight for what is in their heart and their \ngut, and they move the system in the right direction.\n  For Betty Strong, it was community that mattered most. It was the \ndemocratic process she cared about, and she believed that it worked \nbest when you have maximum participation.\n  That is not to say that she did not have a deeply held set of values \nand beliefs that drove her politics; she did.\n  First and foremost, she was a Democrat--a Democrat Democrator, as the \nfolks in Alabama used to say: a Yellow Dog Democrat. She had the hash \nmarks and battle scars of more than 40 years of engagement to prove it.\n  If I had to categorize her politics, I would say she was an old-\nfashioned but practical FDR Democrat, an accomplished activist who \nfought on behalf of organized labor and through the Central Labor \nCouncil for the basic dignity of American workers.\n  I remember how she welcomed my wife Jill and me to her home as she \nwelcomed a host of Democratic candidates over the years. And she did \nnot hesitate to make her opinions known. She did not hesitate to share \nher love and affection with you.\n  But partisanship is not a word I think of when I remember Betty \nStrong. The word I think of is ``democracy.'' To watch her in action \nwas to understand what Teddy Roosevelt meant when he said, ``the \npolitics of decency.'' She was a decent person, as decent as any I have \never met in my public life. She was as engaged as she was engaging, as \nwarm as she was tough, and as wise as she was shrewd.\n  To see her build a coalition, to watch her rally support, was to \nrealize that all she wanted to do was bring the best out in people.\n  I first met her in 1987. I stayed in contact with her over the entire \ntime until her death. She was a friend of mine, a friend of Senator \nHarkin's, and a friend of many of us here.\n  I only wish we had more like her in both parties. You have them in \nyour party, as I have them in mine. And, God, they are beloved. They \nare beloved people. But it seems like the generation is passing of the \npeople who made the commitment she made.\n  She knew all politics was local, but she also knew local politics \nmade up what this Nation is. She was a nation builder. She was a great \nwoman. I miss her. Our sympathies to Darrell and her family.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues for their graciousness. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6867-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6867-S6869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE DETROIT PISTONS ON WINNING THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL \n                        ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStabenow be recognized for her approximately 5-minute statement, and \nthat I then be recognized for my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMichigan.\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Michigan to offer \nthis resolution congratulating the Detroit Pistons for winning the \nNational Basketball Association Championship.\n  What a game, and what a win.\n  In a remarkable display of toughness, talent, tenacity, and old-\nfashioned hard work, the Pistons made history yesterday by winning \ntheir third consecutive home game at the Palace of Auburn Hills to \nclinch their third NBA title.\n  It was the first time in NBA Finals history that the home team won \nthe third, the fourth, and the fifth game at home.\n  The Pistons embody all that I love about the people of Michigan. They \nare a determined, hard-working team that has shown relentless \ndetermination to achieve their goal. The Pistons are a complete team. \nThey sacrifice personal gains for the good of their teammates. And we \nsaw that over and over again last night. They dove for loose balls, and \nthey played great defense.\n  Like the people of Michigan, the Pistons do not seek the limelight \nbut, rather, let their performance on and off the court speak for \nitself.\n  Off the court, the Pistons launched their Read to Achieve Program in \nOctober 2001. I was very pleased to participate in one of their reading \nevents. To date, they have opened four reading and learning centers, \nthe most recent last Monday at the Cornerstone Elementary Linwood \nCampus Library. And they have donated their time to read with over \n4,500 students throughout Michigan.\n  On the court, the Pistons faced many hurdles to win this title. \nFirst, they overcame a grueling regular season schedule to win 54 \ngames. Next, they outlasted three of the toughest teams in the Eastern \nConference playoffs: the Milwaukee Bucks, the New Jersey Nets, and the \nIndiana Pacers to make it to the NBA Finals.\n  In the end, the Pistons prevailed against the storied Los Angeles \nLakers, a franchise with 14 titles to its credit, four future Hall of \nFamers, and a future Hall of Fame coach, Phil Jackson, who has coached \nnine NBA championship teams.\n  Our Pistons beat them all and showed they are the best.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize members of the Pistons \norganization who made this remarkable season possible.\n  Congratulations, first, to Bill Davidson, the Pistons owner, a man \nwho has had a wonderful year. Mr. Davidson, a generous philanthropist \nfor the last 25 years, adds the Pistons' NBA title to the Detroit \nShock's 2003 WNBA championship.\n  I also congratulate the Pistons President of Basketball Operations, \nJoe Dumars. As an NBA player, Joe was one of the driving forces on the \n1989 and 1990 Pistons championship teams, and proved to be equally \nvaluable in the Pistons front office by assembling this terrific team.\n  Next, of course, big congratulations are in order to Larry Brown, the \nfirst coach to win an NBA championship and an NCAA title. The much \ntraveled Hall of Fame coach made his nest in Detroit this year and won \nthis championship by asking his players to play basketball the ``right \nway,'' emphasizing defense, rebounding, and team play. This kind of \nold-fashioned philosophy is the kind of workman-like philosophy we \nvalue in Michigan.\n  Finally, and most importantly, cheers to the guys doing the hard work \non the hardwood. The Pistons starting backcourt of Richard Hamilton and \nFinals MVP Chauncey Billups provided the leadership, scoring, and \ndefense when the team needed it most. Each game, the tandem of Ben \nWallace and Rasheed Wallace erected a virtual wall around the Pistons \nbasket and blocked shots and collected rebounds that were critical to \nthe Pistons' success--and great fun to watch.\n  Joining the Wallaces in the front court was Tayshaun Prince, the \nlong-armed forward who made the highlight-reel block of a layup during \ngame 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals that turned that series around \nand propelled the Pistons to the NBA Finals.\n  Finally, the contributions of the Pistons reserves, known \ncollectively as the ``Alternatorz,'' proved invaluable, as they always \nprovided a spark whenever they were called upon.\n  Mr. President, I attended game 3 of the NBA Finals last Thursday \nevening with my son. It was very exciting, and I can tell you that \nPistons basketball is a beautiful thing to watch. And though this \nDetroit Pistons team is not known for its physical play, as the ``Bad \nBoys'' teams of 1989 and 1990 were, it is known for the intimidating \npresence of the Pistons center and spiritual leader, Ben Wallace.\n  Aside from the Pistons' victory, there was nothing more entertaining \nand fun to watch than seeing the countless Detroit fans at the Palace \nwearing wigs resembling Ben Wallace's hair. Looking forward to next \nyear, I want to pass on a message to the NBA I saw on one fan's sign: \n``Fear the Fro.''\n  Again, congratulations to all the Pistons players, coaches, and staff \nwho made this championship possible. This was truly a magnificent \naccomplishment for fans in Detroit and across the State of Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the Pistons \nplayers and coaches be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I might also say, I look forward to \ncollecting, with my colleague, on the bet that Senator Levin and I won \nfrom our colleagues and friends from California.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n               Detroit Pistons--2004 NBA World Champions\n\n       Players: Chauncey Billups, Elden Campbell, Tremaine \n     Fowlkes, Darvin Ham, Richard Hamilton, Lindsey Hunter, Mike \n     James, Darko Milicic, Mehmet Okur, Tayshaun Prince, Ben \n     Wallace, Rasheed Wallace, Corliss Williamson,\n       Head Coach: Larry Brown\n       Assistant Coach: Herb Brown, Dave Hanners, Igor Kokoskov, \n     John Kuester, Mike Woodson\n       Athletic Trainer: Mike Abdenour\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last night before 22,000 fans, a gritty \nbunch of Detroit Pistons achieved one of the biggest championship \nbasketball upsets in history. In a league that has long emphasized the \nrole of its star players, the Detroit Pistons bring to mind another \nfamous team, the 1980 U.S. Olympic gold medal hockey team, and remind \nus that teamwork, perseverance, desire, and defense win championships.\n  The Detroit Pistons president Joe Dumars and his staff, with the full \nand total support of the owner Bill Davidson, put together a team not \nbuilt around one or two superstars but on the solid play of all of its \nmembers. In their effort to build a team that could advance through the \nplayoffs and win a championship, the Pistons made a midseason trade for \nRasheed Wallace, a talented and multidimensional power forward.\n  In a league where bold season-changing trades are rare, this move \ngave the Pistons a potent front court scoring option and another \nrebounding and shot blocking presence to compliment two-time defensive \nplayer of the year Ben Wallace. Throughout the series the Pistons were \nthe true definition of a team, with each and every Piston contributing \nin some way during their run for the championship.\n  NBA finals MVP Chauncey Billups, who has played for five teams in his \nshort career, looked at home with the Pistons and played a stellar \nseries on both ends of the court. For this year, at least, they could \nhave renamed MVP the MVT for the ``most valuable team,'' because this \nwas truly a team effort. It must have been extremely difficult for the \npeople who selected the MVP to single out just one Piston because they \ntruly were a unit.\n  In Larry Brown, the Pistons had obtained a coach who over the course \nof 31 years of coaching had developed a reputation as a keen student of \nthe game, able to motivate players and respect his players and make \ngametime adjustments with great skill. Focusing his players on his \nfavorite mantra--play the right way--Coach Brown was able to prove that \nby sharing the ball and sharing the glory, even the star-studded Lakers \ncould be defeated. Over the course of the season Coach Brown became the \nfirst coach in basketball history to win both an NBA and NCAA \nchampionship title.\n  The country may have viewed the Pistons as the underdog, but thanks \nto Coach Brown, his players remained hungry for a championship and \nalways believed in their hearts that they were up to the challenge.\n\n[[Page S6869]]\n\n  So our heartiest congratulations to the Detroit Pistons, as the \nplayers, coaches, staff, and fans celebrate their third NBA \nchampionship. The effect of these finals will be felt for a long time.\n  As a Detroiter and proud citizen of Michigan, I know the huge \nimpetus, the wonderful momentum, the great feeling that pervades and \npermeates my home State tonight. Since Detroit is now home to both the \nWNBA and NBA champions, perhaps Detroit, long known as Hockeytown USA, \nwill now be recognized as Hoopstown USA as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble be agreed to \nen bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and \nthat any statements relative to the resolution be printed in the Record \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COLEMAN). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 380) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 380\n\n       Whereas the Detroit Pistons finished second in the Central \n     Division of the Eastern Conference and won the National \n     Basketball Association (NBA) World Championship for the first \n     time since winning back to back Championships in 1989 and \n     1990;\n       Whereas the Detroit Pistons is the first Eastern Conference \n     team to win the Championship since 1998;\n       Whereas the Detroit Pistons by defeating the heavily-\n     favored Los Angeles Lakers 4 games to 1 showed grit, \n     determination, discipline, and unity, thereby securing their \n     third National Basketball Association World Championship;\n       Whereas the Detroit Pistons completed an incredible season \n     with strong performances from many key players, including \n     Finals Most Valuable Player Chauncey Billups, two-time \n     Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace, a new head coach in \n     Larry Brown and savvy front office executives such as Joe \n     Dumars;\n       Whereas Detroit Pistons owner Bill Davidson became the \n     first owner to win an NBA and WNBA championship, as well as \n     the Stanley Cup championship, in the span of 12 months;\n       Whereas President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars built \n     a cohesive championship team through smart draft choices, key \n     free agent signings and bold trades, including the mid-season \n     acquisition of Rasheed Wallace, a vital part of the Pistons' \n     impenetrable frontline;\n       Whereas Detroit Pistons Head Coach Larry Brown, the oldest \n     coach to win an NBA Championship, became the first coach to \n     win both an NBA and NCAA championship;\n        Whereas each member of the Detroit Pistons roster, \n     including Chauncey Billups, Elden Campbell, Tremaine Fowlkes, \n     Darvin Ham, Richard Hamilton, Lindsey Hunter, Mike James, \n     Darko Milicic, Mehmet Okur, Tayshaun Prince, Ben Wallace, \n     Rasheed Wallace, Corliss Williamson, made meaningful \n     contributions to the success of the basketball team and \n     proved once again that the whole can be greater than the sum \n     of its parts;\n       Whereas Detroit Pistons fans made a meaningful contribution \n     to the success of their basketball team through their energy \n     and passion which was on display throughout the regular \n     season and playoffs at the Palace at Auburn Hills;\n       Whereas the Detroit Pistons became the first team in NBA \n     Finals history to win games 3, 4, and 5 on their home court \n     since the NBA returned to its current format in 1985;\n       Whereas in honor of the Detroit Pistons' championship, the \n     Palace of Auburn Hills is officially changing its address to \n     Four Championship Drive; and\n       Whereas the Detroit Pistons have demonstrated great \n     strength, skill, and perseverance during the 2003-2004 season \n     and have made the entire State of Michigan proud: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Detroit Pistons on winning the 2004 \n     National Basketball Association Championship and recognizes \n     all the players, coaches, support staff, and fans who were \n     instrumental in this achievement; and\n       (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the Detroit Pistons for \n     appropriate display.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank our friend from Georgia for his patience as we let \nout our feelings about what happened yesterday in Detroit.\n  Mr. MILLER. Congratulations to the Pistons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized for 8 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6869-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6869-S6870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REMEMBRANCE OF D-DAY\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, D-Day happened when I was 12 years old. \nBut I can remember it better than I can remember some things that \nhappened last week. At that time my mother worked at the old Bell \nBomber Plant in Marietta, GA, helping build B-29s or, as they were \ncalled back then, ``flying fortresses.''\n  Sunday before last, I got to realize a lifelong dream, a visit to \nNormandy. I got to walk around Omaha and Utah beaches. I peered down \nthose steep slopes at Pointe du Hoc. I sat spellbound and misty eyed as \nI listened to the magnificent speech of our President George W. Bush at \nthat Sunday morning ceremony, amid those nearly 10,000 silent crosses \nand Stars of David, a sacred spot in the history of freedom, if ever \nthere was one.\n  I got to talk and meet with many of those members who are left of the \n``greatest generation.'' One sat in front of me at the ceremony with \nhis two, big, good-looking, husky, raw-boned sons, who looked as if \nthey were a couple of acorns that had not fallen too far from that \nsturdy oak. He came in with them a little stooped, moving slowly, an \ninfantryman's blue badge and a Bronze Star proudly attached to his \nshirt. He told me he had come in on the first wave, ``loaded down with \ngrenades,'' and later ``I threw them everywhere,'' he said. Mostly he \nwas quiet, though.\n  When our President began to speak, he almost reverently slightly \nbowed his head, obviously lost in the memory of that longest day long \nago.\n  I sat directly behind him and I couldn't see, but I think his eyes \nwere closed. But he was hearing--no, he was feeling each and every \ntouching word. When our President spoke of ``the whistles of shells \nfrom behind them, the white jets of enemy fire around them,'' on \nseveral occasions, he would nod softly as if saying to himself: That is \nexactly how it was.\n  When the President talked of the sound of bullets hitting the steel \nramps that were about to fall, he softly but visibly shivered in \nagreement and then a more vigorous nod, as his old body stiffened and \nhe was once again that young warrior, that soldier of freedom, charging \nin to face the enemy, ``throwing those grenades everywhere,'' as he had \nput it earlier.\n  His two big sons--strong men, you could tell--were in tears, \nunashamedly taking off their sunglasses and wiping their eyes with the \nback of their hands. They did not have any Kleenex. They were not \nexactly the tissue-carrying kind. I couldn't help but wonder, when was \nthe last time these men had shown such emotion. How long had they \ntalked and planned with their dad on this important moment in his life \nand the life of this country?\n  He told me he lived in Florida now, and I am terribly ashamed I did \nnot get his name. But I was hesitant, I was reluctant. I felt like I \nwas intruding on a family gathering.\n  I did talk with many others. I want to mention 2 whose names I did \nget, 2 who had been among the 100 awarded the prestigious French Legion \nof Honor: Marvin J. Perrett and Alan F. Reeves.\n  Coxswain Perrett is from New Orleans and helped Stephen Ambrose put \ntogether that great D-Day museum located there. By the way, visit it, \nif you have a chance. It is magnificent. This coastguardsman had \nbrought 36 men on to Omaha Beach in a landing craft on the first wave, \nafter piloting them around for hours, around and around on that rough, \nchoppy sea, but with those thick fumes and their own vomit gagging \nthem. Something I had never known before, he also took a landing craft \ninto Iwo Jima in the first wave and later Okinawa. That is what \ncoastguardsmen did.\n  I met Alan F. Reeves who had been part of General Eisenhower's \nSupreme Allied Command at one time and is still active with those \nmembers who are living. He gave me some insight into that great man who \nhad commanded this greatest of all assaults in world history. He was \nfascinating and inspiring to talk with. He shared something else with \nme, a beautiful poem written by his son who once visited the cemetery \nwith his father.\n  I asked Mr. Reeves if I could have a copy of it, and I want to share \nit with the Senate. By Christopher Bromley Reeves of Delaware:\n\n     Le cimetiere de St. Laurent, and all it holds\n     Awaits the sixtieth recollection of why it is.\n     Its rows on rows boxed by Austrian black pines,\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\n     Their fallen cones scattered at the edge\n     Calm, suspended from the world and time\n     It observes the preparations undisturbed.\n     Somewhere near, they'll build a stage\n     For politicians, veterans, other dignitaries.\n     They'll have their say, then wing their way,\n     Adding little, detracting nothing.\n     Fewer seats, more empty chairs,\n     This commemoration.\n     I'd rather wait within the esplanade of trees,\n     Defer the grid of graves behind me,\n     Lift a pine cone from the path,\n     Roll it in my hand,\n     Smell its earth and resin tar,\n     Gaze across the cliff\n     Beyond the beach,\n     Drift the moment,\n     Delay the turn.\n     A weepy rain is in the air,\n     But I can hear the hush press on my back,\n     The quiet murmur of ten thousand\n     Crosses sprung from planted souls,\n     They no longer scream.\n     The gentle yet relentless passage of these sixty years\n     Does not diminish any sacrifice; it has removed the sting.\n     Wounds have eased, their pains appeased.\n     Time deftly folds the space between those lost and left,\n     Eventually to wrap them all in common thought,\n     Collected minds of how this place was wrought\n     Wrap us\n     In the mists creeping up the slopes,\n     Seeping through the burial ground.\n     Make free wind stall, and pine cone fall.\n     Let no shadow touch the mall.\n     The Channel's rough today.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \nexcellent works. Once again, he has shown he is one of the most \neloquent Members of this body, if not the most eloquent. We are going \nto miss him. He still has a lot to do between now and the end of this \nsession, but he has certainly done yeoman's service here. His tribute \nto those soldiers who were there on that special day many years ago is \nvaluable to us all.\n  Mr. President, I had the opportunity to accompany former Senator Phil \nGramm to Pointe du Hoc in Normandy a few years ago. Tears were in his \neyes when he showed us exactly where the Texans went up the hill at \nPointe du Hoc.

Thompson II,\n       Executive Director.\n\n          Notice of Adoption of Amendments to Procedural Rules\n\n\n                         Introductory Statement\n\n       On September 4, 2003, a Notice of Proposed Amendments to \n     the Procedural Rules of the Office of Compliance was \n     published in the Congressional Record at S11110, and H7944. \n     As specified by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (``Act'') at Section 303(b) (2 U.S.C. 1384(b)), a 30 day \n     period for comments from interested parties ensued. In \n     response, the Office received a number of comments regarding \n     the proposed amendments.\n       At the request of a commenter, for good reason shown, the \n     Board of Directors extended the 30 day comment period until \n     October 20, 2003. The extension of the comment period was \n     published in the Congressional Record on October 2, 2003 at \n     H9209 and S12361.\n       On October 15, 2003, an announcement that the Board of \n     Directors intended to hold a hearing on December 2, 2003 \n     regarding the proposed procedural rule amendments was \n     published in the Congressional Record at H9475 and S12599. On \n     November 21, 2003, a Notice of the cancellation of the \n     December 2, 2003 hearing was published in the Congressional \n     Record at S15394 and H12304.\n       On February 26, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance caused a Second Notice of Proposed Amendments \n     to the Procedural Rules to be published in the Congressional \n     Record at H693 and S1671. The Second Notice included changes \n     to the initial proposed amendments, together with a brief \n     discussion of each proposed amendment, and afforded \n     interested parties another opportunity to comment on these \n     proposed amendments. (The Second Notice was also published in \n     the House version of the Congressional Record on February 24, \n     2004. However, because the Senate did not publish the Second \n     Notice on that date, the Second Notice was published on \n     February 26, 2004.)\n       The comment period for the Second Notice of Proposed \n     Amendments to the Procedural Rules ended on March 25, 2004. \n     The Board received a number of additional comments regarding \n     the proposed amendments.\n       The Executive Director and the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance have reviewed all comments received \n     regarding the Notice and the Second Notice, have made certain \n     additional changes to the proposed amendments inter alia in \n     response thereto, and herewith issue the final Amendments to \n     the Procedural Rules as authorized by section 303(b) of the \n     Act, which sates in part: ``Rules shall be considered issued \n     by the Executive Director as of the date on which they are \n     published in the Congressional Record.'' See 2 U.S.C. \n     1383(b).\n       The complete existing Procedural Rules of the Office of \n     Compliance may be found on the Office's web site: \n     www.compliance.gov.\n       Supplementary Information: The Congressional Accountability \n     Act of 1995 (CAA), PL 104-1, was enacted into law on January \n     23, 1995. The CAA applies the rights and protections of 11 \n     federal labor and employment statutes to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the Legislative Branch of \n     Government. Section 301 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381) \n     establishes the Office of Compliance as an independent office \n     within that Branch. Section 303 (2 U.S.C. 1383) directs that \n     the Executive Director, as the Chief Operating Officer of the \n     agency, adopt rules of procedure governing the Office of \n     Compliance, subject to approval by the Board of Directors of \n     the Office of Compliance. The rules of procedure generally \n     establish the process by which alleged violations of the laws \n     made applicable to the Legislative Branch under the CAA will \n     be considered and resolved. The rules include procedures for \n     counseling, mediation, and election between filing an \n     administrative complaint with the Office of Compliance or \n     filing a civil action in U.S. District Court. The rules also \n     include the procedures for processing Occupational Safety and \n     Health investigations and enforcement, as well as the process \n     for the conduct of administrative hearings held as the result \n     of the filing of an administrative complaint under all of the \n     statutes applied by the Act, and for appeals of a decision by \n     a hearing officer to the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance, and for the filing of an appeal of a decision by \n     the Board of Directors to the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Federal Circuit. The rules also contain other matters \n     of general applicability to the dispute resolution process \n     and to the operation of the Office of Compliance.\n       These amendments to the Rules of Procedures are the result \n     of the experience of the Office in processing disputes under \n     the CAA during the period since the original adoption of \n     these rules in 1995.\n\n                       HOW TO READ THE AMENDMENTS\n\n       The text of the amendments shows changes to the preexisting \n     text of the Procedural Rules as follows: [deletions within \n     italicized brackets], and added text in italicized bold. Only \n     subsections of the rules which include amendments are \n     reproduced in this NOTICE. The insertion of a series of small \n     dots (. . . . .) indicates additional, unamended text within \n     a section has not been reproduced in this document. The \n     insertion of a series of stars (* * * * *) indicates that the\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\n     unamended text of entire sections of the Rules have not been \n     reproduced in this document.

When specifically requested by the Executive \n     Director, or by a Hearing Officer in the case of a matter \n     pending before the Hearing Officer, or by the Board of \n     Directors in the case of an appeal to the Board, any document \n     may also be filed by electronic transmittal in a designated \n     format, with receipt confirmed by electronic transmittal in \n     the same format. Requests for counseling under section 2.03, \n     requests for mediation under section 2.04 and complaints \n     under section 5.01 of these rules may also be filed by \n     facsimile (FAX) transmission. . . . .\n       Discussion: The Office is beginning the process or \n     migrating to electronic filing of documents. Because of the \n     limitations in current capabilities, this authorization is \n     optional, and provides for a designation of the format to be \n     utilized. The Rule does not contemplate that a party will be \n     involuntarily required to file electronically. The \n     authorization for such filing must be made by the official(s) \n     before whom the filing is pending.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (d) Service or filing of documents by certified mail, \n     return receipt requested. Whenever these rules permit or \n     require service or filing of documents by certified mail, \n     return receipt requested, such documents may also be served \n     or fled by express mail or other forms of expedited delivery \n     in which proof of date of receipt by the addressee is \n     provided.\n       Discussion: Because of the increase in time required to \n     process mail through the U.S. Postal Service since 9-11, the \n     Office has determined that additional flexibility in the use \n     of comparable document delivery services is needed.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     2.03 Counseling.\n\n       (a) Initiating a Proceeding, Formal Request for Counseling. \n     In order to initiate a proceeding under these rules, an \n     employee shall [formally] file a written request for \n     counseling [from] with the Office regarding an alleged \n     violation of the Act, as referred to in section 2.01(a) \n     above. All [formal] requests for counseling shall be \n     confidential, unless the employee agrees to waive his or her \n     right to confidentiality under section 2.03(e)(2), below.\n       Discussion: Requiring a written request for counseling \n     provides the Office with documentation of the request. Such \n     documents remain confidential, as required by section 416 of \n     the Act, and by the Procedural Rules.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (c) When, How, and Where to Request Counseling. A [formal] \n     request for counseling must be in writing, and [: (1)] shall \n     be [made] filed pursuant to the requirements of section \n     2.03(a) of these Rules with the Office of Compliance at Room \n     LA-200, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999, \n     [telephone 202-724-9250;] FAX 202-426-1913; TDD 202-426-1912, \n     not later than 180 days after the alleged violation bf the \n     Act.[;] [(2) may be made to the Office in person, by \n     telephone, or by written request; (3) shall be directed to: \n     Office of Compliance, Adams Building, Room LA-200, 110 Second \n     Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999; telephone 202-724-\n     9250; FAX 202-426-1913; TDD 202-426-1912.]\n       Discussion: This amendment conforms to the amendment at \n     section 2.03(a).\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (l) Conclusion of the Counseling Period and Notice. The \n     Executive Director shall notify the employee in writing of \n     the end of the counseling period, by certified mail, return \n     receipt requested, or by personal delivery evidenced by a \n     written receipt. The Executive Director, as part of the \n     notification of the end of the counseling period, shall \n     inform the employee of the right and obligation, should the \n     employee choose to pursue his or her claim, to file with the \n     Office a request for mediation within 15 days after receipt \n     by the employee of the notice of the end of the counseling \n     period.\n       Discussion: Because of the increase in time required to \n     process mail through the U.S. Postal Service since 9-11, the \n     Office has determined that additional flexibility of personal \n     delivery is needed, as long as that delivery can be verified.\n       (m) Employees of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol \n     and the Capitol Police.\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\n       (1) Where an employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or of the Capitol Police requests counseling under \n     the Act and these rules, the Executive Director may recommend \n     that the employee use the grievance procedures of the \n     Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police. The term \n     `grievance procedures' refers to internal procedures of the \n     Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police that can \n     provide a resolution of the matter(s) about which counseling \n     was requested. Pursuant to section 401 of the Act and by \n     agreement with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol \n     Police Board, when the Executive Director makes such a \n     recommendation, the following procedures shall apply:\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (ii) After having contacted the Office and having utilized \n     the grievance procedures of the Architect of the Capitol or \n     of the Capitol Police Board, the employee may notify the \n     Office that he or she wishes to return to the procedures \n     under these rules:\n       (A) within [10] 60 days after the expiration of the period \n     recommended by the Executive Director, if the matter has not \n     [been resolved] resulted in a final decision; or\n       (B) within 20 days after service of a final decision \n     resulting from the grievance procedures of the Architect of \n     the Capitol or the Capitol Police Board.\n       (iii) The period during which the matter is pending in the \n     internal grievance procedure shall not count against the time \n     available for counseling or mediation under the Act. If the \n     grievance is resolved to the employee's satisfaction, the \n     employee shall so notify the Office within 20 days after the \n     employee has received service of the final decision resulting \n     from the grievance procedure. [or i] If no request to return \n     to the procedures under these rules is received within [the \n     applicable time period] 60 days after the expiration of the \n     period recommended by the Executive Director, the Office will \n     [consider the case to be closed in its official files] issue \n     a Notice of End of Counseling, as specified in section \n     2.04(i) of these Rules.\n       Discussion: Section 401 of the Act authorizes the Executive \n     Director, ``after receiving a request for counseling . . . \n     [to] recommend that the employee use the grievance procedures \n     of the Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police for \n     resolution of the employee's grievance for a specific period \n     of time, which shall not count against the time available for \n     counseling or mediation.'' The extension of the grace period \n     in the case of a matter which has not been concluded in 60 \n     days provides the parties additional time to complete the \n     grievance process. The issuance of a Notice of End of \n     Counseling rather than the administrative closure of a matter \n     ensures that no employee inadvertently loses the opportunity \n     to continue to pursue a matter, which has not been \n     successfully concluded through the agency grievance \n     procedure. If an employee notifies the Office of a desire to \n     return to the Office dispute resolution procedure pursuant to \n     subsection (ii) above, the time remaining in counseling shall \n     not include any time between the filing of the request for \n     counseling, and the date of issuance by the Executive \n     Director of a recommended referral. Thus, for instance, if \n     the Executive Director recommends referral 5 days after the \n     filing of a Request for Counseling, the time remaining in \n     counseling as of the date the Office receives a notification \n     of return would be 25 days.\n\n     2.04 Mediation.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (e) Duration and Extension.\n       (1) The mediation period shall be 30 days beginning on the \n     date the request for mediation is received, unless the Office \n     grants an extension.\n       (2) The Office may extend the mediation period upon the \n     joint written request of the parties or of the appointed \n     mediator on behalf of the parties to the attention of the \n     Executive Director. The request [may be oral or] shall be \n     written and [shall be noted and] filed with the Office no \n     later than the last day of the mediation period. The request \n     shall set forth the joint nature of the request and the \n     reasons therefor, and specify when the parties expect to \n     conclude their discussions. Request for additional extensions \n     may be made in the same manner. Approval of any extensions \n     shall be within the sole discretion of the Office.\n       Discussion: This amendment authorizes a mediator or both \n     parties to submit a request for extension. The Office will \n     accept joint requests by the parties in which the signature \n     of a party has been authorized to be executed by the other \n     party, as long as that authorization is stated in the \n     submission.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (i) Conclusion of the Mediation Period and Notice. If, at \n     the end of the mediation period, the parties have not \n     resolved the matter that forms the basis of the request for \n     mediation, the Office shall provide the employee, and the \n     employing office, and their representatives, with written \n     notice that the mediation period has concluded. The written \n     notice to the employee will be sent by certified mail, return \n     receipt requested, or will be [hand] personally delivered, \n     evidenced by a written receipt, and it will also notify the \n     employee of his or her right to elect to file a complaint \n     with the Office in accordance with section 405 of the Act and \n     section 5.01 of these rules or to file a civil action \n     pursuant to section 408 of the Act and section 2.06 of these \n     rules.\n       Discussion: Because of the increase in time required to \n     process mail through the U.S. Postal Service since 9-11, the \n     Office has determined that additional flexibility of personal \n     delivery is needed, as long as that delivery can be verified.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     2.06 Filing of Civil Action.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (c) Communication Regarding Civil Actions Filed with \n     District Court. The party filing any civil action with the \n     United States District Court pursuant to sections 404(2) and \n     408 of the Act shall provide a written notice to the Office \n     that the party has filed a civil action, specifying the \n     district court in which the civil action was filed and the \n     case number.\n       Discussion: The Office of Compliance is required by the Act \n     to educate Members of Congress, employing offices, and \n     employees regarding their rights and responsibilities under \n     the Act (section 301(h)); to ensure that an employee has not \n     filed both a District Court and an administrative complaint \n     in violation of section 404; and to monitor any judicial \n     interpretation of the Act or review of Office regulations \n     pursuant to sections 408 and 409. Requiring such notice by a \n     party to a matter which has been processed through counseling \n     and mediation before this agency pursuant to a duly \n     promulgated rule of this agency does not violate any \n     applicable attorney rule of professional conduct.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 5.03 Dismissal, Summary Judgment, and Withdrawal of \n       Complaints.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (d) Summary Judgment. A Hearing Officer may, after notice \n     and an opportunity for the parties to address the question of \n     summary judgment, issue summary judgment on some or all of \n     the complaint.\n       Discussion: This amendment clarifies the existing authority \n     of Hearing Officers to issue summary judgment or partial \n     summary judgment.\n       ([d]e) Appeal. A [dismissal] final decision by the Hearing \n     Officer made under section 5.03(a)-[(c)] (d) or 7.16 of these \n     rules may be subject to appeal before the Board if the \n     aggrieved party files a timely petition for review under \n     section 8.01. A final decision under section 5.03(a)-(d) \n     which does not resolve all of the claims or issues in the \n     case(s) before the Hearing Officer may not be appealed to the \n     Board in advance of a final decision entered under section \n     7.16 of these rules, except as authorized pursuant to section \n     7.13 of these rules.\n       Discussion: This amendment clarifies that any final \n     decision which does not completely dispose of a matter will \n     be treated as an interlocutory appeal.\n       ([e]f) . . . . .\n       ([f]g) . . . . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 7.02 Sanctions.\n\n       (a) The Hearing Officer may impose sanctions on a party's \n     representative necessary to regulate the course of the \n     hearing.\n       Discussion: This rule is procedural. The Office of \n     Compliance is required by section 405(d)(3) of the Act to \n     conduct its hearings ``to the greatest extent practicable, in \n     accordance with the principles and procedures set forth in \n     sections 554 through 557 of [the Administrative Procedure Act \n     found at] title 5, United States Code.'' The phrase \n     ``necessary to regulate the course of the hearing'' is \n     derived from section 556(c)(5) of the Administrative \n     Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 556(c)(5). Agency tribunals operated \n     under the Administrative Procedure Act possess broad \n     authority to regulate the practice and conduct of attorneys \n     and other representatives appearing on behalf of parties to \n     proceedings before them.\n       (b) The Hearing Officer may impose sanctions upon the \n     parties under, but not limited to, the circumstances set \n     forth in this section.\n       ([a]1) Failure to Comply with an Order. When a party fails \n     to comply with an order (including an order for the taking of \n     a deposition, for the production of evidence within the \n     party's control, or for production of witnesses), the Hearing \n     Officer may:\n       ([1]a) . . . . .\n       ([2]b) . . . . .\n       ([3]c) . . . . .\n       ([4]d) . . . . .\n       ([5]e) . . . . .\n       ([6]f) . . . . .\n       ([7]g) . . . . .\n       ([b]2) . . . . .\n       ([c]3) . . . . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 8.01 Appeal to the Board.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (b)(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, within 21 \n     days following the filing of a petition for review to the \n     Board, the appellant shall file and serve a supporting brief \n     in accordance with section 9.01 of these rules. That brief \n     shall identify with particularity those findings or \n     conclusions in the decision and order that are challenged and \n     shall refer specifically to the portions of the record and \n     the provisions of statutes or rules that are alleged to \n     support each assertion made on appeal.\n       (2) Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, within 21 days \n     following the service of the appellant's brief, the opposing \n     party may file and serve a responsive brief. Unless otherwise \n     ordered by the Board, within 10 days following the service of \n     the appellee's responsive brief, the appellant may file and \n     serve a reply brief.\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\n       (3) Upon written delegation by the Board, the Executive \n     Director is authorized to determine any request for \n     extensions of time to file any post petition for review \n     document or-submission with the Board in any case in which \n     the Executive Director has not rendered a determination on \n     the merits. Such delegation shall continue until revoked by \n     the Board.\n       Discussion: This ministerial delegation is not a \n     ``substantive'' rule. The extension of filing deadlines is \n     limited to the parameters of a written authorization from the \n     Board, and cannot affect the requirement of section 406(a) \n     that a party must ``file a petition for review by the Board \n     not later than 30 days after entry of the decision in the \n     records of the Office.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 9.01 Filing, Service and Size Limitations of Motions, \n       Briefs, Responses and other Documents.\n\n       (a) Filing with the Office; Number. One original and three \n     copies of all motions, briefs, responses, and other documents \n     must be filed, whenever required, with the Office or Hearing \n     Officer. However, when a party aggrieved by the decision of a \n     Hearing Officer or a party to any other matter or \n     determination reviewable by the Board files an appeal or \n     other submission with the Board, one original and seven \n     copies of [both] any [appeal brief] submission and any \n     responses must be filed with the Office. The Office[r], \n     Hearing Officer, or Board may also request a party to submit \n     an electronic version of any submission [on a disk] in a \n     designated format, with receipt confirmed by electronic \n     transmittal in the same format.\n       Discussion: The addition of the phrase ``or other matter or \n     determination reviewable by the Board'' references those \n     controversies over which the Board has jurisdiction, but \n     which are not initially determined before a Hearing Officer. \n     These other matters or determinations include collective \n     bargaining representation and negotiability determinations \n     made by the Board pursuant to Part 2422 of the Office of \n     Compliance Rules, review by the Board of arbitration \n     decisions pursuant to Part 2425 of the Rules, determination \n     of bargaining consultation rights under Part 2426 of the \n     Rules, requests for statements of policy or guidance by the \n     Board under Part 2427 of the Rules, enforcement of standards \n     of conduct decisions and orders by the Assistant Secretary of \n     Labor of Labor Management Relations pursuant to Part 2428 of \n     the Rules, and determinations regarding collective bargaining \n     impasses pursuant to Part 2470 of the Rules. Some of these \n     matters are addressed to the Board in the first instance. \n     Submission by electronic version is an option in addition to \n     the existing methods for filing documents. See also amended \n     rule 1.03(a), supra. This addition reflects the decision of \n     this agency to begin migrating toward electronic filing of \n     submissions. Because of the limitations in current \n     capabilities, this authorization is optional, and provides \n     for a designation of the format to be utilized. The Rule does \n     not contemplate that a party will be involuntarily required \n     to file electronically. The authorization for such filing \n     must be made by the official(s) before whom the filing is \n     pending.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 9.03 Attorney's fees and costs.\n\n       (a) Request. No later than 20 days after the entry of a \n     Hearing Officer's decision under section 7.16 or after \n     service of a Board decision by the Office, the complainant, \n     if he or she is a prevailing party, may submit to the Hearing \n     Officer who heard the case initially a motion for the award \n     of reasonable attorney's fees and costs, following the form \n     specified in paragraph (b) below. All motions for attorney's \n     fees and costs shall be submitted to the Hearing Officer. The \n     Hearing Officer, after giving the respondent an opportunity \n     to reply, shall rule on the motion. Decisions regarding \n     attorney's fees and costs are collateral and do not affect \n     the finality or appealability of a final decision issued by \n     the Hearing Officer. A ruling on a motion for attorney's fees \n     and costs may be appealed together with the final decision of \n     the Hearing Officer. If the motion for attorney's fees is \n     ruled on after the final decision has been issued by the \n     Hearing Officer, the ruling may be appealed in the same \n     manner as a final decision, pursuant to section 8.01 of these \n     Rules.\n       Discussion: This amendment clarifies the rules to exclude \n     the filing of motions for attorney's fees with the Board of \n     Directors.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 9.05 Informal Resolutions and Settlement Agreements\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (b) Formal Settlement Agreement. The parties may agree \n     formally to settle all or part of a disputed matter in \n     accordance with section 414 of the Act. In that event, the \n     agreement shall be in writing and submitted to the Executive \n     Director for review and approval. If the Executive Director \n     does not approve the settlement, such disapproval shall be in \n     writing, shall set forth the grounds therefor, and shall \n     render the settlement ineffective.\n       (c) Requirements for a Formal Settlement Agreement. A \n     formal settlement agreement requires the signature of all \n     parties or their designated representatives on the agreement \n     document before the agreement can be submitted to the \n     Executive Director. A formal settlement agreement cannot be \n     rescinded after the signatures of all parties have been \n     affixed to the agreement, unless by written revocation of the \n     agreement voluntarily signed by all parties, or as otherwise \n     permitted by law.\n       (d) Violation of a Formal Settlement Agreement. If a party \n     should allege that a formal settlement agreement has been \n     violated, the issue shall be determined by reference to the \n     formal dispute resolution procedures of the agreement. If the \n     particular formal settlement agreement does not have a \n     stipulated method for dispute resolution of an alleged \n     violation of the agreement, the following dispute resolution \n     procedure shall be deemed to be apart of each formal \n     settlement agreement approved by the Executive Director \n     pursuant to section 414 of the Act. Any complaint regarding a \n     violation of a formal settlement agreement may be filed with \n     the Executive Director no later than 60 days after the party \n     to the agreement becomes aware of the alleged violation. Such \n     complaints may be referred by the Executive Director to a \n     Hearing Officer for a final decision. The procedures for \n     hearing and determining such complaints shall be governed by \n     subparts F, G, and H of these rules.\n       Discussion: The Act empowers the Executive Director to \n     exercise final approval over any settlement agreement. \n     Otherwise, no settlement agreement shall ``become \n     effective.'' See 2 U.S.C. 1414. This procedural rule provides \n     a dispute resolution procedure which is designed to preserve \n     the confidentiality of any settlement agreement to the \n     maximum extent possible, should the parties not include \n     another dispute resolution mechanism in the settlement \n     agreement which is approved by the Executive Director.\n     Sec. 9.06 Payments required pursuant to Decisions, Awards, or \n     Settlements under section 415(a) of the Act. Whenever a \n     decision or award pursuant to sections 4050, 406(e), 407, or \n     408 of the Act, or an approved settlement pursuant to section \n     414 of the Act, require the payment of funds pursuant to \n     section 415(a) of the Act, the decision, award, or settlement \n     shall be submitted to the Executive Director to be processed \n     by the Office for requisition from the account of the Office \n     of Compliance in the Department of the Treasury, and payment.\n       Discussion: This rule memorializes existing practices \n     authorized under section 415(a) of the Act.\n\n     Sec. 9.07 Revocation, Amendment or Waiver of Rules. \n\n. . . . .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6873-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6873-S6874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATING RAE ANN RED OWL OF PINE RIDGE, SOUTH DAKOTA ON HER \n                       MASTER'S DEGREE IN NURSING\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as my colleagues will attest, I routinely \ncome to the Senate floor to discuss the numerous challenges facing \nNative Americans in my state, and across Indian Country. While I've \nspoken at length about the need to address Indian education, Indian \nhealth care, and economic development on Indian reservations, I am here \ntoday for a different reason: to congratulate one of my constituents on \nan extraordinary accomplishment.\n  Earlier this month, Rae Ann Red Owl of the Pine Ridge Reservation \nbecame the first Lakota person, man or woman, to receive a master's \ndegree from the nursing program at the University of North Dakota. More \nthan that, when she walked across the stage, she became the first woman \never from Pine Ridge to earn a master's degree in nursing.\n  While earning a master's degree is a remarkable achievement, for Rae \nAnn, this step represents yet another obstacle overcome in a long life \nof beating the odds. Rae Ann can trace her desire to attend college all \nthe way back to when she was in fifth grade and had to get a ride to \nschool with her grandfather because she had overslept and missed the \nschool bus. As her grandfather drove her to school, he told her, \n``education is the most important thing in life.'' That advice made her \ndecide right then and there that she wanted to attend college.\n  Unfortunately, fulfilling dreams like this one is easier said than \ndone in Indian Country. Rae Ann grew up on Pine Ridge, one of the \npoorest Indian reservations in the country. In a community where rates \nof alcohol and drug abuse are well above the national averages, Rae Ann \nwas not immune to such pressures. But, instead of succumbing to these \nproblems, she defeated them, and set a new course for her life.\n  Rae Ann applied for, and was accepted to, the Indians Into Medicine \nProgram at the University of North Dakota. As she set out to pursue her \ndream, she found herself away from her home and her family for the \nfirst time, all the while caring for her two young daughters. In 1989, \nafter years of studying, she graduated with a nursing degree, returned \nto Pine Ridge, and landed a job working for the Indian Health Service. \nTwelve years later, she realized that, with additional training, she \ncould do even more to improve the quality of life on Pine Ridge--\nespecially at the IHS--and returned to the\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\nUniversity of North Dakota in 2002. Last month, Rae Ann received her \nmaster's degree in nursing. After hearing about all of Rae Ann's \naccomplishments, and about the adversity she's overcome, it will come \nas no surprise to my colleagues that she plans to continue her \neducation by enrolling in law school this fall.\n  When so many stories exist about the tremendous obstacles Native \nAmericans face--in getting an education, gaining access to health care, \nand improving their quality of life--it is important for all of us to \nrecognize success stories like Rae Ann's. Not only is Rae Ann a role \nmodel for her tribe, she is an example for all people who face \nadversity as they strive to fulfill their dreams. I would like to \nextend my personal congratulations on her recent achievement, and wish \nher the best of luck in all her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6874-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        U.S. AID AND TERRORISTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a very brief moment to \nspeak to an article entitled ``U.S. Aid Goes to Terrorism Backers'' \nthat appeared in today's edition of the Washington Times.\n  The allegation that American foreign assistance dollars in the West \nBank and Gaza are going to Palestinian groups ``working with or \nfostering terrorist-supporting organizations'' is a serious one. The \nUnited States Agency for International Development, USAID, and the U.S. \nDepartment of State must immediately clarify these troubling reports, \nand I urge them to do so in an expeditious and public manner.\n  My colleagues should note that we already require the Secretary of \nState to ensure that no assistance for the West Bank and Gaza goes to, \nor through, individuals or entities ``the Secretary knows or has reason \nto believe advocates, plans, sponsors, engages in, or has engaged in, \nterrorist activities.''\n  I will have more to say on this issue once USAID and the State \nDepartment clarify this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6874-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In January 2000, a gay Mississippi man, was murdered by Brett David \nKabat. Tolbert was kidnapped from a Biloxi gay bar and brutally \nstrangling him and beating him to death before dumping his body in \nAlabama and stealing his truck. Because his friends say Tolbert was \ngay, was last seen at a gay bar, and the nature of his murder was \nparticularly brutal, it is believed that Tolbert was targeted because \nhe was gay. When Tolbert's body was discovered, he was beaten beyond \nrecognition with just a few teeth left in his mouth.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6874-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6874-S6876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WORLD DAY AGAINST CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is with a sense of sorrow that I rise \ntoday to speak about the practice of abusive and exploitative child \nlabor, as well as to recognize World Day against Child Labor, which \noccurred on June 12. Unfortunately, hundreds of millions of children \nare still forced to work illegally for little or no pay. The \nInternational Labor Organization has set aside this day to give a voice \nto these helpless children who toil away in hazardous conditions.\n  We should not only think about these children on June 12. We should \nthink about this last vestige of slavery every day. I have remained \nsteadfast in my commitment to eliminate abusive and exploitative child \nlabor. It was in 1992 that I first introduced a bill to ban all \nproducts made by abusive and exploitative child labor from entering the \nU.S.\n  Since I introduced that bill, we have made some progress in raising \nawareness about this scourge. In June of 1999, ILO Convention 182, \nconcerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of \nthe Worst Forms of Child Labor, was adopted unanimously in the ILO and \nhere in the U.S. Senate. This was the first time ever that an ILO \nconvention was approved without one dissenting vote. In record time the \nSenate ratified ILO Convention 2 with a bipartisan, 96-0 vote.\n  For the first time in history the world spoke with one voice in \nopposition to abusive and exploitative child labor. Countries from \nacross the political, economic, and religious spectrum--from Jewish to \nMuslim, from Buddhists to Christians--came together to proclaim \nunequivocally that abusive and exploitative child labor is a practice \nwhich will not be tolerated and must be abolished.\n  Gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is an \nacceptable practice because of a country's economic circumstances. Gone \nis the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is acceptable \nbecause of cultural tradition. And gone is the argument that abusive \nand exploitative child labor is a necessary evil on the road to \neconomic development. When this convention was approved, the United \nStates and the international community as a whole laid those arguments \nto rest and laid the groundwork to begin the process of ending the \nscourge of abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  As of today, 50 countries have ratified ILO Convention 182. In fact, \nsince the ILO was established in 1919, never has one of it treaties \nbeen ratified so quickly by so many national governments.\n  In May of 2000, the Senate enacted the Trade and Development Act of \n2000. This act included a provision I authored that requires more than \n100 nations that enjoy duty-free access to the American marketplace to \nimplement their legal commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child \nlabor in order to keep these trade privileges.\n  In 2001, Congressman Engel and I, along with the chocolate industry, \nnegotiated the Harkin-Engel Protocol. This plan addresses abusive and \nexploitative child labor within the cocoa and chocolate producing \ncountries of West Africa. This agreement will for the first time make \npossible the ability to publicly certify that cocoa used in chocolate \nor related products has been grown and processed without abusive child \nlabor. This historic agreement represents a true partnership between \nindustry and government to stamp out abusive and exploitative child \nlabor.\n  In an effort to continue to raise awareness, last month the first \nChildren's World Congress about Child Labor was held in Florence, \nItaly. The Congress was organized by the Global March and my good \nfriend Kailash Satayarthi. At this conference child delegates from all \nacross the world joined with the common purpose of discussing and \nraising awareness about the atrocities of abusive child labor. I would \nlike to commend Kendra Halter, one of my constituents, from Iowa City, \nwho was selected to participate as a U.S. delegate to the Congress.\n  The child delegates participated in workshops and were allowed to \nquestion foreign leaders and government officials from various \ncountries to include the United States. The Congress produced a \ndeclaration that stressed the need for governments to take direct \naction combating this issue by providing free quality education. The \ndeclaration also calls for parents and youth of all countries to get \ninvolved in the spreading of awareness of this scourge.\n  In spite of all of these successes there is much more to be done. \nCurrently, according to the ILO, there are 246 million child laborers \nin the world. 73 million of those are under the age of 10, and \napproximately 22 thousand children die in work related accidents every \nyear. Abusive and exploitative child labor is prevalent in many parts \nof the world, including in our backyard.\n  In the June 10 edition of the Washington Post, the issue of abusive \nchild labor once again made the headlines. The article brings to light \nthe troubled life of a child aged 14 and his family as they labor \ndangerously in the sugar\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\ncane fields of El Salvador. The young boy has been working in the \nfields for more than half of his life. His four brothers and sisters \nare also forced to work with him, his youngest brother is nine. Their \ntiny bodies are gashed by machetes and burned by hazardous fertilizers. \nThese children and hundreds more are denied an education and in turn \nwill be destined to a life of poverty. This is not what should be \nhappening in the 21st century.\n  In fact, the Bush administration has recently finished negotiating a \nsubregional free trade agreement with the Central American countries. \nEl Salvador is one of six countries participating in the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement or CAFTA. In my view, we should not be \nnegotiating free trade agreements with countries that do not enforce \ntheir own labor laws and international standards. Not only is it my \nview but it is U.S. law.\n  Abusive and exploitative child labor should be a thing of the past. \nThe United States should not continue to turn a blind eye to this \nscourge. It is time that we enforce our laws and international \nstandards and ensure that countries are raising their standards on this \nissue. If we did our part to ensure that children were learning and not \nlaboring, there would not be a need to have a day dedicated to end \nchild labor.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record declaration to which I \nreferred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Children's Declaration\n\n\n       Children's World Congress on Child Labour--10-13 May 2004\n\n       We are the Present, Our Voice Is the Future!\n       We, the delegates of the Children's World Congress on Child \n     Labour, have come to the city of Florence, Italy, from all \n     different parts of the world, speaking different languages, \n     growing up with different cultures and backgrounds, because \n     we all know that child labour must be eliminated.\n       Although our Congress has been successful, we are missing \n     some of our important delegates. These children were already \n     selected to participate in the Congress. But, these children \n     did not get visas necessary to come to Italy because the \n     Italian government thought them as a security risk. These \n     children who were not allowed to attend, felt very \n     discriminated. We all missed their ideas at the Congress, \n     because these children are from the regions where child \n     labour is most common. At the next Congress, we would like to \n     see them participate because their voice is their vision and \n     the world must hear it.\n       Each country had a different selection process to choose \n     the delegates. All children who participated in the selection \n     process had either faced child labour in their own experience \n     or had learned about it and joined the fight against child \n     labour. With the passion and desire to solve this terrible \n     crime against 246 million children around the world, we were \n     all qualified to take part in this Congress. This is why the \n     discussions for the last 3 days have been very fruitful.\n       What follows in our Declaration is the responsibility, of \n     all including the business sector and others who hold the \n     power to help us in our struggle.\n       Before we even start to discuss about child labour, we must \n     appreciate that the only way the children can have their \n     rights is in the situation of peace. Peace is the most basic \n     human right. We have to ask ourselves why everyone is not \n     able to have something so fundamental. While living in peace, \n     every child has not only a better chance of getting their \n     rights, but also has a stronger potential to improve the \n     world for their generations and those to come.\n       When we started discussing about child labour, we found \n     that many issues were common to all different parts of the \n     world. We heard personal stories from the children about; \n     child trafficking, sexual exploitation, working on fishing \n     boats, cleaning cars, selling things on street or in market, \n     pornography, collecting garbage, transportation and shipping, \n     brick making and demolishing, the making of medical utensils \n     and other dangerous materials, drug trafficking, domestic \n     servants, bounded labourers, farming, mining, weaving \n     carpets, child soldiers, working in factories and sweatshops. \n     These children are misused everyday and have no one to speak \n     for them.\n       While most people and governments are aware these problems \n     exist, they are hidden or just ignored. This does not change \n     the fact they all are very dangerous to the physical and \n     mental well being of a child. These forms of child labour \n     must be stopped.\n       Most of the children have expressed that they are losing \n     faith in the governments because of their empty promises. \n     They have made many promises to end child labour through \n     education and better social services. But they do not act. \n     Their promises are not met with real commitment or resources.\n       While the governments put an enormous amount of money to \n     weapons and war, there are still children who cannot read or \n     write. They have no homes to live in or food to eat. The \n     government must take the needs of children as a priority. \n     They must provide all that is necessary to live while still \n     protecting our rights.\n       As it is a responsibility of governments to protect our \n     rights, end child labour, and provide free, equal education \n     or good quality, we have many demands for the governments. \n     When we speak about the governments, we talk not only about \n     the role of national governments but also other governmental \n     bodies at international and regional levels that are \n     responsible for protecting our rights.\n       First and most importantly, governments must listen to \n     children. The governments make the issues of the children a \n     priority and include the children in the decision-making that \n     affects our lives. Governments must also provide \n     opportunities for children to participate and express their \n     opinions because they are the future as well as the present \n     and their opinion should be valued\n       Governments must criminalise child labour but should never \n     criminalise the children. The children are victims of child \n     labour. They must create and carry out laws that strictly \n     punish the adults who have abused children for their own \n     interest. Governments must support the children if they want \n     to bring the cases of them being used as child labourers to \n     court, by providing a free attorney. Children should be able \n     to turn in the people who have abused them without fear of \n     getting trouble. Instead, these children should be rescued \n     and rehabilitated.\n       Governments must fight against trafficking of children. \n     They must enforce the laws they already have. But today's \n     laws may not be enough so they must make more effective ones. \n     The governments in countries where trafficking happens must \n     work together to have laws which can criminalise the \n     traffickers.\n       Governments must provide compulsory education of quality at \n     free of cost. Schools must provide skilled teachers who are \n     qualified. There should be a mechanism to check that the \n     teachers are doing their job well and these laws to provide \n     education for all children are enforced. The teachers must \n     get paid better. Education must also be provided equally to \n     all children regardless of gender, race, economic status, \n     religion, places of birth, citizenships, caste, disability, \n     indigenousness or languages.\n       Every country has to make sure the issue of child labour is \n     taught in every school.\n       Governments should encourage adults to work. Adults should \n     work so they have enough money not to put their children to \n     work. The rights of adults as workers have to be respected. \n     Adult workers always have to be allowed to unionise in their \n     workplace, because the union can help protect them from \n     dangerous working conditions and provide them the minimum \n     wage. It is important that adults are protected as workers so \n     that the children do not have to work.\n       Governments must establish a National Plan of Action to end \n     child labour. These plans should be made together with \n     children.\n       Governments must make sure that overseas development aid \n     (ODA) goes directly to its purpose and does not end up in the \n     wrong hands.\n       Governments must make a system to put some trademarks for \n     the products that are not made by child labourers.\n       Governments, not only should they work with other \n     governments, they should also work with civil society and \n     trade unions to be at most effective. In return, the civil \n     society must understand the demands of the children and work \n     together with us to watch them closely so that the \n     governments will not fail us again. NGOs also have to use the \n     resources that they have honestly and directly for the \n     children.\n       It is also parents' responsibility to listen to children.\n       The children need love, respect and dignity. It is in the \n     hands of parents to provide with happy and stable family \n     life. Parents must take their responsibility and vote. When \n     they vote, they must also speak for the children and vote for \n     someone who respects child rights. If the parents are not \n     acting in the best interest of the child, the state must act \n     on the child's behalf. Parents must talk about issues such as \n     child sexual exploitation or abuse even when they are not \n     comfortable because this is the only way a child will know \n     his or her natural rights of safety and security. Parents \n     must understand the importance of a proper education no \n     matter of the gender of the child.\n       Having identified the current situation of child labour and \n     our demands to the adults, we now show our commitment and the \n     role in ending child labour.\n       We, the children, have to start initiatives to spread \n     awareness about child labour in our own local communities and \n     villages. We must educate each other about child labour, from \n     a child to a child to promote child participation.\n       We must work at national level and establish a Children's \n     Parliament, in every country, that is not just a symbol but a \n     source of power for children to change the situations that we \n     think are wrong. This Parliament would elect a representative \n     to the country's government. These representatives would also \n     meet at a congress at regional and at international to look \n     at the problems at a larger scale, and report back to their \n     governments and local communities.\n       We have to start a network of children so that we can keep \n     contact with each other to\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\n     be educated on the issue all over the world. Only while \n     working together, we can have the power to take action and to \n     end child labour. This network will be made up of children \n     from all over the world, and it will spread the stories of \n     child labour and opinions. The network will help us plan more \n     effective actions in our struggle against child labour. The \n     network will also be a medium to report on the governments' \n     failing or not failing their promises among the children of \n     the world.\n       We believe that the use of art, dance, music and drama as a \n     form of expression and means to spread awareness about child \n     labour is very important. These are ways in which children \n     from any background can connect with, understand and enjoy. \n     There are many ways to spread the message against child \n     labour, beyond boarders, through performing art.\n       We must also use media to spread our voices. We would \n     create our own form of media, such as newspaper developed by \n     the children for the children, for us to freely express our \n     opinion. Media also must be more friendly and tell the truth \n     about child labour and help us combat child labour.\n       We have to bring the efforts to end child labour out to the \n     villages, where the fight is not as strong. Information about \n     child labour sometimes only reaches cities and people in the \n     villages do not have information about the dangers of child \n     labour. We must get them involved.\n       We promise to continue to take action to eliminate child \n     labour and make a better world for children. Now, we ask all \n     of you to join us, because only together can we truly achieve \n     freedom for all. In this friendship, we will create a healthy \n     and peaceful world for all.\n       Today, the power is in our hands. We define the future.\n       We are the present and our voice is the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6876-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6876-S6877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ENERGY BILLS UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I express my serious concern \nwith several pieces of so-called energy legislation that the House of \nRepresentatives is considering this week. This package of bills \nincludes a comprehensive energy bill that differs both from the failed \nconference report on H.R. 6 and from the Senate energy bill that was \nintroduced on February 12, 2004, and placed directly on the calendar.\n  These bills are not the product of hearings or of bipartisan \nconsensus between the House and the Senate. The comprehensive energy \nbill the House is considering is nearly identical to the energy bill \nconference report we have already defeated. The other bills are equally \ntroubling. They trample States rights and they enact significant new \ntaxpayer subsidies. Most importantly, they are not the right energy \npolicy for America.\n  I have for many months now said that we should try to reach consensus \non targeted pieces of energy legislation. We could pass legislation on \nissues such as the increased production of renewable motor fuels. We \ncould enact fiscally responsible extensions of needed energy tax \nprovisions, such as the wind energy tax credit. National electricity \nreliability standards are another area in which Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Feingold and I believe there could be agreement and we could \npass a bill. I also believe there are a number of energy efficiency \nmeasures that could garner broad support.\n  But, there should be no agreement on the poor environmental policy \nthat is contained in these bills. The Senate should reject them if they \nare passed and sent over for consideration.\n  The omnibus bill the House passed yesterday, H.R. 4503, is identical \nto the failed conference report on H.R. 6, except for the inclusion of \ntwo coal-related provisions that are in the pending Senate bill, S. \n2095.\n  As with the energy bill conference report, nearly a hundred sections \nof the bill are in the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. We were not consulted on any of these sections, the House \nhas made no effort to fix these provisions, and I have repeatedly \nraised concerns about them on the Senate floor.\n  The waiver of liability for MTBE producers is included in the House's \nbill. The Senate has repeatedly rejected this provision.\n  The House bill unravels the ozone designation process in the Clean \nAir Act by delaying compliance with the national health-based air \nquality ozone standards until the air in the dirtiest city is cleaned \nup. The House insists on this leftover from the failed energy bill \nconference report, though changing cities' ozone compliance deadlines \nunder the Clean Air Act doesn't increase our Nation's energy supplies.\n  This bill also provides unprecedented relief for a single region of \nthe country from application of the entire Clean Air Act, without a \nhearing.\n  The House continues to insist that oil and gas exploration and \nproduction activities be exempted from the Clean Water Act stormwater \nprogram.\n  The Clean Water Act requires permits for stormwater discharges \nassociated with construction activity. The amendment changes the act to \nprovide a special exemption for oil and gas construction activities \nfrom stormwater pollution control requirements.\n  The scope of the provision is extremely broad. Stormwater runoff \ntypically contains pollutants such as oil and grease, chemicals, \nnutrients, metals, bacteria, and particulates.\n  I have told colleagues this before, but EPA estimates that this \nchange would exempt at least 30,000 small oil and gas sites from clean \nwater requirements. In addition, every construction site in the oil and \ngas industry larger than 5 acres would be exempt as well.\n  The large sites have held permits for 10 years or more. That is a \nterrible rollback of current law. I want Senators to imagine trying to \nexplain to constituents why an oil drilling site that had to comply \nwith the Clean Water Act for 10 years suddenly no longer needs to do \nso.\n  The House is scheduled to act today on another bill, H.R. 4517, \ncalled the United States Refinery Revitalization Act of 2004. It gives \nthe Department of Energy a lead role in environmental permitting \ndecisions for refineries in a newly designated ``refinery \nrevitalization'' zone. The Energy Department would get the ability to \nissue permits and make ``federal authorization decisions'' under our \nmajor environmental laws including: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water \nAct, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the National Environmental Policy \nAct, and our national solid and hazardous waste laws, among others.\n  The Energy Department would get to make environmental regulatory \ndecisions and set compliance deadlines. This is a classic case of the \nfox guarding the hen house. Moreover, if a permit is denied , there \nwould only be an appeal to the DOE Secretary and then judicial review \nin the D.C. Circuit Court. The EPA, which normally makes these \ndecisions, has no role at all.\n  In an effort to assure Members, there is a savings clause in the bill \nthat is supposed to protect environmental laws. The bill includes \nlanguage that contradicts the savings clause provisions. It states that \nif the best available pollution control technology is used at a \nfacility then that facility is in compliance with all environmental \npermitting requirements. In addition, the role of states is not clear, \nparticularly those with more stringent standards.\n  While this bill proposes to increase our domestic refining capacity, \nit will not do so. In fact, it is drafted in a way that will likely \nreduce our supplies of gasoline and heating oil.\n  The bill is supposed to restart idled refineries. It defines ``idle \nrefineries'' as those that have shut down after June 1, 2004. Let me \nsay that again for my colleagues, idle refineries are refineries that \nshut down after June 1, 2004. These are not refineries that have been \nmothballed and shut down for many years. These so-called idle \nrefineries could be operating now and then shut down after enactment of \nthe bill in order to game the system. The refineries would seek \nregulatory relief under a newer, inexperienced regulatory agency, and \ndrive prices even higher by further constraining production. This is a \ntragic outcome, and certainly not one that expands our Nation's \nrefining capacity.\n  The House passed another bill yesterday, H.R. 4513, that exempts \nFederal agencies planning renewable energy projects from the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. Federal agencies would no longer have to \nidentify alternative project locations when they site a renewable \nenergy project. They also would no longer have to examine alternatives \nto the project other than the actions they propose to take, or the \noption of doing nothing at all. Like the\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\nrefinery bill, this bill has bad consequences. While the bill seeks to \nspeed up renewable energy projects, it is really a way to trample over \nFederal environmental laws or State and local requirements. For \nexample, a city's objections to a windmill or solar panels proposed for \nthe top of a downtown federal building may not have to be resolved or \nalternatives considered, even if there are local scenic concerns or \nconflicts with zoning ordinances. In a regular NEPA process, discussion \ncould resolve those concerns and produce a project that meets both \nFederal and local needs. We should be reaching agreement over the \ndevelopment of renewable energy, not creating conflicts.\n  Also today, the House will take up H.R. 4545, the Gasoline Price \nReduction Act of 2004, a bill that proposes to increase gasoline \nsupplies by capping the number of so-called boutique fuel blends. This \nbill is not likely to have a beneficial effect in terms of reducing \ngasoline prices or increasing supplies, and appears designed to \nsignificantly worsen air quality. It allows EPA open-ended authority to \nwaive cleaner-burning gasoline or diesel requirements indefinitely \nbased on an undefined ``significant fuel supply disruption.'' In \naddition, EPA's determination appears not to be judicially reviewable, \nsince the EPA Administrator need only deem a waiver ``necessary.'' \nFurther there is no obligation to mitigate or make up for the excess \nair pollution that may occur over the waiver period.\n  This bill also would bar any increase in the number of existing fuels \nand fuel additives. This would apply to any State-adopted ultra-low \nsulfur diesel, biodiesel or cleaner-burning gasoline programs, even \nthough these programs do not affect gasoline prices or supply, and \nregardless of the fact that they may be needed to meet new, health-\nbased air quality standards for ozone or fine particulate pollution.\n  There are too many serious problems with these bills. The American \npeople do not want us to act at the expense of environmental quality. \nWe should be passing the pieces of the energy bill where we can reach \nagreement to do so, like those issues I outlined.\n  We should not be rushing to pass legislation with such serious \nconsequences. These are aggressive, overreaching bills, and are deeply \nflawed. I will oppose them, and other Senators should as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6877-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENERGY TRADING OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the recent release of audiotapes of \nEnron traders gloating about their ability to manipulate energy markets \nshould jolt the Senate into passing S. 2015, the Energy Needs \nRegulatory Oversight Now or ENRON Act.\n  A public utility near Seattle, which is trying to get back the money \nit lost to Enron's unscrupulous energy trading practices, received the \ntapes from the Justice Department. These tapes confirm what we all \nsuspected: Enron manipulated energy markets and gouged consumers. \nAccording to these tapes, Enron traders celebrated when a forest fire \nshut down a major transmission line into California in 2000. This shut \ndown cut power supplies and raised energy prices. An energy trader \nsang: ``Burn, baby, burn. That's a beautiful thing.'' These taped \nconversations also provide evidence that Enron made secret pacts with \npower producers and Enron traders deliberately drove up prices by \nordering power plants to shut down. The traders also brag about their \nability to manipulate markets and steal money from the ``grandmothers \nof California,'' who one trader called ``Grandma Millie.'' The \narrogance of these traders shocks the conscience. It also demonstrates \nthe need for Congress to protect consumers from energy market \nmanipulation. We cannot let the market abuses that took place during \nthe Western energy crisis of 2000 happen again.\n  S. 2105 requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to prohibit \nthe use of manipulative practices like these that put at risk consumers \nand the reliability of the transmission grid. We learned from this \ncrisis that electricity markets need close government oversight to \nensure that companies do not engage in risky and deceptive trading \nschemes leading to soaring energy prices and their own possible \nfinancial failure. In both cases, consumers--the people who depend upon \nthe electricity these companies generate or trade--are the losers.\n  The Senate recently went on record in support of barring abusive \nenergy market practices when it approved an amendment to the fiscal \nyear 2004 agricultural appropriations bill offered by Senator Cantwell. \nI am disappointed this language was stripped from the omnibus spending \nbill. These necessary protections were also omitted from the final \nenergy conference report and the revised energy bill we voted on in \nApril.\n  We need to send a clear message to the energy industry that this \nbehavior will not be tolerated, and we must show consumers that we will \nprotect them from energy market manipulation. I am proud to cosponsor \nS. 2015 and encourage my fellow colleagues to pass this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6877-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6877-S6878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JUDITH RODIN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to pay tribute \nto Dr. Judith Rodin, who on June 30, 2004, will complete a remarkable \n10-year presidency of the University of Pennsylvania, my alma mater.\n  When she came to the University of Pennsylvania in 1994, Dr. Rodin \nbecame the first woman president of an Ivy League school. During her \ntenure, she has led the University of Pennsylvania through a period of \ngrowth and development that has transformed the University academically \nand greatly improved the quality of life on campus and in surrounding \nWest Philadelphia.\n  Since 1994, the University of Pennsylvania has doubled its research \nfunding, tripled both its annual fundraising and endowment and \nattracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants. However, Dr. \nRodin's greatest legacy will be her response to the challenge the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania faces as a citizen of West Philadelphia.\n  From her first days as President of the University of Pennsylvania, \nDr. Rodin made clear that one of her core beliefs was that a great \nresearch university must also be a great neighbor.\n  Dr. Rodin established the West Philadelphia Initiatives--a multi-\nfaceted urban-planning and community-development program which has \nreduced crime and blight, increased job opportunities and improved the \nquality of life in West Philadelphia. This program in turn has \nreinforced the University's ability to attract the best students, \nfaculty, staff and research opportunities.\n  The success of the West Philadelphia Initiatives in bringing \nemployment, investment and quality-of-life improvements to West \nPhiladelphia has become a model for collaboration between universities \nand urban communities throughout the United States.

JUDITH RODIN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to pay tribute \nto Dr. Judith Rodin, who on June 30, 2004, will complete a remarkable \n10-year presidency of the University of Pennsylvania, my alma mater.\n  When she came to the University of Pennsylvania in 1994, Dr. Rodin \nbecame the first woman president of an Ivy League school. During her \ntenure, she has led the University of Pennsylvania through a period of \ngrowth and development that has transformed the University academically \nand greatly improved the quality of life on campus and in surrounding \nWest Philadelphia.\n  Since 1994, the University of Pennsylvania has doubled its research \nfunding, tripled both its annual fundraising and endowment and \nattracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants. However, Dr. \nRodin's greatest legacy will be her response to the challenge the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania faces as a citizen of West Philadelphia.\n  From her first days as President of the University of Pennsylvania, \nDr. Rodin made clear that one of her core beliefs was that a great \nresearch university must also be a great neighbor.\n  Dr. Rodin established the West Philadelphia Initiatives--a multi-\nfaceted urban-planning and community-development program which has \nreduced crime and blight, increased job opportunities and improved the \nquality of life in West Philadelphia. This program in turn has \nreinforced the University's ability to attract the best students, \nfaculty, staff and research opportunities.\n  The success of the West Philadelphia Initiatives in bringing \nemployment, investment and quality-of-life improvements to West \nPhiladelphia has become a model for collaboration between universities \nand urban communities throughout the United States. Key to the success \nof the program has been Dr. Rodin's acute understanding of the problems \nfacing the West Philadelphia community, as a native Philadelphian.\n  Dr. Rodin was born in Philadelphia and attended Girls' High School, \nwhere she was a Mayor's Scholar. As an undergraduate at the University \nof Pennsylvania, she showed great talent both in the classroom and in \npolitics, where, as president of the women's student government, she \nhelped to lay the groundwork for a merger with the men's student \ngovernment.\n  Dr. Rodin later earned a doctorate in psychology at Columbia \nUniversity, and spent two decades on the faculty at Yale University, \nwhere she worked tirelessly to research and explain the biological and \npsychological factors that lead to obesity--a critical health issue \nfacing our country today.\n  She also helped launch the women's health movement, and expanded our \nunderstanding of aging by demonstrating that elderly people who are \nempowered lead more active, healthier, and longer lives than those who \nare consigned to helplessness.

CONVENTION TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the tenth \nanniversary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. \nSince its adoption on June 17th, 1994, some 190 countries, including \nthe United States, have become party to the convention. But for those \nlooking for reasons to celebrate on this tenth anniversary, the news on \ndesertification is not good at all. Indeed, the scope and pace of \ndesertification have increased over the last two decades. In some parts \nof the world, the rate of desertification has doubled since the 1970s. \nBy 2025, according to the United Nations, two-thirds of the arable land \nin Africa will be gone.\n  Today, desertification threatens an astonishing one-third of the \nearth's land surface, directly affecting over 250 million people and \nthreatening the livelihoods of some 1.2 billion more. Most of these \npeople live in the world's poorest countries, caught in a vicious cycle \nof accelerating poverty and environmental degradation. Disruptions \nassociated with climate change will likely make things worse.\n  No one has to be reminded of how important fertile soil has been to \nhuman societies. But what can take centuries to form can be eroded or \nblown away in a matter of years. Loss of arable land directly \nundermines food security, displacing large numbers of people, creating \nnew opportunities for sickness and disease, and, in some cases, \ncontributing to famine. These sorts of pressures also work to \nexacerbate political instability in so-called weak states.\n  Indeed, the links between desertification and security are \nincreasingly apparent, as recognized by a recent NATO workshop on the \nissue. It is high time that policy makers in the United States take \nthese linkages seriously.\n  But it is also high time to recognize that desertification is \nfundamentally a humanitarian issue. We cannot remain indifferent while \nmillions suffer from the effects of desertification. This was the \nimpetus that drove the international community to negotiate and adopt a \nformal convention ten years ago. As we mark the tenth anniversary of \nthe convention, we would do well to remember this and to acknowledge \nthat we must redouble our efforts to combat this global environmental \nproblem.\n  Unfortunately, the United States has so far failed to play a leading \nrole in the global effort to combat desertification. Although we \nfinally became a party to the convention in 2000, we have never been \nespecially active. I urge the current administration to step up and \ntake a more active role in the convention. Without active participation \nand leadership by the United States, the effectiveness of international \nefforts to combat desertification will be limited at best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6878-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF DAVID GRUENWALD\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

While he \nis only 14 years old, he has already done more volunteer work than many \npeople will do in their whole life. As a project to become an Eagle \nScout, David started a book drive for inmates at the Daviess County \nDetention Center.

Soon they had \nincreased the size of the facility's library from about 30 books to \n2,900.\n  The citizens of Owensboro are fortunate to have a young man like \nDavid Gruenwald in their community. His example of dedication, hard \nwork and compassion should be an inspiration to all throughout the \nentire Commonwealth.\n  He has my most sincere appreciation for this work, and I look forward \nto his continued service to Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6878-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DR.

Captain Christopher comes to this position after nearly 20 \nyears of distinguished service to the Navy in the fields of aviation, \npublic affairs and intelligence.\n  Captain Christopher has spent most of his life in New Orleans, and he \nhas made a wonderful home there with his wife Penny and their two \ndaughters. He received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the \nUniversity of New Orleans, and his work with NMCI still brings him back \nto the UNO campus. Though he is now stationed in Virginia, his heart \nand family remain in New Orleans. As a Louisiana Senator, I like that!\n  Captain Christopher's work at NMCI has been truly outstanding. The \nNavy Marine Corps Intranet is a progressive and comprehensive project \nwith an ultimate goal to transform the Department of the Navy's \ncomputer and information networks in a way that increases combat \nreadiness and effectiveness. NMCI will revolutionize command and \ncontrol efficiencies within the Navy, and between the services, to \nensure that our forces are operating in unison. This will save American \nlives, increase combat readiness and effectiveness, and, ultimately, \nmake us stronger. Under Captain Christopher's leadership, many of these \ngoals have been brought closer to reality.\n  I once again want to thank my friend, Captain Chris Christopher, for \nhis efforts on America's behalf. Future generations of Sailors and \nMarines will no doubt reap the benefits of his labor and America will \nbe safer as a result.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize George \nand Germaine Briant as Louisiana's longest married couple. George and \nGermaine Briant of Hammond, LA, were married over eighty years ago on \nJuly 20, 1921. The couple currently lives at Sunrise of Live Oak \nVillage in Hammond where their affectionate displays of kissing, \nhugging, and dancing, regularly prove a true testament of their love. \nAs the residents of Hammond would tell you, George never fails to sing \n``Let Me Call You Sweetheart'' to Germaine, at every opportunity.\n  The Briants contributions to our Nation go beyond their loving \nexample. George served in World War I and was awarded many medals, \nincluding the Purple Heart and the French Legion of\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\nHonor, for his courageous and exceptional service to his country. The \nBriants only son, George H. Briant, a World War II pilot, gave his life \nfor his country. Although the lives of George and Germaine Briant tell \ntales of patriotism, valor, and loss, the most salient characteristics \nof their marriage are commitment, loyalty, selflessness, and \nunconditional love.\n  I am proud to announce that at a time when people may need shining \nexamples of self-sacrifice and a reminder of the responsibility \ninvolved in a commitment to family, George and Germaine Briant offer a \nportrait of a genuine marriage that has fidelity and trust at its \nroots. I know that my colleagues here in the United States Senate join \nme today in congratulating this exceptional couple who have shown the \nstrength of a marriage bond that has only deepened with time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6879-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE ARKANSAS EASTMAN FACILITY\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity \nto bring to the attention of the Senate very good news about the work \nof some of my constituents. The Arkansas Eastman facility of Brock \nService Painting Company, located in Batesville, AR, has been \nrecognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration as a ``Star'' site under OSHA's Voluntary \nProtection Program. The OSHA Voluntary Protection Program recognizes \nexemplary safety and health efforts demonstrated by company management \nand employees in a cooperative effort to promote safe and healthy \npractices in the work environment.\n  As you can imagine, I am extremely proud of the accomplishments of \nthese Arkansas workers and their managers. The significance of their \nachievement is underscored when you take into account that since 1982, \nout of 6.2 million potential sites, only 1,041 sites have been \nrecognized for their efforts in the Voluntary Protection Program. \nMoreover, only 20 contractors have been selected to receive the \nprestigious ``Star'' award.\n  Not only have employees of the Arkansas Eastman facility maintained a \nsafe work environment and adhered to safe work practices, but they also \nhave consistently exceeded the regulatory requirements established by \nOSHA. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, sites participating \nin the Voluntary Protection Program have overall lost-workday, and \ninjury and illness rates 60 percent below their industries' averages.\n  The dedication and hard work of these employees are credits to \nthemselves, their company, their family and neighbors in Batesville, \nand the people of Arkansas. I am happy to recognize their achievements \nand to salute this notable accomplishment here in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6879-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING LT.

William \nPaul Kerby is an important occasion that represents a man, and a \ngeneration.\n  Lt. William Paul Kerby deserves America's appreciation. As Valley \nCounty's first serviceman to lose his life in World War II, he \ndisplayed the selfless sacrifice of a true American. It is his \ndedication that Kerby Gardens hopes to honor--a spirit of sacrifice \nthat has defined our country and the State of Idaho since its beginning \nand continues to do so today.\n  Lt. Kerby was one of over 1,700 Idahoans who never returned from the \nbattlefield in that great and terrible war. It is to these men that we \nowe our freedom today. There is still no other event in modern history \nthat so transformed our world as did the Second World War. It brought \nout the best in our Nation and proved the courage of an entire \ngeneration, one that has been called ``The Great Generation.'' It is \nthe courage and sacrifice of those veterans, men including Lt. William \nKerby, that this garden remembers and honors.\n  In commemorating the dedication of Kerby Gardens, I would like to \nrecognize, honor and thank Lt. Kerby and all of Idaho's veterans for \ntheir sacrifices. In World War II, as in other conflicts, America's \nservicemen and women have demonstrated the values and ideals our \ncountry holds dear.

Colonel Woodward's character reflects this sacrifice and the \nsteadfast resolve so many of our veterans maintain in the preservation \nof freedom. Allow me a moment to tell you about him.\n  Colonel Woodward joined the United States Air Force in 1941. Shortly \nafter enlisting, he was called to arms in the European campaign of \nWorld War II. Colonel Woodward quickly earned the rank of captain \nflying B-17 bombers. During his 13th mission flying under the 100th \nBomb Group, he was shot down and injured. He received a Purple Heart \nfor these actions.\n  Colonel Woodward's relentless service to our country does not end \nhere. In addition to his contributions in World War II, Colonel \nWoodward continued to serve through times of peril. From 1952-1954 he \nflew in the Korean war. From 1966-1967, he served in intelligence and \nstrategic planning during the Vietnam war. In 1971, after 30 years of \nservice, Edgar F.

Reg. 35149).\n  It remains a major national security goal of the United States to \nensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons \npursuant to various arms control and disarmament agreements is \ndedicated to peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and \nprotected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. The \naccumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in \nthe territory of the Russian Federation continues to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of \nthe United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \nthe accumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material \nin the territory of the Russian Federation and maintain in force these \nemergency authorities to respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2523. A bill to exempt the Great Plains Region and Rocky Mountain \nRegion of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from trust reform reorganization \npending the submission of agency-specific reorganization plans; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today Senator Johnson and I are \nintroducing a bill that reflects the concerns of tribal leaders about \nthe lack of progress on trust management reform and their \ndissatisfaction with the Department of the Interior's reorganization \nplan to deal with it. It offers an alternative to the Department's \napproach that tribal chairmen in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain \nregions believe will better serve their members.\n  Trust reform is a particularly vexing issue that has confounded \nFederal policymakers and frustrated Native Americans for years. But the \nbottom line is that when the United States Government divided Indian \nlands in 1887, it made a commitment, through solemn treaty obligations, \nto hold those lands in trust, to manage them wisely, and to give any \nincome from the sale or lease of the land to its Indian owners. It has \nnever fulfilled that promise.\n  The Indian trust has been so badly mismanaged, for so long, by \nAdministrations of both political parties, that no one today has any \nidea how much money should even be in the trust--let alone, how much is \nowed to individual account holders and to tribes, and for what. \nMeanwhile, too many individual and tribal community needs go unmet in \nIndian Country because of the lack of resources. That is the \ncontradiction that simply cannot be allowed to continue.\n  I know that the Interior Department has gone to great efforts to \nreform its internal structure to get a handle on the administration of \nthe Indian trust fund. And I appreciate that Interior officials believe \nthat their reorganization plan has been shaped, at least in part, by \n``listening sessions'' it held in Indian Country. Yet, the fact remains \nthat tribal leaders around the country do not accept the premise that \nthose meetings represented true consultation, and they do not accept \nthe Department's reorganization plan as a legitimate response to \nmismanagement of the Indian trust. A number of tribal leaders have told \nme that the Department's ``listening sessions'' were hardly that, but \ncould more accurately be described as a notification of how the \nDepartment would proceed.\n  Tribal leaders in my State believe strongly that the Department's \nreorganization plan moves in the wrong direction. Instead of \nintegrating the trust and ``non-trust'' functions of the Department, it \nseparates those functions even further. They also believe the plan \nignores the unique character of each region's challenges. The Great \nPlains Region, for example, has more Individual Indian Money Account \nholders than any other region and holds 33 percent of the nation's \ntribal trust assets.\n  I acknowledge that this is a difficult problem and that some in the \nAdministration sincerely desire to solve the trust management problem \nin a way that ensures that stakeholders receive what is due them in a \ntimely manner. I also greatly appreciate the attention devoted to this \nmatter. However, I do believe some of that attention has been \nmisdirected. And, given the recent history of the trust reform debate, \nI have no credible answer to tribal leaders' lament that the Department \nappears more interested in undercutting the Cobell v. Norton lawsuit \nthan in considering the opinion of tribes in South Dakota or the rest \nof Indian Country.\n  Since the Department formally unveiled its reorganization proposal \nearlier last year, numerous questions have been raised about exactly \nhow this reorganization, which is currently being advanced \nadministratively, will improve the present trust fund management and \naccounting procedures.\n  What are the role and responsibilities of the Special Trustee's trust \nofficers who will be dispatched throughout Indian Country, and how will \nthese positions relate to the local and regional BIA offices? Is this a \nduplication of services?\n  Who has oversight over these positions, and what accountability \nmechanism is in place to monitor their performance? What are the lines \nof authority?\n  Will Indian preference apply to any new positions that are created by \nthe reorganization?\n  Why is the reorganization effort affecting the Office of Indian \nEducation Programs when the court mandate affects only trust fund \nmanagement reform? Does the plan violate the BIA amendments to the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization?\n  The list of questions is long, and tribal leaders and their \nconstituents deserve answers. Those answers cannot be gleaned from the \n18 pages of organizational charts the Department has provided as a \nrationale for its plan to reorganize the BIA and the Office of the \nSpecial Trustee.\n  This past February tribal leaders from nearly every Indian Nation in \nAmerica traveled to Washington for a meeting of the National Congress \nof American Indians to discuss a variety of issues, including trust \nreform. They expressed unanimous opposition to the Department of \nInterior's reorganization efforts, and their urgent plea to Congress \nwas that the federal government work with Native people to find an \nhonorable and equitable solution to the Indian trust fund dispute.\n  In March, in an appearance before the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee, Tex Hall, Chairman of the Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort \nBerthold and President of the National Congress of American Indians, \ntestified that tribal leaders do not believe that their views are \nreflected in the Department's trust reorganization plan. And the \nChairman of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Michael Jandreau, a member of \nthe BIA-Tribal Task Force on trust reform, told the Committee that \n``meaningful involvement [of] and input from tribal leadership'' and \nthe failure by the federal government to recognize ``obvious treaty \nobligations'' are contributing to the inability to reach consensus on \ntrust reform.\n  This disagreement between Indian Country and Washington runs deep and \ncannot be solved by Interior Department officials simply re-drawing \nlines on organizational charts. The search for resolution must include \nreal, meaningful, and ongoing consultation between Department officials \nand the tribes and tribal leaders. After all, we are talking about \nIndian people's money.\n  At the March Committee hearing, Harold Frazier, testifying in his \ncapacities as Chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and as \nChairman of the Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association, offered \nboth a critique of the Department's reorganization plan and an \nalternative to it. He emphasized that a majority of Indian tribes \nopposed the reorganization, not just because it was implemented without \n``meaningful tribal consultation,'' but also because ``a one-size-fits-\nall approach to trust management reform is certain to fail.'' While \nacknowledging that some aspects of reform, such as land consolidation \nand improved record-keeping, are better managed at the national level, \nChairman Frazier pointed out that basic services provided at the agency \nlevel are the key to the most efficient utilization of trust assets and \nthat these resource decisions are best made at the local level\n\n[[Page S6885]]\n\nso they may be adapted to serve tribal beneficiaries' unique needs. And \nhe offered the Great Plains Regional Proposal for Trust Reform as an \nalternative to the Department's reorganization plan.\n  Senator Johnson and I believe that Chairman Frazier has made a \nconstructive contribution to breaking the trust impasse, and the bill \nwe are introducing today codifies the Great Plains Regional Proposal \nfor Trust Reform, as expanded by the inclusion of the Rocky Mountain \nRegional Tribes. It is based on the principle that differences among \ntribes in population, employment, revenue base, and even geographic \nlocation effect the type of trust reform suitable for each area, and it \nhas precedent in a provision of the FY 2004 Interior Appropriations \nbill, Section 139, that exempted certain self-governance tribes from \nthe Interior reorganization plan.\n\n  Our proposal exempts the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain tribes from \nthe Department of the Interior's trust reform reorganization, excluding \ncurrent efforts to reform Indian probate and encourage land \nconsolidation, thereby precluding the Department from reorganizing the \nBIA at the agency level. It also stipulates that any funds appropriated \nto accomplish trust reform at the agency level within the Great Plains \nand Rocky Mountain Regions can be expended only under plans developed \nby local tribes in cooperation with, and with the approval of, the \nDepartment of the Interior. And it authorizes $200,000 for the Great \nPlains Region and $200,000 for the Rocky Mountain Region to be used for \nthe development of agency-specific reorganization plans.\n  The legislation Senator Johnson and I are introducing today is not \nintended to end the trust reform debate. We still do not have an \nhistorical accounting of trust income; we still do not know if certain \nrecords exist; and we still do not know how much the United States of \nAmerica owes to Indian people and to the Tribes. Neither is the \nlegislation intended to limit other regions searching for their own \nsolutions; to the contrary, we and the tribes of the Great Plains and \nRocky Mountain regions respect other regions' rights to develop \nproposals that meet their own unique needs. But we do hope our proposal \nwill help refocus the debate in a more constructive, substantive, cost-\neffective manner, acknowledging that the tribes know what is best for \nthem and should be consulted--in a meaningful way--and play a key role \nin this process.\n  The tribes understand that the Interior and Treasury Departments, the \nBIA, and the Special Trustee for American Indians must be their allies \nin the search for a solution. But friction over reorganization has \ndiverted attention from the more fundamental challenge of providing a \nfull and fair accounting to Indian people, and ultimately paying the \nmoney that is owed to them and the tribes.\n  Now that the Department has been given authorization to proceed \nadministratively with its reorganization plan, I hope the Department \nwill submit to Congress a legislative proposal on how to address the \nunderlying, substantive problem that we have been wrestling with for \nfar too long. I also hope the Department will embrace the pilot program \nSenator Johnson and I are proposing today, with the support of the \nGreat Plains and Rocky Mountain Tribal Chairmen's Associations.\n  In closing, I think it is extremely important to reflect on two \ncentral facts about the Indian trust debate as we consider the proposed \nreorganization of the BIA and the OST, and the Great Plains and Rocky \nMountains Tribal Chairmen's Associations' ideas for localizing trust \nreform.\n  First, residents of Indian Country have been victimized for \ngenerations by persistent mismanagement of trust assets by the federal \ngovernment. Far too many families for far too long have been denied \ntrust assets to which they are entitled because of Federal \nmismanagement. And this situation has adversely affected their quality \nof life.\n  Second, frustration with the Federal Government's failure to come to \ngrips with this problem has not only led to litigation (Cobell v. \nNorton), it has also solidified the tribes' determination to be part of \nthe solution to the problem. Effective trust management reform will \nremain an elusive goal if the tribes are not full participants in this \nexercise.\n  We need to recognize the human dimension and consequences of trust \nmismanagement, and we need to accept that tribal leaders must be equal \npartners in its reform. The bottom line is that the tribes do not have \nthe resources they need to adequately address the full range of socio-\neconomic challenges they face. In the case of trust reform, the issue \nis not simply boxes on an organizational chart, but lives that \nliterally hang in the balance.\n  Yesterday I met with Chairman Frazier, Chairman Jandreau, and Oglala \nSioux Tribal President John Yellow Bird Steele. Their frustrations with \nthe Department's reorganization proposal could be summed up with the \ncomments made by one chairman and echoed by the other two: ``They left \nus out of the equation. We have many of the records, and we know what \nadjustments need to be made at the agency level to address our local \nneeds. Whether it's historical accounting or reorganization, we have to \nbe part of the solution.''\n  It's a concept so simple that it should go without saying, but the \nAdministration has not adhered to it. But we still have a chance to \nturn that around. The tribes of the Dakotas, Nebraska, Montana, and \nWyoming have stepped up to the plate. They aren't just complaining \nabout the Administration's proposal; they're offering their own. \nThey've developed regional proposals to fit their unique regional \nneeds. We should respect their judgment, and the judgment of other \nregions that will undoubtedly follow with their own proposals.\n  The history of trust management has been a travesty, and, without a \nconcerted and open-minded effort to address the issue, the future will \nnot be any better. The United States has a fiduciary responsibility to \nIndian Country based on numerous treaty obligations. We must satisfy \nour obligations. We must work together to craft a solution to the \nunderlying trust problem. Let's start by granting the Great Plains and \nRocky Mountain Regions greater autonomy to fashion their own trust \nsolutions.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2523\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nprovision of health care, rehabilitation, and related services to \nveterans suffering from trauma relating to a blast injury, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to establish \na Department of Veterans Affairs War-Related Blast Injury Center. The \nneed for this type of research and treatment facility has become \nespecially pressing in light of the staggering number of veterans \nreturning from the battles raging abroad.\n  Blasts from such weapons as artillery, mortar shells, and roadside \nbombs--improvised explosives that blow debris such as broken glass, \nnails, and gravel upward into the face--have become the most common \nmechanism of injury in modern warfare. The resulting injuries include \nthose to the lungs, inner ear, limbs, and, quite commonly, the head. In \naddition to the serious physical wounds, deep psychological wounds also \nresult, including post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  Despite the fact that injuries from explosive devices currently make \nup the majority of combat casualties and the most severe, there has \nnever been an established medical program to evaluate, treat, and track \nthe short- and long-term consequences of these specific injuries. This \nbill is an important first step toward correcting this deficiency. It \nestablishes at least one War-Related Blast Injury Center within VA that \nwould provide comprehensive and specialized rehabilitation programs, as \nwell as targeted education and outreach programs and research \ninitiatives.\n  The Center would be formed from a collaboration between the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, (VA) and the Department of Defense, \npromoting cooperation between the two agencies to reach their \nrespective goals regarding the care of our military personnel. One of \nthe Center's main purposes would be to fill in the gap that now exists \nin the evidence base for treating victims of blast injuries. Through \nits specialized evaluation and treatment of the polytrauma that results \nfrom blast injuries, the Center would facilitate the identification of \ntrends in those suffering from this trauma and go a long way in \ndetermining innovative, more effective treatment approaches.\n  In addition to its comprehensive rehabilitation program and the \nconduct of research, the Center will also provide education and \ntraining to health care personnel across the care continuum, including \nfirst responders, acute-care providers, and rehabilitation staff. It \nwill also develop improved models and systems for the furnishing of \nblast injury services by VA.\n  While my legislation does not designate a site for the Center, I \nmention with pride the work being done at the Tampa VA Medical Center \n(VAMC) in Florida. The Tampa VAMC has an exceptional Physical Medicine \nand Rehabilitation (PM) Service that serves the largest number of \nveterans in the Nation. The Spinal Cord Injury, Amputee, and Traumatic \nBrain Injury Programs are not only VA's largest, but they have also \nbeen recognized as providing the highest quality of care in VA by their \ndesignation as Clinical Centers of Excellence. The PM Service \nutilizes an interdisciplinary team for patient care that includes \nphysicians, therapists, audiologists, neuropsychologists, and social \nworkers. Among them, this wide-ranging medical staff has access to a \nbroad spectrum of medical and support services to best treat their \npatients.\n  In addition, this outstanding hospital serves as one of seven lead \ncenters comprising the Defense/Veterans Brain Injury Center, a \ncooperative treatment and research program in traumatic brain injury. \nIt also established a Gulf War Program in 1999 and in the past year \ncreated a Blast Injury Program. For all these reasons, the Tampa VAMC \nwould serve as an excellent site for a War-Related Blast Injury Center.\n  An April 2004 article in The Washington Post detailed the experiences \nof combat surgeons in Iraq currently caring for the heroic men and \nwomen serving there. These doctors described their experiences treating \nan overwhelming flow of soldiers with wounds that probably would have \nbeen fatal in previous wars. Increasingly, these wounds involve severe \ndamage to the head and eyes and often leave soldiers brain damaged, \nblind, or both. This article paints a clear picture of the injuries our \nsoldiers in Iraq are subjected to and must deal with upon their return. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of The Washington Post article be \nprinted in the Record following this statement.\n  In addition, a recent update by VA's Physical Medicine and \nRehabilitation National Program Office revealed over a 60 percent \nincrease in rehabilitation patients in 2003 compared to 2002. This \nmeans that there were 215 additional brain injury patients and 423 more \namputee patients. This sizable increase speaks to the great need for \nthe War-Related Blast Injury Center.\n  This past April, more than 900 soldiers and Marines were wounded in \nIraq, more than twice the number wounded in October of last year, the \nprevious high. On May 2, in a tragic event that hit close to home, 5 \nreservists from the Jacksonville-based Seabee battalion were killed in \na mortar attack in Iraq and an additional 30 suffered injuries \nresulting from the blast. The Jacksonville-based Seabees were in Iraq \nto do humanitarian work such as fixing electrical and water systems and \nsewage problems. These brave men epitomized American courage and \nselflessness. A War-Related Blast Injury Center would serve to care for \nservicemembers like the Seabees who suffer this type of horrific wound.\n  After all that these courageous, selfless soldiers sacrifice and \nsuffer in battle, we owe them a place where they may receive the \ntreatment necessary to mend their wounds, both physical and mental.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 27, 2004]\n\n The Lasting Wounds of War; Roadside Bombs Have Devastated Troops and \n                         Doctors Who Treat Them\n\n                             (By Karl Vick)\n\n       The soldiers were lifted into the helicopters under a \n     moonless sky, their bandaged heads grossly swollen by trauma, \n     their forms silhouetted by the glow from the row of medical \n     monitors laid out across their bodies, from ankle to neck.\n       An orange screen atop the feet registered blood pressure \n     and heart rate. The blue screen at the knees announced the \n     level of postoperative pressure on the brain. On the stomach, \n     a small gray readout recorded the level of medicine pumping \n     into the body. And the slender plastic box atop the chest \n     signaled that a respirator still breathed for the lungs under \n     it.\n       At the door to the busiest hospital in Iraq, a wiry doctor \n     bent over the worst-looking case, an Army gunner with coarse \n     stitches holding his scalp together and a bolt protruding \n     from the top of his head. Lt. Col. Jeff Poffenbarger checked \n     a number on the blue screen, announced it dangerously high \n     and quickly pushed a clear liquid through a syringe into the \n     gunner's bloodstream. The number fell like a rock.\n       ``We're just preparing for something a brain-injured person \n     should not do two days out, which is travel to Germany,'' the \n     neurologist said. He smiled grimly and started toward the UH-\n     60 Black Hawk thwump-thwumping out on the helipad, waiting to \n     spirit out of Iraq one more of the hundreds of Americans \n     wounded here this month.\n       While attention remains riveted on the rising count of \n     Americans killed in action--more than 100 so far in April--\n     doctors at the main combat support hospital in Iraq are \n     reeling from a stream of young soldiers with wounds so \n     devastating that they probably would have been fatal in any \n     previous war.\n       More and more in Iraq, combat surgeons say, the wounds \n     involve severe damage to the head and eyes--injuries that \n     leave soldiers brain damaged or blind, or both, and the \n     doctors who see them first struggling against despair.\n       For months the gravest wounds have been caused by roadside \n     bombs--improvised explosives that negate the protection of \n     Kevlar helmets by blowing shrapnel and dirt upward into the \n     face. In addition, firefights with guerrillas have surged \n     recently, causing a sharp rise in gunshot wounds to the only \n     vital area not protected by body armor.\n       The neurosurgeons at the 31st Combat Support Hospital \n     measure the damage in the number of skulls they remove to get \n     to the injured brain inside, a procedure known as a \n     craniotomy. ``We've done more in eight\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\n     weeks than the previous neurosurgery team did in eight \n     months,'' Poffenbarger said. ``So there's been a change in \n     the intensity level of the war.''\n       Numbers tell part of the story. So far in April, more than \n     900 soldiers and Marines have been wounded in Iraq, more than \n     twice the number wounded in October, the previous high. With \n     the tally still climbing, this month's injuries account for \n     about a quarter of the 3,864 U.S. servicemen and women listed \n     as wounded in action since the March 2003 invasion.\n       About half the wounded troops have suffered injuries light \n     enough that they were able to return to duty after treatment, \n     according to the Pentagon.\n       The others arrive on stretchers at the hospitals operated \n     by the 31st CSH. ``These injuries,'' said Lt. Col. Stephen M. \n     Smith, executive officer of the Baghdad facility, ``are \n     horrific.''\n       By design, the Baghdad hospital sees the worst. Unlike its \n     sister hospital on a sprawling air base located in Balad, \n     north of the capital, the staff of 300 in Baghdad includes \n     the only ophthalmology and neurology surgical teams in Iraq, \n     so if a victim has damage to the head, the medevac sets out \n     for the facility here, located in the heavily fortified \n     coalition headquarters known as the Green Zone.\n       Once there, doctors scramble. A patient might remain in the \n     combat hospital for only six hours. The goal is lightning-\n     swift, expert treatment, followed as quickly as possible by \n     transfer to the military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany.\n       While waiting for what one senior officer wearily calls \n     ``the flippin' helicopters,'' the Baghdad medical staff \n     studies photos of wounds they used to see once or twice in a \n     military campaign but now treat every day. And they struggle \n     with the implications of a system that can move a wounded \n     soldier from a booby-trapped roadside to an operating room in \n     less than an hour.\n       ``We're saving more people than should be saved, \n     probably,'' Lt. Col. Robert Carroll said. ``We're saving \n     severely injured people. Legs. Eyes. Part of the brain.''\n       Carroll, an eye surgeon from Waynesville, Mo., sat at his \n     desk during a rare slow night last Wednesday and called up a \n     digital photo on his laptop computer. The image was of a \n     brain opened for surgery earlier that day, the skull neatly \n     lifted away, most of the organ healthy and pink. But a thumb-\n     sized section behind the ear was gray.\n       ``See all that dark stuff? That's dead brain,'' he said. \n     ``That ain't gonna regenerate. And that's not uncommon. \n     That's really not uncommon. We do craniotomies on average, \n     lately, of one a day.''\n       ``We can save you,'' the surgeon said. ``You might not be \n     what you were.''\n       Accurate statistics are not yet available on recovery from \n     this new round of battlefield brain injuries, an obstacle \n     that frustrates combat surgeons. But judging by medical \n     literature and surgeons' experience with their own patients, \n     ``three or four months from now 50 to 60 percent will be \n     functional and doing things,'' said Maj. Richard Gullick.\n       ``Functional,'' he said, means ``up and around, but with \n     pretty significant disabilities,'' including paralysis.\n       The remaining 40 percent to 50 percent of patients include \n     those whom the surgeons send to Europe, and on to the United \n     States, with no prospect of regaining consciousness. The \n     practice, subject to review after gathering feedback from \n     families, assumes that loved ones will find value in holding \n     the soldier's hand before confronting the decision to remove \n     life support.\n       ``I'm actually glad I'm here and not at home, tending to \n     all the social issues with all these broken soldiers,'' \n     Carroll said.\n       But the toll on the combat medical staff is itself acute, \n     and unrelenting.\n       In a comprehensive Army survey of troop morale across Iraq, \n     taken in September, the unit with the lowest spirits was the \n     one that ran the combat hospitals until the 31st arrived in \n     late January. The three months since then have been \n     substantially more intense.\n       ``We've all reached our saturation for drama trauma,'' said \n     Maj. Greg Kidwell, head nurse in the emergency room.\n       On April 4, the hospital received 36 wounded in four hours. \n     A U.S. patrol in Baghdad's Sadr City slum was ambushed at \n     dusk, and the battle for the Shiite Muslim neighborhood \n     lasted most of the night. The event qualified as a ``mass \n     casualty,'' defined as more casualties than can be \n     accommodated by the 10 trauma beds in the emergency room.\n       ``I'd never really seen a `mass cal' before April 4,'' said \n     Lt. Col. John Xenos, an orthopedic surgeon from Fairfax. \n     ``And it just kept coming and coming. I think that week we \n     had three or four mass cals.''\n       The ambush heralded a wave of attacks by a Shiite militia \n     across southern Iraq. The next morning, another front erupted \n     when Marines cordoned off Fallujah, a restive, largely Sunni \n     city west of Baghdad. The engagements there led to record \n     casualties.\n       ``Intellectually, you tell yourself you're prepared,'' said \n     Gullick, from San Antonio. ``You do the reading. You study \n     the slides. But being here . . . .'' His voice trailed off.\n       ``It's just the sheer volume.''\n       In part, the surge in casualties reflects more frequent \n     firefights after a year in which roadside bombings made up \n     the bulk of attacks on U.S. forces. At the same time, \n     insurgents began planting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) \n     in what one officer called ``ridiculous numbers.''\n       The improvised bombs are extraordinarily destructive. \n     Typically fashioned from artillery shells, they may be packed \n     with such debris as broken glass, nails, sometimes even \n     gravel. They're detonated by remote control as a Humvee or \n     truck passes by, and they explode upward.\n       To protect against the blasts, the U.S. military has \n     wrapped many of its vehicles in armor. When Xenos, the \n     orthopedist, treats limbs shredded by an IED blast, it is \n     usually ``an elbow stuck out of a window, or an arm.''\n       Troops wear armor as well, providing protection that \n     Gullick called ``orders of magnitude from what we've had \n     before. But it just shifts the injury pattern from a lot of \n     abdominal injuries to extremity and head and face wounds.''\n       The Army gunner whom Poffenbarger was preparing for the \n     flight to Germany had his skull pierced by four 155mm shells, \n     rigged to detonate one after another in what soldiers call a \n     ``daisy chain.'' The shrapnel took a fortunate route through \n     his brain, however, and ``when all is said and done, he \n     should be independent. . . . He'll have speech, cognition, \n     vision.''\n       On a nearby stretcher, Staff Sgt.

A bill to establish regional dairy marketing areas to \nstabilize the price of milk and support the income of dairy producers; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join today with nine of my colleagues \nto introduce the National Dairy Equity Act (NDEA), legislation intended \nto substantially reduce Federal expenditures for the dairy industry and \nallow for more local authority to regulate milk prices in a particular \narea. Members of the House of Representatives have introduced similar \nlegislation with 20 cosponsors.\n  This legislation would establish a voluntary, national program that \npermits producers and consumers, acting through Regional Dairy \nMarketing Area (RDMAs), to establish minimum prices for Class I fluid \nmilk, which is intended to stabilize the price of milk. Although the \nJune 2004 Class I fluid milk price is $18.40, the true impetus for this \nlegislation is based on the April 2003 price of $11.89, the lowest milk \nprice in the last 25 years as of October 1978. The recent rise in milk \nprice, while certainly welcome, gives only a temporary respite from the \nlow prices of the past five years that have threatened the survival of \nthousands of dairy farm. In Pennsylvania alone, since 1999, 1,100 dairy \nfarms have fallen victim to the battle over milk pricing.\n  Since last spring, I, along with my colleagues in both the Senate and \nthe House representing the Northeast, South and Midwest, have held \nmonthly meetings to address this dire situation faced by the dairy \nindustry. Additionally, I have worked with Pennsylvania Department of \nAgriculture Secretary Dennis Wolff, the Pennsylvania Dairy Task Force, \nwhich represents Pennsylvania's 9,900 commercial dairy farms, and have \nassembled a working group of 24 Pennsylvania dairy farmers for their \ninput, while holding eight forums in Pennsylvania discussing the merits \nof the legislation I present today.\n  Under the NDEA, five RDMAs would be established; three of these \nRDMAs, the Northeast, the South, and the Midwest, would be \nautomatically deemed\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\nas participating States, but there is a mechanism for any State to opt \nout. The States within the other two regions, the Intermountain and the \nPacific, can opt into the program. Ultimately, the NDEA overcomes \nprevious inter-regional objections to similar plans because it permits \nregions with low Class I utilization to receive the same benefit as \nhigher regions, and does not require national pooling of money between \nthe various regions.\n  Within each RDMA, a board, representative of both farmers and \nconsumers, would be appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture \nexclusively from lists of nominees provided by the Governors, Ag \nCommissioners in which they are elected officeholders. The RDMA boards \nwould distribute the payments to the farmers in their regions and would \nalso have the authority to conduct supply management, including the \ndevelopment and implementation of incentive-based supply management \nprograms.\n  Specifically, this legislation would allow states that do not wish to \nparticipate in the NDEA to continue participating in the current Milk \nIncome Loss Contract (MILC) program, which would be extended to 2007 to \ncoincide with the reauthorization of the Farm Bill. The MILC program is \nset to expire at the end of September 2005. Although I supported the \nMILC program when it was offered in the 2002 Farm Bill, I am aware that \nthe MILC program is delinquent in providing a producer (farmer) \nreferendum within a region; especially in the Northeast, to establish a \nregulated over-order price.\n  Equally, I am concerned about the cost of the MILC program. Since \n2002, this program has cost the Federal Government nearly $1.65 \nbillion, when it originally scored at only $1 billion from 2002 to \nSeptember 2005. If enacted, the NDEA will reduce government spending by \n90 percent in the Northeast, 100 percent in the South and 65 percent in \nthe Midwest. Nationwide, this is a cost savings of nearly $700 million, \nroughly $200 million per year from enactment until 2007.\n  More specifically in Pennsylvania, the MILC payment program is \ncosting the Federal Government roughly $44.2 million, which is \ndispersing payments to 8,300 dairy farms with herd sizes of roughly 100 \ncows or less. Under the NDEA, this cost to the Federal Government would \nbe reduced by 90 percent, and would ultimately pay $35 million more to \nthese farmers for a total of $78.6 million because the maximum price \nfor milk would be capped at $17.50, national pooling under the MILC \npayment would be eliminated and better supply management techniques \nwould be put into place.\n  Finally, this legislation clearly does not model a dairy compact \nbecause unlike a compact, the NDEA establishes a cap of $17.50 per cwt, \nhundredweight, on maximum Class I price, which could increase in \nsucceeding years based on Consumer Price Index (CPI), Additionally, \nthis legislation equalizes payments producers receive by establishing a \n50 percent Class utilization payment for all regions thereby not \nplacing low Class I utilization areas at a disadvantage, ultimately \nestablishing a level playing field. The NDEA provides for federal \nauthority for the establishment of five RDMAs, and establishes a \ncentral dairy producers payment fund at the Federal level that would \ntransfer processor payments and if necessary CCC funds back to each \nRDMA in order to equalize all payments among regions.\n  As we continue to celebrate National Dairy Month, I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor and support this timely legislation, which \nwould help reduce the Federal deficit and would tighten the huge gap \nthat exists in the stabilization of the milk price for the betterment \nof our nation's dairy industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, \n        and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 2528. A bill to restore civil liberties under the First Amendment, \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing the Civil Liberties Restoration Act of 2004.\n  The attacks of September 11 changed this nation forever. Much has \nbeen done since then to combat the threat of terrorism and make America \nsafer. But not every measure or policy adopted after 9/11 has been \neffective, legal, or fair. The strengthening of security has sometimes \nmeant the weakening of civil liberties. Often, the Bush Administration \nhas misused the fear of terrorism as an excuse to ignore basic rights \nin our society.\n  Immigrants, especially Arabs and Muslims, became targets as the \nAdministration carried out roundups of individuals based on national \norigin and religion, rather than any specific assessment of danger. \nAbusive detention practices took place. Registration programs have made \ncriminal suspects out of legal immigrants.\n  These changes were implemented without Congressional consultation or \napproval. They have swept much too broadly and eliminated necessary \nchecks and balances that prevent abuse. They have squandered our \nlimited resources and have been more successful in alienating immigrant \ncommunities than in apprehending terrorists. We cannot allow fear to \ntrump and trample the values upon which our country was founded. Our \nNation can be both secure and free.\n  The Civil Liberties Restoration Act of 2004 will provide basic civil \nliberties protections, and restore balance and fairness to our laws in \nthe treatment of immigrants. It will preserve fundamental rights \nwithout endangering national security. It will restore the confidence \nof immigrant communities, especially those unfairly targeted by recent \nand current policies.\n  It will place reasonable limitations on closed immigration hearings. \nOn September 21, 2001, the Attorney General ordered immigration judges \nto close all hearings on individuals detained in the 9/11 \ninvestigation. In a highly critical report issued by the Inspector \nGeneral of the Justice Department in April 2003 we learned that many \nwere arrested as a result of ``chance encounters or tenuous \nconnections'' to the investigation, rather than ``any genuine \nindications of a possible connection with or possession of information \nabout terrorist activity.''\n  Nevertheless, over 600 immigration hearings were held in secret. \nVisitors, the press and even family members of the detainees were \nexcluded. Consistent with the First Amendment, our legislation \nauthorizes the closing of immigration hearings only when the government \ncan demonstrate a compelling privacy or national security interest.\n  The bill will restore other due process protections weakened after 9/\n11. Before that, the INS was required to give notice to detained non-\ncitizens within 24 hours of arrest, informing them of the charges \nagainst them. On September 20, 2001, Attorney General Ashcroft issued a \nregulation extending that period to 48 hours or ``an additional \nreasonable period of time'' in ``emergency or other extraordinary \ncircumstances.''\n  This open-ended change led to serious abuses. As the Inspector \nGeneral reported, some detainees were held for more than a month after \ntheir arrest, without being told of the charges against them. Often \nthey were held in harsh and restrictive conditions and prevented from \nconsulting with their attorneys.\n  Our legislation will require a charging document to be served within \n48 hours of an arrest or detention. Non-citizens held for more than 48 \nhours would have to be brought before an immigration judge within 72 \nhours of their arrest or detention, with an exception for non-citizens \nwho are certified by the Attorney General, based on reasonable grounds, \nas having engaged in espionage or a terrorist offense.\n  After 9/11, the Bush Administration also adopted policies that deny \nbond to many immigrants with no individual assessment of their danger \nor flight risk. Two examples of this policy were the ``hold until \ncleared'' policy criticized by the Inspector General's report, and the \nAttorney General's precedent decision declaring that all Haitians \narriving by sea were a national security threat and must be detained.\n  Unilateral executive branch decisions mandating detention violate \nfundamental rights. Blanket detentions of persons who pose no flight \nrisk or harm to the community waste valuable resources that should be \nused to apprehend criminals and terrorists.\n\n[[Page S6890]]\n\n  Our legislation will require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nprovide all detainees with individual assessments to determine whether \nthey pose a flight risk or a threat to public safety, except those in \ncategories specifically designated by Congress as posing a special \nthreat. If the individual is eligible for release, the Secretary must \nset a reasonable bond or other conditions to guarantee the person's \nappearance at future proceedings, and this decision would be subject to \nreview by an immigration judge.\n  The authority of immigration judges was further weakened by an \nOctober 2001 regulation that authorizes the Attorney General to stay a \ndecision by an immigration judge to release an individual if bond had \noriginally been denied, or had been set at $10,000 or more. The current \nregulation goes too far. It allows the government's immigration \nattorneys to overrule a decision by an immigration judge that an \nindividual does not pose a risk.\n  The bill puts reasonable limitations on this automatic stay \nauthority. The Board of Immigration Appeals could stay the immigration \njudge's bond decision for a limited time, only when the government is \nlikely to prevail in appealing that decision and there is a risk of \nirreparable harm in the absence of a stay.\n  In early 2002, Attorney General Ashcroft issued a series of \n``procedural reforms'' purportedly designed to eliminate the backlog of \ncases in the Board of Immigration Appeals. Altering its practices in \naccordance with the new mandates, the Board has issued thousands of \nsingle-member decisions affirming without written opinions the \ndecisions of the immigration judges. Before the changes took effect, 1 \nin 4 appeals was granted, now only 1 in 10 is granted. Instead of \neliminating the backlog, however, the cases have shifted to the federal \ncourts. The number of Board decisions being appealed to the federal \ncourts has increased dramatically. The Ninth Circuit has received over \n4,200 immigration appeals, more than four times the usual number.\n  These so-called reforms highlight the degree to which integrity and \nimpartiality of the immigration courts have been compromised. To \ncorrect the problem, the bill establishes an independent regulatory \nagency within the Department of Justice to administer the immigration \ncourt system. Integrity would be restored by enabling Board Members and \nimmigration judges to exercise independent judgment and discretion. The \nreforms will help ensure that individuals and families receive fair \ntreatment in immigration decisions, which can have profound \nconsequences for immigrants and refugees, such as permanent separation \nfrom loved ones, or deportation to countries where they may face \npersecution and even death.\n  The Act will also end the infamous National Security Entry-Exit \nRegistration System--the NSEERS program which was launched by Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft in August 2002 and which required men from \npredominately Muslim or Arab countries to be fingerprinted, \nphotographed, and interrogated, based on the absurd notion that \nterrorists would present themselves for registration and be caught.\n  As Vincent Cannistraro, former director of Counterterrorism \nOperations at the CIA, has said, policies like the NSEERS program \ncaused fear and distrust and worked ``against intelligence-gathering by \nlaw enforcement, particularly the FBI.'' At a time when we needed vital \nintelligence information, members of these communities were unfairly \nstigmatized and discouraged from coming forward to help our law \nenforcement and counter-terrorism efforts.\n  According to Department of Homeland Security officials, no one \nregistered under the NSEERS program was ever charged with terrorism. \nLast December, significant parts of the NSEERS program were suspended. \nOur bill will terminate it completely, and it will also close removal \nproceedings for certain individuals targeted under it.\n  A related issue is the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. More \nthan 14,000 individuals who voluntarily complied with the NSEERS \nprogram were placed in removal proceedings for technical immigration \nviolations, even though many of them had relief available to them or \nwere in the process of applying for permanent residence. Immigration \nofficers routinely refused to use their discretion not to arrest these \nindividuals, or not to initiate removal proceedings against them, or \nnot to release them from detention. The result was a massive diversion \nof resources away from investigations, prosecutions, and removals of \ncriminals and terrorists.\n  Our bill will codify an immigration memorandum which outlines the \nparameters for the responsible exercise of prosecutorial discretion. \nThe legislation makes clear that such discretion is not an invitation \nto violate or ignore the law, but is intended to give the government \nthe flexibility to maximize its allocation of resources. Exercise of \nsuch discretion is particularly appropriate in light of the complexity \nof the immigration laws, the harshness of the consequences of \nenforcement, and the importance of conserving limited enforcement \nresources so that they are available for use against individuals who \nthreaten our safety and security.\n  Given the problems inherent in the NSEERS program, the government \nshould reconsider all pending NSEERS cases and determine whether a \nfavorable exercise of discretion is warranted. Family ties, \nhumanitarian concerns, and eligibility for relief are positive factors \nthat should be considered in assessing such cases.\n  Our bill also protects the integrity of the National Crime \nInformation Center database. For decades, in maintaining the database, \nthe Department of Justice was required to obey the Privacy Act, which \nrequires each agency to maintain its records ``with such accuracy, \nrelevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to \nassure fairness to the individuals in the determination.'' In March \n2003, Attorney General Ashcroft issued a regulation stating that these \nrequirements no longer applied to the NCIC database, and justified the \nexemption because ``in the collection of information for law \nenforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what \ninformation is accurate, relevant, timely and complete.''\n  Our legislation requires the Attorney General to comply with the \nPrivacy Act in maintaining the database. Circumventing this statutory \nobligation poses significant risks not only for individuals whose files \nmay be part of this data system, but also for communities that rely on \nlaw enforcement to employ effective, reliable methods for protecting \npublic safety.\n  This requirement is especially important today. The Attorney General \nannounced last year that information on more than 400,000 persons with \nremoval orders and an unknown number of alleged NSEERS violators would \nbe included in the database. The error rate in immigration records has \nalways been very high--a fact confirmed by numerous reports issued by \nthe Inspector General. Requiring the Attorney General to comply with \nthe Privacy Act will help prevent inaccurate and unreliable information \nfrom contaminating the database and harming individuals and \ncommunities.\n  The bill also protects privacy by ensuring that constitutional \nlimitations apply to secret surveillance. The Patriot Act amended the \nForeign Intelligence Service Act to permit surveillance or searches \nwhen a ``significant purpose'', not just the ``primary purpose'', of \nthe surveillance or search is foreign intelligence. Under current \nprocedures, when such evidence is brought before a court, it is nearly \nimpossible for a criminal defendant to contest its introduction, \nbecause the government's application for the search is kept secret. \nWhen such evidence is used in criminal cases, the court should disclose \nthe application and related materials to the defendant, subject to the \nClassified Information Procedures Act, which offers a balanced and \neffective way to protect both national security information and the \nrights of defendants.\n  In addition, the legislation provides that when such information from \nelectronic surveillance and other sources is introduced in a criminal \ncase, disclosure of the surveillance application, order, or other \nmaterials is permitted under the procedures in the Classified \nInformation Procedures Act.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the practice of data-mining. Through \ncomprehensive data-mining, many records that people believe are private \ncan be\n\n[[Page S6891]]\n\ncollected by computer, fed into a database and used by the government \nwithout their knowledge. Law enforcement must have the necessary means \nto protect our safety, but the use of data-mining technology should not \nbe allowed to threaten privacy and civil liberties.\n  The legislation will require all federal agencies to report to \nCongress within 90 days and annually in future years on data-mining \nprograms used to find patterns indicating terrorist or other criminal \nactivity and the effect of these programs on civil liberties and \nprivacy, so that Congress can exercise its oversight authority over \nfederal agencies using this technology.\n  We know that we can protect our nation's security and still respect \nthe basic rights of both citizens and immigrants. The Civil Liberties \nRestoration Act is a needed effort to end the abuse that has become all \ntoo common in the past three years, and Congress has a responsibility \nto end them. It has been said that our laws are the wise restraints \nthat make us free. The restraints have been weakened in recent years, \nand we need to make them stronger.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Liberties Restoration \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Fighting terrorism is a priority for our Nation.\n       (2) As Federal, State, and local law enforcement work \n     tirelessly every day to prevent another terrorist attack, our \n     Nation must continue to work to ensure that law enforcement \n     have the legal tools and resources to do their job.\n       (3) At the same time, steps that are taken to protect the \n     United States from terrorism should not undermine \n     constitutional rights and protections.\n       (4) Some of the steps taken by the Administration since \n     September 11, 2001, however, have undermined constitutional \n     rights and protections.\n       (5) Our nation must strive for both freedom and security.\n       (6) This Act seeks to restore essential rights and \n     protections without compromising our Nation's safety.\n\n               TITLE I--RESTORING FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS\n\n     SEC. 101.

EXERCISE OF PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress Regarding Prosecutorial Discretion.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) Exercising prosecutorial discretion is not an \n     invitation to violate or ignore the law, rather it is a means \n     by which the resources of the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     may be used to best accomplish the mission of the Department \n     of Homeland Security in administering and enforcing the \n     immigration laws of the United States.\n       (B) Although a favorable exercise of discretion by any \n     office within the Department of Homeland Security should be \n     respected by other offices of such Department, unless the \n     facts and circumstances in a specific case have changed, the \n     exercise of prosecutorial discretion does not grant lawful \n     status under the immigration laws, and there is no legally \n     enforceable right to the exercise of prosecutorial \n     discretion.\n       (2) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the exercise of prosecutorial discretion does not lessen the \n     commitment of the Secretary of Homeland Security to enforce \n     the immigration laws to the best of the Secretary's ability.\n       (b) Prosecutorial Discretion.--The Secretary of Homeland \n     Security shall exercise prosecutorial discretion in deciding \n     whether to exercise its enforcement powers against an alien. \n     This discretion includes--\n       (1) focusing investigative resources on particular offenses \n     or conduct;\n       (2) deciding whom to stop, question, and arrest;\n       (3) deciding whether to detain certain aliens who are in \n     custody;\n       (4) settling or dismissing a removal proceeding;\n       (5) granting deferred action or staying a final removal \n     order;\n       (6) agreeing to voluntary departure, permitting withdrawal \n     of an application for admission, or taking other action in \n     lieu of removing an alien;\n       (7) pursuing an appeal; or\n       (8) executing a removal order.\n       (c) Factors for Consideration.--The factors that shall be \n     taken into account in deciding whether to exercise \n     prosecutorial discretion favorably toward an alien include--\n       (1) the immigration status of the alien;\n       (2) the length of residence in the United States of the \n     alien;\n       (3) the criminal history of the alien;\n       (4) humanitarian concerns;\n       (5) the immigration history of the alien;\n       (6) the likelihood of ultimately removing the alien;\n       (7) the likelihood of achieving the enforcement goal by \n     other means;\n       (8) whether the alien is eligible or is likely to become \n     eligible for other relief;\n       (9) the effect of such action on the future admissibility \n     of the alien;\n       (10) current or past cooperation by the alien with law \n     enforcement authorities;\n       (11) honorable service by the alien in the United States \n     military;\n       (12) community attention; and\n       (13) resources available to the Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n\n     SEC. 303.

A bill to assist displaced American workers during a jobless \nrecovery, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as many as half a million Americans in the \nservices sector have lost their jobs in the past three years; off-\nshoring threatens to wipe out 3.3 million more jobs in the coming \ndecade. An off-shoring tsunami is bearing down on workers in the \ninformation technology and services sector. The most vulnerable jobs \nare those considered the cream of the new economy: highly paid database \nmanagers, software coders, financial analysts and accountants.\n  In places like my own State of Oregon, the prolonged jobless recovery \nis causing many people real pain. Highly educated and experienced \nworkers are being forced to walk an economic tightrope. Displaced \nsoftware workers with advanced degrees are forced to search for entry-\nlevel positions, but employers won't hire them because they're \noverqualified. In Oregon and elsewhere, the number of discouraged \nworkers leaving the workforce altogether is unprecedented. If these \nfolks were counted the national unemployment rate would be 7.4 percent \nrather than the current 5.6 percent.\n  Something in the country's tax and trade policy is seriously awry \nwhen productivity is generating wealth for a few, but not employment \nfor the many who want to work. Something just isn't right when people \ncan't find jobs but productivity is growing faster now than in the late \n1990's, corporate profits as a share of national income are at an all-\ntime high and all of the extra $220 billion in GDP has gone into \ncorporate profits. In my view part of problem can be traced to U.S. tax \nand trade policies that actually encourage U.S. corporations to move \njobs overseas rather than encourage American business to invest in \nAmerican workers. These policies need to be changed.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today, the Keep American Jobs \nat Home Act, takes a first step toward eliminating tax and trade \npolicies that favor off-shoring and overseas outsourcing at the expense \nof American workers. It will eliminate tax breaks for off-shoring and \nextend wage and training and health care premium assistance to \nserviceworkers who lose their jobs because of trade.\n  The first key feature of the bill will eliminate tax breaks for U.S. \ncorporate off-shoring so that corporations cannot ship millions of jobs \noverseas courtesy of the American taxpayer. The average American \nprobably does not know that his or her taxes are used to offset the \noff-shoring of their own jobs. That's right: current law allows the \ntaxes of hard-working Americans to go right into the pockets of \ncorporations to help them offshore and outsource American jobs. No \ncorporation should get such a tax break, and no American taxpayer \nshould be asked to foot the bill for their own pink slip.\n  Today, when a corporation sends executives and staff overseas to \nscope out a new facility, to buy an existing firm, or to hire foreign \nworkers to replace employees in the United States the corporation can \ndeduct the costs from its gross income. This means that the corporation \ngets a tax break on the compensation of the executives, the salaries \nand wages of workers, travel, lodging, meals, the cost of Internet \naccess, computer time, copies, faxes and anything else that falls into \nthe broad category of deductions from gross income for trade and \nbusiness expenses. This means a corporation get a business expense \nwrite-off for just about any item imaginable related to off-shoring.\n\n[[Page S6895]]\n\n  The bill says the costs of off-shoring and outsourcing will no longer \nbe ``ordinary and necessary expenses.'' When is it ever necessary that \na taxpayer foot the bill for her own pink slip? When is it ever \nnecessary that taxpayer dollars subsidize the traveling expenses of a \ngroup of executives looking to relocate a manufacturing facility in a \nforeign country?\n  A respected industry research group predicts that by the end of this \nyear, one of out every ten jobs in the U.S. IT provider industry will \nmove to emerging markets and one out of every 20 IT jobs within user \nenterprises. And these figures cover jobs only in the IT sector. Under \ncurrent law, all of the ``ordinary and necessary expenses paid or \nincurred'' in moving these millions of jobs overseas would be \ndeductible from corporate gross income.\n  If a corporation opts to fire U.S. workers here at home and instead \nhire workers overseas, then the company should make that business \ndecision based on the full cost of the transaction, not the cost \nsubsidized by tax deductions courtesy of the American taxpayer.\n  Another important part of the bill will put in place a safety net for \ndisplaced IT and other service workers. Such a safety net, known as \nTrade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, has been in place since l962 for \ndisplaced manufacturing workers. This provision will make service \nsector workers displaced by trade eligible for TAA, giving them \nretraining, income support and a health insurance tax credit.\n  I was disappointed when this part of the legislation won a majority \nvote in the United States Senate recently, but failed to reach the 60 \nvote threshold needed to overcome a point of order raised by opponents. \nI believe it is more necessary than ever to provide assistance to \nworkers who lose their jobs because of policies the Federal Government \nhas adopted.\n  Globalization of technology is globalizing the technology workforce. \nGeography is increasingly less important in determining where a job can \nbe done. The transformation from an economy built on smokestacks to one \nbuilt on packets of light has come at a heavy price. Today, a software \nprogrammer in Beijing or Bangalore can perform the same tasks as a \nprogrammer in Beaverton, OR, but the programmer in Beijing or Bangalore \nwill cost the company as little as one-fifth to one-tenth what the \nAmerican programmer will be paid.\n  The irony is that some of the very same workers who launched the \ntechnology revolution have now become its victims. Hardly a day goes by \nwithout a front page story about an American programmer on his way out \nhaving to train a foreign worker who will replace him.\n  The average American may think the Federal Government is helping \nthose tech workers displaced by trade. But it is not. That's because \nU.S. trade assistance laws were designed for the manufacturing era. \nSince 1962, when a worker lost his job in a manufacturing plant as a \nresult of trade, he could get help through the TAA. TAA has helped \nhundreds of thousands of displaced workers.\n  But workers in the services sector--which now accounts for four-\nfifths of the U.S. workforce--are not eligible for TAA. Time after \ntime, when a displaced software developer, accountant, or telemedicine \nsupport staff has gone knocking on TAA's door for help, they have been \nturned away. Our bill will open TAA's door to these and other displaced \nservice sector workers. All of these workers who have been displaced by \ntrade deserve the same benefits.\n  This part of the bill will establish equity in the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance program between manufacturing and service workers. It will \ncover three categories of trade-impacted service workers: 1. those who \nlose their jobs when their employer closes or lays off because of \nimport competition; 2. public and private sector service workers who \nlose their jobs when their facility moves overseas; and 3. secondary \nservice workers who provide services to a primary firm where workers \nare eligible for TAA and whose closure causes the layoff or closure at \nthe secondary firm.\n  Why is TAA so important? Because it provides retraining, income \nsupport, health insurance tax credit and other benefits to workers who \nlose their jobs due to trade. It can also help ``secondary workers''--\nthose supplying parts or services and who may lose their jobs when the \nfacility they service shuts down due to import competition or moves \noverseas.\n  Another innovative way to encourage the unemployed to reenter the \nworkforce is to provide wage insurance for qualifying displaced workers \nupon reemployment. Eligible workers receive up to $10,000 over two \nyears to cover up to 50 percent of the difference in salary between a \nnew, lower paying job and their former position. The bill also would \nlower the qualifying age from 50 to 40. Wage insurance helps ease the \nburden of reentry for eligible workers who cannot find new employment \nat wages comparable to their previous positions.\n  Workers reeling from the off-shoring of service sector jobs cannot \nafford to wait for the higher-skilled jobs economists promise are \naround the corner. Higher-value, higher-paid systems integration jobs \nmay come along, but in this jobless recovery unemployed IT \nprofessionals are more likely to see Elvis than a sudden proliferation \nof help wanted ads for new, highly-skilled IT jobs. The wage insurance \nand TAA pieces of this legislation address what American workers really \nneed: a fighting chance to survive in a relentlessly global economy.\n  This provision offers corporate boards of directors and officers a \nsafe harbor against shareholder lawsuits involving a business decision \nnot to outsource or off-shore American jobs. A corporation that chooses \nto keep its workers out of breadlines over the numbers on its bottom \nline should not run the risk that it could be sued for potentially \nlower profits or return to shareholders.\n  In 2002, Congress offered TAA workers help in paying for health \ninsurance while they pursue TAA training or retraining. The vast \nmajority of unemployed workers just don't have the money to afford \nhealth care for themselves and their families. The Health Care Tax \nCredit program was intended to help workers keep coverage until they \nare reemployed. Unfortunately, the level of premium assistance and \nbureaucratic obstacles led to fewer than five percent of eligible \nworkers taking advantage of the health care tax credit.\n  The provisions in Title II of the bill seek to remove these barriers \nto participation. The bill would boost the premium coverage from 65 \npercent to 75 percent, clarify that any TAA worker who had three months \ncoverage prior to losing his job is eligible for the HCTC, allow \nworkers to get less expensive group coverage, give coverage to spouses \nof Medicare-eligible TAA recipients workers, and require the IRS to \nexpedite refunds of the first month's tax credit.\n  In closing, I recall that the Chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisors just a few months ago called off-shoring ``just a new way of \ndoing international trade. More things are tradable than were tradable \nin the past, and that's a good thing. When a good or service is \nproduced at lower cost in another country, it makes sense to import it \nrather than to produce it domestically.''\n  If this is the ``new way of doing international trade,'' the United \nStates needs a new policy to help the nearly 4 million Americans whose \ninformation technology and related jobs have been or are expected to be \nmoved overseas. The country needs a tax and trade policy that promotes \nrather than discourages investment in American workers. The country \nneeds a tax and trade policy that eases rather than increases the pain \nof worker dislocation and that eliminates the tax breaks that entice \nU.S. businesses to move overseas. These are the goals of the Keep \nAmerican Jobs at Home Act, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2531\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keeping American Jobs at \n     Home Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n\n[[Page S6896]]\n\n       (1) The unusually prolonged period in which there has been \n     negative job growth has caused an unprecedented number of \n     people to refrain from actively looking for work and, \n     therefore, to be excluded from the unemployment measurement, \n     effectively creating a ``missing'' labor force. If the \n     unemployment rate in February 2004 took into account this \n     missing labor force, the unemployment rate would have been \n     7.4 percent or 1.8 percent greater than the official rate of \n     5.6 percent.\n       (2) Newly released unemployment figures show that the trend \n     toward growing long-term unemployment continued last year, \n     the second year after the recession ended.\n       (3) An analysis of long-term unemployment from 2000 to 2003 \n     shows that the number of people without work for 6 months or \n     more has risen at the extraordinarily high rate of 198.2 \n     percent over this period, from just over 649,000 in 2000 to \n     nearly 2,000,000 in 2003.\n       (4) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2003, \n     22.1 percent of all unemployed workers had been out of work \n     for more than 6 months, an increase from 18.3 percent in \n     2002. This proportion is higher than at comparable points in \n     the recovery periods of the 4 most recent recessions, and is \n     the highest rate since 1983.\n       (5) In 2005, 588,000 American jobs are projected to be \n     moved overseas. In 2010, that number is expected to grow to \n     1,600,000 and by 2015, 3,300,000 American jobs will be moved \n     overseas.\n       (6) In February 2004, the Chairman of the Council of \n     Economic Advisors, called offshoring ``just a new way of \n     doing international trade. More things are tradable than were \n     tradable in the past, and that's a good thing. When a good or \n     service is produced at lower cost in another country, it \n     makes sense to import it rather than to produce it \n     domestically.''.\n       (7) Immediate action is necessary to encourage United \n     States companies to keep American jobs at home, to assist \n     displaced American workers in finding new, family wage jobs, \n     and to assure that the current American workforce has the \n     skills to compete and win in the global economy.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assist \n     displaced American workers during a jobless recovery by--\n       (1) ensuring displaced workers in the software, information \n     technology, and services sectors have access to the same \n     trade adjustment assistance and health care tax credits as \n     displaced manufacturing workers;\n       (2) providing wage insurance for qualifying displaced \n     workers upon reemployment (to make up part of the difference \n     between a new, lower salary and a previous, higher salary); \n     and\n       (3) providing a legal safe harbor for United States \n     businesses that choose to keep American jobs at home.\n\n           TITLE I--ASSISTANCE FOR DISPLACED AMERICAN WORKERS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to establish wilderness areas, promote conservation, \nimprove public land, and provide for the high quality development in \nLincoln County, Nevada, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to co-sponsor a bill that is important to Lincoln County, \nimportant to Southern Nevada, and important to America.\n  The Lincoln County Conservation, Recreation and Development Act of \n2004 accommodates southern Nevada's growth and meets our conservation \nchallenges. I am pleased that Congressman Gibbons, Congresswoman \nBerkley and Congressman Porter are introducing companion legislation in \nthe House of Representatives today. We are working together on a \nbipartisan basis to reach fair compromises on a number of difficult \nissues.\n  The Lincoln County Conservation, Recreation and Development Act \nrepresents a comprehensive plan that balances the needs for \ninfrastructure development, recreation opportunities, and conservation \nof our natural resources and public lands in Lincoln County, Nevada. \nOur bill is a broad-based compromise. It creates utility corridors, \nresolves wilderness study area issues, provides for competitive, \nFederal land sales, designates a back country off-highway vehicle trail \nand provides for the conveyance of federal land to the State of Nevada \nand Lincoln County for use as public parks.\n  We do not expect everyone to advocate every provision of this bill. \nIn fact, I don't imagine that anyone will champion every provision of \nthis bill. It is a tough compromise and it is a good bill.\n\n[[Page S6899]]\n\n  I will preface my description of the titles of this bill by reviewing \nthe challenges that public land issues pose in Nevada. Nearly 9 out of \nevery 10 acres in our State are owned and managed by the Federal \nGovernment. This includes land managed by the U.S. Forest Service, the \nBureau of Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management, the Department of \nEnergy, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force.\n  In Lincoln County, the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife \nService and Department of Defense manage 49 out of every 50 acres--98 \npercent of the total land area.\n  Unlike most of America where land use decisions are made by local \ncommunities, many land use decisions in Nevada require concurrence of \nFederal officials and, in some cases, the passage of Federal laws. The \nEly Field and the State offices of the BLM bear tremendous \nresponsibilities with respect to the management, development, and \nconservation of natural resources in eastern Nevada, particularly in \nLincoln County. Many of my colleagues from western states identify with \nthe challenges and benefits of Federal land ownership.\n  In Lincoln County these challenges are compounded by rapid growth and \na fragile ecology: The neighboring Las Vegas valley is the fastest \ngrowing community in the nation, and the Mojave Desert is one of North \nAmerica's most extreme and vulnerable regions.\n  Many people believe this scenario poses an impossible challenge for \nLincoln County. Some believe that managing growth in southern Nevada \nand protecting our desert for future generations are mutually \nexclusive. Some believe that protecting our air and water quality and \nrecognizing that some open space should be set aside as wilderness are \nprohibitive barriers to growth that will unnecessarily restrict \nrecreation. Some believe that the federal management of public land is \ntoo strict; others find it too lenient.\n  Some believe that every acre of Lincoln County should be privatized. \nSome believe that not a single acre should be auctioned from the public \ndomain. The only common thread in these views is that they are \nperspectives passionately held by Nevadans.\n  I hope this context illustrates why compromise is not just desirable \nbut necessary.\n  We fully expect some criticism for what this bill does not do. For \nexample, it does not designate the more than 2.5 million acres that the \nNevada Wilderness Coalition advocates in Lincoln County. Nor does the \nbill release all the wilderness study areas in Lincoln County as others \nadvocate. Our compromise is fair, forward-looking and provides for \nconservation, recreation and development in Lincoln County and for \nsouthern Nevada.\n  The Lincoln County Conservation, Recreation and Development Act will \nenhance our quality of life, protect our environment for our children \nand grandchildren, and make public land available for housing, growth \nof the industrial base and infrastructure to meet community needs.\n  As I discuss each title of this bill, I will explain how these \nprovisions reflect our shared effort to improve the quality of life and \nenhance economic opportunities for Nevadans while enriching and \nprotecting the awe-inspiring natural and cultural resources with which \nsouthern Nevada is blessed. This bill will benefit Nevadans today, and \nfor generations to come.\n\n                          TITLE I--LAND SALES\n\n  The first title of our bill serves to increase the percentage of \nprivately held ground in Lincoln County so local property taxes can \nbetter sustain basic governmental services. Some people oppose selling \nFederal land under any circumstances. However, in a case such as \nLincoln County, where 98 percent of the 6.8 million acres is federally \nowned, blind and blanket opposition to land sales simply defies common \nsense.\n  Our bill makes available for auction up to about 90,000 acres, \ncurrently managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Further, the bill \ndirects the BLM to proceed with the auctions required by the Lincoln \nCounty Land Act of 2000.\n  With respect to the 90,000 acres to be auctioned within Lincoln \nCounty, we provide for annual auctions until the acreage is sold or the \nCounty determines it prefers for the land to remain in Federal \nownership. The bill does not stipulate how much acreage should or could \nbe sold in a given year, or exactly which parcels of land should be \nsold, because those decisions are better left to the County, the \nmunicipalities, and citizens working in cooperation with the BLM.\n  This basic framework for so-called joint selection has worked very \nwell in Clark County and we expect that it will be similarly successful \nin Lincoln County. This bill will greatly enhance the self \ndetermination of communities in Lincoln County.\n  The bill includes a provision that allows the Federal Government to \nretain up to 10,000 acres of the 90,000 set aside for disposal based on \nnatural and cultural resource values. For example, if the land disposal \nareas in this bill include, unbeknownst to us, a significant petroglyph \nsite or a population of a threatened or endangered species, the \nSecretary could choose to retain ownership.\n  As I have noted before on this floor, when Congress passed the \nSouthern Nevada Public Lands Management Act of 1998, it established a \nnew paradigm for the sale of public lands in Clark County, Nevada. One \nof the core principles of this new way of doing business was that the \nproceeds from the sale of Federal lands should be reinvested in \nFederal, State, and local environmental protection, infrastructure and \nrecreational enhancements in the areas and communities where the lands \nare sold.\n  This bill is patterned after that law and provides a revenue source \nfor following through on the various provisions of this bill such as \nthe creation and management of an off-highway vehicle route and new \nwilderness areas.\n\n                          TITLE II--WILDERNESS\n\n  Nevada has more than 80 wilderness study areas on Federal land across \nthe State. These areas, which are primarily owned by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, are managed to protect wilderness character land. These \nareas remain as de facto wilderness until Congress passes legislation \neither designating the land as wilderness or releasing the land from \nwilderness study area consideration.\n  Although there is broad support for addressing Nevada's wilderness \nstudy areas through Federal legislation, there is no consensus on how \nto do so. Those who advocate for wilderness designation and those who \noppose further additions to the wilderness system hold strong and, in \nmay cases, irreconcilable views on this issue.\n  Those of us who wrote this bill hold different views regarding \nwilderness. In developing the wilderness component of this bill, \nSenator Ensign, Congressman Gibbons and I made compromises that will \nconcern all interested parties. Our bill designates more wilderness \nthan some advocates can support, and it falls short of the 2.5 million \nacres that some wilderness proponents are fighting to designate in \nLincoln County alone. In any case, this bill is a critical step toward \naddressing the outstanding wilderness study issues in the state of \nNevada.\n  Our bill designates wilderness and releases wilderness study areas. \nIt designates 14 wilderness areas, all of which are under the purview \nof the Bureau of Land Management, totaling roughly 770,000 acres. The \nbill releases roughly 246,000 acres from wilderness study area status, \nincluding four BLM study areas which are released in their entirety and \nportions of other WSAs throughout Lincoln County. This legislation \nresolves all but two of the wilderness study areas in Lincoln County. \nThose two areas, Mt. Grafton WSA and the South Egans WSA are more than \nhalf in White Pine County and will be addressed when the Congressional \ndelegation creates a public land bill for White Pine County.\n  Our bill provides for wilderness management protocols that address \nthe particular circumstances of southern Nevada much as we did in the \nClark County Conservation of Public Lands Act of 2002. For example, we \nexplicitly require the Secretary of Interior to allow for the \nconstruction, maintenance and replacement of water catchments known as \nguzzlers when and where that action will enhance wilderness wildlife \nresources, such as bighorn sheep. In addition, we believe that the use \nof motor vehicles should be allowed to achieve these purposes when \nthere is no reasonable alternative and it does not require the creation \nof new roads.\n\n[[Page S6900]]\n\n  Some wilderness purists argue that these man-made water projects \ndisturb the ecosystems of the Mojave Desert. I believe that guzzlers \ncan actually help restore more natural function to ecosystems that have \nbeen forever fragmented by development. These projects, which are \nprivately funded and hand built by dedicated conservationists, have a \nlegitimate place in southern Nevada wilderness and our bill is clear on \nthat point.\n  In our effort to create a fair wilderness designation, we have \nbenefited from the advice and suggestions of many Nevadans representing \na spectrum of views. These advocates include the Nevada Land Users \nCoalition, the Lincoln County Commission, The Nevada Wilderness \nProject, The Fraternity of Desert Bighorns, the State of Nevada, Red \nRock Audubon, Friends of Nevada Wilderness, Lincoln County residents, \nPartners in Conservation, ranchers and miners, to name just a few.\n  Although our compromise does not mirror the specifics of any \nstakeholder wilderness proposal, it does reflect careful consideration \nof the constructive suggestions and ideas offered by interested \nNevadans. We appreciate their help, and our compromise honors our \ncommitment to listen carefully to all parties. We are also grateful for \nthe help we have received from the Federal land managers in Lincoln \nCounty. We look forward to working with them to improve this bill in \nways that will make their jobs easier, and enhance the experience of \nthose who use public land.\n\n                      TITLE III--UTILITY CORRIDORS\n\n  The third title of this legislation establishes rights-of-way on \nFederal land within discrete multi-purpose utility corridors in Lincoln \nand Clark Counties. By designating these corridors, this bill serves to \nconsolidate the process for establishing utility corridors and rights-\nof-way on the BLM land in question.\n  I would like to spend a few moments elaborating on what we do and do \nnot intend this bill to accomplish with respect to utility corridors \nand rights-of-way.\n  Last year the Southern Nevada Water Authority and the Lincoln County \nCommission signed an agreement ending a number of decades-old \ngroundwater disputes in Lincoln County. As a result of this agreement \nvarious protests and counter-protests between Southern Nevada Water \nAuthority and Lincoln County were amicably resolved. Subsequent to \nreaching this agreement, the SNWA and Lincoln County requested that the \nNevada Congressional delegation introduce legislation to help put their \nplans into action.\n  This bill partly satisfies those requests. It does not, however, \nprovide for everything either the SNWA or Lincoln County Commission \nwanted. For example, it provides substantially fewer miles of corridor \nthan they requested and focuses specifically on corridors for trunk \nlines. This is analogous to painting the trunk and major limbs of a \ntree but not the branches, twigs and leaves. We provide routes for \narterial water pipelines, but not for every well pad and secondary \nfeeder.\n  This legislation relocates an existing utility corridor from the east \nto the west side of Highway 93 between the Highway 93 Highway 168 \njunction and the Kane Springs Road Highway 93 junction. This returns \nthe utility corridor to its original location prior to passage of the \nFlorida-Nevada Land Exchange bill. The owners of the private property \ncurrently encumbered by the utility corridor will pay the Federal \nGovernment fair market value for the appreciation of their property due \nto this provision.\n  Our bill stipulates that prior to the designation of any right-of-way \nprovided for in this bill, the proponents must complete a full \nenvironmental impact statement pursuant to the provisions of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Our bill is not intended to \nprovide short cuts around Federal environmental laws. Rather it \nrecognizes that one comprehensive environmental statement regarding the \nimpact of water utility corridors and water development in Lincoln \nCounty is necessary, but that environmental reviews for the \nestablishment of utility corridors and permission to build pipelines \nneed not be conducted separately.\n  It is also worth noting that our bill explicitly recognizes the role \nthe State Engineer plays in Nevada water law, and makes it crystal \nclear that this bill is not intended to influence his decisions \nregarding water rights adjudications or any of his other important \nresponsibilities.\n  Finally, our bill authorizes the United States Geological Survey to \nconduct a hydrogeologic study of the water resources in White Pine \nCounty. This study should establish greater certainty regarding the \nwater resources of east-central Nevada, and provide a basis for \nincreasingly well-informed resource decisions in the future.\n\n            TITLE IV--SILVER STATE OFF-HIGHWAY VEHICLE TRAIL\n\n  This bill establishes an off-highway vehicle route in central Lincoln \nCounty as the Silver State Off-Highway Vehicle Trail. The Silver State \nTrail is a combination of existing back-country roads that are \ncurrently open and being used.\n  Sadly, much of rural Nevada is suffering the consequences of \nuncontrolled off-road vehicle use. Lincoln County is no different. And \nas more and more Nevadans seek recreation opportunities in Lincoln \nCounty, this situation is likely to get worse before it gets better.\n  Many public land users enjoy back-country, motorized travel and the \nvast majority of these citizens treat public lands with respect and \ncare. Some of these responsible stewards helped us design this route.\n  The Silver State Trail will serve as both a recreational and \neducational resource. It will be open to the full range of \nrecreationists including off-highway vehicle users and mountain bikers. \nBy providing an appropriate place for off-highway vehicle enthusiasts \nto explore Lincoln County, this bill will help locally focus off-\nhighway vehicle use on our public lands and educate public land users.\n  Interested citizens will work with the Bureau of Land Management and \nlocal governments to develop a management plan for the Silver State \nTrail. This plan will increase recreational use and mitigate the \nnegative impacts of such activity. If this Silver State Trail is not \nestablished, off-highway vehicle use will not go away; it will just do \nmore damage, in many cases unintended and avoidable damage, to our \npublic lands. I hope this trail will give public land users additional \nopportunities to develop a deeper and better appreciation for the \nMojave Desert and how it can be used and how it must be protected.\n\n               TITLE V--STATE AND COUNTY PARK CONVEYANCES\n\n  Our bill includes a title dedicated to the creation of parks for \nLincoln County and the State of Nevada. In the case of Nevada State \nParks, we provide for the conveyance of three parcels of land that are \ncurrently leased to the State of Nevada by the Bureau of Land \nManagement. These conveyances are contingent upon agreement between \nLincoln County and the State of Nevada supporting the ownership \ntransfers. In the case of Lincoln County, this bill provides for the \nconveyance of about 18,000 acres for use as open space and public \nparks. In both cases, if the land is not used for a public park or open \nspace purpose, the land will revert to Federal ownership.\n  This title of our bill represents a conservation grant package to the \nState and County that should pay dividends for conservation and \nrecreation in Lincoln County for generations to come.\n\n                  TITLE VI--TRANSFERS OF JURISDICTION\n\n  During the development of this bill we decided against addressing \nwilderness issues within the Desert National Wildlife Range. This is a \nmajor disappointment to some in the environmental community who view \nthe wilderness resources in the Range as some of the most pristine and \nwild country in the Mojave Desert.\n  It is clear that significant acreage within the Desert Game Range \nmeets the criteria of the Wilderness Act of 1964, and someday it may \nyet be recognized as such. In the meantime the areas in question will \ncontinue to be managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service according to \nits mission.\n  This legislation does convey approximately 8,000 acres from the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service to the BLM, which will manage it as a utility \ncorridor, and conveys a similar amount of acreage from the BLM to the \nFish and Wildlife Service for inclusion in the\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\nDesert National Wildlife Range. These areas lie between State Highway \n93 and the Sheep Range and this transfer helps rationalize the Federal \nland ownership pattern in northern Clark County and southern Lincoln \nCounty.\n  This legislation, the Lincoln County Conservation, Recreation, and \nDevelopment Act of 2004, is a many-faceted compromise. It is an \nambitious bill. It is a complex bill. And it is an important bill for \nLincoln County and all of southern Nevada.\n  I look forward to working with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to ensure timely review \nand passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Graham of Florida, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Breaux, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Talent, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Allen, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \n        Dole, Mr. Carper, Mr. Smith, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. \n        Coleman, Mr. Edwards, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Domenici, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Bayh, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 2533. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to fund \nbreakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease research while providing more help \nto caregivers and increasing public education about prevention; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the \nintroduction of the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004. \nI believe the greatest tribute to President Reagan and the Reagan \nfamily is a living memorial. That is why I am introducing this \nlegislation with my colleague, Senator Kit Bond. Our legislation makes \nan all out effort to spark and accelerate breakthroughs for \nAlzheimer's. The legislation supports research on how to prevent the \ndisease, how to care for people who have it, and initiatives to support \nthose who are caregivers. Let's celebrate President Reagan's life of \nvigor by attacking Alzheimer's with vigor.\n  The time to act for real breakthroughs is now. Just last month, \nSenator Bond and I held a hearing on Alzheimer's research. Expert after \nexpert told us: We are on the verge of amazing breakthroughs; we will \nlose opportunities if we don't move quickly; we are at a crucial point \nwhere NIH funding can make a real difference. Researchers, families, \nand advocates all said the same thing, we need to do more, and we need \nto do better. I believe that the answer to that call is passing the \nRonald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004.\n  We are truly on the brink of something that can make a huge \ndifference for American families. We know that families face great \ndifficulties when a loved one has Alzheimer's. There is great emotional \ncost as well as financial cost. We know that for our public investment \nwe could get new treatments that would prolong a patient's cognitive \nabilities. Each month we delay admission to a long-term care facility \nis important to the family and to the taxpayer. Everybody wants a cure; \nthat is our ultimate goal. But even if we keep people at home for 1 or \n2 more years, to help them with their memory, and their activities of \ndaily living, it would be an incredible breakthrough.\n  Our bill would do three things. First, it would strengthen our \nnational commitment to Alzheimer's research. The legislation doubles \nthe funding for Alzheimer's research at the National Institutes of \nHealth from $700 million to $1.4 billion. We need to give researchers \nthe resources they need to make breakthroughs that are on the horizon \nin diagnosis, prevention and intervention. Also, our bill calls for a \nNational Summit on Alzheimer's that would bring together the best minds \nto look at priorities for research moving forward.\n  Second, our bill provides critical support for caregivers. The family \nis always the first caregiver. The nation saw what a family of prestige \nand means went through; imagine what other American families are going \nthrough. The legislation creates a tax credit for families caring for a \nloved one with a chronic condition, like Alzheimer's, that would help \nthem pay for prescription drugs, home health care and specialized day \ncare. Also, it helps create one-stop shops across the country so \nfamilies can find services like respite care, adult day care and \ntraining for caregivers.\n  Third, our legislation promotes News You Can Use for families and \nphysicians. Incredible advances are being made every day. We need to \nget the word out so families and doctors know the most current \ninformation. The Alzheimer's Association has been doing a great job \nwith their ``Maintain Your Brain'' campaign; however, philanthropic \nefforts of advocacy groups are not a substitute for public policy. Our \nbill builds on these efforts to create an effective public education \nstrategy.\n  It is amazing how far we have come. Back in the early 1980s, \nAlzheimer's was a catch-all term for any kind of memory loss. Today, \ndoctors diagnose Alzheimer's with 90-percent accuracy. Every day NIH is \nmaking progress to identify risks, looking at new kinds of brain scans \nfor appropriate detection, and understanding what this disease does to \nthe brain.\n  How did we get this far, this fast? With a bipartisan commitment of \nthe authorizers and appropriators. Together, we have been working to \nincrease the funding for the National Institute on Aging. In 1998 the \nNational Institute on Aging was funded at approximately $500 million. \nThanks to our bipartisan effort, it is at $1 billion. Now is the time \nto do more.\n  My own dear father had Alzheimer's. I remember when I would go to \nvisit him. It didn't matter that I was a United States Senator; it \ndidn't matter that I could get Nobel Prize winners on the phone. The \nresearch and treatments didn't exist for my father, for President \nReagan, or for more than 4 million families. Alzheimer's is an All \nAmerican disease that affected an All American President. Now we need \nan All American effort to speed up the breakthroughs so no family has \nto go through the long goodbye.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and move swiftly to enact \nit into law.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the life, \nleadership and the truly remarkable legacy of the 40th President of the \nUnited States, Ronald Reagan.\n  President Reagan was a great communicator with a powerful message. He \npreached the gospel of hope, freedom and opportunity not just for \nAmerica but for the world. Reagan was a genuinely optimistic person who \nbrought that spirit of optimism and hope to the American people and to \nenslaved peoples around the world. He was a man who took disappointment \nand moved on. He was a man of unfailing good humor, care and \nthoughtfulness. Even people who disagreed with his policies across the \nboard could not help but like him.\n  In the U.S., his policies encouraged the return of more tax dollars \nto average Americans and unfettered entrepreneurship to create jobs and \nbuild the economy. Reagan's strong military opposition to the Soviet \nUnion helped bring down the walls that harbored communism and tyranny \nthroughout Eastern Europe and much of the world.\n  In a letter to the American people in 1994 Ronald Reagan announced he \nwas one of the millions of Americans with Alzheimer's disease. One of \nthe most courageous things Ronald and Nancy Reagan did was to announce \npublicly that he had Alzheimer's disease. Through their courage and \ncommitment, the former President and his wife, Nancy, changed the face \nof Alzheimer's disease by increasing public awareness of the disease \nand of the need for research into its causes and prevention.\n  In honor of Ronald Reagan, today my colleague Senator Mikulski and I \nare introducing the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004. \nThis bill will increase research for Alzheimer's and increase \nassistance to Alzheimer, patients and their families. This bill will \nserve as a living tribute to President Reagan and will: 1. double \nfunding for Alzheimer's Research at the National Institute of Health; \n2. increase funding for the National Family\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\nCaregiver Support Program from $153 million to $250 million; 3. \nreauthorize the Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant Program that provides \ngrants to states to fill in gaps in Alzheimer's services such as \nrespite care, home health care, and day care; 4. authorize $1 million \nfor the Safe Return Program to assist in the identification and safe, \ntimely return of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related \ndementias who wander off from their caregivers; 5. Establish a public \neducation campaign to educate members of the public about prevention \ntechniques that can maintain their brain'' as they age, based on the \ncurrent research being undertaken by NIH; 6. establish a $3,000 tax \ncredit for caregivers to help with the high health costs of caring for \na loved one at home; and 7. encourage families to prepare for their \nlong term needs by providing an above-the-line tax deduction for the \npurchase of long term care insurance.\n  Ironically it was President Reagan who drew national attention to \nAlzheimer's for the very first time when he launched a national \ncampaign against Alzheimer's disease some 22 years ago.\n  In 1983 President Reagan proclaimed November as National Alzheimer's \nDisease Month. In his proclamation President Reagan said ``the \nemotional, financial and social consequences of Alzheimer's disease are \nso devastating that it deserves special attention. Science and clinical \nmedicine are striving to improve our understanding of what causes \nAlzheimer's disease and how to treat is successfully. Right now, \nresearch is the only hope for victims and families.''\n  Today, approximately 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's, with \nannual costs for this disease estimated to exceed $100 billion. Today \nthere are more than 4.5 million people in the United States with \nAlzheimer's, and that number is expected to grow by 70 percent by 2030 \nas baby boomers age.\n  In my home State of Missouri, alone, there are over 110,000 people \nwith Alzheimer's disease. Based on population growth, unless science \nfinds a way to prevent or delay the onset of this disease, that number \nwill increase to over 130,000 by 2025--that is an 18 percent increase.\n  In large part due to President Reagan, there has been enormous \nprogress in Alzheimer research--95 percent of what we know we \ndiscovered during the past 15 years. There is real potential for major \nbreakthroughs in the next 10 years. Baby boomers could be the first \ngeneration to face a future without Alzheimer's disease if we act now \nto achieve breakthroughs in science.\n  President and Mrs. Reagan have been leading advocates in the fight \nagainst Alzheimer's for more than 20 years, and million of American \nhave been helped by their dedication, compassion and effort to support \ncaregivers, raise public awareness about Alzheimer's disease and \nincrease of nation's commitment to Alzheimer's research.\n  This bill will serve as a living tribute to President Reagan and will \noffer hope to all those suffering from the disease today. As we \ncelebrate the life and legacy of Ronald Reagan, we are inspired by his \nlegendary optimism and hope, and today we move forward to confront this \nexpanding public health crisis with renewed vigor, passion, and \ncompassion.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, the death last week of \nPresident Ronald Reagan has focused our attention on the ravages that \nAlzheimer's inflicts not only on the person with the disease, but the \nentire family.\n  Alzheimer's disease currently affects 4.5 million Americans. As the \nbaby boom generation ages that number is expected to explode. Without \nadvances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment, we can not only expect \na growing emotional toll on those suffering from the disease and their \nfamilies, but also a significant drain on the already strained \nresources of the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n  However, there is reason to be hopeful. We now know that Alzheimer's \nDisease is not a normal part of aging, and that there may be ways to \nprevent the disease. Scientists are beginning to focus on the \nprotective effects of mental, physical and social activity, and believe \nthat following a diet and exercise program similar to that for people \nwith heart disease may delay the onset of Alzheimer's.\n  The legislation will accelerate important prevention research, in \npart by putting the National Institute of Aging Alzheimer's Disease \nPrevention Initiative into law.\n  In addition, this legislation includes two important changes to our \ntax laws that would provide greater Federal assistance to those who \nbear the burden of assisting patients with Alzheimer's and other \nconditions requiring long-term care. Over 13 million people in the \nUnited States need help with basic activities of daily living such as \neating, getting in and out of bed, getting around inside, dressing, \nbathing and using the toilet. While many Americans believe that long-\nterm care is an issue primarily affecting seniors, the reality is that \n5.2 million adults between the ages of 18-64 and over 450,000 children \nneed long-term care services today. These numbers are expected to \ndouble as the baby boom generation begins to retire.\n  Most long-term care is provided at home or in the community by \ninformal caregivers. However, in situations where individuals must \nenter nursing homes or other institutional facilities, costs are paid \nlargely out-of-pocket. Such a financing structure jeopardizes the \nretirement security of many Americans who have worked hard their entire \nlives.\n  The Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act provides two important \ntools to help Americans and their families meet their immediate and \nfuture long-term care needs--an above-the-line income tax deduction for \nthe purchase of long-term care insurance and a caregiver tax credit.\n  First, the bill provides an above-the-line deduction for long-term \ncare premiums to make long-term care insurance more affordable for a \ngreater number of Americans. Today, such premiums are deductible, but \nthe availability of the deduction is severely limited. First, the \ncurrent deduction is available only for the thirty percent of taxpayers \nwho itemize their deductions. That leaves the remaining seventy percent \nof taxpayers with absolutely no benefit. Second, the deduction is \nlimited to an amount, which in addition to other medical expenses \nexceeds 7.5 percent the taxpayers adjusted gross income. This AGI limit \nfurther decreases the utilization of the current deduction.\n  Our legislation removes these restrictions and makes the deduction \nfor long-term care premiums available to all taxpayers.\n  In order to provide sufficient incentives for families to maintain \nlong-term care coverage, the deduction allowed under this bill \nincreases the longer the policy is maintained. The deduction starts at \n60 percent for premiums paid during the first year of coverage and \ngradually increases each year thereafter until the deduction reaches \n100 percent after at least four years of continuous coverage. This \nschedule is accelerated for those age 55 or older. For those \nindividuals, the deduction starts at 70 percent for the first year and \nincreases to 100 percent after at least two years of continuous \ncoverage.\n  Second, the bill provides an income tax credit for taxpayers with \nlong-term care needs. The credit is phased in over 4 years, starting at \n$1,000 for 2003 and eventually reaching $3,000. To target assistance to \nthose most in need, the credit phases out for married couples with \nincome above $150,000 $75,000 for single taxpayers)''\n  The bill also updates the requirements that long-term care policies \nmust meet in order to qualify for the income tax deduction. These \nupdated requirements reflect the most recent model regulations and code \nissued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Mikulski, Bond, Grassley, \nClinton, Warner and me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida:\n  S. 2534. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend and \nenhance benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill, to improve housing \nbenefits for veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation I\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\nintroduce today, the proposed ``G.I. Bill for the 21st Century,'' a \nbill to improve home-buying and education options for America's \nveterans.\n  We have reached a milestone in American history. The pending measure \nis a fitting tribute to our nation's veterans as we celebrate the 60th \nanniversary of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, better known \nas the ``G.I. Bill.'' The G.I. Bill, for veterans of World War II, is \nrecognized as one of the most important acts of Congress.\n  The G.I. Bill ensured that all who sacrificed through service would \nnot be penalized as a result of their war service and upon their return \nwould be aided in reaching the positions which they might have occupied \nhad their lives not been interrupted by war. This legendary piece of \nlegislation alleviated postwar troubles and anticipated economic \ndepression. During the past six decades, this government has invested \nbillions of dollars in education and training for veterans. America has \nreceived a return on its investments many times over, resulting in a \nbetter educated, better trained, and dramatically changed society. In \nfact, many Members of this Senate have benefited from its far-reaching \nimpact. In addition to its provisions for education and training, the \nG.I. Bill allowed millions of veterans the opportunity to purchase \nhomes, transforming the majority of Americans from renters to \nhomeowners.\n  The G.I. Bill not only eased the transition of servicemen and women \nback into civilian life, it transformed American society. The social \nand economic class structure of the United States was forever changed \nand the boundaries that once encompassed class status were blurred. The \nbill expanded opportunities for lower- and middle-class families to own \ntheir own homes and to attend college. This expansion led to the \nevolution of the higher education system and paved the way for future \nindividuals from all cultural and economic backgrounds to have access \nto higher education. The 7.8 million men and women who used their G.I. \nBill benefits cultivated a new and progressive workforce that placed \nmore people in professional career roles, especially in critical-need \nareas such as education, engineering, and health care.\n  We must continue to ensure that veterans' education benefits change \nto meet the needs of veterans and their families who use them. We \nshould continue with the original intent of the G.I. Bill to increase \nthe ability of our veterans to acquire higher education. We have \nservicemembers fighting the war on terrorism world-wide and a whole new \ngeneration of combat veterans being created, as was the situation \nduring World War II. We should make every effort to accommodate the \neducational needs of our veterans, and these changes to the Montgomery \nG.I. Bill, known as MGIB, are an important step in doing so.\n  ``The G.I. Bill for the 21st Century'' would exclude MGIB benefits \nfrom computation as income when calculating campus-based student \nfinancial aid, such as Perkins Loans. This, importantly, draws the \ndistinction between a benefit that has been earned, and paid for, by \nthe veteran, and other types of income. This end is furthered by \nallowing the individual applying for financial aid to subtract $1200 \nfrom the expected family contribution. This $1200 represents the money \nthat the individual paid to participate in the MGIB program. Clearly it \nshould not be counted as part of the veteran's income to pay for \nschool. This legislation is in keeping with legislation that I \nintroduced, and that became law, in 1998 that excluded veterans \neducation benefits from being considered as income in the computation \nof some forms of financial aid.\n  This legislation also offers an opportunity for enrollment in the \nMGIB education program for servicemembers who participated in or were \neligible to participate in the post-Vietnam era educational assistance \nprogram, known as VEAP. Congress created an enrollment window for VEAP-\neligible servicemembers to convert to the far more comprehensive MGIB. \nHowever, some servicemembers were not able to participate because of \nfinancial reasons or did not learn of the enrollment period in time to \nmake the deadline. These individuals have contacted Members of Congress \nto create another window. As my colleagues know, education can be the \nkey to a successful transition to civilian life. This bill creates a \none-year window and requires the servicemember to pay $2700, which was \nthe VEAP contribution.\n  I have spoken with many veterans and widows of veterans who were not \nable to immediately go to school. By the time they enrolled, their \nbenefits were expiring. That is why this legislation maintains the 10-\nyear delimiting period for veterans, surviving spouses, and dependents \nthat enroll in training programs, which does not begin to toll until \nthe individual begins the program of study. This would allow eligible \nparticipants to utilize the benefit when best for them.\n  In keeping with my commitment to evolve the educational assistance \nbenefit to meet the needs of those using it, the bill that I introduce \ntoday would make national admissions exams such as the SAT, GRE, LSAT \nand GMAT, and national exams for credit at institutions of higher \neducation, such as the AP exam covered by MGIB. This would greatly aid \nthe individuals who have been absent from an academic setting for a \nlong period of time and would go a long way in preparing them for their \neducational endeavors.\n  As we face the greatest mobilization of troops since World War II, it \nis only fitting that we act in the spirit of the G.I. Bill to \ndramatically increase the ability of our veterans and their families to \nbuy homes in competitive housing markets throughout the nation. This \nbill would change the method by which Congress establishes the maximum \namount veterans may borrow through the VA home loan guaranty program.\n  This legislation would index the maximum VA guaranty loan amount at \n100 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit. Under the current \nsystem, a specific dollar figure for the VA maximum loan amount is set \nby legislation. The maximum loan limit has not been changed since 2001. \nThe current maximum guaranty is $60,000, which allows veterans to \nsecure loans to purchase homes costing up to $240,000. Since that time, \nthe Freddie Mac conforming loan rate has increased by over 18 percent. \nSadly, the VA loan limit has not kept pace and currently represents \nonly 74 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit. The change \nwould also allow for annual adjustments to the amounts available to \nveterans, without annual legislation, ensuring that the VA home loan \nguaranty benefit remain viable in competitive housing markets.\n  In 1999, Congress passed legislation that changed the Federal Housing \nAdministration (FHA) Loan Program and permanently indexed FHA loans at \n87 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit. Why should we \npenalize the buying power of our veterans by maintaining a system that \nhas failed to keep pace with annual increases in housing costs \nthroughout the United States? To recognize this service and sacrifice, \nit only seems right that the loan limit available to veterans be set at \na higher rate than the FHA limit. By indexing the VA loan limit at 100 \npercent, the current VA maximum loan amount would increase from \n$240,000 to $333,700 and give our veterans greater buying power in a \nnational housing market where the cost of a home continues to rise.\n  In addition, the Congressional Budget Office, known as CBO, has \ninformally projected that from 2005 to 2009 this increase will help \nover 10,000 new buyers participate in the VA Loan Guaranty Program. The \nBudget Office has also projected that the increase in new veteran \nbuyers would generate savings of more than $200 million over the next \nfive years. These savings will then be passed on to our veterans in the \nform of increased education and training opportunities.\n  We must fight to ensure that veterans' education benefits are as \nflexible as those who left their homes and served freedom around the \nglobe at their country's call to service. And, in keeping with the \noriginal intent of the G.I. Bill, raising the VA home loan guaranty \nlimit would help more veterans realize the American dream of owning a \nhome of their own. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these \nworthwhile efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\n                                S. 2534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 381, introduced \nearlier today by Senator Nelson of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 381) recognizing the accomplishments \n     and significant contributions of Ray Charles to the world of \n     music.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of \nmyself, the Senior Senator from Florida, Bob Graham, and my esteemed \ncolleagues from Georiga, Senators Zell Miller and Saxby Chambliss, to \ncommend to my colleagues a resolution commemorating Ray Charles for his \ngreat contributions to the world of music and culture.\n  It is with great sadness that as our Nation mourned the death of \nformer President Reagan, we received the news that this great and \ntalented musician, Ray Charles, succumbed to liver disease at age 73.\n  Ray Charles was born in Albany, GA on September 23, 1930, but he made \nFlorida his home for many years. As a baby he moved with his family to \nGreenville, FL where he developed an early appreciation for music. \nThere are stories from friends and family telling how at age 3 he began \nplaying the piano, and showed a strong interest in music.\n  Ray Charles wasn't born blind, but lost his sight to a childhood \nillness. His mother, Aretha Robinson, enrolled him in the St. Augustine \nSchool for the Deaf and Blind, where he leaned not only how to read and \nwrite Braille, but learned how to write music, and plan the piano, \nclarinet, trumpet and saxophone. In the late 1940s, after graduating \nfrom St. Augustine's, Ray Charles left Florida and began to work in \nhoning his craft full time. And, as they say, the rest is history.\n  Ray Charles began recording in the 1950's, experiencing success on \nthe musical charts that culminated in his winning the first of many \nGrammy Music Awards in 1960 for Georgia on My Mind. This great song was \nadopted in 1979 by the State of Georgia as their State song.\n  Ray Charles received eleven additional Grammy Awards, with the last \nof these awards coming in 1993.\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\n  The list of honors he has received in his lifetime is impressive and \nreflects the impact that he has had on American music and culture. His \nmusic cannot be categorized or limited to one genre, which cannot be \nsaid of many artists. He was influenced by all types of music, and his \nmusic in turn influenced all types of artists--from rhythm and blues to \ncountry artists to rock and roll.\n  Ray Charles's story is an American story, and one that should serve \nas an inspiration to us all; a story that shows how a strong spirit can \novercome the greatest of obstacles.\n  Ray Charles once said that his family was so poor that ``nothing was \nbelow us but the floor.'' Despite this poor beginning, and the racism \nand prejudice he undoubtedly faced as a blind black man during this \ntime, he triumphed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 381) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 381\n\n       Whereas Ray Charles, born Ray Charles Robinson on September \n     23, 1930, to Bailey and Aretha Robinson in Albany, Georgia, \n     was one of the greatest musical artists of the United States;\n       Whereas Ray Charles, who as an infant moved with his family \n     to Greenville, Florida, and, after suffering an illness that \n     left him blind, attended the St. Augustine School for the \n     Deaf and Blind from 1937 to 1945, where he learned not only \n     how to read Braille, but how to write music and play the \n     piano, trumpet, clarinet, and alto saxophone;\n       Whereas during the course of his 58-year career, Ray \n     Charles defied easy classification, as his music spanned all \n     genres, and many talented musicians from the world of rhythm \n     and blues, popular music, jazz, gospel, country, and rock and \n     roll have noted his strong influence on their careers;\n       Whereas his talent has long been recognized by the \n     recording industry and his many fans, as he has received 12 \n     Grammy Awards, with the first in 1960 and the most recent \n     award in 1993, and had 32 of his songs reach the national \n     Billboard's top 40 pop charts between 1957 and 1971;\n       Whereas his influence and contributions to the world are \n     evidenced by the numerous honors he has received from \n     organizations, and institutions, including: the Blues \n     Foundation's Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, \n     Songwriters Hall of Fame, Georgia Music Hall of Fame, Florida \n     Artists Hall of Fame, a Lifetime Achievement Award as part of \n     the Black Achievement Awards television show sponsored by \n     Johnson Publishing Company, a star on the Hollywood Walk of \n     Fame, the Helen Keller Personal Achievement Award from the \n     American Foundation for the Blind, and an honorary doctorate \n     of fine arts from the University of South Florida in Tampa;\n       Whereas Ray Charles has received praise from Republican and \n     Democratic Administrations with the adoption of ``Georgia on \n     My Mind'' as the Georgia State song in 1979, an invitation in \n     1984 to perform at the Republican National Convention and \n     President Reagan's inaugural ball in 1985, recognition in \n     1986 as a legend by the Kennedy Center Honors, and the \n     presentation of a National Medal of Arts by President Clinton \n     in 1993;\n       Whereas Ray Charles was a great humanitarian and activist \n     who provided financial support to Dr. Martin Luther King, \n     Jr., during the civil rights struggle, and joined with other \n     recording artists to record ``We Are the World'', a project \n     that brought world awareness and financial assistance to the \n     millions dying from starvation in Africa;\n       Whereas during the course of his life he persevered, \n     overcoming the tremendous obstacles that he encountered in \n     the early stages of his career due to racism and prejudice \n     because of his blindness, to become one of the greatest and \n     defining musical talents of all time; and\n       Whereas this great American, Ray Charles, died on June 10, \n     2004: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes Ray Charles as one of the greatest American \n     musicians of all time;\n       (2) honors Ray Charles for his contributions to music, \n     culture, community, and the United States;\n       (3) offers its appreciation to Ray Charles for sharing his \n     musical gifts with the world; and\n       (4) extends its deepest sympathy to the family and the \n     loved ones of Ray Charles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6908-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 17, 2004\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will resume the \nDefense authorization bill. Under the previous order, when we resume \nconsideration of the bill tomorrow morning, the Bond-Harkin energy \nemployee amendment will be the pending business. It is the hope of the \nbill managers that we can adopt the amendment without a rollcall vote.\n  For the remainder of the day, we will continue the consideration of \namendments to the bill. There is another amendment that I will offer \nrelated to death benefits, and there are several missile defense \namendments we hope to consider early in the day. Senators should expect \nrollcall votes throughout the day as the Senate continues to make \nprogress on the bill. As a reminder, a cloture motion was filed on the \nDefense bill.\n  In addition, there will be additional votes on judicial nominations \nduring Thursday's session as well.\n  Mr. President, I will just add, on the death benefits bill, \nlegislation I have offered, that it is important, in my view, we \nexamine the extent of death benefits to men and women who serve our \ncountry in combat. Frankly, it is not where it should be. This bill \nwould increase those benefits. It will be done in a way that will not \nengender a budget point of order. But I think we can make some progress \nwith that tomorrow, and I hope Senators will be alert to this issue. I \nthink, frankly, we are not where we should be in generosity toward \nthose who give their lives for their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/16/senate-section/article/S6908-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
