Mr. President, I want to make a few comments on the news, \nand give a quick update on the events that have happened in my own \nmailroom earlier in the week.\n  First of all, just a few minutes ago, this morning, with regard to \nthe employment situation, we have been given very good news. The \nunemployment rate is at 5.6 percent, which was little changed, but the \nnonfarm payroll employment increased by 112,000, with job gains in \nconstruction and several service-providing industries. Indeed, that is \nvery good news. That is 112,000 new jobs in January.\n  If we look back to last August, we have seen a creation of 366,000 \npayroll jobs. These numbers are very good news. It demonstrates we have \nturned the corner. But, clearly, we have a lot more work to do as we go \nforward. So there is very good news today on the job front; the trends \nare in the positive, right direction. But, again, we have a lot more \nwork to do.\n  The economy is doing well. I say that very quickly, and say we have a \nlot more work to do in job creation. But, again, that figure of 112,000 \nis very good news.\n  Mr. President, on another front but timely in terms of the news \nitself, I am delighted to report we are ahead of schedule in getting \nSenators back into their offices here on the Capitol grounds. As \neveryone knows, in response to the attack on my office with what is a \ndeadly poison by the name of ricin, we immediately focused on the \nsafety and welfare of the staff throughout the Capitol complex. Through \na very comprehensive plan, a comprehensive response, even though I know \nit has not been handled just perfectly, and there are a lot of \nfrustrations, I am delighted to report nobody has been hurt, everybody \nis safe, and that includes people here in my office, in the Dirksen \nbuilding, the Senate office buildings, the Capitol complex, and, \nindeed, the postal system in this country.\n\n  All testing has been negative, with the exception of the testing \nright around where the discovery was made. The Russell Senate office \nbuilding has been opened now for 2 days. The Hart Senate office \nbuilding opened yesterday. The Dirksen office building we will be \nmaking announcements about over the course of the day.\n  On a third issue, Mr. President, I am delighted to see the response \nto the\n\n[[Page S676]]\n\nMedicare legislation we passed has been very positive in a number of \nways. According to press reports, over 100 companies, agencies, and \norganizations have filed or are filing applications to participate in \nthat prescription drug card that will be available to all seniors this \nsummer.\n  To me, that demonstrates a real interest and a fierce sign of \ncompetition and a lot of people participating in addressing the issue \nof health care, health care costs, prescription drugs, and making \nprescription drugs more available to our seniors. This is a strong \nindication there will be a very positive and broad interest that this \nfull benefit, once it is available, will be taken advantage of.\n  Also, earlier in the week we saw Medicare HMOs are, in response to \nthis bill, slashing their premiums, making these premiums come down, \ntherefore lowering that burden that falls on the senior in terms of \nout-of-pocket costs. At the same time, they are increasing their \nbenefits in response to this bill, and expanding their service to more \nand more seniors, with the opportunity for more and more seniors to \nparticipate in integrated health care plans.\n  This is a real stark contrast to what we had seen in the past where \nthere were shrinking choices. Now there are going to be expanding \nchoices. We are already seeing that take place.\n  We began this Congress making the promise we would bring about \nstrengthening the Medicare system and expanding the choices within the \nMedicare system and lowering the burden in terms of out-of-pocket \nexpenditures and costs to individual seniors, and we have delivered on \nthat promise. We made the promise that seniors would have access to \nbetter health care, and we have delivered on that promise by providing \npreventive care and prescription drugs for the first time really in \nMedicare today.\n  So the plan is working. The new discount cards will be available for \nour seniors later on this spring.\n  Mr. President, on a related issue, I want to comment on a silent \nepidemic that is in this country and that affects a lot of people who \nare listening to me right now--my colleagues and others who are \nwatching through the various media. It has to do with an epidemic that \na lot of people don't recognize that is occurring that can affect your \nhealth care and my health care and that of our colleagues and our \nfamilies. It can be brought to focus by a single question that I want \nto ask every American; that is, are you positively sure that you don't \nhave high blood pressure right now? If you can't answer that question \nyes or no, then you need to find out. Are you positively sure that you \ndon't have high blood pressure?\n\n  High blood pressure is hypertension. If you can't answer that \nquestion, just listen to me for a couple minutes on this important \nissue. The American Heart Association calls hypertension, or high blood \npressure, ``the silent killer.'' We call it hypertension, and it is \nhigh blood pressure just like the pressure in a tire. If you are \npumping up a tire with too much air, a bicycle tire or an automobile \ntire, it gets higher and higher. And literally, when they put that \nblood pressure cup on your arm and they measure to get those two \nnumbers, the one and the slash and then the other number, it tells you \nhow much pressure is in your body.\n  The higher the pressure in your body, once it gets out of a certain \nrange, the more likely you are to die, whether that be from heart \ndisease, because it causes hardening of the arteries, or a stroke. It \nis as simple as that.\n  When a person's blood pressure is too high, the heart is having to \npump too hard. The heart is a pump. You have the rest of the body and \nthe resistance of the blood vessels themselves. If it gets too high, it \nis like too much pressure in a tire. Or you can think of taking a thin \ncoffee stirring straw and you are trying to blow through that as hard \nas you possibly can and the pressure that builds up strains the heart, \nwhich is a pump, and the blood pressure. If that pressure builds up \nover a period of time, because it is that way all throughout the course \nof the day--heartbeat after heartbeat, day after day--it damages \neverything that is downstream from the heart and the blood vessels--the \nbrain and all of the organs. That is my physiology lesson.\n  The point is, it is widespread. This is not just a few people. There \nare about 50 million people in the country today who have high blood \npressure. Remember, if you have high blood pressure, you are going to \nhave heart disease or a stroke or myocardial infarction, coronary \nartery disease, or atherosclerotic heart disease.\n  The interesting thing about that is that a third of those 50 million \npeople don't know they have it. That is why I am taking time on the \nSenate floor to address it. Because if it is 50 million and a third of \nthem don't know they have it, all you have to do is put a blood \npressure cup on your arm and then we have treatment for it. We can save \nthousands of lives if people will just act.\n  I also want to relate that to what I just mentioned about Medicare \nitself. As legislation comes through this body, it is important for us \nto think like that, to take every opportunity to improve the \nlegislation, if it can be as direct as that in terms of saving lives.\n  With the Medicare prescription drug bill this body passed, that the \nPresident signed in December, for the first time in the history of this \ngreat Medicare Program, once you hit 65, that blood pressure cup and \nthat physical exam becomes part of the program. That is amazing to me.\n  Traditionally, people who came into Medicare didn't get that physical \nexam because it was not provided in the program. It is today. It was \nnot 2 months ago. Thus, if you had hypertension throughout your life \nand you hadn't gone to the doctor because you hadn't been in a motor \nvehicle accident or you didn't like doctors, when you got to be 65 and \non Medicare, at 70 and 75, and you have hypertension, it is never \ndiagnosed. But in this Medicare bill, we included an entry physical \nexam so you make the diagnosis. That is step No. 1.\n\n  Also in this Medicare bill for the first time in the history of \nMedicare--a wonderful program, 40 years we have had this fantastic \nprogram; I just told you diagnosis is there for the first time--there \nis the treatment. Never before in the history of Medicare have \nprescription drugs, which is the way you treat most hypertension today, \nbeen available through the Medicare Program itself. Yet that benefit, \nthat better health care, because we passed this prescription drug bill \nand Medicare bill, is available.\n  So those two things: Diagnosis is going to be made. Remember, 16 \nmillion people in the country don't know they have it. So we are going \nto make the diagnosis. And then after the diagnosis, we don't leave \npeople high and dry. We give them help. We don't give them all their \nprescription drugs. We never promised we would give them all their \nprescription drugs, and we shouldn't give them all their prescription \ndrugs. We probably can't afford it. But we have helped every senior who \nhas hypertension who didn't have access to prescription drugs to get \nprescription drugs. We have helped every single one and low income. We \nhave really helped.\n  We see why this Medicare bill was important. People argue $400 \nbillion is too much, or it is too little. Everybody is getting it from \nboth sides. The point is, for the first time we have preventive care, \nwe have early detection, and we increase the likelihood that a senior \ncan get treatment for this life-threatening disease.\n  I should also mention that African Americans, of that 50 million \npeople with hypertension, are disproportionately affected. So they have \nthis additional benefit both in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Look \nat hypertension and high blood pressure today. African Americans are \ndisproportionately affected.\n  I am gratified for this major advance in the Medicare bill. There are \nlots of things in the Medicare bill such as this that we didn't talk \nvery much about on the floor of the Senate, but because we made reforms \nlike that to Medicare, lives will be saved. More Americans are going to \nget the care that they deserve, and more Americans are going to get the \ntreatments they need. That is what is in this bill. Hypertension is a \ngood example. More lives will be saved.\n  Let me go back to the question I asked: do you know what your blood \npressure is? What is it? I know what my number is. I am a physician. I \nthink about it all the time. But you need to be able to know. Is it \nhigh or low? No. 2, if you haven't had it\n\n[[Page S677]]\n\nchecked recently, go have it checked. It is as simple as having a blood \npressure cup put on your arm. Thirdly, if you are over the age of 65, \nbecause of the President's Medicare bill, you are going to receive more \nhelp to get the prescription drugs you need if you need them to help \nsave your life. Are you positively sure you don't have high blood \npressure?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S677-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Daschle. I \nsay to Senator Frist, blood pressures rise from time to time actually \non the floor of the Senate, depending on what we are doing. Mine \nrelates to the issue of when we treat serious things too lightly or \nlight things too seriously.\n  Speaking of that, most of us agree that a serious matter that ought \nto be treated seriously is the highway bill. This week was a \ndisappointment because we had the difficulty of getting into our office \nbuildings and the ricin issue here on Capitol Hill.\n  I know both the Republican leader and the Democratic leader share \nthis view. This highway bill is critically important.\n  I recall a political campaign in an election that was waged a couple \nof campaigns ago where they had a sign on the wall that said, ``It is \nthe economy, stupid.'' That was their sign, just to remind them every \nday to focus like a laser on the economy.\n  With respect to this country's economy and jobs, at a time when more \nthan 2\\1/2\\ million people lost their jobs in recent years and 8 to 10 \nmillion people are now looking for a job this morning, there isn't \nanything that we can do that is, in my judgment, more urgent than \npassing this highway bill. Why? Because this is a job generator. \nInstantly, people go back to work.\n  It means that contractors are out there with new contracts. They are \nhiring people. Everyone in this Chamber knows that the one formula for \nproducing jobs now, immediately, is to pass this highway bill.\n  It has been a disappointment to me this week that we have had some--\nit was described in the National Journal or Congressional Quarterly as \na small group of Republicans--who have decided to hold this bill up and \nstop it. That would not be in this country's interest.\n  We must get this done. I appreciate the strength of the majority \nleader and the strength of the Democratic leader, as well, to stay with \nit. I would say to Senator Frist that I believe there is a broad, \nbipartisan consensus in this Chamber to produce a highway bill that \nhelps us invest in the improvements necessary in roads and bridges \nacross the country. Over 30 percent of them are in disrepair. But more \nimportant than that, in my judgment, is the ability to be a job \ngenerator, to expand this economy and put people back to work is job \none.\n  There is not much more of importance we can do this year. I don't \nknow of a more important bill this year that will be related to \nAmerican jobs than this bill. So it is my hope that, even though there \nis some obstruction going on by a few in the Chamber on the other side, \nwe stay here, stick with it, work late if necessary, and get this bill \ndone. It is that important for this country. Frankly, I think there is \na broad, bipartisan consensus on that point. When we have that, let's \nstick with it and do it, even if there are some in this Chamber who \nhave decided they want to hold it up.\n  I thank my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, for giving \nme the time. I am about to go chair a hearing. It also relates to jobs. \nThis jobs issue is so critically important. People got out of bed this \nmorning in this country asking themselves: Where can I find a job? \nThere are millions and millions of them. It is a big deal, a big issue. \nIt is a serious matter for this country.\n  The bill we are considering now has the opportunity to allow us to \naddress this in a very significant way, and we cannot and should not \nmiss this opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S677-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S677-S680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis comments this morning. I share his view about the importance of \nthis highway bill, in particular.\n  I wish to say a few things about both the highway bill as well as the \nbudget this morning. We just received our report again this month about \nthe economy and the jobs created. I think the good news is that we did \nsee the creation of 112,000 new jobs in January. I think that is a \npositive development. The bad news is that it falls short of what was \nneeded to keep us on a path to ensure that jobs are not lost during the \nPresident's first term.\n  Mr. President, 150,000 new jobs in January was the stated goal of the \nAdministration. The figure released today indicates a substantial \nshortfall; this is nearly 40,000 jobs short of their stated goal. Of \ncourse, it is dramatically short--two-thirds short--of what the goal \nwould be to reverse this unemployment debacle we have witnessed for the \nlast 3 years. 300,000 new private sector jobs would have to be created \neach month to erase the decline we have witnessed the past 36 months. \nSo while we made some progress this month with 112,000 new jobs, we are \nfalling far short of the Administration's stated goal of 150,000 and \neven further short of the 300,000 jobs necessary to reverse the \nunfortunate trend.\n  There is another disturbing problem that we have not been able to \naddress, and the administration has not been able to address. This is \nthe 42nd month in a row that we have actually seen a loss of \nmanufacturing jobs. For 42 straight months manufacturing jobs have \ndeclined.\n  The jobs issue may be the single most critical issue as we look at \nthe economy. There is a long, long way to go before we can say with any \nconfidence that we have turned this economy around, that people who \nhave jobs will keep them, and people who don't have jobs will get them.\n  I think most of us would receive today's news about jobs this month \nwith that sense of disappointment, but also with the realization that \n112,000 jobs is better than what we had in December when only a \nthousand jobs were added.\n\n\n                        The Transportation Bill\n\n  Let me take a moment to talk about the transportation bill again this \nmorning. I will not repeat my concerns about the delay and resulting \nloss of those jobs. I want to focus on the positive and, once again, \ncompliment the managers of the bill who balanced divergent interests to \nbring us a finely crafted bill that certainly deserves our support. \nChairman Inhofe and Senator Jeffords, Senator Bond and Senator Reid \ndeserve our praise for working in a bipartisan fashion, as do Banking \nCommittee Chairman Shelby and Senator Sarbanes, and Finance Committee \nChairman Grassley and Senator Baucus. But I also especially thank the \nmajority leader for scheduling the time it will take to get this bill \ndone. When the leader and I met on Monday, I was impressed with his \nresolve and desire to bear down and get this critical work done for \nthis country.\n  Our roads, our bridges, our transit system, our rail lines, and our \nports all need assistance to ensure that our Nation has the first-class \ninfrastructure needed to reinvigorate our economy and make our country \nstrong and competitive. After having lost 3 million jobs over the last \n3 years, there is nothing more important than passing this bill, which \nwill provide hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  Senator Frist and Senator Inhofe suggested the other day that it \nmight\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\ncreate nearly 2 million good jobs in engineering, construction, and \nadministration. So I know that many of us would like to have made more \nprogress on the bill this week than we have so far. But things really \ndo seem to be coming together.\n  The Banking Committee approved transit provisions for the bill the \nother day. We had a discussion about those provisions yesterday on the \nSenate floor. The Finance Committee reported a bipartisan bill earlier \nin the week, and we have discussed many of these provisions on the \nfloor throughout this week.\n  We also have had several amendments debated and discussed. There is \nno question about it, there is a lot of work to be done. But the work \nwe are doing to provide jobs and assure first-class infrastructure is \namong the most important work the Senate could be doing. In fact, I \ncannot think of anything more important for us to be working on at this \ntime than this bill.\n\n  To be frank, it is a good feeling to see us working on such an \nimportant issue in such a cooperative and bipartisan fashion. I salute \nSenator Frist and his team for recognizing the importance of this bill. \nAs Senator Frist said on Monday, we need to move swiftly to pass this \nbill, which he so aptly said has broad support in the Senate, as well \nas across the country.\n  I also want to be abundantly clear that the firm and steadfast desire \nof every Democratic Senator I have spoken to is to stay with this bill, \nto be cooperative, and resolve differences, to complete the bill and \nmove it forward so we can get it to the President's desk as soon as \npossible.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Mr. President, having talked about the highway bill, let me now move \nto the last matter I want to address this morning. The budget I have \nhere was presented to us by the administration. It is the budget for \nfiscal years 2005 through 2009, containing 2,365 pages, and literally \nmillions of numbers and figures.\n  This document cannot be taken seriously as a budget. As vast and \nextensive as this budget seems, the administration has actually omitted \nessential facts and data that will have enormous consequences for the \nfiscal future and our economy.\n  There is nothing in this budget--not a dime--to cover the costs of \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. What does that tell you? Well, it \ntells you one of two things: Either the President is going to announce \nwithin the next month or so a complete withdrawal of all troops and all \nAmerican presence in Afghanistan and Iraq to coincide with his current \nbudget proposal or he is hiding those numbers until a later date. In \neither case, this omission makes this budget totally meaningless when \nit comes to helping us understand the costs of the commitments we are \nmaking in two of the most important parts of the world today.\n  I don't understand how the Administration can leave out the funding \nfor these operations at the same time it acknowledges we have tens of \nthousands of troops in these countries today and will have troops there \nfor years and years to come.\n  CBO estimated the cost associated with our efforts in Iraq could \nreach $200 billion, yet there is not one dime in this budget--I am only \nholding up a piece of the budget--not one dime in this budget, this \nentire budget, to cover the costs of our ongoing operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for the current fiscal year or the four years after that. \nThe charade, the sham, the misleading character of this budget makes me \nwant to send it right back.\n  Or consider the alternative minimum tax. By 2009, the last year of \nthe administration's 5-year budget plan, 30 million Americans will see \ntheir taxes increased as a result of the alternative minimum tax. Most \nof us agree that we will need to fix this tax to prevent it from \nfalling on middle-class Americans.\n  The CBO estimates that the President would need to request at least \n$150 billion through 2009 and more than $600 billion through 2014 to \nprevent this tax increase caused as more Americans fall subject to the \nalternative minimum tax. Yet, other than a 1-year temporary patch for \n2005, this budget does not address that this recognized problem either.\n  Let me make sure people understand. On the spending side, perhaps the \nlargest military operations we expect to carry out over the course of \nthe next several years, expenditures to directly pay for the activities \nof tens of thousands of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is not \none dime in this budget.\n  On the tax side, a collective realization, a bipartisan realization \nthat we are going to have to change the alternative minimum tax before \nit hits middle-class Americans hard, a problem that is estimated to \ncost $150 billion over the course of the next 5 years alone, there is a \none-year patch, after which the budget acts as if this problem doesn't \nexist.\n  Most egregiously, the budget stops after 5 years, just before the \nfull cost of the President's tax breaks begins to be felt and just as \nthe full cost of the baby boomer retirement begins to emerge. When you \ninclude the 5 years after the budget projections stop, the President's \ntax breaks will add trillions more to the national debt, an estimated \n$2 trillion.\n  So the President omits specific and known expenditures, ones to which \nwe know we are going to have to commit resources--$200 billion, \nperhaps, in the case of our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan; $150 \nbillion for AMT; and $2 trillion over the next 10 years for his tax \ncuts. Of course, if I had a $521 billion deficit already written into \nthis so-called budget, I wouldn't put these costs in either, but I also \nwouldn't have called the document a budget. I would call it my wish \nlist. I would call it my priorities. But you can't call this a budget.\n  It would be like a man and woman sitting at their kitchen table \ntrying to make ends meet, and they say: You know that mortgage payment \nwe have to make for the coming year, let's just not count that. And, \noh, yes, the kids' college, that $500 check each month we have to pay, \nlet's not count that. Oh, and the car payment, we better not count that \neither. Let's leave off the mortgage, college, and a car payment, and \nyou know what, bingo, the budget balances. But in this case, the budget \ndoesn't even balance with those omissions. In this case, we still have \na $521 billion deficit.\n  We cannot predict every challenge our Nation will face in the coming \nyears, but we do not need a crystal ball to know we have to commit \nresources to support our troops. We do not need a crystal ball to know \nthat Congress will act to spare 30 million Americans from the \nalternative minimum tax. And we do not need a crystal ball to know that \nwhen you ask to make tax cuts permanent, the cost will be with us for a \nlot more than 5 years.\n  There is a credibility chasm, whether it is weapons of mass \ndestruction, whether it is the budget, whether it is so many things \nthat emanate these days from this administration, its credibility has \neroded dramatically.\n  I can't imagine, for the life of me, a more irresponsible document \nthan what we have been sent this week. If anyone--anyone--would do this \nin real life, they would be in bankruptcy court within a year. That is \nwhy we will see our national debt skyrocket from $5.6 trillion when \nPresident Bush took office, to $11 trillion by the end of the 5-year \nbudget--just the 5-year budget he has proposed.\n  In the end, budgets are not about numbers, they are about choices. \nThe first observation that is that these glaring omissions, these \nextraordinary misrepresentations have enormous implications not only \nfor our fiscal future but also for this Administration's credibility. \nThat is just the first piece of this.\n  The second piece is what this budget tells us about the choices the \nadministration made as they were writing these numbers. When we look \nclosely at this so-called budget, we learn something valuable about the \nadministration's priorities and choices. We shouldn't be surprised.\n  They propose that the IRS cut back on enforcement of America's tax \nlaws. Can you imagine, not only are we not going to provide some \nfairness in our tax system, but those who are given these tax breaks \nare also being sent the message: Maybe you don't even have to comply as \nmuch because we are going to drop enforcement, which means more \ncorporate loopholes will be exploited and more will resort to tax \ncheating. What does that say?\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\n  When we also cut back the COPS Program as this budget does, at the \nsame time we cut back funding to enforce our tax laws, what does that \nsay about the desire, the determination on the part of this \nadministration to go after those who break the law, whether it is by \nfailing to pay their fair share of taxes or doing something illegal in \nour neighborhood?\n  The cutback in enforcement funding also means higher taxes for honest \nAmerican taxpayers and larger debts passed on to our children and \ngrandchildren. That is the choice the White House has made. The \nadministration proposes that hundreds of billions of dollars be given \nto the biggest corporations and wealthiest among us. This means a more \nuncertain future for Social Security because $2 trillion will need to \nbe taken out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  This also was a choice the administration has made. They insist that \neven in the face of massive deficits, a job crisis, and our ongoing \nactivities in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must continue their failed \npolicies of tax cuts first, last, and always.\n  Another sad illustration of its poor choices, in addition to record \ndeficits and debt, 2.4 million children are going to be left behind \nbecause of underfunded education priorities; 210,000 more veterans will \nnot receive the health care they need; 1,200 fewer cops will be on our \nstreets. What an amazing turnaround.\n  Less than 3 years ago, we were praising the cops of New York and \nWashington for their incredible response to 9/11, and now we tell many \nof them they are out of a job because we are not going to fund the \nprograms that put them there in the first place. Thousands of \nfirefighters and emergency personnel also praised less than 3 years ago \nwill be fired as a result of the cuts in this so-called budget. These \nare the choices the White House has made. The President has chosen to \nprovide huge windfalls for millionaires and giant corporations, and \nhuge cutbacks for the programs that matter most to American families. \nFamilies who make and follow budgets should look at the \nadministration's budget and be aghast, not just for the sleight-of-hand \ntricks that hide its true cost, but for the fact that the President has \nabandoned their priorities and their concerns. If this budget passes, \nAmericans face a future with poorer schools, higher crime, and less \nsecure retirements.\n\n  We have to do better than this. We must provide Americans with a \nbudget that honors their choices, their priorities, and prepares our \nNation to meet challenges of our future. And we must be as forthcoming \nand responsible with taxpayers' dollars as they are with their own \nfamily budgets sitting at that kitchen table.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I say to the distinguished Democratic \nleader, as someone who has worked on this highway bill to get it to the \npoint where it is now, I very much appreciate the team work that has \nbeen shown with the majority and Democratic leaders. They have both \nspoken out strongly in favor of this legislation. That means a lot to \nSenator Inhofe, Senator Bond, Senator Jeffords, and to me, the two \nchairmen of the committee and subcommittee, and the two ranking \nmembers, who have worked to get this bill to the point where it is.\n  So I want to say again how much we appreciate the Democratic leader \nand the majority leader coming to the floor often and talking about the \nimportance of this bill and especially acknowledging the fact that 90 \npercent of this bill is paid for through the trust fund, and a small \npercentage of it is through other taxes, no new taxes. So I thank the \nminority leader very much for his help.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the compliments of \nthe distinguished assistant Democratic leader. He has worked diligently \nwith the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \ncoordinated the efforts, and while this week could have been more \nproductive, I do think at the committee level it was all that we could \nhave hoped for on a bipartisan basis. The Finance Committee did its \nwork. On a bipartisan basis, the Banking Committee has done its work. \nAfter the divisive and partisan battles we have had on energy, \nMedicare, and on so many things as we closed the first session of this \nCongress, it is somewhat refreshing to see the bipartisan nature of our \nwork on this bill.\n  Senator Frist has made it abundantly clear it is his desire, and I \nwould say I share it just as strongly, that we finish next week. I \nwould love to see this bill completed by this time next week. I think \nif we work hard, accommodate each other's desire to entertain \namendments, debate these amendments, have votes on the amendments, \nthere is no reason we cannot finish this bill a week from today, prior \nto the Presidents' Day recess. That would certainly be my hope.\n  Again, I appreciate the leadership provided, especially by the \nSenator from Nevada, in reaching that goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I could just ask one more question. I know how busy the \nleader is, but as I was reading my news clips today, and as I was \nlistening to the distinguished majority leader talk about what a great \nbill this Medicare bill is and how that now people, if they are 65 \nyears old, can have a high blood pressure cup placed on their arm and \nin a few seconds find out what their blood pressure is, I do not think \nthat is very expensive. I, frankly, say that most people who go to \ndoctors have that done automatically anyway. I apologize for this, but \nit will take only about 3 minutes. I want to read an article that was \nin Nevada's second largest newspaper, the Reno Gazette-Journal. This is \nwhat appeared in my news clips today: ``Seniors Blast Medicare \nPrescription Plan.'' I am not making any of this up.\n\n       Riley Waller is among many Washoe County citizens still \n     angry over the Medicare prescription plan signed into law in \n     December, saying it will gouge seniors and the taxpayers \n     who'll pay for it.\n       More than 100 senior citizens listened Thursday morning as \n     Nevada Division of Aging officials explained how the new \n     prescription drug program will work. Several seniors said \n     they're unhappy with the new prescription program adopted by \n     Congress and signed into law by President Bush, with the \n     backing of the largest group representing older Americans.\n       ``It took away the opportunity for people to get drugs from \n     Canada at half the price,'' said Waller, 77, of Reno. ``It \n     will not allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices. That's \n     ridiculous.''\n       Robert Chamberlain, 67, a retired Reno lawyer, said he soon \n     will be among 45,000 seniors to drop their membership in the \n     American Association of Retired Persons.\n       ``When the AARP came out in favor of the Bush plan, they \n     did a disservice to the elderly people who are in need of \n     Medicare,'' Chamberlain said. ``The AARP will profit from \n     them in selling them insurance.''\n       Norma Herring, another Reno senior, said she doesn't take \n     prescription drugs and will not pay a monthly premium to get \n     them.\n       ``No way am I going to pay a monthly fee.''\n       The Medicare prescription program begins in January 2006, \n     while a temporary discount card program starts this June. \n     ``How these programs provided by insurance companies will \n     intertwine with the state's Senior Rx program has not been \n     determined,'' said Betty Squires, Nevada Division of Aging \n     Medicare adviser for seniors.\n       People must sign up for both programs. Seniors will be \n     given a six-month window to register for the Medicare drug \n     program starting November 15, 2005. If they register later, \n     they'll pay a penalty.\n       Under the program, each year seniors must pay $420 in \n     monthly premiums; buy the first $250 of medications; pay 25 \n     percent of medication costs between $250 and $2,250; and all \n     of the costs from $2,250 to $5,100--the so-called doughnut \n     hole. After that, Medicare will pay 95 percent of \n     prescription drug costs.\n       In providing an example, Squires said a married man whose \n     prescriptions total $4,850 a year would spend $3,370 to buy \n     them while Medicare would pick up $1,080 of the cost.\n       Individuals with annual incomes less than $9,600 and \n     couples with incomes less than $13,000 would generally pay \n     between $1 and $5 per prescription with no additional costs. \n     Other low-income groups with few assets also would get \n     discounts.\n       Squires said some employers might drop prescription drug \n     benefits for their retirees in anticipation of the new \n     program.\n       ``Teachers in Las Vegas lost the benefit. It's already \n     happening,'' she said.\n       But her hope is companies will instead cover the premiums \n     or provide coverage for the doughnut hole.\n       In the last few weeks, a national liberal group called \n     Moveon.org has spent $1 million on television commercials in \n     Nevada, putting words in President Bush's mouth about the \n     prescriptive drug program.\n       The commercials say the Medicare bill has real drug \n     benefits for the big drug companies, Bush contributors, in \n     forbidding Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices and \n     barring people from importing drugs from Canada.\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\n       Squires said the drug companies won't be limited in how \n     much profit they'll make from the new program.\n\n  I will not finish the article, and I am sorry to take the leader's \ntime, but this is happening all over America. It is not just in Reno. \nThe prescription drug benefit, no matter how it is painted with \nchocolate, is a program that is not good for the American people. The \nAmerican people know this, as indicated by the group that met in Reno \nyesterday. This is a disaster waiting to happen.\n  Does the leader acknowledge the same thing is happening in South \nDakota?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the most recent report from \nNevada with regard to how his constituents are viewing this new \nMedicare Program. I must say it is perfectly in concert with the \nsentiments expressed in similar articles in South Dakota. During the \nlast break, when I was home holding meetings regarding this program, we \nhad standing room only crowds in every single meeting, and those crowds \nwere almost universally angered, frustrated, and concerned about their \ncircumstances as a result of this legislation passing.\n  Much of their anger, as the Senator noted in the article, is directed \ntowards the organization AARP, for their failure to stand up for \ncitizens, and I think that is understandable. Their frustration and \ntheir anxiety goes deeper than just an organization. They are concerned \nabout their own livelihoods and what it may mean for them and how \ntroubling it is to them that the Government is actually forbidden from \nnegotiating lower drug prices, which is what the goal was in the first \nplace.\n  So it is their inability to get lower drug prices, their concern \nabout having to pay exorbitant premiums and fees for a limited benefit, \ntheir concern about being pushed into an HMO, their concern about \nwhether they can access drugs from other countries like Canada where \nprices are cheaper: all of those and many more concerns were reflected \nin these discussions. It is again reflected in the article the Senator \nhas just read into the record.\n  So I share his consternation and his resolve to address these issues. \nWe have to find a way to fix it, and the senior citizens of this \ncountry are demanding we do it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S680-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S680-S686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSAFE, ACCOUNTABLE, FLEXIBLE, AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT OF \n                                  2003\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1072, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1072) to authorize funds for Federal-aid \n     highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Modified committee amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 2267, to exempt certain agricultural \n     producers from certain hazardous materials transportation \n     requirements.\n       Gregg amendment No. 2268 (to amendment No. 2267), to \n     provide that certain public safety officials have the right \n     to collective bargaining.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I commend my friend, the junior Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, for his steadfastness in attempting to move this \nmost important bill that the Chair just reported. He has worked hard on \nthis for months. This week he has worked hard on it. This has not been \nan easy week. I said many times before, as I said earlier speaking with \nthe Democratic leader this morning, there is no other legislation we \nwill consider this Congress that will do more for the American worker \nor have so great an impact on every facet of American life than the \nbill which was just reported by the Chair, the highway bill.\n  Since coming to Congress, I have been so impressed with what \ninfrastructure development does for the entire community. It provides \njobs, but the social benefits are significant. For every $1 billion \ninvested in infrastructure, it has been established, and we heard it \nmany times, we create more than 47,000 high-paying jobs, skilled jobs \nthat generate more than $6.2 billion of economic activity. Again, for \nevery billion dollars spent on infrastructure development--for example, \nhighway or transit--we create 47,000 jobs. But the spinoff for this $1 \nbillion is $6.2 billion in economic activity. Even by conservative \nestimates, funding our Nation's infrastructure program at the $311 \nbillion Bond-Reid level will create hundreds of thousands, if not \nmillions, of jobs.\n  I thank the two leaders again, Senators Daschle and Frist, for their \nsupport and for their recognition of the importance of this measure. I \nwholeheartedly agree with the majority leader's statements earlier this \nweek when he urged the Members of this body to focus their full \nattention on this legislation. I would say, however, that his focus \nshould be on that side of the aisle. We, over here, are marching in \nlockstep toward completing this legislation. There has been a lot of \nstumbling taking place on the other side of the aisle. There has been \nroadblock after roadblock placed before this highway bill by the \nmajority. The majority leader said:\n\n       We cannot ask our fellow citizens to join the great \n     American workforce and then stand idly by while our \n     roads decay and that commute to work stretches from \n     minutes into hours. It is a job issue. . . . Our highways, \n     our bridges, our roads, our ports, and our trains are in \n     fact very much the physical expression of the very name we \n     bear, uniting the States of America.\n\n  I agree with the majority leader, but we need help. This bill is \nbeing held up by the majority. I don't know why, but some on the other \nside of the aisle have failed to recognize the wisdom of their leader, \nSenator Frist. These Members continue to impede our progress on this. \nOn the first thing we are doing this year in this session of the \nLegislature, there is a big roadblock, I repeat, on our highway bill. \nProgress is being impeded.\n  During last year's budget debate, 79 Senators--and there would have \nbeen more but we had some out running for President even then--79 \nMembers of this body voted to support a $311 billion piece of \nlegislation for highways and transit. Under the leadership of Senator \nGrassley and Baucus, we have a funding package that meets this goal, \nenjoys bipartisan support, and meets the President's funding criteria.\n  I am always amazed at this bipartisan stuff we talk about here. \nMcCain-Feingold is said to be a bipartisan bill, the great legislation \ndone to improve campaign financing. It was bipartisan. OK, we had \nMcCain and Hagel--and there may be a few other Republicans, and I \napologize to those; I am sure the Presiding Officer was one of them--\nwho favored McCain-Feingold. Basically, the Democrats pushed campaign \nfinance reform.\n  On the highway bill, unless something changes, I don't know where the \nbipartisanship is. We know Bond and Inhofe support this legislation. \nBut let's have this a truly bipartisan piece of legislation and move \nforward as we did during the budget process; 79 Senators supported what \nwe are supposed to be doing in this. With the finance package having \nbeen completed, every piece of the puzzle is in place.\n  I remember I was always very bad working jigsaw puzzles. My little \nbother, he was great, but I, in my little-boy head, was envious of my \nbrother Larry. He could do these puzzles. So, what I would do, I would \nhide the last couple of pieces of the puzzle so that way he couldn't \ncomplete the puzzle. He would come to me for the missing pieces and I \nwould say okay, but I would always get something; he would have to \ncarry the wood or do something to get the last few pieces.\n  We have the pieces to this puzzle. None of them are hidden. This is \nan important, complicated piece of legislation. It has very difficult \ncomponents--highways, rail, mass transit, and the tax portion. \nEverything is done and everything is paid for. There are no new taxes. \nWith this last piece of the puzzle now in place, we are ready to move \nforward.\n  As my friend from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, so passionately \ncommunicated last night, now is the time to act. Why would Senator \nVoinovich know? What basis would this man have to talk about this \nhighway bill? It could be that George Voinovich was mayor of one of the \nlargest cities in America, the mayor of Cleveland, OH. It could be that \nhe was Governor of one of the most populous States in America, Ohio. He \nknows, from being a\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nmayor and a Governor, how important this transportation bill is.\n  I think we should listen to George Voinovich, telling us, let's move \non this legislation. It is important to Ohio. It is important to \nNevada. It is important to Rhode Island. It is important to Texas. It \nis important to South Dakota. It is important to Tennessee. Every State \nin the Union benefits from this. But we have some people saying: Oh, we \ncan't do this, it's pork.\n  What in the world is that supposed to mean? Most of the bill is paid \nfor out of the highway trust fund. Pork? I don't understand that. Is \nreconstructing a damaged bridge pork? Thirty percent of the bridges in \nAmerica are in a state of disrepair. As has already been established \nhere on the Senate floor, there are bridges in America where a school \nbus comes to the bridge, stops, lets the kids out, drives the bus \nacross empty, has the kids walk across the bridge and jump back in the \nbus, and take off. Why? Because the bridge is dangerous. They can't \nhave a bus full of kids go on a bridge that may collapse at any time.\n  Is that pork? One-third--almost one-third of all the bridges in \nAmerica need something done: either be replaced or repaired or \nrenovated in some fashion. The busiest two-lane road in Nevada is from \na place called Railroad Pass to Searchlight, my hometown. It is a \ndeathtrap. We are fortunate that half of that--18 miles of the 36 \nmiles--now is a four-lane road. We are in the process of making the \nrest four lanes.\n  Is that pork? A busy two-lane road in Nevada, and people are killed \nand injured on that road all the time. Is that pork? I don't understand \nwhat the word means. I don't think so. Try to tell that to the truck \ndrivers who are tied up in traffic, not being able to move their loads \nacross this country because of the traffic on the road from Railroad \nPass to Search Light. There are examples all over America that are the \nsame. Is that pork because you want to move people more quickly?\n  As the majority leader mentioned in his statement, people are stuck \nin traffic. What does that do? It pollutes the air. There is no worse \npollution than a car idling. It prevents people from getting to work so \nthey can be productive. If it is a truck or a bus, it holds up the \nability of commerce to move on, costing all of us more money.\n  Those folks who are talking about this bill having too much money \nneed to reassess what their priorities are for the country. I \npersonally believe this bill doesn't have enough money. It certainly \ndoesn't have too much. A long-time Member of the other body, the \nchairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the only \nCongressman from Alaska, believes what we have done here in the Senate \nisn't enough. He is over there working with the Republican majority in \nthe House trying to get more money. I applaud him for doing that. We \nneed more money for highways and transit--not less. This is a 6-year \nbill. I support it. If we can get it passed, I will be happy with it.\n  As Senator Voinovich said last night, we must seize this opportunity \nto act. I say it today. We must seize this opportunity to act.\n  According to a study by the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials, the current extension--and we should have \ndone this bill last year--cost $2.1 billion in project delays and \ncaused the loss of almost 100,000 jobs. The extension has interrupted \nState transportation officials' ability to do long-term planning.\n  I hope we will not do another 1-year extension. If we do, it would \nmake things even worse. These projects are difficult. You cannot \ncomplete a major highway project in a year. You can't do it. The \nhighway projects are multiyear projects. It is the same with transit \nprojects. If you don't have multiyear funding, you can't plan, and it \nwinds up costing more money. A project that costs $100 will wind up \ncosting $300. Multiply that by millions, and we understand.\n  We now are fast approaching the busiest contracting season in the \nyear. Right now the weather is bad. Look at how things have slowed down \noutside this Capitol building. This isn't the time contractors' work is \ndone. In the West, you can do it almost every place, but not here in \nthe East, and not in the Midwest. It is too cold.\n  Much of the major highway construction and contracting is done in the \nmonths of March, April, and May. Without a long-term bill and the \ncorresponding guaranteed revenue streams, many vital transportation \nprojects will be put on hold and others delayed, wasting more money and \ncosting thousands more jobs, at a time when millions of willing and \nable Americans are looking for work. How can we let this happen?\n  The Democratic leader talked about the fact we created a little over \n100,000 jobs this past month. We should be happy about that. But it is \nreally pathetic. It is pathetic. We haven't looked at what happened \nduring the month of December when normally lots of new jobs come on \nboard. People were expecting 175,000 new jobs. This is what we got--a \nlittle over 100,000. We will take it. But we will never make up for the \nloss of 3 million jobs that were lost in the last 3 years with 100,000 \njobs a month. It won't work.\n  People down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue should be beating down the \ndoors saying pass this bill. What are they doing? They are carping, \nsaying maybe we ought to take another look at this. They are beating up \non Chairman Young on the House side, saying don't even think about more \nmoney for highways.\n  I hope we can continue working on this. We need to do this. When \nmillions of Americans are willing and able to work, shouldn't we \nprovide jobs for them?\n  We spend a lot of time talking about deficits. But one we don't focus \non nearly enough is the infrastructure deficit. Senator Daschle had his \ncopy of the budget here. He talked about this swirling monetary debt we \nhave, and the deficit we are going to have this year. But what we don't \ntalk about very much is the deficit we have in the infrastructure.\n\n  When we were in charge of the Senate, I held a hearing and invited \nmayors from around the country to talk about the infrastructure deficit \nthey have in their cities. I can remember Atlanta, GA. Their mayor said \nhe was looking forward to getting out of office. He said, I am glad to \nbe leaving because it is only a question of time before there will be a \ncollapse of infrastructure such as water and sewer.\n  That is the way it is all over the country. This country is facing a \ngrowing infrastructure deficit. We are not keeping up with the \ninfrastructure needs. That is an understatement. Congestion continues \nto get worse--forget about water and sewer. Americans will lose an \nestimated $67 billion in lost time and productivity, and we will waste \nalmost 5.7 billion gallons of gas waiting in traffic this year.\n  In addition to the personal tragedy associated with traffic \naccidents, accidents cost $137 billion a year in property losses, \nlosses in market productivity, and medical costs. How many of those \naccidents could be avoided by better traffic lights and better \nhighways? We know we can do better.\n  While our transportation infrastructure has an estimated worth of \n$1.7 billion, much of this system needs an extensive overhaul and a lot \nof maintenance. Over a quarter of the Nation's bridges, as I have \nalready stated--in fact, it is 29 percent--are functionally deficient \nor obsolete. I have talked about that a lot. The Federal Highway \nAdministration's 2002 Conditions and Performance Report estimates the \nFederal deficit in roads and bridges must be at least $35 billion a \nyear just to maintain the current level of system performance. I say \nthat is not very good. New investments to improve system performance \nwill cost a lot more. We have a duty to close this infrastructure \ndeficit.\n  A well-maintained national surface transportation system is essential \nto the free flow of people and goods so vital to a healthy and robust \neconomy. We have a duty to the Nation to act now.\n  Again, I thank Senators Inhofe, Jeffords, and Bond for their \ncommitment to move this most important legislation.\n  I again want to thank Senators Frist and Daschle for their continued \ncommitment and support in our effort to move a fully funded 6-year \nreauthorization through the Senate before the current short-year \nextension expires at the end of February. We must act, and we must act \nquickly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n              Decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Court\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, 2 days ago, the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt sent shock waves across America when it held that traditional \nmarriage--a marriage between a man and a woman--would be eliminated by \njudicial fiat. It is no secret the American people support traditional \nmarriage. Yet some who would criticize that support for traditional \nmarriage accuse those who support it of being intolerant.\n  What I would suggest to you is the only ones guilty of intolerance \nare those who support the kind of judicial activism we have seen \ndemonstrated by the Massachusetts court most recently--one that is \nfundamentally disdainful of democracy itself under the rule of law.\n  Most Americans instinctively and laudably support two fundamental \npropositions. First, that every individual is worthy of respect, \ndignity; and second, that the traditional institution of marriage is \nworthy of protection.\n  Some opponents of traditional marriage laws, however, have accused \nthose who disagree with them of intolerance, even though support for \ntraditional marriage reflects traditional values shared by the \noverwhelming number of Americans. These deeply held values deserve more \nrespect than that.\n  Throughout history, mankind itself, humankind itself, has recognized \nthe fundamental importance of marriage and its traditional definition \nas the union of one man and one woman. That understanding is reflected \nin the laws, traditions, and customs of all 50 States. Now I should \nsay, apparently, 49 States--unless the Massachusetts Legislature and \nthe Massachusetts people are able to somehow overcome this edict by the \nMassachusetts Supreme Court in their attempt to alter this historic \ninstitution and fundamental building block of our society.\n  Common sense and social science alike teach us that, even as we \nrespect family relationships of all kinds, we must recognize that \nchildren are best raised by intact traditional families.\n  Accordingly, in 1996, this body, the U.S. Congress, recognized that \nfact by passing a law called the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that \nwas supported by overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both the Senate \nand in the House, and ultimately signed into law by President Clinton, \na law that reaffirms that marriage is defined as the traditional union \nof a man and a woman. Indeed, three-fourths of the States have approved \nsimilar legislation. In light of this popular and well-grounded \nnational consensus, charging supporters of traditional marriage with \nintolerance is simply outrageous.\n  I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who \nsaid in 1996 as part of the debate over the Defense of Marriage Act \nthat ``there are strongly held religious, ethical, moral beliefs that \nare different from mine with regard to the issue of same-sex marriage \nwhich I respect and which are no indications of intolerance.''\n  It was just last September that the Constitution Subcommittee of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, held a hearing to consider \nwhether some recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions put the Defense of \nMarriage Act in jeopardy. To me it just made good sense that Congress \nitself, after having passed this law so overwhelmingly, would look to \nsee whether judicial activism posed a threat to this democratic \nexpression of the will of the American people through their duly \nelected representatives.\n  Indeed, there was some debate whether the Supreme Court decision in \nLawrence v. Texas, which created not just an equal protection right but \nwhich created out of whole cloth this notion espoused by Justice \nKennedy and a majority of the Court, to an individual right to autonomy \nin one's sexual relationships, such that government can never regulate \nor intrude.\n\n  Of course, they purported to put marriage, incest, pedophilia, and \nother things like that out of bounds or outside of their decision, but \nthe fundamental basis for that decision, legal scholars at that time \nrecognized, could easily be transferred to other cases where the very \ndefinition of marriage and family itself was at issue.\n  So it was with great concern that, just a short time after that \nSeptember hearing, we saw the day when we would have to face this issue \nhad come much faster than any of us could imagine. The Massachusetts \nSupreme Court, the first court in the Nation, held that--based on the \nvery same rationale that the U.S. Supreme Court used in the case of \nLawrence v. Texas--that Massachusetts could no longer limit marriage \nlicenses to couples of the opposite sex.\n  In an apparent attempt to create a figleaf of an idea that democracy \nwas still alive in Massachusetts and it would not forever be ruled by \njudicial edict, the Court granted the legislature 180 days to bring the \nlaws of Massachusetts into line with this new found legal right to \nsame-sex marriage. It was a newly discovered right, of course, being \nfound primarily in the U.S. Supreme Court decisions of last summer.\n  So in an effort to find some way out of this dilemma, the legislature \nasked the Massachusetts Supreme Court whether civil unions would be \nsufficient under the court's ruling to meet the requirement of equality \nof treatment. It was the day before yesterday when the court, \nastoundingly, said ``No.''\n  The only thing that would satisfy the Court's decision, its edict, \nwould be to give same-sex couples the same treatment as we recognize \nfor traditional marriage between a man and a woman. Thus the people of \nMassachusetts, their Governor, their legislature, are now scrambling to \ntry to figure out what alternatives are available to them. They hope to \navoid this runaway train careening down this track--the establishment, \nat least in Massachusetts, of a right to same-sex marriage.\n  The thing that was impressed upon me so much about the Massachusetts \ndecision when reading it, besides the fundamental holding which sent \nshockwaves across America, was the sheer contempt that the court held \nfor traditional marriage. Its intolerance for traditions we have \nrecognized in this country, certainly since its founding, and in \nidentifying this new right based on no particular or specific text but \nindeed made up out of whole cloth by the court relying on Lawrence v. \nTexas.\n  The Massachusetts court did not stop at this enormous step, but \nproceeded to condemn traditional marriage outright, and they did so in \nrather startling terms. After acknowledging, as Senator Kennedy had \nback in 1996 when we were talking about the Defense of Marriage Act, \nthat deep-seated religious, moral, and ethical convictions are \nmotivating traditional marriage supporters, the Massachusetts court \nsaid that it still found ``no rational reason'' for laws limiting \nmarriage to a man and a woman. And, in fact, it went even further. It \nconcludes the traditional marriage is ``rooted in persistent \nprejudices.''\n  I know that Members of this body and our colleagues across the \nCapitol, really no one in America, wants to engage in this debate. It \nis understandable. No one, frankly, wants to be painted with a brush of \nintolerance of somehow treating people badly. But as I said, this is \nnot about treating others badly, failing to give them respect as \nindividuals. This is about the intolerance marshaled by judicial \nactivists on the Massachusetts Supreme Court and on benches around the \ncountry, the massive intolerance they have for fundamental democratic \nvalues. These are the values that say we, the people, are the judges of \nour own destiny, and no law will be made unless it is founded on the \nfundamental consent of the people, not on casual judicial edict.\n  The American people are left in shock when, occasionally, courts come \nout with rulings that defy all logic and all common sense--rulings that \ndramatically conflict with our traditions and our fundamental \nvalues. These are cases not only like the Massachusetts case, but like \nthe case decided by the Ninth Circuit not too many months ago where, \nfor the first time in American history, a court has held that to allow \nschoolchildren to say the Pledge of Allegiance and recite ``one nation \nunder God'' violated the Constitution. Again, another decision totally \nat odds with common sense, totally at odds with our values and \ntraditions, and one\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\nthat certainly the American people would not support. Instead, a \nhandful of judges who appear to consider themselves smarter, wiser than \nthe common man, are telling the American people what they think is good \nfor them.\n\n  After all appeals are exhausted, if in fact the American people are \nleft with a decision like this Massachusetts decision, make no doubt \nabout it, if it stands, it will then be used in a variety of different \nways.\n  Lawsuits will proliferate all across the country, citing the \nMassachusetts decision, based on this U.S. Supreme Court decision \nLawrence v. Texas last summer as a basis to recognize same-sex \nmarriages in other States. Because they will be challenging on a \nconstitutional basis, State statutes will then be scrutinized to see if \nthey pass muster under this new-found constitutional right made up by \nthe Massachusetts court. They will be argued as a basis upon which to \noverturn traditional marriage laws in other States as well. And that \nwill happen in State and Federal courts, all across the country.\n  The second thing that will happen is that same-sex couples who \nreceive marriage licenses in Massachusetts will begin to move to other \nStates, and they will file lawsuits in those States and say: Under the \nfull faith and credit clause of the U.S. Constitution, I have a right, \nunder the U.S. Constitution, to have my marriage, which is valid in \nMassachusetts, recognized in Texas or Kansas or Maine or California, \nOklahoma, Florida--you name it.\n  We will begin to see these sorts of lawsuits and claims proliferate \naround the country. And that causes me a great deal of concern when a \ncourt of law, supposedly--but really a court that is acting more like a \nsuperlegislature, a legislature wearing black robes, ruling by edict \nand the gavel--makes statements such as this, such as the court in \nMassachusetts did when it called traditional marriage a ``stain,'' a \n``stain'' on our laws that must be ``eradicate[d].''\n  I am just baffled at how people, who put their hands on the Bible and \npledge to uphold the laws and the Constitution of their State and of \nthe United States, can find a right that no one else has found to exist \nin the Constitution. I am baffled that they are so openly contemptuous \nof American values and American families and our traditions that they \nwould call traditional marriage a ``stain'' that must be \n``eradicate[d]'' from our laws.\n  The choice is up to us, whether to live with the dictates or the \nedicts of judges. Judges in other States cannot be held directly \naccountable to us, because we cannot vote on them, we cannot seek any \nsort of redress against those decisions. Yet we have to live with this \nsort of judicial adventurism and judicial activism that challenges the \nbasic precepts upon which our society is based.\n  The choice we are left with is to decide whether a Federal marriage \namendment to the U.S. Constitution is the appropriate response.\n\n  As I said just a few moments ago, last September I held a hearing in \nthe Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, asking the \nquestion: Is the Defense of Marriage Act in jeopardy? As I said, we had \na debate. Some said, well, yes, they thought courts had all the tools \nthey needed in order to hold that act unconstitutional, and it was just \na matter of time before they did that. And there were others who \ncandidly said: No, there is no way, no how, that it was never going to \nhappen.\n  Well, we have learned something since that September hearing. Not \nonly has a court shown its willingness to attack the fundamental \ninstitution of traditional marriage in such a contemptuous, anti-\ndemocratic way, but the day on which other courts are more likely to do \nthe same has become incredibly accelerated.\n  I believe we are now engaged in a battle over whether this land, when \nit comes to traditional marriage, will be ruled by the whim of judges \nor whether we, the people, will determine our fate and our values and \nthe outcome of this very important controversy.\n  I believe we stand by and do nothing at our own peril. Because if we \ndo nothing, this decision will redefine and trivialize the institution \nof marriage. If you can take the label of ``marriage'' and apply it not \njust to the traditional relationship between a man and a woman--one \nthat has been found over countless years to benefit children, to \nprovide a stable emotional and economic foundation for children so they \ncan then prosper and become responsible, productive adults--if we allow \na court, making it up as they go along from the sweet mysteries of \nlife, to attack an institution as fundamental as marriage--and our \nresponse is to do nothing about it, then shame on us--shame on us.\n  I never imagined in a million years when I ran for this body, the \nUnited States Senate, in 2002, that I would be coming to the Senate \nfloor and defending traditional marriage. And I bet my colleagues here, \non both sides of the aisle, in both Chambers, are scratching their \nheads and wondering: What has the world become? Has the world gone \ncrazy? What happened to our understanding of what American values are, \nand our tradition, and our respect for democracy, and our respect for \nthe different branches of Government that perform different functions, \nwith the Legislature passing laws, the courts interpreting the laws, \nand the President, the executive branch, executing those laws?\n  We stand by and do nothing at our own peril. So I believe the time \nhas come for the appropriate committees in this body, as well as in the \nHouse of Representatives across the Rotunda, to convene hearings to \ndetermine how best we can respond to this startling display of judicial \nactivism that so threatens our fundamental institutions and our values. \nAs the chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I intend to work with Chairman Hatch to do just that.\n  The day that some speculated would come has now come upon us so much \nmore quickly than any of us ever dreamed--the day has come, I believe, \nto confront this challenge to democracy and to the rule of law itself \nface to face.\n  We must not flinch. We must not back down. We must not allow people \nto paint our motivations as hateful or hurtful because, indeed, they \nare not.\n  No, what we are about is preserving our law, preserving the \nseparation of powers where the legislature makes the law and the \njudiciary interprets the law. We are about preserving the fundamental \nbuilding block of our society and the well-being of families and the \nwelfare of children. That is what we are for. That is what this debate \nwill be focused on.\n  I believe the institution of marriage deserves better than it has \nreceived at the hands of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Our \ninstitutions of democracy deserve better. The American people deserve \nbetter. They deserve respect. Our Constitution deserves respect.\n  Traditional marriage laws have served as the underpinning of \ncivilized society for countless generations. Opponents of traditional \nmarriage should demonstrate greater tolerance and respect toward others \nby respecting democracy and the will of the people, and ceasing their \njudicial war against marriage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it has been our intention to get as many \nof the obstacles out of the way and as many amendments here as possible \nrelating to the highway bill. The leader told us he wants to have the \nhighway bill completed by late next week. I think we can do that. If \nMembers have amendments they would like to have considered by the \nmanagers, our staff will be available this afternoon and Saturday \nafternoon from noon until 5 p.m. in Hart-415.\n  If you have any amendments you would like to work out, I strongly \nadvise you to bring them down today or tomorrow instead of waiting \nuntil next week. Again, that will be in Hart, room 415, and anytime \ntoday or tomorrow, Saturday, between noon and 5 p.m.\n  I also note we have been inviting people to come and speak on the \nbill. No one has come down yet. It is now 11:15. In the event that no \none wants to speak on the bill by noon, we will probably shut down.\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it feels as if we have been away a \nlong time. This was an unpleasant respite and it goes to the issue of \nhow safe our country can be. This, the people's property, is not exempt \nfrom terror or the threat of terror. It does not matter whether we \ndefine terrorists as someone coming from Afghanistan or the Middle East \nor some faraway place. Terrorism is not different if it comes from an \nindividual or a dissatisfied or disgruntled American. We have to fight \nagainst it with everything in our means. Unfortunately, we see the \nresult of this fight within our society, within the Capitol. It is not \nthe glorious place it used to be from the outside. We still have the \nresponsibility, for the glory of our country, to carry on from the \ninside.\n  To our majority leader, we extend our feelings that it could not have \nbeen an uglier manifestation of differences. He is someone who we all \nknow has had experiences. I am sure he finds challenges on his trips to \nAfrica and doing the work he has done in flying a single-engine plane \nto go places to perform services for those less fortunate.\n  I thank the majority leader for bringing up this bill. I know there \nhave been concerns or maybe even disputes from other parts of \nGovernment not to move ahead with this, to try and reduce it to less \nworthiness. While I have the floor and there is apparently no rush for \nothers to follow, I want to say that for my staff, from the Lautenberg \noffice, and I think it is probably fair to say those on the staff of \nthe entire Capitol who perform as they always do under pressure, they \nmanage to get their work done. They are willing to be inconvenienced. \nThey are willing to do whatever they have to do to perform their tasks, \nand we greatly respect it.\n  That is why I get upset when I hear talk about reducing Government \nuntil it withers on the vine when we have people here who work so hard \nand diligently to keep things going on behalf of our society and across \nthis country.\n  I am pleased we are finally taking up S. 1072, the bill that \nreauthorizes our Nation's Federal Surface Transportation Program. I do \nnot think there is any other bill we are going to pass this year that \nis as important or more important, let's say, than the highway bill. We \nhave to be able to move people and goods efficiently, economically, and \nsafely. Otherwise, our economy would choke.\n  It is a peculiar anomaly that even as things have slowed down in this \nperiod of recession, I did not see any less traffic on our roads, or \nany less pollution coming from congestion. So it is important we get on \nwith this, and I hope we are not going to get any resistance to what \nappears to be a bill that takes care of needs across this country.\n  I hope the President is not approaching this with an objection in \nmind. Whether that objection extends as far as a veto or not, we do not \nknow, but I hope he will see this is an essential part of our \nfunctioning as a society and encourages us to make these investments \nwhich are talked about so glibly. As the saying goes, when it comes to \nwhere the rubber meets the road, we do not see it happening. We hope it \nis going to happen now, and the bill will pass--and I think it is \ninevitable we will pass this bill--that it moves along at least at a \npace that it leaves us with the amounts of funding we are looking at.\n\n  S. 1072 is a complex bill. The major titles come from four different \nauthorizing committees. There are lots of Members who deserve credit \nfor bringing it to the floor. I think of Senator Inhofe and Senator \nJeffords and Senator Bond and Senator Harry Reid who had the primary \nresponsibility for this measure in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Also, Senator Shelby and Senator Sarbanes worked so hard to \ncraft a transit title which falls under the jurisdiction of the Banking \nCommittee. This title is particularly important to the residents of my \nhome State, New Jersey, over 11 percent of whom rely on public \ntransportation to get to and from work.\n  Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus and the rest of the Finance \nCommittee had to figure out how to pay for the bill.\n  Last but not least, the committee on which I serve, the Commerce \nCommittee, reported out its title, which deals with many important \nsafety programs, under the able leadership of Senator McCain and \nSenator Hollings.\n  This past Monday, the groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, saw his shadow. \nIt suggests we face 6 more weeks of winter weather, the kind of dreary \nweather we have grown accustomed to--the kind that we have seen in \nthese last several weeks and we did not like any of it. We did not like \nit when it was raining and we did not like it when it was snowing. We \nlike to see some rain to make sure we have enough water, but the \naccompanying misery was not pleasant at all. I know I speak for \neverybody when I say that.\n  There was another shadow, however, we saw on Monday last, the shadow \ncast by record-breaking deficits in the President's budget request for \nfiscal year 2005. Because of these budget deficits, the President is \nrequesting, sadly, inadequate funding for our highways, mass transit, \nintercity and freight rail transportation, safety programs and \nenvironmental protection. When it comes to the future of our surface \ntransportation system, the President, with his proposal, is forecasting \n6 more years of traffic congestion, air pollution, wasted fuel, \nunnecessary fatalities, and a stagnant economy.\n  The Department of Transportation expects freight traffic to double in \nthis country over the next 2 decades. Meanwhile, more and more \nAmericans will need to use our roads, rails, and runways to travel to \ntheir jobs, to school, to medical appointments, to worship, to \nvacation. We are already straining capacity as we follow those \npursuits.\n  The needs of our transportation system are well documented and I am \ndisappointed President Bush has declined to acknowledge these needs in \nhis vision of America's future. S. 1072 would authorize a program that \nis 25 percent bigger than the Bush administration's current proposal. \nThe House of Representatives may consider one that is even 50 percent \nbigger than the Bush administration's proposal. We are on the right \ntrack, and the President is on the wrong track. I am hopeful we can all \nagree on a final proposal which truly addresses the needs of our \nnational transportation system this is something the American people \ndeserve.\n  A bigger, better highway bill is not just about reducing traffic \ncongestion and repairing bridges, as important as those things are. The \nSecretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, has stated that $1 billion \ninvested in transportation infrastructure supports 47,000 good-paying \njobs, jobs which are located in America. When it comes to trade, we do \nnot need to export any more jobs. We have to curb that, and we can do \nit by investing in transportation. One billion dollars invested equals \n47,000 good-paying jobs. We ought to look at it from that aspect very \nseriously.\n\n  Transportation needs vary across the country. I can assure you, when \nit comes to need, my State, New Jersey, is near the top of the list. \nNew Jersey is home to some of the oldest transportation routes in the \ncountry. Roads, bridges, rail tracks, and airports built decades ago \nare in need of repair or replacement. Our portion of the national \ntransportation system includes 420 miles of interstate highway and \n6,300 bridges, 1,580 miles of class 1 railroad tracks. There are 49 \npublic use airports and the largest seaport on the east coast.\n  I point this out just to indicate the needs of one State, and I know \nthe needs of other States are also acute. This infrastructure makes a \nsignificant contribution to our national economy. Over 375 million tons \nof general cargo move through the State, mostly on trucks and railcars, \nto and from the Port of New York and New Jersey.\n  Newark Liberty International Airport is the eighth largest cargo \nairport in the country. And, mind you, we are only a very small State, \nabout 47th in size, and we have the eighth largest cargo airport in the \ncountry, the 20th biggest in the world, handling over 78,000 tons of \ncargo annually.\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\n  New Jersey lies along the busiest travel routes for freight and \npassenger travel in the country: The New Jersey Turnpike, the Northeast \ncorridor, the Port of New York and New Jersey, Newark Liberty \nInternational Airport, and Interstate 95. There is a very good chance \nthat the goods you use have traveled along these routes, or you \nyourself have traveled along these corridors in the last few years.\n  While supporting the commercial movement of these goods and \npassengers in the support of our Nation's economy, New Jersey's \ntransportation infrastructure must also support over 4 million \nautomobiles registered in the State, almost 2 million light-duty trucks \nand sport utility vehicles, lots of buses, and over 100,000 \nmotorcycles. These vehicles owned by New Jersey residents must share \nthe road with all the freight traffic moving through our State, and we \nmust do it in a safe, environmentally-conscious, and efficient manner.\n  The same goes for rail travel along the Northeast corridor, which \nextends from Boston to Washington, DC. New Jersey commuter trains must \nshare the rails at the biggest chokepoint on the entire coast, the \ntunnels under the Hudson River. Right now, during peak travel periods, \nNew Jersey commuter trains run every 3 minutes and pretty soon at the \nrate they are expanding it will be every 2 minutes. It is hard to \nbelieve. This sounds like a subway train, but I am talking about \ncommuter trains, each of which carries some 1,200 passengers.\n  Because New Jersey's transportation infrastructure is used so \nheavily, both in interstate commerce and by our resident commuters, it \nis important that it remains in a condition sufficient to support all \nthis traffic.\n  Unfortunately, much of it isn't. I can't overstate this.\n  The current condition of our transportation infrastructure is \nterrible. Thirty-nine percent of urban interstate roads in New Jersey \nare reported as being in ``mediocre'' or ``poor'' condition, according \nto the Federal Highway Administration; 24 percent of our rural \ninterstate roads are in ``mediocre'' or ``poor'' condition; 37 percent \nof New Jersey's 6,000 bridges are considered to be ``structurally \ndeficient'' or ``functionally obsolete.''\n\n  On top of all that, there is at least a $4 billion backlog of rail \nmaintenance on the Northeast Corridor. We desperately need to repair \nexisting infrastructure and add capacity. The average commuting time \nfor New Jersey residents is over 30 minutes, and it is the third \nlongest average commute in the country. So New Jersey desperately needs \na new highway bill and I am pleased the bill the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works has reported authorizes funding levels for \nthe core highway and transit programs that are higher than the funding \nlevels contained in the legislation that it is replacing, TEA 21, and \nfar more than what the President has proposed.\n  Under the Committee's proposal, New Jersey is a donor State. That \nmeans that motorists in New Jersey pay more in gasoline taxes than the \nState receives from the Federal Highway Trust Fund under the allocation \nformulas. New Jersey is not alone in that category. Texas, Florida, \nWisconsin, California, and many other States are currently contributing \ntens or hundreds of millions of dollars to our Nation's transportation \nsystem while other States get a windfall--in some instances many times \nover the amount of their contribution.\n  Formula fights are unpleasant and difficult to resolve--those fights \nto discuss who gets what under a given formula. Senators who represent \nStates that reap more from the Highway Trust Fund than their citizens \npay in gasoline taxes are understandably reluctant to lose ground, \nespecially when their departments of transportation plan the financing \nfor large, long-term projects. I think the allocations in this bill are \na good start but still could use some tweaking. New Jersey, as I said, \nis a donor State and under the Committee's proposal the State will do \nbetter than it has under TEA-21.\n  I look forward to the day when we get 100 cents back on the dollar \nand stop this raid on what I see as New Jersey's contribution to places \nthat really don't have the nexus to us that is needed to get to our \nsystem. I say that, not out of anger and malice, but I am so tired of \nhearing about contributions to Washington, how hard we have to fight to \nget our contributions honored and respected. We don't have a large \nmilitary installation. That is not our choice; that is the way the \ndefense establishment was created. But we are 50th in receipt of \nFederal funds compared to what we send out.\n  That is not a very welcome fact, I can tell you, in my State or with \nthose of us who represent the State of New Jersey.\n  New Jersey's motorists will continue to donate tens of millions of \ndollars more than the State receives over the life of the bill. So \nwhile there is some improvement over the status quo, our State needs to \ndo better, and we will continue that fight, given our transportation \nneeds.\n  I make one final point and that concerns the addition of an intercity \nrail title to this bill. I think it is not only appropriate to have \nsuch a title in this bill, it is imperative. Intercity rail service is \nan essential part of our national transportation network. That is one \nof the lessons we learned on 9/11, that fatal day, that fateful day in \nAmerican history, when our aviation system was crippled and some 5,000 \nairplanes had to be grounded.\n\n  That is one of the reasons I fight so hard to protect FAA in its \npresent format as part of the Government, just like we have our \nmilitary units as part of the Government. I think of the FAA as the \nfifth branch of our defense. Those airplanes had to be grounded on 9/\n11. The controllers in the towers and centers, the people who control \nthe flight service stations--they did this with the skill of a \nphysician doing brain surgery. Everything was precise. These airplanes, \nfilled with thousands of people--hundreds of thousands of people--were \nin the air, and they were sent to destinations they didn't plan to be. \nYet they could rely on the FAA to bring them all home safely. I make \nthat point as an aside.\n  The fact is, the aviation system was turned off and we had to rely on \nother means of transportation. Highways were jammed with cars and \ntrucks that couldn't move. Many Americans found another way to get to \ntheir destinations, and that was passenger rail service.\n  There was a group from Washington, legislators, who came up there \nvery soon after 9/11 to see what had happened and to see if we could do \nthings that would prevent it from ever happening again. They had to \ncome up by Amtrak. That was the only possible way they could reach \ntheir destination--they couldn't fly.\n  For this country to have a decent passenger rail service we need to \nmake the same commitment to rail infrastructure, the same kind of \ncommitment that we have to building highways and runways. It is \nessential. It is not just essential for New Jersey and New York and \nthat region or the Northeast corridor, it is essential across the \ncountry.\n  I am not necessarily just talking about long-distance rail. I am also \ntalking about those centers and cities where there are numerous \nconnections--200-, 300-, or 400-mile-long corridors--that could be so \nwell served by more efficient high-speed rail.\n  One need only look at what happens in Europe. If you want to go from \nBrussels, Belgium, to Paris, France, you take a train that runs about 1 \nhour 20 minutes to cover 200 miles. Imagine if we could go from \nWashington to New York City or vice versa in 1 and a half hours, let us \nsay, or 1 hour 40 minutes. It would make life considerably easier than \nnow with the crowding we have at the airports and on our highways.\n  This is a good bill for the most part. I think it can be improved, \nand I intend to offer some amendments to do just that. I will discuss \nthem at the appropriate time.\n  I congratulate the managers of this bill for bringing it to the \nfloor, Senator Inhofe and our good friend from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords. I look forward to working with them and the rest of the \nSenate to make a good bill even better and get it to President Bush. I \nam pleading with him now as much as we can in front of the American \npeople to say, Mr. President, we have to take care of our \ninfrastructure. Everybody knows that. We can define those needs perhaps \na little bit differently, but we can't deny that that is\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nthe major responsibility at the moment. But we don't make things happen \nhere domestically without investing what we have to. Making things \nbetter here at home with our infrastructure is a perfect example of \nthat. I plead with the President openly: Mr. President, please sign \nthis bill when it comes to you.\n  I am hopeful that we will work out something with the House that is \nnot dissimilar to what we have here in the Senate bill. If it is \nbetter, we will take that. But we want to be at least as good as the \nSenate bill. We hope there is not going to be a campaign that puts this \nhighway and interstate funding on a back burner.\n  I hope the President will have the wisdom to sign it, notwithstanding \nthe fact that we will likely authorize more spending for high-speed \ntransit and intercity rail than he wants.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the country desperately \nneeds increased spending on our surface transportation infrastructure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me begin by expressing my \nappreciation for the Senate leaders for their strong support in \nreauthorizing the Nation's transportation program, and also my good \nfriend from New Jersey who lends his participation and expertise in \ncoming up with a good bill. He has worked very hard. I deeply \nappreciate what he has done. Senators Frist and Daschle have spoken \nforcefully to the vital nature of S. 1072, its potential to create jobs \nand spur the economy.\n  The American people are counting on us to advance this important \nlegislation. With the stellar bipartisanship of leaders Senators Frist \nand Daschle, I am confident we will succeed. Having worked now for many \nmonths with my good friend from Oklahoma, I know we will succeed.\n  As we consider this massive surface transportation bill, there is a \ntendency to focus on the State-by-State funding matter, overlooking the \nimportant policy initiatives and broad implications that attend to the \ninvestment of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  I do not question the importance of the funding formulas. We spent \ncountless hours examining options and developing an approach that \nbenefits all States and balances competing interests.\n  But today, and through the course of our debate on S. 1072, I want to \ndiscuss the many forward-looking refinements that my colleagues and I \nhave put forward for consideration.\n  Transportation investment is a means to an end. Our Nation has grown \nand prospered through strategic development of ports, trails, roads, \nrails, airports, highways, subways, and byways. In almost every case, \nour great cities can trace their origins--their very existence--to the \nlogistics of transportation as one of the many eras of our Nation's \nexpansion.\n  The form and expanse of our cities and towns are an outgrowth of \nsurface transportation technology and investment. In my State of \nVermont, even today, the distance between village centers reflects \nhistoric travel times by horse and wagon.\n  Older suburbs in the eastern and midwestern United States are located \nalong early twentieth century trolley lines--lines later abandoned and \nnow being renewed.\n  Our great sprawling sunbelt and western cities are a product of many \nkey technologies, not the least of which is the modern highway. And it \nis the greatest highway network in the world--the Eisenhower Interstate \nDefense Highway System--that has tied our Nation and its many regions \nso closely together as we move into the twenty-first century.\n  Transportation investment truly forms our Nation and its communities. \nThat is why our decisions on transportation policy and program \nstructure--both in Congress and at home in our States and communities--\nmust be balanced, well-informed, and forward-looking. I am proud that \nS. 1072 reflects this understanding.\n  We are probably coming to a conclusion for the week. I thank all of \nthose who have succeeded in making sure this bill is proceeding \nproperly, especially my good friend from Oklahoma, with whom I have \nworked. I know he will assist us in making sure this bill becomes a \nreality in the not-too-distant future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We will be shutting down here shortly, so I will repeat \nthe announcement I made earlier. We are going to try to have this \nhighway bill completed by the end of the week. To do that, there are \nseveral things that need to happen. One is that we get these amendments \nin. We have announced before, and we want to make sure the offices \nknow, if Members have amendments they would like to have considered by \nthe managers, our staff will be available this afternoon and Saturday--\nthis afternoon, all afternoon and Saturday from noon to 5 o'clock--in \nHart room 415. We would like to have amendments looked at. I strongly \nurge you to come down. We are going to stay on our timetable to try to \nhave this completed.\n  I appreciate the comments by the Senator from Vermont and the Senator \nfrom New Jersey. It is very important we get this done.\n  We are beyond the point of turning back and changing things. We have \nspent a year working out all the elements--the environmental portion of \nthe bill, the safety portion of the bill, the formula portion--and we \nhave probably the best bill we have had during my time, and I go back \nto ISTEA when I was in the other body and TEA-21 here.\n  We have considered more than the other formulas and we have now \nabandoned the idea of percentages that will get 60 votes and then \nwalking. That is not the way we should be doing it. I think we are \ndoing it a lot better.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S686-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S686-S687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to a period of morning business with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise to salute a woman who has just \ncompleted a stellar tour serving our Nation as Ambassador to the \nRepublic of Finland, Bonnie McElveen-Hutner. I am proud to call Bonnie, \nand her husband, Bynum, my friends. Today, the President of Finland, \nTarja Halonen, will award Bonnie the Commander Grand Cross of the Order \nof the Lion, an honor recognizing her exceptional and outstanding \nservices. Bonnie McElveen-Hunter is truly worthy of this distinction.\n  I first met Bonnie in 1999, and was immediately impressed with her \nintelligence, her drive, her confidence, her spirit, and without a \ndoubt, her Southern charm. She is the eldest of three children born to \nJohn T. McElveen, a former Air Force U2 pilot and Madeline, a school \nteacher. In fact, even to this day, though retired, Madeline is the \never present teacher and is known to impart her ``pearls of wisdom'' \nupon her daughter.\n  Bonnie's credentials are impeccable. She is a serious, successful CEO \nwho serves as head of Pace Communications in Greensboro, NC, one of the \ntop women-owned businesses in the country. The company's impressive \nclient list has included United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Holiday Inn, \nRadisson Hotels, and Toyota. Under Bonnie's leadership, the company \nbecame the largest custom publishing company in America, based on \nrevenue. Bonnie's successes led President Bush to call her a \n``trailblazer among female entrepreneurs.'' How true indeed.\n  Bonnie's service as ambassador has been as successful as her \nendeavors in the private sector. Following the terrorist attacks of 9/\n11, she forged close\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\nrelationships with Finland's leaders. During this trying time of \ninternational tension, Bonnie not only promoted unity between Finland \nand the United States in the face of terrorism, she helped to improve \ncommercial ties between the two nations.\n  After the change of government in Finland, Bonnie worked to foster \nstrong bonds with the new Finnish leadership. She developed a close \nrelationship with Prime Minister Vanhanen, helping to ensure continued \nwarm relations with the Finnish leadership. She met with every new \nminister in the Cabinet to emphasize the importance of our bilateral \nties and to explore ways to enhance our partnership on key issues.\n  While serving as ambassador, Bonnie also worked on several ``non-\ntraditional'' diplomatic items, including collaboration with Secretary \nof State Colin Powell to organize The Helsinki Women's Business Leaders \nSummit. This summit brought together American, Finnish, Russian, \nEstonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian entrepreneurs to share their business \nideas across international borders. And she helped broker an \narrangement that allowed women from Finland, the Baltics and Russia to \nshadow fifty of our country's top female business leaders.\n  Bonnie McElveen-Hunter has always had a keen interest and concern for \nher fellow man. As ambassador, she advanced the ``child of Karelia'' \nproject, which helps Finnish and Russian charities assist children who \nare at risk for drugs, crime HIV/AIDs, and trafficking in the \ntransborder region of Karelia. Bonnie is also one of the United Way's \nmost effective fundraisers. And, when she and Bynum moved into a new \nhome, they raised $1 million for Habitat for Humanity as part of their \nhousewarming.\n  I love a story Bonnie tells about her childhood When she was 9 years \nold, her mother had her write the word ``can't'' on a piece of paper \nand bury it in a shoe box in the backyard of the home. She has not used \nthe word since.\n  Bonnie McElveen-Hunter epitomizes the American spirit through her \ncompassion and sense of entrepreneurship. She serves as an inspiration \nfor us all. Congratulations, Madame Ambassador.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S687-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S687-S689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE IMPORTANCE OF STATE AND FEDERAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, ``We're just everyday people,'' said Linda \nRaymond of herself and her husband, Mike, of Woburn, MA. ``But we \nstopped a landfill from expanding and raised environmental awareness. \nAny community can do what we did.''\n  The Raymonds live in a blue-collar suburb of Boston where they both \nwork in the public school system. Three years ago, while walking on a \nwooded trail in their neighborhood, they discovered that the city's \nlandfill, which had been dormant for 15 years, was bustling with truck \ntraffic. They had cause for alarm. Woburn is the setting of the events \nthat were described in the book, ``A Civil Action.'' After rates of \nleukemia shot upward, local industries were sued in the 1980s for \npolluting the area water. The Raymonds, who had not previously been \ninvolved in environmental activism, sprang into action, determined to \ndiscover what was being planned for the landfill and how this would \nimpact the community's public health.\n  The Raymonds' story was recounted in the January 25, 2004, issue of \nParade magazine. ``When Linda Raymond contacted town officials to find \nout what was going on, she hit a stone wall. `I couldn't get a straight \nanswer from anyone,' she says. `It was very frustrating.''' The article \ndescribes what the Raymonds did next: ``To get answers--and action--the \nRaymonds turned to a powerful set of tools: Federal and State Freedom \nof Information (FOI) laws.''\n  With the information the Raymonds collected under Massachusetts State \nFOI laws, they educated the community and held public officials \naccountable. Their actions ultimately led to the city shelving plans to \nexpand the size of the landfill by over a million tons of waste--plans \nthat had been developed without public knowledge or debate, and which \nhad not been evaluated for environmental or health impacts.\n  The Raymonds' triumph highlights the power of Government sunshine \nlaws. It also demonstrates one of the most common uses of such laws by \ncitizens and local community groups--that is, reliance on FOI laws to \nensure that schools, neighborhoods and local industries are safe and \nsecure. Our FOI laws are in danger, however, especially in the post-9/\n11 era. As noted by Parade, ``Some journalists and civil liberties \ndefenders believe that fences have gone up around FOI laws in the \naftermath of 9/11. `Freedom of Information is under threat,' says \nWoburn Daily Times Chronicle columnist Marie Coady. `Across the \ncountry, it's becoming harder to access documents.'''\n  One of the most significant threats to American citizens' right to \nknow about health and safety issues was enacted by Congress in 2002 in \nthe form of a broad exemption to the Federal sunshine law, the Freedom \nof Information Act, FOIA. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, HSA, \ncontained a subtitle purportedly designed to protect ``critical \ninfrastructure information.'' That broadly defined term applies to \ninformation regarding a variety of facilities--such as privately \noperated power plants, bridges, dams, ports, or chemical plants--that \nmight be targeted for a terrorist attack. In exchange for the \ncooperation of private companies in sharing information with the \ngovernment regarding vulnerabilities in the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure, those companies would not have to share certain \ninformation with the public.\n  Encouraging cooperation between the private sector and the Government \nto keep our critical infrastructure systems safe from terrorist attacks \nis a goal we all support. Unfortunately, rather than increasing \nsecurity by encouraging private sector disclosure to the Government, \nthe law guts FOIA at the expense of our national security and public \nhealth.\n  The HSA created a new FOIA exemption for ``critical infrastructure \ninformation.'' In HSA negotiations, House Republicans and the \nadministration promoted legislative language that they described as \nnecessary to encourage the owners of such facilities to identify \nvulnerabilities in their operations and share that information with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS. The stated goal was to ensure \nthat steps could be taken to ensure the facilities' protection and \nproper functioning.\n  In fact, such descriptions of the legislation were disingenuous. \nThese provisions, which were eventually enacted in the HSA, shield from \nFOIA almost any voluntarily submitted document stamped by the facility \nowner as ``critical infrastructure.'' This is true no matter how \ntangential the content of that document may be to the actual security \nof a facility. The law effectively allows companies to hide information \nabout public health and safety from American citizens simply by \nsubmitting it to DHS. The enacted provisions were called ``deeply \nflawed'' by Mark Tapscott of the Heritage Foundation. He argued that \nthe ``loophole'' created by the law ``could be manipulated by clever \ncorporate and government operators to hide endless varieties of \npotentially embarrassing and/or criminal information from public \nview.''\n  In addition, under the HSA, disclosure by private facilities to DHS \nneither obligates the private company to address the vulnerability, nor \nrequires DHS to fix the problem. For example, in the case of a chemical \nspill, the law bars the Government from disclosing information without \nthe written consent of the company that caused the pollution. As the \nWashington Post editorialized on February 10, 2003, ``A company might \npreempt environmental regulators by `voluntarily' divulging \nincriminating material, thereby making it unavailable to anyone else.''\n  Last March, I introduced a bill to repeal this dangerously broad FOIA \nexemption and to replace it with a balanced measure that will protect \nour Nation's critical infrastructure without obliterating public \noversight. The Restoration of Freedom of Information Act--Restore \nFOIA--would protect legitimate records pertaining to critical \ninfrastructure safety, but would remove the free pass given by the HSA \nto industry for any information that a facility chooses to label \n``critical infrastructure.''\n  Perhaps most important to people like the Raymonds, who relied on \nState\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\nFOI laws to obtain information on the Woburn landfill, the Restore FOIA \nbill also allows local authorities to apply their own sunshine laws. \nUnlike the provisions of the HSA, the Restore FOIA bill does not \npreempt any State or local disclosure laws for information obtained \noutside the Department of Homeland Security. Likewise, it does not \nrestrict the use of such information by State agencies.\n  By enacting Restore FOIA, we can protect the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure without cutting the public out of the loop. James \nMadison said, ``A popular government, without popular information, or \nthe means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy or \nperhaps both.'' I urge my colleagues to support Restore FOIA so that \nthis basic and fundamental principle is upheld.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Parade article describing the \nRayburns fight for open and accountable Government be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Parade Magazine, Jan. 25, 2004]\n\n                      How They Uncovered the Truth\n\n                          (By Micah Morrison)\n\n       At first glance, they don't look like activists. Mike and \n     Linda Raymond of Woburn, Mass., a blue-collar community north \n     of Boston, are both in their mid-50s. They have been married \n     35 years, with two grown sons and four grandchildren. Mike \n     teaches computer and fitness classes at the local high \n     school. Linda is a secretary with the public school system. \n     But these self-described ``everyday working people'' took on \n     City Hall in a battle to protect their community.\n       Family pictures are on proud display in the Raymonds' \n     comfortable home on North Maple Street in one of Woburn's \n     many close-knit neighborhoods. ``It's a good place to raise \n     kids,'' Mike Raymond says of his town. ``It has excellent \n     schools and a good health-care system.'' Yet, on an autumn \n     day three years ago, the Raymonds discovered something about \n     their community that troubled them deeply.\n       The Raymonds took a walk down the wooden path at the end of \n     their street. Past small ponds and a rise of trees, they came \n     upon an astonishing sight: Trucks loaded with debris were \n     rumbling up the 60-foot slopes at the Woburn Landfill. The \n     40-acre mountain of trash had been dormant for more than 15 \n     years--now, mysteriously, it was growing again.\n       ``I worried,'' Linda Raymond recalls. ``Who had opened the \n     landfill? Was it toxic? Why hadn't people in the neighborhood \n     been told?''\n       Given Woburn's history, the Raymonds had reason for \n     concern. In the 1980s, the town was rocked by a lawsuit \n     against local industries claiming that water pollution had \n     led to an increase in leukemia deaths. The story was revived \n     in the '90s with the book and movie A Civil Action. Today, \n     Woburn Mayor John Curran says the city ``has worked hard to \n     overcome the Civil Action stigma. Our drinking water has been \n     of the highest quality for over 20 years.''\n       Getting no answers. But when Linda Raymond contacted town \n     officials to find out what was going on, she hit a stone \n     wall. ``I couldn't get a straight answer from anyone,'' she \n     says. ``It was very frustrating.'' So, to get answers--and \n     action--the Raymonds turned to a powerful set of tools: \n     federal and state Freedom of Information (FOI) laws.\n       As the Raymonds discovered, FOI requests can be made by \n     anyone. ``There are a million ways the public can use FOI \n     laws,'' says Robert Freeman of the New York State Committee \n     on Open Government. ``When property taxes are raised, you can \n     review the assessment rolls to ensure that you've been \n     treated fairly. You can find out if your child's teacher is \n     really certified to teach math. You can find out if a \n     restaurant has health-code violations.''\n       First steps. After researching FOI laws, Linda Raymond \n     figured that her first letter should go to the Massachusetts \n     Department of Environmental Protection. She wrote asking for \n     ``any and all documents pertaining to the Woburn Landfill,'' \n     noting that she was making the request under the state's \n     Freedom of Information laws. The agency quickly complied, \n     inviting Linda to come review the files.\n       Speeky cooperation from government agencies is not always \n     the norm. ``There will be delays,'' Linda says. ``Something \n     you have to be persistent. And it's important to know your \n     rights--including the right to an appeal when documents are \n     denied.''\n       Looking over the files, Linda made some important \n     discoveries. Under state law, the city was required to bring \n     in material to ``cap'' the landfill and close it with a \n     protective lining of topsoil, loam and netting. She found \n     that, to pay for the multimillion-dollar project, Woburn had \n     hired a private contractor who was hauling in soil and debris \n     from construction sites to cover the capping costs. In \n     reading through the documents, Linda also discovered that the \n     bottom of the landfill did not have a protective lining.\n       That's when the Raymonds really began to worry, because the \n     landfill sits on top of a watershed feeding into the \n     nearby Aberjona River. ``We found medical waste, coal ash, \n     construction debris and oil seeping into the wetlands,'' \n     Mike recalls. Were contaminants polluting the watershed?\n       Digging deeper. The Raymonds zeroed in with more specific \n     requests. A second FOI petition went to the Woburn city clerk \n     for the contract the town had signed with the waste-\n     management firm. The response brought some startling news: \n     ``The original contract called for 300,000 tons of waste to \n     be brought in,'' Mike explains, ``but the town was looking to \n     expand the landfill by another million tons.''\n       A third request, to the Woburn Board of Health, brought \n     documents revealing that the former mayor had quietly \n     assembled a panel to advise him on landfill issues, with no \n     public input. The documents also showed discussions of plans \n     for the future of the site, including turning it into a \n     picnic area or police shooting range.\n       ``We got very angry,'' Linda recalls. ``We felt the \n     politicians were making plans without anyone knowing about \n     it. And there were possible health risks.''\n       Taking action. The Raymonds swung into action. They \n     organized their neighbors, contacted the media and raised the \n     issue at public meetings. ``The documents we obtained under \n     FOI educated us,'' Linda says. ``And we in turn were able to \n     educate the community.''\n       At first, their aims were modest. ``We wanted to postpone \n     the capping until the landfill could be tested and deemed \n     environmentally safe,'' Mike says. But the Raymonds had hit a \n     nerve. Under mounting pressure, plans for the landfill were \n     shelved.\n       ``Without FOI laws,'' Linda says, ``we couldn't have done \n     it.''\n       A threat to access? Next time, it might be more difficult. \n     Some journalists and civil liberties defenders believe that \n     fences have gone up around FOI laws in the aftermath of 9/11. \n     ``Freedom of Information is under threat,'' said Woburn Daily \n     Times Chronicle columnist Marie Coady. ``Across the country, \n     it's becoming harder to access documents.''\n       On the federal level, ``there has been a major change in \n     atmosphere since 9/11,'' says Lucy Dalglish, executive \n     director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. \n     Federal officials ``are not releasing information they would \n     have provided five years ago.''\n       Still, thousands of Freedom of Information requests \n     continue to be routinely processed every year. And with legal \n     challenges under way, ultimately the courts will decide \n     whether the new restrictions are a reasonable response to a \n     changed world.\n       The Raymonds say they'll keep using FOI laws. Although the \n     state of Massachusetts has given the Woburn Landfill a clean \n     bill of health, the couple plan to closely watch the results \n     of the elaborate pollution-monitoring procedures established \n     at the site.\n       ``We're just everyday people,'' Linda says, ``but we \n     stopped a landfill from expanding and raised environmental \n     awareness. Any community can do what we did.''\n       Mike agrees. He cites his favorite quote, from \n     anthropologist Margaret Mead: ``Never doubt that a small \n     group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; \n     indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.''\n\n\n                    a powerful tool everyone can use\n\n       It's not difficult to use Freedom of Information laws, and \n     there's no telling what you might turn up. Here are some tips \n     on getting the information you want:\n       Research First.--Who has the information you're seeking? \n     Identify your targets. Ask your local librarian for help. \n     Check municipal, state and federal Web sites. Most states \n     have a designated office to help with public-records \n     searches. Federal agencies have FOI officers. The Reporters \n     Committee for Freedom of the Press (www.rcfp.org) publishes \n     guides to using state and federal Freedom of Information \n     laws.\n       Put It in Writing.--While some states allow oral requests, \n     it's best to write a short letter stating what information \n     you're seeking. Note that you're making the request under a \n     State or Federal Freedom of Information statute. Be as \n     specific as possible. The Reporters Committee for Freedom \n     of the Press has a helpful sample letter at its Web site.\n       Show Them the Money.--Often there will be a photocopying \n     fee and other costs related to your request. You can speed \n     the process by stating in your letter how much you're willing \n     to pay and asking to be notified if costs exceed that amount. \n     You also can request a fee waiver. In some cases, you can go \n     to a government office to view the documents and do your own \n     copying.\n       Exemptions and Appeals.--Many public records are exempt \n     from FOI laws. The U.S. Congress did not make itself or the \n     courts subject to the statute. Most documents impacting \n     minors, criminal investigations, trade secrets and personal \n     privacy are off-limits. But you also may be denied documents \n     that you have a right to see. If you are denied access, be \n     sure to use the FOI appeals process. A brief letter to the \n     agency head requesting a review of the decision will get the \n     ball rolling. Meanwhile, make photocopies of everything you \n     send out. Above all, be patient and persistent. You may be \n     pleasantly surprised!\n\n\n                      There's More You Can Discover\n\n        There's a common belief that FOI laws are used mainly in \n     environmental cases. Not true. Here are examples of other \n     uses of this powerful tool:\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\n       In Grand Rapids, MI, a high school government class used \n     Freedom of Information laws to expose flaws in the county's \n     jury-selection system.\n        In Fulton, MO, a concerned citizen used State open-\n     government laws--kissing cousins to FOI statutes--to force \n     disclosure of town-council discussion about building a golf \n     course at taxpayer expense.\n        In Washington, D.C., a women used FOI laws to find out \n     about the ownership of some drug-infested, abandoned \n     buildings. The owner? The District of Columbia government!\n        The U.S. Department of Agriculture--as a result of an FOI \n     request--revealed accounts of the mistreatment of circus \n     elephants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S689-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GUN SAFETY REPORT CARDS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, the Brady Campaign to \nPrevent Gun Violence, united with the Million Mom March and the \nNation's leading State-based gun violence prevention groups, published \nthe annual gun safety report cards for every State in America. The \nreport cards are the culmination of a comprehensive analysis of each \nState's gun safety laws.\n  The report cards rate each State on seven types of laws that protect \nchildren from gun violence. Extra credit and demerits are also assigned \nfor other State gun laws. The Brady Campaign includes in its analysis \nsuch questions as: is it illegal for a child to possess a gun without \nsupervision? Is it illegal to sell a gun to a child? Are gun owners \nheld responsible for leaving loaded guns easily accessible to children? \nAre guns required to have child safety locks, loaded-chamber indicators \nand other childproof designs? Do cities and counties have authority to \nenact local gun laws? Are background checks required at gun shows? Is \nit legal to carry concealed handguns in public?\n  The report awarded 10 States with Sensible Safety Stars for \nprotecting children from gun violence. Nine other States were sent to \nthe ``Time-Out Chair'' for weakening State gun laws. Unfortunately, 31 \nStates received grades of D or F in this year's report cards. Not \nsurprisingly, according to the report, States receiving Ds and Fs tend \nto have child and teen firearm death rates that are higher than the \nnational average. For example, the average firearms death rate of youth \nin the 8 States that received an F grade was 33 percent higher than the \naverage firearms death rate for the 10 States that received an A or a \nB.\n  I applaud the efforts of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence \nto keep the pressure on State and local legislators to enact sensible \ngun safety legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to review this \nreport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S689-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OBJECTION TO S. 1896 AND H.R. 1664\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last November, I announced my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up S. \n1896, the Tax Relief Extension Act, and H.R. 1664, the Armed Forces Tax \nFairness Act. I did so because these bills were the only relevant \namendable legislation expected to be taken up in the Senate before the \nneed of the last session and, therefore, they provided the only \nopportunity to extend unemployment benefits before Federal unemployment \nbenefits expired at the end of the year.\n  Oregon currently has the second highest unemployment rate in the \nNation with an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent. Extension of \nunemployment benefits is critical for many Oregonians who have or will \nsoon run out of unemployment.\n  In order to restore or continue benefits to unemployed workers in \nOregon and many other States, I will be pushing for passage of S. 2006, \nthe Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act. S. 2006 restores Federal \nunemployment benefits and reforms a ``look back'' rule that affects \nOregon and other high unemployment States as part of the legislation.\n  Because there is now legislation before the Senate to restore Federal \nbenefits for unemployed workers in Oregon and other States, I will no \nlonger object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take \nup S. 1896 or H.R. 1664.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S689-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n   Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n   One such crime occurred in Houston, TX, on January 26, 2002. Hugo \nBarajas was found dead from multiple gun shot wounds to the neck, arm \nand chest in a club that caters to the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and \ntransgender community. Barajas, a man, was dressed as a women at the \ntime of the murder.\n   I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harm that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S689-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S689-5", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n   As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S689-6", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Wyden, and Mrs. \n             Feinstein):\n       S. 2053.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it adjourn until 1 p.m. Monday, \nFebruary 9. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the \nmorning hour be deemed to have expired, the Journal of the proceedings \nbe approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their \nuse later in the day, and the Senate resume consideration of S. 1072, \nthe highway bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say before we leave, Senator \nInhofe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Bond, and I want people to know our \nstaffs are going to be available all weekend to work on any problems \nanyone has regarding the bill. If people have amendments, they can ask \nto meet with our staffs. We will go over the amendments to see if they \nare acceptable. The offices are open now. There is no reason not to be \nable to have the resources they need to go over this bill with our \nstaffs.\n  The point I am making is we are open for business and we want to make \nsure everyone has the opportunity to talk to our staffs about any \nproblems they have with the bill and ways it can be made better.\n  Anyway, please work with our staffs. They will be in their offices \nthis weekend. I hope when Monday morning comes, people will also \nrecognize the offices will be open. At 1 o'clock, we will be open for \nbusiness. The leader indicated there won't be votes on Monday--will \nthere be?\n  Mr. FRIST. No.\n  Mr. REID. So there will be no votes, but that doesn't mean we cannot \ndo a lot of work. We hope everyone will cooperate with us. If there are \nproblems, let us know. We want to move this bill as quickly as \npossible. It is important to everyone.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I might be a little more specific. In \nHart-415 they are going to be open today and from noon until 5 o'clock \non Saturday to work on amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I simply say I am confident there will be adequate \ntime to take care of everything. I hope nobody wants to come in on the \nSabbath. But, if necessary, we have someone who will work on the \nSabbath.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S691-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S691-S692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will restate what you just heard. We will \nresume consideration of S. 1072, the highway bill on Monday. It has \nbeen a challenging week in lots of different ways. We have had this \nincident in my personal office and a lot went on here on the floor, \nwith progress.\n  I know the ranking member and the managers of this bill have been \nfrustrated in that we have not made as much progress as they would have \nliked. They would like to have this bill signed, sealed, delivered, and \ndone. We did have good debate on the highway bill. Important points \nhave been made throughout the week. We have the foundation to complete \naction on this bill next week. You just heard that we will be working \nthrough the afternoon. There will be people working tonight and people \nwill be working tomorrow, as you have just heard, on Saturday and \nSunday, in preparation for coming back in at 1 o'clock on Monday.\n  We have a lot to cover next week on this bill. It is an important \nbill. I argue that it is a vital bill to support the infrastructure we \nare all so dependent upon each and every day in our activities, whether \nit is during the weekends, or going to school or work, or as part of \nour business. We have an obligation to continue to address it and to \ncomplete this next week.\n\n  Since we are closing down for the week, it has been only 5 days since \nthis letter with this toxic substance was directed at this institution. \nAs I have said before, I have been very pleased with the response in \nterms of the coordination, the communication. It is not perfect; it can \nbe better; but I assure people we will take each incident and do our \nvery best to communicate as well as we can, review procedures, and \nreview systems, and we are doing just that.\n  I just finished a conference call for 30 minutes with the 40 employee \nstaff members affected most directly from my office and from the EPW \noffice and Senators Jeffords' and Inhofe's office, answering questions. \nThere are a lot of unanswered questions. We will answer those and meet \nwith them and come up with different and better procedures as we go \nforward.\n  The fact that the chairman could say the Hart Building is open \ntomorrow is music to my ears. We were able to open it ahead of \nschedule. The Russell Building got opened and the Dirksen Building, \nwhich is still closed, will be opened Monday morning. It is right on \nschedule.\n  I thank everybody for coming together and working through a broad \nrange of both national agencies and agencies here on the Hill. First \nand foremost is the safety of our Senate employees, and we responded in \nsuch a way that I am happy to say nobody has been hurt. Everybody is \nOK, in spite of the fact we had this assault.\n  Also during this week, in Chairman Gregg's HELP Committee, we passed \nS. 1879, an extension of the mammography quality provision. In Chairman \nCollins' committee, we worked on S. 1612, which established a \ntechnology equipment and information transfer program with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. We passed that this week. The Senate \nconfirmed a U.S. district judge this week for the Northern District of \nIllinois. We will be back in Monday. The chairman encourages members to \nhave amendments and contact him. His staff will be working through the \nweekend.\n  As the assistant Democratic leader mentioned, we will not be voting \non Monday, but we will be working. I will consult with Senator Inhofe \nand the Democratic leadership as we go forward. I hope we will be \nprepared for a vote early Tuesday morning. We will keep people posted \nin that regard.\n  I did mention this earlier. Do you know what your blood pressure is? \nFifty million people have hypertension, which causes stroke and heart \nattacks. A third of the people don't know they have it. If you know you \nhave it, we have ways to treat it these days. The Medicare bill we \npassed means you can diagnose it because, for the first, in an entry \nlevel physical exam which is part of Medicare, you are going to be able \nto have hypertension treated. If you don't know what your blood \npressure is, go home tonight and think about that and have it checked.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is called the silent killer.\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes. People don't know they have it. Probably about a \nfourth of the people listening to me have hypertension, and a third \ndon't know it, and they will die prematurely. It is pretty interesting.\n  Mr. REID. It doesn't make you sick, does it?\n  Mr. FRIST. It is silent. You don't feel it until you have a stroke or \nheart attack. There are ways to prevent it. It is the silent killer. \nThat is what the American Heart Association says. February is heart \nmonth, and right now\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\nthe First Lady has a real initiative for women's heart disease. More \nwomen die of heart disease than men. I bet you didn't know that. A lot \nof people think it is more men.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/06/senate-section/article/S692-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2004, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
