Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and commemorate Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month. As a member of the Congressional Asian \nPacific American Caucus, the only Chinese American in the U.S. Senate, \nand sole Native Hawaiian in the U.S. Congress, I am proud to stand here \nto honor the accomplishments and diversity of the AAPI community.\n  In 1978, my friends and dear colleagues Representatives Frank Horton \nand Norman Mineta, joined by Hawaii's Senators Daniel K. Inouye and \nSpark Matsunaga, introduced the first resolutions establishing Asian \nPacific American Heritage Week to recognize the ongoing contributions \nto our Nation of the AAPI population. Representatives Horton and Mineta \nworked with their colleagues in the 102nd Congress to make Asian \nPacific American Heritage Week a month-long celebration, and succeeded \nin doing so with enactment of Public Law 102-450 in 1992. I look back \nwith pride over the past 25 years since our great Nation first observed \nAsian Pacific American Heritage Week.\n  Throughout this month, Federal agencies and AAPI and other \norganizations will hold events in celebration of the diversity of the \nAAPI population that range from samplings of Asian cuisines to dance, \nand policy lectures by distinguished speakers. Each event demonstrates \nthe contributions that AAPI individuals have made to our country. I \ncommend agencies and organizations for sponsoring such events to \nincrease public awareness of the contributions made by the AAPI \ncommunity.\n  This month presents us with a good opportunity to reexamine the need \nto increase AAPI participation in our Federal Government. I encourage \nthe President to renew Executive Order 13216, the President's Advisory \nCommission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, which expired on \nJune 7, 2003. The Commission is mandated to develop, monitor, and \ncoordinate Federal efforts to improve AAPI participation in Government \nprograms; foster research and data collection for AAPI populations and \nsub-populations; and increase public and private sector and community \ninvolvement in improving the health and well-being of the AAPI \ncommunity. AAPI citizens, whether employed in the private and public \nsector, deserve the coordination of services that the Commission can \nfacilitate.\n  Our celebration of AAPI history includes remembrances of the \nchallenges and hardships that have been overcome. For example, we will \nnever forget the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. \nAt the newly opened Manzanar National Historic Site Interpretive Center \nat the Manzanar War Relocation Center, we have an opportunity to \nexplore our past and reflect. The AAPI community, specifically the \nJapanese American National Museum and Japanese American Citizens \nLeague, are exploring ways to preserve and recall history at the other \nsites that mark this traumatic time in our country's history in an \neffort to ensure that such actions do not repeat themselves.\n  This month also affords us time to reflect on the various social \nneeds that exist in the AAPI community. Its population enriches our \nculture linguistically through a range of languages, such as Chinese, \nHawaiian, Korean, Japanese, Malay, Samoan, Tamil, Thai, Vietnamese, and \nvarious Melanesian, Micronesian, and Polynesian languages. Our Nation \nbenefits from this linguistic diversity in our ability to compete in \nthe global economy, and U.S. national security is strengthened by \nincreasing the pool of individuals fluent in critical languages. \nFluency in foreign languages is one of the vital skills necessary for \nthe United States to exercise international leadership economically and \npolitically. However, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, slightly \nless than half of the 7 million AAPI who speak a language other than \nEnglish at home report that they speak English ``very well.'' We need \nto better address the educational needs of all limited English \nproficiency students, children, and adults.\n  I want to extend my gratitude to the patriotic men and women serving \nour country in the military, including the 60,813 Asian Americans and \nPacific Islanders serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Services, as \nwell as the 28,066 in the Reserves and National Guard. I also commend \nthe 351,000 AAPI veterans, 57,000 of whom are of Native Hawaiian and \nPacific Islander heritage, for their excellence in defending our \nnation.\n  In addition, individual achievements among the AAPI population are \nmany. Though impossible to enumerate all those extraordinary \nindividuals, I would like to cite a few examples.\n  Army Specialist Hilario Bermanis of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division \nwas presented with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for Meritorious \nConduct in Operation Iraqi Freedom. On July 16, 2003, the award \npresentation ceremony took place bedside at Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter where he was convalescing from grave injuries. Specialist \nBermanis and a fellow soldier were on guard duty in southern Baghdad \nwhen they sustained an attack by rocket propelled grenades on June 10, \n2003. His fellow soldier died instantly and Specialist Bermanis lost \nboth legs and his left hand. Officials from the Federated States of \nMicronesia (FSM) and the U.S. Government have visited him at Walter \nReed and praised him for his courage and exemplary service. A senior \nU.S. official commended Specialist Bermanis's service as representative \nof FSM citizens' commitment to the security of the United States and \nPacific region. Specialist Bermanis hails from Pohnpei in the Federated \nStates of Micronesia.\n\n  Dr. Yuan-Cheng Fung, the recipient of the Chinese Institute of \nEngineers' Distinguished Life Time Achievement Award, is a pioneer in \nbioengineering and founder of the University of California, San Diego's \nbioengineering department. Born in China in 1919, Dr. Fung began his \ncareer as an aeronautics engineer working for the Chinese government. \nDr. Fung received his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology \nin 1948, where he became a faculty member and a major contributor to \nthe field of aeroelasticity. When his mother developed glaucoma, Dr. \nFung's interests shifted to medical science. Combining an expertise in \nforce and motion from aeronautics with physiology, he synthesized a new \nunderstanding of how the body functions and became the father of \nbiomechanics.\n  Lauren Moriarty, a Native Hawaiian, is a career member of the Senior \nForeign Service and was confirmed for the rank of Ambassador to the \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, where she was recently the \nU.S. Senior Official. Having previously served in Beijing and Taipei, \nMs. Moriarty led the Economic Sections at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, \nChina (1999-2001) and the American Institute in Taiwan (1994-1997) as \nthose two economies completed negotiations to accede to the World Trade \nOrganization. She has received numerous awards, including the State \nDepartment's 1993 Arnold L. Raphel Award for her leadership and \nmentoring of her subordinates.\n  Indra K. Nooyi is the widely admired President and Chief Financial \nOfficer for PepsiCo and highest ranking Indian-born woman in corporate \nAmerica. Upon emigrating to the United States in 1978, Ms. Nooyi \nentered the Yale School of Management. She worked from midnight to five \nin the morning to support herself at school. A firm believer in human \npotential and an advocate of education, Ms. Nooyi has received awards \nfor her dedication to human capital management. She is ranked by \nFortune magazine as one of America's top 50 most powerful women.\n  AAPI cultural and linguistic diversity, entrepreneurship, public \nservice, and scientific endeavors illustrate a\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\nnumber of the ways that our Nation excels. The United States is the \nmost energetic and innovative country because of the combination of \nthese AAPI strengths with the diverse abilities and skills of our \nNation's other ethnic and racial groups. The U.S. is also a leader in \nthe world because of our ability to acknowledge, celebrate, and utilize \nthe potency of our combined, diverse citizenry, including the \ncontributions from every member of our AAPI community. In the world \nthat is all too frequently wracked by ethnic and religious conflicts, \nwe can demonstrate to others how racial and ethnic harmony in the U.S. \nprovides a balance that encourages a stable democracy, provides for \nwell-functioning societies, and sustains the most powerful economy in \nthe world.\n  In closing, I extend my deepest aloha to all in celebration of Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month, and I urge my colleagues to \nparticipate in commemorations of this month in their States and our \nNation's Capital.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I ask to be recognized to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5031-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5031-S5033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, we have apparently \nreached an impasse on the FSC/ETI bill. I am the first one to \nacknowledge that our majority leader should be insistent we pass this \nbill. We are dealing with some changes to the tax policy of the United \nStates to avoid tariffs on U.S.-manufactured products going into \nEurope. The WTO has ruled against us and we need to change our law. We \nhave a lot of other things being added onto this bill that are probably \nnot related to that but, as this bill is being touted as a jobs \npackage, I think that is an appropriate way to describe what we are \ntrying to accomplish in this bill.\n  But I am going to be honest with you, I have an amendment I have had \npending on this bill for a very long time, along with Senator Schumer, \nand this amendment deals with requiring the Chinese Government to float \nthe currency. It basically says if within 180 days the Chinese \nGovernment does not take corrective action in the way they peg their \ncurrency to the dollar, then tariffs will be levied against any \nproducts coming out of China into the United States that benefit from \nthat currency devaluation.\n  To make a long story short: China cheats. The Chinese have a system \nof valuing their money that creates between a 15-percent and 40-percent \ndiscount on all products produced in China. This currency manipulation \nis putting our manufacturing community at a severe disadvantage. It is \ncreating an unfair advantage for Chinese-produced products, and it is \ndone by the Government.\n  Free trade, fair trade, these are words people throw around. If you \nare a free trader, that code word means you don't care for the \nconsequences to the worker. If you are a fair trader, the code word \nmeans you are a protectionist. I would like to be thought of as a \nbalanced trader. You cannot have balance if your trading partner at the \ngovernmental level cheats.\n  I don't have enough time to go into how I think the Chinese \nGovernment intentionally steals intellectual property rights of \nAmerican companies and foreign companies, but 90 percent of all the \nvideos and tapes sold in China are pirated. If you do business in \nChina, your intellectual property is very much at risk because there is \nno rule of law protection. The Chinese Government helps companies \ntransship--illegally ship goods produced in China to get the benefit of \ntrade agreements to which they are not party, and it goes on and on. \nBut one of the biggest abuses is to value the currency in an \nartificially low manner that pegs the Chinese currency to the dollar in \na way that gives a 15-percent to 40-percent discount.\n  Our amendment, that of myself and Senator Schumer, tries to let the \nChinese know we are not going to take this anymore. They need to take \ncorrective action. If we are going to trade with you, if you are going \nto be a member of the family of nations, you need to comply with \ninternational trade laws when it comes to how you value money; that you \ncan't cheat without a consequence.\n  If you doubt what I am saying, talk with any manufacturing entity \nthat is a domestic manufacturer that competes with China and ask them \nabout the money problem, the currency, the devaluing of the Chinese \ncurrency, and how it affects their ability to be competitive. In \ndroves, they will tell you that you need to either get China to \nfloat their currency like every other market-based economy has done, to \nfind its true value, as we do, or you need to revalue it to get a more \nfair and accurate representation of the value of the Chinese currency.\n\n  We have had great job growth in the last 2 months. That is \nencouraging. But one thing we have not been able to accomplish yet is a \nrebounding in manufacturing jobs. I am here to say I support the \nPresident in every endeavor to try to grow this economy, but we--the \nadministration, the Congress, the House and the Senate--need to deal \nmore aggressively with Chinese abuses when it comes to trade.\n  From September 2002 to September 2003, there has been a 6.6 percent \ndecline in manufacturing jobs in South Carolina. One of the great \nreasons is not productivity gains; it has been a loss of market share \nto China--not because they work harder, not because they are smarter, \nbut because the Government cheats.\n  As a whole, the U.S. manufacturing jobs have decreased by 4.2 \npercent. Only two States, Hawaii and Nevada, have seen an increase in \nmanufacturing jobs. In South Carolina, 41,000 jobs in 2003 were lost in \nmanufacturing and 3 million American jobs have been lost in the last \n5\\1/2\\ years. China's access to the U.S. textile industry and apparel \nmarket more than doubled in 2002, growing at 117 percent. That is in \naddition to 114 percent up in 2003.\n  The bottom line to all this is there will be no economic recovery in \nmanufacturing until our country aggressively deals with trade abuses of \nChina in a wide variety of areas, but one of the chief abuses is the \nChinese Government artificially devalues its money, creating a discount \nfrom 15 to 40 percent on every product made in China. That is not fair \nto those people who are competing with Chinese companies. It is done \nintentionally and it has a serious and dramatic effect on our ability \nto sustain manufacturing jobs in this country.\n  The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission was a \ncommission established by the Congress to look at Chinese policies and \nhow they affect our economy and whether China is playing fairly. It is \na bipartisan group. It is a group before which I have testified. They \nhave taken testimony from a variety of people in the United States \nabout China and how China affects the U.S. market and whether Chinese \npractices comply with international trade regimes. Here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       China, in violation of both its IMF and WTO obligations, is \n     in fact manipulating its currency for trade advantage.\n       The Commission urges the congressional leadership to use \n     its legislative powers to force action by the U.S. and \n     Chinese governments to address this unfair and mercantilist \n     trade practice.\n\n  They are telling us that, yes, the currency in China is being \nintentionally manipulated and it is costing us jobs and it has a \ndetrimental impact on the American economy.\n  It is being undervalued on purpose to create a trade advantage. They \nare urging us to get the administration and us as a body--the House and \nSenate as bodies--to fight back. I am here to say I accept their \nchallenge. I am willing to fight back.\n  We are not going to have a cloture vote with my vote until I get a \npromise we are going to address this problem this year.\n  Since 1994, when China pegged its currency to the dollar, the trade \ndeficit has increased dramatically. In 1994, they tied the value of \ntheir currency to\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\nthe United States dollar in a way that the China Trade Commission found \nto be unfair and a way that Secretary of the Treasury Snow's office \nfound to be manipulated, to be unfair.\n  In 1994, the trade deficit with China was $30 billion. In 2003, it is \n$124 billion and it is going up. This says a lot about the problem we \nhave with China. You will never convince me their markets are fairly \nopen and their conduct as a government is not responsible for this \nincreased trade deficit. All of it is not due to the currency \ndevaluation, but a great deal of it is. The question for the Senate is: \nAre we going to sit on the sidelines and ignore this problem? Are we \ngoing to continue to allow the Chinese Government to continue to \nintentionally devalue its currency, creating an advantage for Chinese \ncompanies over American companies, and have no response? The answer of \nthis Senator is, no, we are not going to sit on the sidelines. As \nSenators, we need to be held accountable about this abuse by China. If \nMembers do not think it is an abuse, come to the Senate and say so, but \nspeak up one way or the other. No more being silent on an issue this \nimportant to our economy.\n\n  Since permanent normal trade relations have been established by \nChina, there has been an explosion of Chinese exports. PNTR status used \nto be most-favored-nation status. They changed the acronym because no \none wants to say China is the most favored nation because they are so \nabusive to their people and the world at large. We changed the acronym. \nThe reason we changed the acronym is because people did not want to \nassociate themselves with saying China is a most favored nation.\n  We need a more ``Ronald Reagan response'' to China. It is an evil \nempire that abuses people. It does not allow freedom of speech or \nfreedom of religion. It is hard to trade with people who have none of \nthe values you possess. Since 2001, there has been over a 20-percent \nincrease in Chinese imports. Our exports to China have basically been \nflat. They are taking us to the cleaners.\n  China has been in clear violation of IMF and WTO commitments by \nmaintaining an unfairly low exchange rate to gain competitive \nadvantage. IMF article IV states that members should avoid manipulating \nexchange rates in order to gain an unfair competitive advantage over \nother members.\n  That is what is going on in China. We are proposing in our amendment \nthat if China does not fairly value its currency to meet international \nstandards of doing business--and, yes, every country has sovereignty \nover their own currency, but countries do not have the right to \nmanipulate their currency in a way to create an unfair advantage in the \nworld marketplace and still consider themselves a member of the family \nof nations.\n  What we are talking about is bringing about corrective action that \ninternational trade regimes require. That is all we are talking about. \nWe are going to give the Chinese 180 days to correct this problem and \nwork with them to do so, but we are not going to let them get away with \nit.\n  About 3 or 4 months ago, maybe even longer now, this body unanimously \npassed a resolution I authored condemning the Chinese manipulation of \ntheir currency, saying it was unfair, created damage to the American \neconomy, and hurt American manufacturing. That was passed by a voice \nvote, with no opposition. That has not done anything. I thought it \nmight. I thought it might get their attention, but the abuse still \ncontinues.\n  It is now time to be serious. The amendment we offer says if you do \nnot peg your current currency in a more accurate way, or ``float'' as \nyou should, being a major economic force in the world, we will start \nputting tariffs on your products 6 months down the road. And we have \nthe right to do that under international law. A reevaluation of the \nyuan should permit other nations' currencies to go up at least partway, \nmaybe 10 percent or so.\n  The whole idea of trade is to help developing nations and rise all \nboats. The Chinese manipulation of their currency and their practices \nare to sink every boat around them. The Dominican Republic and other \ndeveloping nations are having a hard time competing with China. China \nis not interested in raising the boats of other nations. They \nare interested in stealing market share and sinking every boat they can \nget hold of.\n\n  If they change their practices, it will allow their neighbors to \naccurately value their currencies, helping American manufacturing in a \ntremendous way. What would that way be?\n\n       If you put all these currency changes together--not just \n     China, the Asian region--the result would be a $50 billion \n     reduction in the United States current account deficit, which \n     in turn translates to something like 500,000 high-paying \n     jobs, mainly in manufacturing in this country.\n\n  That is according to Fred Bergsten, Ph.D., Director for the \nInternational Institute for Economics.\n  That sentiment has been echoed by people in the manufacturing \ncommunity, economists, all over this country, all over the world. The \nEuropean Union is having a problem with Chinese currency practices. \nAgain, 500,000 high-paying jobs could come about if the Chinese only \nplayed fair.\n  I have something to say to the Senate: Chinese are not going to play \nfair on their own. If we want the Chinese Communist dictatorship to \nplay fair, we will have to push them.\n  A pegged exchange rate policy is not appropriate for a major economy \nin the global system such as China. They are pegging the yuan to the \ndollar where it will always be of less value than the dollar, \nartificially low, creating a discount on any product made in China. If \nI am selling the product where dollars are involved, and you are \nselling a product in China where the yuan is involved, and you have \nlowered the value of that currency, you have created an advantage for \nyourself. That is exactly what is going on.\n  Secretary Snow stressed that a flexible market-based exchange rate \nregime and reduced controls on capital flows are the best system for \nChina and all major world economies. He is exactly right. He stated \nthat in April of 2004.\n  We have manufacturing business owners who are telling us we have a \nproblem. We have Secretary Snow who has looked at it and found abuses. \nWe have world class economists telling us we have a problem with China. \nWe have the Congress's own commission that was chartered to investigate \nChina in terms of potential abuses telling us that the currency is \nundervalued in a manipulative fashion, hurting American manufacturing \nunfairly. Now we have labor unions commenting.\n\n       While many factors contributed to this devastating job loss \n     (in manufacturing), it is clear that the Chinese government's \n     manipulation of its currency, violation of international \n     trade rules and egregious repression of its citizens' \n     fundamental democratic and human rights are key contributors \n     to unfair competitive advantage. The Chinese government is \n     flouting its international obligations and the U.S. \n     government must act urgently to hold it accountable.\n\n  That is from the AFL-CIO. The truth is, myself and the AFL-CIO \nprobably do not agree on a lot of domestic issues. Sometimes we do. On \nthis issue we see China the same. China is a dangerous, growing threat \nto this country. Their military is doubling, exponentially growing in \nterms of its capabilities. They are getting money from international \ntrade regimes where they are cheap.\n  The Chinese people, I am sure, are good, decent people and living \nunder very oppressive conditions, something we would not stand for 5 \nminutes.\n  At the end of the day, the least we can do is fight back against its \nCommunist dictatorship when they cheat. If we are going to trade with \nChina, then we need to make China part of the family of nations. But \nthis country needs to stand up to the Chinese Government when they \ncheat. They are undervaluing their currency on purpose. It is costing \nus a lot of jobs. It is not fair, and it needs to be addressed.\n  I am here to say, as a U.S. Senator in his first term, I am going to \ndo everything I can to bring this issue to the Senate. I want to do it \non this bill. If I can reach an agreement with our leadership and \nfriends on the other side, we will do it down the road. But we are \ngoing to address this problem. I hope we do something about China's \ntrade abuses sooner or later before it costs us more jobs.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, about 6, 7 months ago, I rose on the \nfloor of the Senate to talk about some good economic news. We have gone \nthrough very difficult economic times in this country--a recession that \nbegan before President Bush got elected. There was a devastating impact \non the psychology of American consumers because of corporate fraud, \ncorporate malfeasance, the actions we saw with Enron and WorldCom, and \nTyco, for which some of those folks involved in that will ultimately be \nbrought to justice. But it had a devastating impact on the confidence \nof American consumers and the economy.\n  Then we had September 11, which had a devastating physical impact, \ndevastating psychological impact, with great suffering across the \nboard. And, again, beyond the hurt that so many families suffered and \nthe Nation suffered, the economy suffered. The economy suffered, and \nthe economy slowed down. Americas had not been attacked on its own \nshores, I believe, since the War of 1812.\n  In spite of that, look at where we are today, 3 years later. There is \ngood news. With all the challenges we face in this world, sometimes you \nhave to stand up and talk about good news.\n  When I rose on the floor of the Senate about 6 months ago, there was \na little bit of good news, and my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle talked about: Let's not be premature. My colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle still lambasted, and continue to criticize, the \nvision and the actions of the President and this Congress in cutting \ntaxes.\n  Today, I had a chance to review the most recent numbers by the Labor \nDepartment. Mr. President, 288,000 new jobs were created in April. And \nit is not just April. As the Presiding Officer from Oregon is well \naware, what happens is the Labor Department often recalculates the \nreports from months before. And the month before the job numbers were \nvery strong. They were at 308,000 new jobs in March. Well, in today's \nlisting of the jobs for April, the March numbers have been revised \nupward to 337,000 jobs.\n  In fact, if you go back to March, what happened in March is that the \nLabor Department revised up the January and February job gains. So the \ntotal in January and February and March was over half a million new \njobs created in this country over 3 months. Now what we see is over a \nmillion jobs--a million jobs--created in this country in the last 8 \nmonths. That is good news. That is something Americans should \ncelebrate.\n  When I was the mayor of St. Paul, folks used to say: Mayor, what are \nyou doing for a kid today?\n  And I would say: One of the best things I can do for a kid is make \nsure mom and dad have an opportunity to work.\n  There are all sorts of good things that come with a job, not the \nleast of which is health insurance. The best welfare program is a job. \nThe best housing program is a job. There is the dignity that comes with \na job, the impact it has on a family, and the lessening of the \npressures that one sees in a family. So there is a whole range of great \nthings that happen.\n\n  It is interesting; I am an optimist and have always been an optimist. \nSometimes there are folks who look at what is good news and what is bad \nnews, and at times I sense that with our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle there is a dark cloud over there waiting for the rain to \nhappen. But the sun is beginning to shine--and not beginning to shine, \nit is shining on Americans who are looking for work--a million new jobs \nin 8 months, 288,000 jobs in April. The reason is, in large measure, \nbecause of the tax cuts this Congress enacted.\n  Talk to any small businessperson, and they will tell you, when you \ngive bonus depreciation, it increases their incentive to put money into \nnew equipment. When you put money into new equipment, folks who produce \nthat equipment have a job, and folks who run that equipment have a job. \nWhen you accelerate or increase expensing, again, it is an \nencouragement to small business. And small businesses are where the \njobs have grown. The small business then reinvests in the business. \nWhen you reinvest in the business, you grow jobs. When you lower the \ntop rate--which is not about tax cuts for the rich--it is tax cuts for \nsmall businesses.\n  I had an opportunity to be in Rochester, MN, the other day. We talked \nabout taxes. I asked the business folks: How many of you are subchapter \nS corporations? A lot of hands went up. I am not an accountant, and I \nused to be a lawyer. But subchapter S corporations are taxed at the \nsame level as personal taxes. So when we talk about cutting the highest \nrate, what is happening is we are cutting the tax load for the job \ncreators in this country, the small business men and women.\n  Yesterday, there was good news. State initial claims for jobless \nbenefits in April, in my State, fell 31.5 percent from last April, \nhitting the lowest level since before the 2001 recession. Initial \nclaims nationally dropped, last week, by 25,000, to 350,000--the lowest \nnumber of claims since October 2000.\n  Retailer sales are up. Productivity is up. Consumer confidence is up. \nHome buying is up. It is fascinating; the economy grew at a healthy \n4.2-percent rate in the first quarter, up 4.1 percent in the previous \nquarter. When I read the Minneapolis Star Tribune yesterday, they were \nsaying: April figures will be announced. Economists were expecting a \ngain of 150,000 jobs. Well, the economists were wrong.\n  We have already doubled what was reported by the Labor Department. \nThe unemployment rate was supposed to remain constant at 5.7 percent, \nbut it has dipped another tenth of a percent to 5.6 percent.\n  Mr. President, this is great news for about every American, except \nJohn Kerry. I hope we put the politics aside. I hope my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle can now say, yes, President Bush was right \nthat when you cut taxes, when you cut the tax load on small businessmen \nand businesswomen, it grows jobs; when you cut taxes and put money back \nin the pockets of moms and dads, it grows jobs.\n  This is not a politician standing up and talking; these are the \nfacts. This is the data the Department of Labor has reported. The \nPresident's vision was clear, the President's vision was right. \nCongress was right to act on that vision. The great beneficiaries today \nare the moms and dads in America who can now look out and say there is \nmore job opportunity out there, and that is a very good thing.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to reflect and respond to the \nreports of what has happened in Iraq over the last several weeks--the \npictures emerging of U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners, the \nappalling treatment of those in our custody.\n  I have struggled over the last several days to put into words my own \nreactions to these images from half a world away. I have been angered \nby it, and I have been, in some ways, sickened by it. This has \nbesmirched the reputation of our country, damaged the reputation of our \nsoldiers serving in Iraq, the vast majority of whom have served \nhonorably, many of them heroically.\n  Yet, what is dominating the news not only in our country but around \nthe world are images of American soldiers torturing and humiliating \nthose we have captured. This does enormous damage to our cause against \nterrorism. It does enormous damage to America's standing in the world. \nThink of how we would feel if these images were of our\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\nsoldiers and American citizens being treated this way by Iraqis. What \nwould be the reaction in America if we saw our soldiers being \nhumiliated and abused in the most immoral ways?\n  This is, first and foremost, an issue of morality. What has happened \nis morally wrong. It is wrong to humiliate people. It is wrong to abuse \npeople. It is wrong to torture people. Those are fundamental values. \nThose are American values. Those are values that are shared by \nvirtually every person in this country. What has happened is not the \nAmerica that I know, not the America that I love.\n  If we think about the larger effects of what has occurred, nothing \ncan be more clear than that it has done enormous damage to our cause \nagainst terrorism. Before this happened, 71 percent of the Iraqis had \ncome to see us as occupiers rather than as liberators. That is before \nthis occurred.\n  What can be the reaction of Iraqis now? After all of the words about \nour intentions and what we hoped to do to help the Iraqi people emerge \nfrom under a dictatorship and move toward freedom and democracy and the \nmost fundamental values that undergird this country, what can be their \nfeeling about America now?\n  I remember so well the President saying we had ended the torture \nchambers of Saddam Hussein. I must say that made me proud, that we had \ndone something good in this war, that we had ended the torture chambers \nof Saddam Hussein. I think we now have to ask, Have we just created our \nown? That is what the pictures show. That is what the stories say.\n  That is not America. That is not what we stand for. We cannot let \nthat be the lasting image of what America has done.\n  In the last few days, the papers across the globe and television \nstations around the world have been full of condemnation and anger \ndirected at America because there has been a failure, a failure of \nvalues, a failure of leadership, a failure to put the best American \nfoot forward. These results will be long lasting, make no mistake about \nit.\n  I graduated high school from an American Air Force base in Tripoli, \nLibya, North Africa. I lived for 2 years in the Arab culture among \nMuslims. I know if one were to try to design something that would \ncompletely and totally enrage people raised in that culture, one could \nnot have designed a scenario worse than what has happened. To have an \nAmerican female in a prison where Iraqi men were naked, forced into \nhomosexual positions, you could not design a circumstance that would \nmore gravely enrage Muslim sensibilities than that.\n  Think of what our reaction would be. Think of the anger we would \nfeel. In their culture, there is nothing more profoundly humiliating \nthan that, and humiliation breeds anger, and anger breeds terrorism. We \nhave created a recruiting poster for al-Qaida that will plague us for \nyears.\n  Right at the heart of this is morality, fundamental morality, and it \nis imperative that we stand up with one voice and say this is wrong, it \nis morally wrong, and that we, first, admit to what occurred; that we \npledge it will never happen again; that we move to make amends for \nthose who have been injured and humiliated and tortured; and that we \ntake steps to assure ourselves and others this will never happen again. \nThose are the basic steps of redemption under any moral code, and those \nare the steps that America must take now.\n  After September 11, there was a wave of sympathy and support for \nAmerica all around the world. Muslims condemned what had occurred--or \nat least a significant majority did--and all across the globe people \nrushed to America's side. Now, if you take public opinion soundings \nacross the world, what one finds is we have dissipated that wave of \nsympathy and support and replaced it with a rising level of disrespect \nfor America. That has serious consequences because, in the war on \nterror, we need allies, we need people who will help out, we need \npeople who will provide information on threats to America.\n  I think we have to seriously rethink how we are conducting this war \non terror. I think the war in Iraq was an enormous diversion from the \nreal war on terror. We must remind ourselves it was not Iraq that \nattacked the United States on September 11; it was al-Qaida.\n  Their acts were directed by Osama bin Laden, not by Saddam Hussein. \nAs evil and repugnant as Saddam Hussein, his sons and his regime were, \nthey were not the masterminds of the September 11 attack on the United \nStates. That was the dirty work of al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. They \nare the ones who ought to be our priority in holding people to account \nfor the vicious murder of nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11. It \nwas al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden who ought to have commanded top \npriority in our move to hold people accountable and responsible for \nthose vicious attacks. Instead, I believe we have allowed ourselves to \nbe diverted by a war in Iraq that had nothing to do with the September \n11 attacks.\n  I hope that as a nation we will rededicate our effort to go after \nthose who were responsible for the attacks on this country. It is now \nover 950 days since the September 11 attacks on this country, and still \nOsama bin Laden threatens America and American interests and our \nallies. Still he is issuing threats. Just most recently, he has put a \nbounty on the heads of those who stand with us.\n  If one looks at the priorities of our war on terror, we have 130,000 \ntroops in Iraq and only 15,000 troops in Afghanistan. Many of our elite \nunits were taken off the hunt for al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and \nshifted to the Iraqi front to be replaced by units in Afghanistan \nsearching for Osama bin Laden whose specialty was Spanish culture. What \nearthly sense does this make in the war on terror?\n  Our top priority should have been to continue aggressively the search \nfor Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida and their network of supporters who \ncontinue to plan attacks on this country.\n  As I have searched for some way to understand what has occurred in \nIraq, I was reminded yesterday in the New York Times of a prison \nexperiment that was conducted at Stanford University in 1971. The \nheadline in the New York Times story is ``Simulated Prison in 1971 \nShowed a Fine Line Between Normal and Monster.''\n  These experiments were conducted by the man who was my professor of \npsychology at Stanford University, Dr. Zimbardo. He took volunteers and \nrandomly split them into groups of ``guards'' and groups of \n``prisoners.'' And he found within days of the prison experiment \nbeginning that the guards had become swaggering and sadistic to the \npoint of placing bags over the prisoners' heads, forcing them to strip \nnaked, and encouraging them to perform sexual acts. This was not half a \nworld a way in Iraq. This was on the campus of Stanford University in \nCalifornia. That experiment and studies like it have given, as the New \nYork Times reports, insight into how ordinary people can, under the \nright circumstances, do horrible things.\n  Professor Zimbardo said that when the news from Iraq emerged, he was \nnot surprised that it happened. He said: ``I have exact, parallel \npictures of prisoners with bags over their heads from the 1971 study,'' \nthe prison experiment at Stanford University.\n  He went on to say that it is not that we put bad apples in a good \nbarrel; we put good apples in a bad barrel. That barrel corrupts \nanything that it touches.\n  Maybe that is what occurred here. Maybe we put good apples, \nfundamentally decent people, in a bad barrel and that barrel has \ncorrupted everything that it touched.\n  One thing that has been learned from these experiments is that in \nsituations where people have absolute power over others, it is \ncritically important that there are others who are watching, others who \nare monitoring, others who are ensuring that there is not abuse. The \nfact that proper oversight was not present is a failure of leadership, \nand it is a failure of leadership that goes right up the chain of \ncommand in our country.\n  I was asked yesterday, do I favor the resignation of the Secretary of \nDefense, Mr. Rumsfeld. I responded by saying, I want to see the full \nfacts before I call for anyone's resignation or removal. I want to know \nwhat did he know, when did he know it, and what did he do about it.\n\n  Those tests do not just apply to the Secretary of Defense; those \ntests apply to everyone in the chain of command.\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\nThey apply to our commanders in Iraq. They apply to General Myers, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Those tests apply to the \nSecretary of Defense and they apply to the President of the United \nStates. What did they know, when did they know it, and what did they do \nabout it?\n  What has occurred here is wrong. It is morally wrong. It has done \nenormous damage to our country, damage that will last for a very long \ntime. Those who are responsible should be held to account and we should \nmake certain that nothing like this ever happens again. This is not \nAmerica. These are not American values. This is not how America acts \ntowards others.\n  The behavior shown in these photos and on these tapes are not the \nbest of America. They are the worst of America, and we can do so much \nbetter. We are so much better.\n  I was also asked yesterday if I believe America should now leave Iraq \nimmediately. Yesterday I had lunch with the young people working in my \noffice for the spring semester, interns from all across my State. I \nasked them the question, What do you think we should do? Even those who \nfelt passionately that America had made a mistake in going to war in \nIraq believe that we simply cannot leave now; that we have an \nobligation to improve things; that we have an obligation to stabilize \nthings; that we have an obligation to prevent the bloodbath that would \ncertainly follow an immediate exodus by our country.\n  I voted against authorizing this war in Iraq because I did not \nbelieve it was in the national security interest of the United States. \nI believed we should not open a second front before we had finished \nbusiness with al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. I believed Iraq would be a \ndistraction. I believed it would take us away from a successful \nprosecution of the real war on terrorism. As much as I feel strongly \nthat that was correct, I also think it would be a mistake for the \nUnited States to exit precipitously from Iraq. The fact is, we are now \nresponsible for what occurs there. We have an obligation to try to make \nthis work.\n  I do not believe that means the United States has an obligation to \nmake a country in the image of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. But I do believe we have a responsibility to bring \nstability and to give the Iraqi people a chance to make judgments about \ntheir own future. That, fundamentally, is what democracy is all about. \nIt is not about America picking the leaders for Iraq. I must say, last \nweek I was taken aback to read Mr. Bremer and others talking about how \nwe are going to pick Iraq's new leaders. Think about that. How we are \ngoing to decide who Iraq's leaders are going to be? That is not \ndemocracy. That is not the role of America. Our job is not to pick \nIraq's leaders. How arrogant is that, to say we can go into a country \nand designate the leaders and think that those people would have any \ncredibility among their own people?\n  If you want to set up a group for failure, have them chosen by the \nUnited States. And for us to tell the Iraqi people, these are your \nleaders, what does that have to do with democracy? Those are not the \nvalues of America. We would not permit for one moment another person to \nchoose our leaders. What business do we think we have choosing theirs? \nI think the obligation we have is to help Iraq pick their own leaders \nand have a society where there is sufficient security for them to make \nthose decisions and for them to be able to rebuild an economy that has \nbeen shattered by decades of despotic rule by Saddam Hussein, and now \nby this war.\n  This is an important moment in history for our country. We are being \ntested, and we need to apply the best of American values and the high \nstandards of morality that have made this country great. We need to \nsend a signal to the rest of the world about what we really stand for. \nWe need to show all those across the globe that America is fully \ncommitted to the fundamental values of democracy and freedom and for \nthe ability of people to choose their own leaders free from fear and \nintimidation and terror. That is a test that we have faced many times \nin our history, and it is a test that we have passed with flying \ncolors.\n  At the same time, we should remind the world of the proudest moments \nin American history when, over and over, this country stood up against \nterrorism and fascism and communism and helped the rest of the world be \nfree. That is in the finest traditions of America. Those are the values \nwe embrace. That is the example we offer the world. Anything less \ndetracts from America's greatness.\n  I hope in the days ahead that this body and the other body and the \nPresident of the United States will reflect on a new direction for our \ncountry in Iraq and in the war on terror. We are faced with a grave \nthreat. I believe the strategy that has been pursued is one that, \ninstead of reducing the threat to our Nation, has actually increased it \nbecause when one humiliates, that creates anger, and anger breeds \nterrorism and strengthens those who wish to bring America down.\n  So this is a turning point. We have an opportunity to choose which \ndirection we take. So many times in our past we have been faced with \nthese choices, and always America has responded with its best. I am \nconfident that we will do the same now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, yesterday President Bush announced he is \ngoing to devote more money, more resources, and more personnel to \nenforcing restrictions on travel to the country of Cuba.\n  Let me describe the absurdity of what is happening with respect to \nthe use of resources by this administration in dealing with the country \nof Cuba. First let me say that Fidel Castro is a dictator. No one here \nhas time for Fidel Castro. That includes myself. The Cuban people \ndeserve to be free. But it is interesting to me that at a time when we \nare confronted with the threat of terrorism in this country, we see the \nadministration obsessed with Cuba, using resources that ought to be \nused in order to combat terrorism being used instead to enforce a ban \nagainst U.S. citizens from traveling in Cuba. It is an outrage. This \nadministration ought to be embarrassed about it.\n  Let me describe what I mean. There is an agency called OFAC--the \nOffice of Foreign Asset Control--in the Treasury Department. Their job \nis to track terrorists and to track the money that goes to finance \nterrorism. That is their job, and they have people working full time to \ntry to pull the cover off this web of money that moves back and forth \nto finance terrorists.\n  What are they doing at OFAC these days? I have a report from the \nDepartment of the Treasury. That report is in response to questions \nfrom myself and from other Members of Congress. It says that OFAC has \ntwo people investigating Osama bin Laden's wealth--that is, tracking \nmoney Osama bin Laden would use to further his efforts to commit acts \nof terrorism against this country and the rest of the world. Two \npeople.\n  Do you know how many people they have tracking Americans who travel \nto Cuba? There are twenty-one people tracking Americans who travel to \nCuba. Track them down, see if you can slap a big fine on them. They \nhave 21 people working on that, and they have 2 people working on \ntrying to find Osama bin Laden's money and shut down the ways he \nfinances his acts of terrorism. It is unbelievable. They ought to be \nprofoundly embarrassed down at the administration and the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  Let me give some examples. This is a picture of a woman named Joni \nScott. Joan Scott is someone who came to visit me. Joni Scott went to \nCuba 4 years ago to distribute free Bibles to the Cuban people. Guess \nwhat. In recent months these 21 sleuths down at\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\nthe Treasury Department who are supposed to be tracking money going to \nterrorists, tracked down this poor woman who was distributing free \nBibles in Cuba and slapped her with a big fine. Shame on her for \ndistributing free Bibles to the Cuban people. Has it come to the point \nwhere some American who travels to Cuba to distribute free Bibles is \nsomehow considered someone acting outside the interests of our country? \nSomeone who undermines this country's interest? Someone who is worse \nthan a terrorist? Is that what they are saying in the administration? \nThey tracked her down and they slapped a big fine on Joni Scott.\n  But she is not the only one. This is Joan Slote. They fined Joan \nSlote 10,000 bucks. She is a bicyclist in her midseventies. She rides \nin the Senior Olympics; she rides bicycles all over the world. What a \nwonderful woman. I have met her. She went with a Canadian bicycle group \nto Cuba just to bicycle in Cuba. They tracked her down and fined her \n$10,000, and then they tried to attach her Social Security checks while \nthe dispute was going on. When they finally settled for something less \nthan $10,000 and she sent them a check and they did not realize she had \nsent the check and paid the bill, so they then tried to attach her \nSocial Security payments. Tracking a little old lady riding bicycles? \nThat is what they are doing down at the Treasury Department because \nriding a bicycle in Cuba somehow undermines American interests. Are \nthey nuts? Are they just crazy? I don't understand this at all.\n  If it is not Joni Scott or Joan Slote, what about these folks who \nparticipate in the international event for disabled athletes. We \nstopped them from going. They lost a lot of money because they had \ntickets purchased to go to the international games in Havana, but those \nferocious folks down at Treasury who are supposed to be tracking assets \nthat support terrorism, they stopped these disabled athletes from going \nto Cuba. That would have undermined American interests, I guess.\n  Or the man from the State of Washington whose father died and was \ncremated. He previously had been a minister at a church in Cuba. His \nlast wish was to have his ashes buried on the church grounds where he \nministered, so his son dutifully complied. His son took his father's \nashes to Cuba to bury them on the church grounds. Guess what. He got a \nfine from the U.S. Government because we have folks down at the \nTreasury Department tracking these people.\n  Now, the Bush administration obviously is concerned about votes in \nFlorida. This is not about sound public policy; it is about politics in \nFlorida. They have actually trained 500 people in the Office of \nHomeland Security to try to track people getting on and off flights to \nand from Cuba so if an American tourist went to Cuba to travel, they \ncould find them and slap them with a fine.\n  They trained 500 people who are supposed to be doing work in the \nOffice of Homeland Security. Let me show you what they did with this \nbig, enhanced inspection with all these folks at the airports. They are \ngoing to grab them. They are going to nail them. We have not nailed \nOsama bin Laden. He is living in a cave someplace. He is probably not \nquaking in his cave, knowing there are only two people looking after \nhis finances in the Department of Treasury and there are 21 of them \nchasing little old ladies who ride bikes in Cuba.\n  But let me show you what they found with this big, enhanced \ninspection at the airports. At a time we are dealing with terrorism, we \nhave this big crackdown on American tourists. This chart shows what \nOFAC found. Boy, we nabbed them. Cuban cigars--officers of the Office \nof Homeland Security worked overtime to find Cuban cigars coming in on \nthe person of an American tourist who went to Cuba. That is going to \nsafeguard our country, if we just get rid of those Cuban cigars.\n  Then, of the 45,400 travelers who were inspected, 215 were suspected \nof attempting to vacation in Cuba. I don't know, I never heard of that \ncharge: suspected of taking a vacation.\n  Homeland Security inspectors found 283 alcohol and tobacco \nviolations. Well, were those major seizures? No. The Homeland Security \nspokeswoman says no. Each violation included a small amount of rum or \ncigars that were found on people who had been in Cuba.\n  There were 42 narcotics seizures. Oh, man, that ratchets up the \nimportance--42 narcotics seizures. Is it heroin or crack? No. No, it is \nnot that. It involves prescription drugs people had on their person. \nThey were taking medications for high cholesterol or perhaps a runny \nnose. So they nabbed them.\n  And then one hazardous material violation was discovered. Oh, man, \nthat sounds ominous. These Homeland Security investigators found \nsomebody coming back from Cuba, coming into this country, an American \ncitizen who had the temerity to vacation in Cuba who came back with a \nhazardous material on them. So they had a hazardous material violation. \nNow, that sounds like terrorism. But no, apparently the hazardous \nmaterial was a carbon dioxide canister used to put fizz in seltzer \nwater.\n  Presumably discoveries like these make it OK that we have 500 people \ntracking American tourists traveling in Cuba and two people tracking \nOsama bin Laden's finances.\n  We have 21 people down at OFAC going over their books. They wear \ntheir suspenders and green eyeshades, wearing their knuckles white, so \nthey can track down a little old lady riding a bicycle, or so they can \ntrack down a wonderful young woman distributing free Bibles in Cuba. \nShame on these people. Shame on these people who decide that trying to \ntrack American citizens who are on vacation is a more important and a \nmore urgent priority than tracking Osama bin Laden's financial network.\n  Now, I am a Norwegian Lutheran, and I don't use that language very \neasily. But I tell you what, I get angry when I see what is happening.\n  My colleague from Montana is in the Chamber. He was one of those who \ngot this report. I asked the question of Secretary Snow: How many \npeople are you using down at the Department of Treasury to track \nAmerican tourists who travel to Cuba? Well, he did not know.\n  I said: Give me the answer. They apparently did the same thing in the \nFinance Committee. They got the answer. Twenty-one people are tracking \nAmerican tourists going to Cuba, and two people are tracking Osama bin \nLaden's finances. What on Earth are they thinking of? Is there not one \nperson down there with one ounce of common sense? I do not understand \nit at all.\n  Here is a chart: There are 100 times more enforcement cases on Cuba \nthan there are on terror issues.\n  And I mention Joni Scott. Let me just finish by again mentioning Joni \nScott. Joni Scott is with a religious group. This wonderful young \nwoman, a good-hearted woman, who cares deeply about her faith in God \nand wants to share it with others, she went, 4 years ago, to Cuba to \ndistribute free Bibles. It was an enriching experience, she said. And \nwas she surprised, not too long ago, to get something in the mail from \nthe U.S. Treasury Department because they have these sleuths down here, \nnot working on things that matter, not working on tracking Osama bin \nLaden and other terrorist networks, no; they are working on this young \nwoman who is distributing free Bibles. I do not understand it.\n\n  I say this, that when we have an opportunity, this year, to affect \nthe financing of the Department of Treasury, I--and I hope others who \nwill join me--will say to them that is not the way you are going to use \nthe taxpayers' money. You have an obligation not to be soft on \nterrorism. You have an obligation not to be soft-headed. You have an \nobligation to use the funding we are providing to track terrorists, to \ncrack the network of financing that Osama bin Laden and others use to \ncommit acts of murder against American people, and against Spanish, and \nother people around the world, where people have been victimized by \nthese acts of terror.\n  So always, it seems to me, it is a case of choosing, making choices. \nWhat do you want to use the money for? What is more important? What is \nmore urgent? What should we be doing? The administration's choice \nyesterday to put even more people into tracking down American tourists \nto Cuba is unbelievable. It is unbelievable to see an administration \nmake such, not only an embarrassing choice, but a choice that is \nfundamentally so soft on terrorism, so soft\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\non combating terrorism, and so hard-headed in trying to track American \ntourists down and slap them with a fine.\n  This notion of trying to slap Fidel Castro around by injuring the \nrights of the American people ought to stop. It does not hurt Fidel \nCastro that we have told the American people you cannot travel in Cuba. \nYou can travel in Communist China. You can travel in Communist Vietnam. \nBut you cannot travel in Communist Cuba. If we spend all this money on \nTV and Radio Marti in order to put voices in Cuba over television and \nradio, to give them another voice other than Fidel Castro, what sense \ndoes it make to say to the American people that traveling to Cuba so \nthat Cubans hear other voices is somehow not worthy, but putting up an \nexpensive radio and television station so the Cubans hear other voices \nis worthy?\n  The Europeans, the Canadians, and others, have used much more common \nsense than we have on this issue. And the President, rather than making \nthings better, is making it much worse. I have no trust for Fidel \nCastro. I want him removed. I think the Cuban people ought to be free \nto choose their own government. But neither do I have any sympathy for \na public policy that is so devoid of common sense, and it is getting \nworse every day, and was made worse yesterday by this President's \nannouncement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5037-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5037-S5039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  POLICIES ON OUR INDIAN RESERVATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague is here to speak, but I do \nwant to make another comment about the health care policies on our \nIndian reservations, an important concern.\n  I want to first say that we have to, in my judgment, deal with these \nissues in a manner that we have not previously done. On our Indian \nreservations in this country, in most cases, we have conditions that \nreflect Third World countries. We have four Indian reservations in my \nState of North Dakota.\n  American Indians today have a life expectancy that is 6 years less \nthan all the rest of the American people. Their rate of alcoholism is \nseven times the rate of the rest of the American people. Their rate of \ntuberculosis is over seven times the rate of the rest of the American \npeople. Their rate of diabetes is four times the rate of the rest of \nthe American people. For accidents, there are nearly triple the \nfatalities on reservations. For suicides, the rate is twice that of the \nrest of the American people. For homicides, the rate is more than \ndouble the rest of the American people.\n  The fact is, we have a very serious problem on these Indian \nreservations. There is, in my judgment, despair and little hope. A \nyoung girl named Tamara Demaris, some years ago, was put in a foster \nhome by a social worker who was handling 150 cases. She did not have \ntime to investigate the home. At that home, there was a drunken party, \nand little Tamara was beaten severely. Her hair was pulled out at the \nroots. Her nose was broken. Her arm was broken. That little girl will \nprobably never get over the scars of that terrible beating.\n\n  That situation has changed. There is no longer one social worker with \n150 cases. We now inspect and investigate where a three year-old child \nwill be placed. But that is the kind of circumstance that happened \nbecause the resources did not exist. We were supposed to protect that \nchild and we did not. I am talking about our society--yes, our society.\n  I will give you another example. The child in this picture died a few \nweeks ago. This young child's name is Avis. Avis missed 90 days of \nschool this school year. She stayed in bed for many days curled up in a \nball. She desperately needed help. All of her actions cried out for \nhelp. Avis, by all accounts, was a young girl who loved to ride horses, \nloved animals, and loved her family. But several weeks ago, Avis died. \nOn that reservation, they had one psychologist, one social worker, and \nno automobile to take anybody to seek treatment. So when you talk to \nthe relatives and the people whose lives intersected with this young \ngirl named Avis, you understand the tragedy of her situation. Avis \nneeded help and didn't get it. At a critical time in the life of this \nyoung 14-year-old girl, she didn't get the help she needed.\n  The Indian Health Service budget for this year recommends cutting \nback on mental health services provided on these reservations. There is \nnot enough as it is. It is painfully thin in terms of the amount of \nresources.\n  The federal government has direct responsibility for the health care \nof several groups of people in this country, including Federal \nprisoners and American Indians. We protect American Indians, and we \nhave a trust responsibility for their health care. With respect to \nFederal prisoners, it is our obligation. We spend almost twice as much \nmoney per person on health care for Federal prisoners as we do for \nAmerican Indians. The result is that wonderful young people such as \nAvis lose their lives. It should not happen.\n  I wish to mention one other thing and then I will conclude. While \nthere is great despair about these issues--and we must confront them \nthis year--there are some areas of hope.\n  The one area of hope, in my judgment, is tribal colleges on \nreservations. The stepladder up and out to opportunity is education.\n  I want to read something I have read before on the floor, because \nlast year we made enormous progress in increasing the funding for \ntribal colleges around the country. I want to read from a letter from a \nwoman I know named Loretta.\n  She says this:\n\n       I grew up poor and considered backward by non-Indians. My \n     home was a two-room log house in a place called the ``bush'' \n     on North Dakota's Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. I \n     stuttered. I was painfully shy. My clothes were hand-me-\n     downs. I was like thousands of other Indian kids growing up \n     on reservations across America.\n       When I went to elementary school I felt so alone and \n     different. I couldn't speak up for myself. My teachers had no \n     appreciation for Indian culture. I'll never forget that it \n     was the lighter-skinned children who were treated better. \n     They were usually from families that were better off than \n     mine. My teachers called me savage. Even as a young child I \n     wondered . . . What does it take to be noticed and looked \n     upon the way these other children are?\n       By the time I reached 7th grade I realized that if my life \n     was going to change for the better, I was going to have to do \n     it. Nobody else could do it for me. That's when the dream \n     began. I thought of ways to change things for the better--not \n     only for myself but for my people. I dreamed of growing up to \n     be a teacher in a school where every child was treated as \n     sacred and viewed positively, even if they were poor and \n     dirty. I didn't want any child to be made to feel like I did. \n     But I didn't know how hard it would be to reach the \n     realization of my dream. I almost didn't make it.\n       By the time I was 17 I had dropped out of school, moved to \n     California, and had a child. I thought my life was over. But \n     when I moved back to the reservation I made a discovery that \n     literally put my life back together. My sisters were \n     attending Turtle Mountain College, which had just been \n     started on my reservation. I thought that was something I \n     could do, too, so I enrolled. In those days, we didn't even \n     have a campus. There was no building. Some classes met at a \n     local alcohol rehabilitation center in an old hospital \n     building that had been condemned. But to me, It didn't \n     matter. I was just amazed I could go to college. It was life-\n     changing.\n       My college friends and professors were like family. For the \n     first time in my life I learned about the language, history \n     and culture of my people in a formal education setting. I \n     felt honor and pride begin to well up inside me. This was so \n     unlike my prior school experience where I was told my \n     language and culture were shameful and that Indians weren't \n     equal to others. Attending a tribal college caused me to \n     reach into my inner self to become what I was meant to be--to \n     fight for my rights and not remain a victim of circumstance \n     or of anybody. In fact, I loved college so much that I \n     couldn't stop! I had a dream to fulfill . . . or perhaps some \n     would call it an obsession. This pushed me on to complete my \n     studies at Turtle Mountain College and to ultimately earn a \n     Doctorate in Education Administration from the University of \n     North Dakota.\n       I've worked in education ever since, from Head Start \n     teacher's aide to college professor. Now I'm realizing my \n     dream of helping Indian children succeed. I am the Office of \n     Indian Education Programs' superintendent working with nine \n     schools, three reservations, and I oversee two educational \n     contracts with two tribal colleges. My life would not have \n     turned out this way were it not for the tribal college on my \n     reservation.\n       My situation is not unique and others feel this way as \n     well. Since 1974, when Turtle Mountain College was chartered \n     by the Turtle Mountain tribe, around 300 students have gone \n     on to earn higher degrees. We now have educators, attorneys, \n     doctors and others who have returned to the reservation. \n     They--I should say, we--are giving back to the community. \n     Instead of asking people to have pity on us because of what \n     happened in our past, we are taking our future into our own\n\n[[Page S5038]]\n\n     hands. Instead of looking for someone else to solve our \n     problems, we are doing it.\n       There's only one thing tribal colleges need. With more \n     funding, the colleges can do ever more than they've already \n     achieved. We will take people off the welfare rolls and end \n     the economic depression on reservations. Tribal colleges have \n     already been successful with much less than any other \n     institutions of higher education have received. That is why I \n     hope you will continue to support the American Indian College \n     Fund.\n       I'm an old timer. The College Fund didn't exist when I was \n     a student. I remember seeing ads for the United Negro College \n     Fund and wishing that such a fund existed for Indian people. \n     We now have our own Fund that is spreading the message about \n     tribal colleges and providing scholarships. I'm so pleased. I \n     believe the Creator meant for this to be. But so much more \n     must be done. There still isn't enough scholarship money \n     available to carry students full time. That is my new dream . \n     . . to see the day when Indian students can receive four-year \n     scholarships so they don't have to go through the extremely \n     difficult struggle many now experience to get their \n     education.\n       I hope you'll keep giving, keep supporting the College \n     Fund, so that some day this dream becomes reality. I know it \n     can happen because if my dream for my future came true, \n     anything is possible. Thank you.\n\n  This wonderful woman describes hope and opportunity through education \nand achievement. Her letter proves that when we invest in the right \nthings, when we care enough to give people the opportunity to step up \nand out of poverty and despair, toward hope and opportunity, then this \nis a better country for them and for all of us as well. That should be \ntrue with respect to our investment in the Indian Health Service. It is \ntrue with our respect to investment in tribal colleges. We must do much \nbetter as we approach these subjects this year. I will have more to say \nabout the Indian Health Service later.\n  I make the point that health care funding for American Indians is an \nissue, as we turn to the appropriations process, to which we must pay \nattention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Chair state the current parliamentary situation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business. \nEach Senator is permitted to speak up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota on \nboth subjects he just addressed. First, the American policy toward \nCuba.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment, as the Senator so clearly explained, devotes 80 percent of \nits financing resources--that is, investigating financing--to tracking \ndown American tourists who travel to Cuba, rather than Osama bin \nLaden's terrorist network. It is amazing.\n  I have gone to Cuba a couple times with Montana businessmen. We \nsigned a contract to sell agricultural products to Cuba.\n  If more Americans could travel to Cuba, it would be more likely that \nwe would be able to have a much better relationship with that country \nthan we now have.\n  Frankly, I also believe very strongly that the current U.S. position \nwith respect to Cuba--namely, prohibiting most Americans from traveling \nto Cuba--and the export embargo the U.S. Government has against Cuba \nhelps Fidel Castro. It is something he uses to rail against Americans. \nIronically, if the embargo was lifted and the travel ban was lifted, if \nwe were not investigating Americans going to Cuba, it would hasten the \nday for democracy in Cuba. It is clear to me that is what would happen.\n  You might ask, Why is the American Government taking such an inane \nview, with most of its resources tracking down good, law-abiding \nAmericans visiting Cuba, rather than trying to track down Osama bin \nLaden and his network? The answer is simple. It is basically politics. \nThis administration is being ruled by a community in the U.S. that \nwants to get back at Cuba. I think it is regrettable that the \nGovernment would not adopt a policy that is good for all America, but \nrather one that just helps the interests of a very small group in \nsouthern Florida. It is an outrage. I, frankly, think the \nadministration should be serving all of America and the Treasury \nDepartment should be devoting its resources to finding terrorists \nrather than checking up on American tourists traveling in Cuba.\n  The second subject the Senator talked about needs to be addressed \nover and over again; it is the abominable plight and economic \nconditions on America's Indian reservations. The Senator from North \nDakota mentioned poverty in many reservations in North Dakota. The same \ncan be said for many reservations throughout the country. In Montana, \nwe have several reservations and the conditions are, in some cases, \njust as bad. In other areas, it is getting a lot better. Fifty percent \nof all the welfare cases, TANF cases, are on Indian reservations. We \nhave an obligation to address that in a solid and constructive way.\n  I wish to explain a few of the positions in the bill that will be \nbefore us. It is not before the Senate at the immediate time, but we \nhave considered the bill over the last week, the JOBS bill.\n  Some of the provisions in that bill relate to helping people who live \non Indian reservations to live a much better life. These are provisions \nto help build schools, provisions to help create good jobs on the \nreservations, and provisions to keep businesses investing on \nreservations.\n  Let me explain a couple of them. First, the JOBS bill includes the \nextension of two provisions which allow tribes to issue tax-exempt \nbonds to build facilities just like the authority that State and local \ngovernments have. We believe, those of us who wrote the JOBS bill, \ntreating tribes like State governments makes good economic sense; that \nit is just plain fair and it is the right thing to do. If State and \nlocal governments can issue tax-exempt bonds to construct facilities, \nso should reservations. I am glad we have that provision in the JOBS \nbill.\n  It also includes a special allocation of what is called new markets \ntax credits for reservations. This provision allocates $50 million in \nnew markets tax credits where poverty rates exceed 40 percent. The new \nmarkets tax credits are designed to spur investment in economically \ndepressed areas. They are not going to solve all the problems that \nexist on reservations but they are certainly going to help, help bring \njobs, help businesses, help spirit entrepreneurship that is so needed \naround our country.\n  This allocation will apply to only the poorest reservations. Lifting \nthese reservations out of the grip of poverty is a moral obligation \nthat all of us in the Senate have.\n  Finally, the JOBS bill addresses school construction on reservations. \nEducation is the key to success in many areas of the country. Many of \nthe jobs we hear about going overseas would probably not go overseas if \nthere were more than high school diplomas and better education in \nAmerica.\n  We have good education but it has to be much better. Without properly \neducated citizens, we cannot compete in the 21st century.\n  Many of the schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are woefully \ndilapidated and often dangerous, literally dangerous for students and \nteachers. The Bureau of Indian Affairs schools are in generally poorer \nphysical condition and have a much more unsatisfactory environment, and \nmore often lack key facilities requirements for education reform, and \nare less able to support computer and communications technology. The \nBureau of Indian Affairs schools are that bad.\n  The JOBS bill includes a provision that will allow tribes to issue \ntax credit bonds to raise funds for construction, rehabilitation, or \nrepair of tribal school facilities funded by the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. This provision gives hope to children stuck in third-rate \nschools. Every child deserves a decent place to go to school. This \nprovision, again in the JOBS bill, will help tribes to raise the funds \nnecessary to provide them.\n  This bill will also bring opportunity to all Americans, an \nopportunity for jobs training, and entrepreneurship, and I am proud the \nJOBS bill also includes provisions aimed at bringing opportunity to \nreservations and tribal communities across the country.\n  A provision I did not really explain in sufficient detail has to do \nwith an employment credit that gives employers a payroll tax offset for \nhiring people on reservations, that would allow jobs to stay on \nreservations. In addition, the JOBS bill includes an extension of \naccelerated depreciation for equipment\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\npurchased by businesses that are located on reservations. This is a \nhuge benefit for small businesses on reservations and gives these \nbusinesses the incentives they need to expand.\n\n  The JOBS bill also includes several new provisions to give an \neconomic lift to tribes. Many tribes have difficulty raising capital in \norder to attract convention centers which work attract tourists to \nreservations. Unlike State and local governments, as I mentioned \nearlier, tribes do not issue bonds for many infrastructure investments.\n  I spoke earlier about that provision and wanted to restate that the \nbasic provisions allow tribes to issue tax exempt bonds to build \nfacilities just as State and local governments now have the authority \nto do. I believe treating tribes as we do State governments makes good \neconomic sense; it gives them an even greater sense of responsibility \nand destiny in controlling their own future. They should have that same \nability just as State and local governments.\n  So for all those reasons I think those Indian reservation provisions \nin the JOBS bill, which are designated to help Indians, will help. It \nis not going to solve all the problems on reservations, but it will \ncertainly give a little more help, a hope, a future to some very \ndepressed parts of our country, and if we fulfill our obligations to \nhelp out, I think we will have done a lot through the provisions of the \nJOBS bill directed at reservations. There are many other provisions in \nthe JOBS bill, obviously, but those directed toward Indian reservations \nwill certainly help those folks. I thank all members of the committee \nand the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, for including \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes. I \nknow the majority leader wants to come as well. I certainly want to be \ncourteous to him.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss an \nissue that has enormous importance for the West and other parts of the \ncountry, and that is the funding, critically needed funding, to protect \nour forests.\n  I believe we are going to have an extraordinarily difficult time in \nthe next few months coping with these forest fires that are causing \nsuch devastation in the West. I was part of a coalition, a member of \nthe Budget Committee which saw the Senate accept unanimously by voice \nvote a measure that would fully fund essentially what we were trying to \ndo, again on a bipartisan basis, in the Healthy Forests Restoration \nAct.\n  I come today because I have heard unofficially that possibly the \namendment I authored and which was accepted unanimously in this Chamber \nis not going to make it out of the budget conference. I think this \nwould be a grievous mistake given the reports we are getting now about \nthe prospect of an extraordinarily difficult fire season.\n  The amendment I authored would increase the budget authority to boost \ninvestments in the Healthy Forests Restoration Act to benefit our \nnational forests, the environment, local communities, and local \neconomies. My amendment would add $343 million to last year's $417 \nmillion for hazardous fuel reduction so as to be able to reach the $716 \nmillion authorization in title I of the Healthy Forests legislation.\n  Now, we have talked a lot during this session about the importance of \nhazardous fire reduction projects. We have talked about it in the \nBudget and Appropriations Committees, in the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act, and my colleagues have heard me repeatedly talk about \nhow important this funding would be. But every year these hazardous \nfuels projects go underfunded or unfunded, and that means another year \nwith little or no warning thousands of people in fire-prone communities \nend up tossing everything they can into their cars and fleeing their \nhomes without knowing if anything is going to remain when they return.\n  The Forest Service's inability to do all of the hazardous fuels \nreduction projects that needs to get done leads to real-life danger on \nthe ground in these small western communities.\n  It leads to danger in the backyards of our citizens, in their \nrecreation areas, and the places they gather in their communities.\n  Two years ago, in July of 2002, the Associated Press reported that \n17,000 people faced evacuation in Oregon. Here is just a bit of this \nreport:\n\n       Firefighters went door-to-door deciding which homes they \n     could save (in Cave Junction, Oregon) as an explosive 68,000-\n     acre wildfire nearby fed off heat, wind and timber.\n\n  These folks were evacuated, and a month later they were still \nevacuated. Another article from one of our publications, the Medford \nMail Tribune, noted the very personal nature of the disruption. It said \nthe Josephine County Sheriff's Office was beginning to reunite an \nestimated 400 evacuated animals, including livestock and even family \npets, with evacuated owners.\n  The Associated Press, that same news outlet, reported just yesterday \nthat an early fire season is expected in eastern Oregon. We are hearing \nabout this all over the West. There are going to be lots of fires. They \nare going to be very early. They, in my view, are going to cause \nenormous pain and hardship for our communities.\n  I implore my colleagues, both in the Senate and in the other body, to \nprotect what we have been able to do in a bipartisan kind of fashion, \nand that is to properly and fully fund this critical aspect of the \nHealthy Forests legislation.\n  For years there has been this budgetary sleight of hand with respect \nto forest fires, where the Forest Service takes from one account and \ngoes to another. When it is all done, it is clear there are not enough \nresources, and that is what I tried to change in the Healthy Forests \nlegislation. We had bipartisan support. Senator Domenici, for example, \nhas done yeoman's work on this for years and years. Senator Crapo, \nanother colleague in this body, has been so supportive of this effort.\n  I will take a few minutes to talk about what I think is ahead and why \nI hope that if the conference has not fully acted that we can protect \nthat amendment to fully fund the effort to deal with this huge fire \nrisk that we are facing.\n  Just yesterday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported:\n\n       California's fire season, off to an ominously early start, \n     could be exacerbated by increasing numbers of dead trees, \n     frozen funding for fuel-reduction projects and the implacable \n     expansion of the suburbs into wildlands. Federal officials \n     moved Wednesday to address one of those concerns, freeing \n     $240 million for removal of dead trees in San Diego, San \n     Bernardino and Riverside Counties, after Senator Feinstein \n     complained about restrictions on the funds. Still, State and \n     national officials say the trend in recent years of extremely \n     destructive wildfires in California and throughout the West \n     is likely to continue this season.\n\n  From the CBS Associated Press story entitled ``Early Start For \nCalifornia Fires,'' which came from Corona, CA, on May 5, just days \nago:\n\n       As acrid smoke for more than 18,000 acres of charred brush \n     curled skyward, California officials feared the earlier-than-\n     usual start of the summer wildfires season could make it the \n     most dangerous ever. Just months after the most devastating \n     wildfires in State history . . . thousands of acres from San \n     Diego to Santa Barbara are ablaze. Thousands of \n     firefighters are on the line, and once again residents are \n     fleeing advancing flames.\n\n  The same day, the Associated Press said:\n\n       It's like gasoline. More than 1,000 people were evacuated \n     in the northeastern Lake Elsinore area as the Cerrito Fire \n     was whipped up by winds.\n\n  Tuesday, the Los Angeles Daily News:\n\n       It was the explosive end to the State's worst fire season, \n     from which the region still hasn't recovered. And this year, \n     authorities say, could be worse. Much, much worse.\n\n  To those thousands of folks across the country, particularly those \nwhom I represent in Oregon who have been pounded by these devastating \nfires year after year, the bickering and the back and forth in Congress \non fully funding forest health, this is not a theoretical thing to \nthose Oregonians. It is not some kind of policy discussion. It is a \ndanger to their families, a danger to their communities, every single \nday.\n  By working in a bipartisan fashion, after more than 25 years the \nCongress came together, passed a landmark\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\npiece of wildfire legislation, which was signed into law by the \nPresident on December 3 of last year. It is going to protect \ncommunities from catastrophic forest fires, preserve old-growth trees, \nrestore unhealthy forests, and protect the involvement of our \ncommunities in discussing these issues.\n  I was very pleased that because of the bipartisan cooperation, we \nwere able to get the Senate to pass a balanced practical approach to \nHealthy Forests legislation, and it authorized the $760 million that is \nessential for hazardous fuels reduction projects, and it made possible \nmy budget amendment that would have provided the funding room necessary \nfor the landmark legislation.\n  Without the help of the budget amendment that was adopted earlier, \nthe issue that is now being debated in Congress, the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act is not going to be able to live up to the full promise \nthat folks in Cave Junction, OR, or Corona, CA, are counting on. The \namendment in the budget resolution will take us a step closer to \nfulfilling the vision that people have in the rural West of this law. \nThey deserve an approach and critical response from the Federal \nGovernment, starting now with the prospect of a devastating fire \nseason.\n  This body agreed that hazardous fuels reduction projects, the \nNational Fire Plan, and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act should be \ngiven complete and bipartisan support. I am hopeful that the budget \nconferees will see the importance of keeping intact the unanimously \naccepted Senate position to fight these fires with the resources \nnecessary.\n  It is critical that we not disappoint people in these small rural \ncommunities across the West. They are counting on the Congress to \nensure that they have the resources that are going to be essential to \nsave their homes and safeguard their lives.\n  I do not want to see these families evacuated again this year and \nnext year because the Congress did not do its job.\n  I urge our colleagues, at a time when we are about to go to the \nbudget conference, to support the effort to fully fund forest fires, to \npromote the healthy forest effort that we enacted on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5040-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MOTHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this Sunday a lot of families will be \ncelebrating a very special day, a day of joy, a day of thankfulness, \nand for some a day of sadness due to the fact that their loved ones, \ntheir mothers, have passed.\n  Restaurants are going to be packed for Sunday brunch. Living rooms \nare going to be full of fidgety children. Families are going to recall \nteasing stories, all to tell their moms that they love them.\n  Mother's Day is the busiest long-distance calling day of the year. It \naccounts for more than one-fifth of all of the floral purchases made \nfor the holidays. I am looking forward to our own holiday with our \nfamily, going to church, celebrating Mother's Day with our immediate \nfamily, and then later in the day joining an extended family and some \nold friends for another Mother's Day dinner.\n  Celebrating moms is a tradition that stretches back millennia. \nAncient Greeks celebrated a holiday in honor of Rhea, the mythological \nmother of gods. Ancient Romans celebrated their mother goddess symbol, \nCybele, and in the British Isles and Celtic Europe, the people honored \nthe goddess, Brigid, and later her successor, St. Brigid, in a spring \ntradition of motherhood.\n  Mother's Day in America got its start in West Virginia in 1858, led \nby the indefatigable Anna Reeves Jarvis, a local schoolteacher. After \nyears of petitioning, Mother's Day finally became an official American \nholiday in 1914, and it was passed in the Congress as a joint \nresolution and signed by President Woodrow Wilson.\n  Today, 90 years later, Mother's Day is celebrated all over the world, \nnot just in the United States--in Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, \nAustralia, Belgium.\n  Abraham Lincoln said of his mom: All that I am or hope to be, I owe \nto my angel mother.\n  It is a sentiment that is shared by the humble and by the lofty, \nthroughout the ages and across the continents. Human nature binds us to \nour mothers. The Bible instructs us to respect and obey our mothers, \nand in turn mothers give us that gift that there is no way to return, \nthat ultimate gift, the gift of life.\n  I close on this tribute to Mother's Day and all the mothers who are \nlistening and to all the families who have lost their mothers with a \nquote by the basketball legend Karim Abdul-Jabar. I think it speaks to \nhow we all remember our moms--looking after us, taking care of all the \nlittle details, reminding us of the things we would miss as we are \ngrowing up, understanding all our unique attributes we might have, as \nwe think of that basketball legend. Karim said:\n\n       My mother had to send me to the movies with my birth \n     certificate so that I wouldn't have to pay the extra 50 cents \n     the adults had to pay.\n\n  Yes, it is the moms who were thinking about what we never necessarily \nthought of, looking at each of us as those very special instruments of \nlife.\n  So happy Mother's Day to all the mothers around the world and to my \nmom, who died 6 years ago. I miss her very much. To my wife Karyn's \nmom, Kathryn McLaughlin in Ft Worth, TX, happy Mother's Day; and of \ncourse most especially to my wife Karyn, who is the rock of our family, \nwho keeps it all together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5040-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5040-S5041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MOTHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this coming Sunday is Mother's Day. In \nkindergartens across the Nation, small hands are being pressed against \npink construction paper hearts, creating a somewhat smudgy record of \nloving hand prints for posterity. Those same small hands will clutch a \ncrayon tightly in order to scribe in wobbly letters the heartfelt \nsentiments so beloved by Mothers--the three best words on earth: I love \nyou.\n  Older children's efforts to honor their mothers may be more \nsophisticated, but the sentiment remains the same: I love you, Mother. \nOr Mom, Mommy, Mama, Ma, or Maw. The name may show some variation \nacross the country, but the title remains a cherished one. The flowers, \ntoo, may show some variation, from the short-stemmed fistful of \nbuttercups wilting in a sweaty young palm to the artistry of the floral \narranger with the world's bounty of blossoms at his or her fingertips. \nAnd these days, the cards may range from time-honored construction \npaper classics through sweet and witty store-boughts, to animated e-\nmail extravaganzas.\n  Whatever the display laid at the mother's feet this Sunday, the old \nadage remains true: It is the thought that counts. Mothers, who so \noften put their children and husband first, and themselves always last, \nwill surely be touched by the love reflected in the efforts to make her \nday a special one. From a plate of cold toast and runny home-cooked \neggs to an elaborate Sunday restaurant brunch, the meal will taste the \nsame to a mother on Mother's Day. It will taste of love.\n  It was just such a love that brought about the first Mother's Day, \nand the depth of the sentiment was and is such that this holiday \ncontinues to resonate among families today.\n  The first Mother's Day proclamation, I am proud to note, was issued \nby the Governor of West Virginia in 1910, but by 1911 every State had \nits own observances. Such is the depth of sentiment for mothers across \nthe Nation that fueled the spread of Mother's Day observances like \nwildfires across the parched West.\n  The Mother's Day International Association was incorporated on \nDecember 12, 1912, for the purpose of furthering the observance of \nMother's Day. By May 1913, the House of Representatives had adopted a \nresolution requesting that the President and other Federal Government \nofficials wear a white carnation on Mother's Day. The following year, \non May 8, 1914, the Congress adopted a joint resolution designating the \nsecond Sunday in May as Mother's Day and urging the U.S. Flag to be \nflown on Government buildings and private homes on that day ``as a \npublic expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our \ncountry.'' President Woodrow Wilson issued the first proclamation \nmaking Mother's Day an official national holiday.\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\n  What inspired this outpouring of devotion and array of public \ndisplays of affection? A single West Virginia mother, Mrs. Anna Reese \nJarvis, is at the heart of this story. Mrs. Jarvis was a minister's \ndaughter. She taught Sunday school in the Andrews Methodist Church in \nGrafton, WV, for many years, while raising her children and caring for \nher neighbors in the difficult years following the Civil War.\n  Mrs. Jarvis's daughter, born in 1864 and also named Anna, was a \ndevoted child. She remained close to her family and especially to her \nmother. Miss Jarvis graduated from the Female Seminary in Wheeling, WV, \nand taught in Grafton before moving with her family to Philadelphia, \nPA. When her mother died in Philadelphia in 1905, Miss Jarvis was \ndeeply affected. She felt that children often neglected to appreciate \ntheir mothers enough while their mothers are still alive.\n  With the help of her friends, in 1907 she initiated a letter-writing \ncampaign urging influential ministers, businessmen and congressmen to \ndeclare a national Mother's Day, hoping to increase respect for parents \nand strengthen family bonds. And such was the power of her message that \nher grassroots campaign took off, resulting in the national display of \nfamilial love that we will see this Sunday.\n  At that first Mother's Day observance in Grafton, Miss Jarvis \nsupplied carnations to the church because they were her mother's \nfavorite flower. White carnations were chosen because they represented \nsweetness, purity, and endurance of a mother's love. Over the years, \nred carnations have become the symbol of a living mother. White \ncarnations now signify that, like Miss Jarvis's mother at the time of \nthe first Mother's Day, one's mother has died.\n  Though not many people wear flowers these days, Mother's Day is a \nbonanza for the floral industry, just as it is for restaurants, the \nphone companies, greeting card companies, and jewelers. It is said that \nmore long distance calls are made on Mother's Day than on any other \nsingle day of the year. Though Miss Jarvis might decry some of the more \ncommercial aspects of today's Mother's Day celebrations, I think that \nshe, too, would be pleased that through her efforts, so many people do \nmake the effort to pay their respects and show their affection for \ntheir mothers.\n  We have so much to thank our mothers for, when we consider the \nenormous expenditure of time and effort that it takes to raise a child \nproperly. Aside from the sometimes grueling routine that many mothers \nface every day just to stay abreast of regular family maintenance, \nthere are the hours she cheerfully spends ensuring that homework is \ndone, that chores are performed, that piano lessons or sports practices \nor dance classes are attended, or that cookies are baked and presents \nwrapped. There are also the loving times that a mother spends with her \nchildren: washing hair, reading bedtime stories, saying prayers, \ncomforting away bad dreams, kissing away hurts, encouraging dreams. It \nis a wonder that mothers find the time to do any of the other creative \nthings they do, from sewing to scrap-booking, painting to pottery, \nreading to writing the letters that help to knit families together.\n\n  My own dear mother died when I was just a baby. I cannot recall the \ntouch of her hand on my cheek, or the sound of her voice saying ``I \nlove you.'' But her angel face still smiles at me from an old \nphotograph, and in her smile I can see the love that she still bears \nfor me as she waits. No mother ever truly leaves you. Anna Jarvis knew \nthat to be true when she conceived the notion of a national Mother's \nDay. She would not have us regret failing to show our love and \nappreciation to our mothers while we can.\n  I offer my thanks to all mothers on this Mother's Day. To my own \nmother, I say thank you for giving me life, and for thinking of me and \nmy future even as your own short life was coming to a close. And to the \ngreat love of my life, Erma, the mother of my beautiful daughters, I \nsay thank you. Thank you for mothering me even as you mothered our \nchildren. Your talent at your chosen career, and your devotion to it, \ncontinue to show themselves in the generations of our lovely and loving \ngrandchildren and great grandchildren. If Miss Jarvis had not beaten me \nto it, my wife Erma certainly has provided ample inspiration for a \nnational Mother's Day.\n  I close with the words of one of my favorite poems, one that I come \nback to each Mother's Day. It is called ``Rock Me To Sleep,'' and it \nwas written by Elizabeth Akers Allen (1823-1911).\n\n                            Rock Me To Sleep\n\n     Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight,\n     Make me a child again just for to-night!\n     Mother, come back from the echoless shore,\n     Take me again to your heart as of yore;\n     Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,\n     Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;\n     Over my slumbers your loving watch keep:\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Backward, flow backward, oh, tide of the years!\n     I am so weary of toil and of tears--\n     Toil without recompense, tears all in vain--\n     Take them, and give me my childhood again!\n     I have grown weary of dust and decay--\n     Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away;\n     Weary of sowing for others to reap;\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,\n     Mother, O Mother, my heart calls for you!\n     Many a summer the grass has grown green,\n     Blossomed and faded, our faces between:\n     Yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain,\n     Long I to-night for your presence again.\n     Come from the silence so long and so deep:\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Over my heart, in the days that are flown,\n     No love like mother-love ever has shone;\n     No other worship abides and endures--\n     Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:\n     None like a mother can charm away pain\n     From the sick soul and the world-weary brain.\n     Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep;\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,\n     Fall on your shoulders again as of old;\n     Let it drop over my forehead to-night,\n     Shading my faint eyes away from the light;\n     For with its sunny-edged shadows once more\n     Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;\n     Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Mother, dear Mother, the years have been long\n     Since I last listened your lullaby song:\n     Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem\n     Womanhood's years have been only a dream.\n     Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,\n     With your light lashes just sweeping my face,\n     Never hereafter to wake or to weep;\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5041-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n             tribute to staff sergeant george s. rentschler\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

It would be unrealistic to expect that we \ncan fight a war and not lose lives. SSG Rentschler knew this. And \nknowing this he went forth into battle for the love of his country.\n  To serve your country when you know that it might be the cause of \nyour death, involves sacrifice. It means that you are brave, honorable, \npatriotic, virtuous. It also means that you are willing to make the \nfinal sacrifice should the necessity arise. The men and women serving \nour country, as SSG George Rentschler did, are heroes who are \nprotecting America to preserve our freedoms in these times of \ncontinuing terrorist threat across the world.\n  The death of SSG Rentschler reveals to the world that this man was a \ntrue hero who sacrificed for our country. We have lost a man of courage \nand generosity. He was role model for all of us and will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5041-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5041-S5042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ON SECTION 8 RULE CHANGES\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, We have all heard of the war on poverty, \nbut I fear that 40 years after that war began, there is a new war \nafoot, a war on people in poverty. And the latest assault in this war \nthreatens to leave thousands of people homeless. I am speaking about \nthe Bush administration's plan to make substantial changes in the way \nour Government helps our poorest citizens secure housing.\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\n  It is not hyperbole, in my view, to say that this change to the \nSection 8 voucher program could have disastrous effects. Section 8, \nadministered by the department of Housing and Urban Development, helps \nnearly 2 million poor families and disabled citizens pay for housing \nwith vouchers that have traditionally covered the full cost of their \nrent.\n  But under the rule change, the reimbursements will no longer cover \nthe full costs. As a result, housing authorities around the country \nwill have to cut back on the number of vouchers they offer.\n  For fiscal year 2005, the President's request shortchanges all \nhousing vouchers now in use by $1.6 billion and could result in further \ncuts in the years ahead. This request would also remove key provisions \nof the Section 8 program that protect families with the lowest incomes, \nsuch as maintaining rent payments at 30 percent of a resident's income.\n  In my home state of Vermont, there are 6,080 authorized vouchers \navailable this year, but Vermont stands to lose 740 of these by next \nyear with the rule change. That translates to a loss of more than $4 \nmillion in housing assistance in Vermont. And this scenario could \nindeed get worse: it is estimated that my state stands to lose up to 1, \n770 housing vouchers by the year 2009.\n  It is important to remind ourselves that we're not talking about just \nnumbers here. These are families--real families--who will be at risk of \nnot having a place to live.\n  I recently read in the Washington Post that the Bush administration \nis making thee changes in an effort to ``constrain rapid growth in the \nprogram's spending.'' However, the increased demand for Section 8 \nhousing arises because more people need help in our ailing economy.\n  Every day in our country, working families are forced to turn to \nemergency shelters and food banks because they cannot afford the high \ncost of rent, child care and transportation. I believe this change in \nsection 8 will add greatly to those numbers, while undermining our \ndeeply held premise that work leads to self-sufficiency.\n  Every day we hear the term ``working poor,'' but I'm afraid we do not \ntake the time to fully understand its meaning.\n  All of this prompts me to ask, once again, where are our nation's \npriorities? We continue to give out tax breaks to millionaires despite \nan ever-mounting deficit. We pour billions of dollars into fighting a \nwar in Iraq for which there is no end in sight. And we will be spending \nbillions more--there is another $25 billion request before us now--to \nrebuild that country while our own nation's poorest citizens cannot \nafford housing.\n  If I may borrow a line from Rita Markley, the executive director of \nthe largest homeless services program in my state, ``We've got to \nremind people that Homeland Security starts with a home.''\n  It is unfortunate that President Bush continues to find fault with a \nprogram that has demonstrated such success. As the Congress deliberates \nthe fiscal year 2005 budget, I will continue to work to protect the \nSection 8 program.\n  Forty years ago, when President Johnson declared war on poverty, he \nhighlighted this nation's commitment ``to pursue victory over the most \nancient of mankind's enemies.''\n  I fear that we have lost sight of the enemy, at the expense of those \nwho needed this victory the most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5042-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5042-S5043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING PUBLIC SERVICE AWARD WINNERS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, for the past 5 days, I have paid tribute to \nthe Nation's public servants during Public Service Recognition Week \nthrough statements on the floor of the U.S. Senate. As this is the 20th \nannual celebration of public service, it was fitting to focus the \nSenate's attention on public servants and issues affecting Federal \nemployees throughout the week.\n  Today I would like to recognize those Federal, State, and local \ngovernment programs that received the Public Service Excellence Awards. \nThe Public Service Excellence Awards recognize and commend U.S. \nprograms and employee teams who represent public service at its best. \nIt rewards innovations, raises awareness of exemplary public service, \nand provides public agencies a showcase for outstanding programs. On \nMay 3, 2004, the Public Employees Roundtable, a nonprofit coalition of \norganizations representing public employees and retirees, held a \nBreakfast of Champions to honor the award winners for this year.\n  This year, the Federal winner was the ``Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) eLearning Program.'' As my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee know, training our Federal workforce is one of the most \nimportant and most underfunded programs in the Federal Government. Even \nwhen training programs are funded, agencies must use innovative \ntechniques to stretch training dollars and apply training funds \nstrategically. The IRS realized that approximately 70 percent of its \ntraining budget went toward travel to and from the seminars. As such, \neLearning could save the IRS a significant amount of money by \nconverting its training system from a classroom-based to a technology-\nenhanced learning and performance support environment. In the initial \nphase of the program, the IRS saved more than $5 million in travel \ncosts by using the technology for briefings required of all 120,000 \nemployees and courses supporting the 28,000 employees of Customer Call \nCenter Operations. At full implementation, the eLearning strategy is \nexpected to save more than $50 million in annual travel costs and \nreduce training time by up to one-third. This innovative program at IRS \nis an excellent example of the dedicated work and professional \nexcellence of federal employees.\n  The State winner is the ``Work that Matters'' campaign by the Montana \nEducation Association and the Montana Federation of Teachers (MEA-MFT). \nThe ``Work that Matters'' public relations campaign was created in 2003 \nto prevent the Montana Legislature from freezing salaries of State \nemployees. ``Work That Matters'' is about putting a face on the people \nwho provide state services and showing them as dedicated, hardworking \npeople, who care about the people they serve.\n  As my colleagues know, all too often government employees are forced \nto ``tighten their belts'' during times of financial difficulties. That \ntrend is no different for State governments across the United States. \nIn Montana, the beginning of the 2003 legislative session had State \nemployees struggling with hiring freezes, layoffs, staff shortages, and \nsalaries far below market value. This public relations program put a \nface to the government employees who carry out the programs and \nservices that benefit taxpayers, the State legislature realized the \nimportance of public service and passed a pay increase.\n  This year's local winner was the City of Chicago's ``311 Service,'' \nwhich provides a one-stop telephone and online customer service center \nfor all non-emergency city services. It is a comprehensive, high-tech, \ncustomer-focused information and response service. Chicago residents \ncan use the system to make service needs known, check on the status of \nearlier requests, file police reports, and get information on city \nprograms and events. In addition, the 311 service is synchronized with \nChicago's 911 emergency service. Such interoperability is commendable \nbecause all too often the non-emergency services are overlooked when \ndeveloping an emergency response system. ``Chicago 311'' is an \ninnovative and effective way for public employees to serve the \ncommunity.\n  The Public Service Roundtable also recognized a non-profit \norganization, which was founded by a retired federal employee. Scott \nDimock and his partner, Sammie Morrison, created Southeast White House \ncommunity center in Washington, DC which has made an incredible impact \non an area troubled by high unemployment, lack of opportunity, and \nbroken promises. Through the use of donated services, time, and money, \nSoutheast White House has developed a mentoring program, a Friends of \nChildren program, a People's House referral service for services \nthroughout the Metropolitan area, and an activities program that \nincludes summer camps, field trips, lessons and programs in a variety \nof subjects, Mom's Night Out, and weekly community banquets open to \nall.\n  In addition, Southeast White House has adopted an elementary school \nand has developed an intensive mentoring program for at-risk children. \nMore than 100 elementary school children\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\nnow receive up to eight hours of mentoring each week. While not \ntechnically part of a federal, state, or local government organization, \nit is easy to see the dedication public servants, both active and \nretired, bring to their nation and their neighbor.\n  I would also like to commend GEICO, the Government Employees \nInsurance Company, for creating the GEICO Public Service Awards which, \nsince 1980, recognizes the work Federal employees do to make their \ncommunities better. The awards recognizes government employees for \noutstanding achievements in one of four areas: substance abuse \nprevention and treatment, fire prevention and safety, physical \nrehabilitation, and traffic safety and accident prevention. In \naddition, one retired Federal employee is honored for his or her work \nin one of those areas. Recipients of the 2003 awards are:\n  Charles Whitlock, fire safety project leader for the U.S. Forest \nService Technology & Development Center in Missoula, MT, for his work \nin fire safety and prevention.\n  Amanda Tye, county executive director of the Cleveland County Office \nfor the Farm Service Agency, for her work in traffic safety and \naccident prevention.\n  Carolyn D. Greene, program support assistant for the Louis Stokes \nV.A. Medical Center in Cleveland, OH, for her work in substance abuse \nprevention and treatment.\n  Ralph P. Fowler, a telecommunications specialist for the United \nStates Army in El Paso, TX, for his work in physical rehabilitation.\n  George S. Klein, a retired general forecaster with the National \nWeather Service Forecast Office in Upton, NY, for his work in physical \nrehabilitation.\n  As Public Service Recognition Week draws to an end, I would like to \nonce again commend those who have been honored for their dedication to \npublic service, as well as those unsung heroes whose daily \ncontributions we could not live without. I also want to thank the \ncompanies, associations, and other employee organizations who work to \nmake Public Service Recognition Week such a success and for their \ncommitment in honoring our Nation's Federal, State, and local \ngovernment employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5043-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REQUEST FOR SEQUENTIAL REFERRAL--S. 2386\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I wish to honor Hugh Robinson of \nsoutheast Missouri, who is retiring today after a long career in farm \nbroadcasting. I am honored to share his successes with my colleagues.\n  Hugh followed a path from Washington, DC to Missouri. Growing up in \nWashington and graduating from Anacostia High School, Hugh has been \ninterested and involved in agriculture most of his life. He knew about \nU.S. Department of Agriculture through his father, who had been an \nagricultural attache for the Foreign Agricultural Service in Sweden and \nGermany. With that experience he had the opportunity to observe farm \nand livestock operations in other countries firsthand.\n  Since 1998, he has been at KBXB, where he has been the only live, \nlocal, farm director in southeast Missouri doing 10 reports a day, 4 \nnews and 6 market reports.\n  He is a voting member of the National Association of Farm \nBroadcasters, and has been involved in the organization since 1978. \nHugh has received numerous awards including: The Missouri Farm Bureau's \nOutstanding Service to Agriculture, the Missouri House of \nRepresentatives' Meritorious Service Award and awards from the Missouri \nCorn Growers Association, Missouri Soybean Association, as well as FFA \nand 4H.\n  More than that, he is widely admired by his colleagues in farm \nbroadcasting and among Missouri's agriculture leaders.\n  I have known Hugh for many years now and I have always appreciated \nhis diligence and great sense of humor. His interviews were tough but \nfair and you could always count on him to get the story right and to \ntell it humbly. I know our State's agriculture community will miss his \nagriculture reports. We will all miss hearing his voice on air.\n  Hugh never said goodbye at the end of an interview. He always said, \n``Keep smiling.'' We are smiling with him today as he celebrates his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5043-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The following enrolled bill, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, was signed on today May 7, 2004, by the President pro tempore \n(Mr. Stevens):\n\n       S. 2315.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe expensing of environmental remediation costs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with my \ncolleague from Indiana, Senator Bayh, important legislation to \nencourage the cleanup of contaminated sites commonly known as \n``brownfields.'' I urge all my colleagues to join Senator Bayh and me \nas supporters of this legislation and ask that they actively work with \nus toward its enactment.\n  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines \nbrownfields as ``abandoned, idled, or under-used industrial commercial \nsites where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or \nperceived environmental contamination that can add cost, time, or \nuncertainness to redevelopment projects.''\n  Brownfields are not unique to my State of Pennsylvania, nor are they \nto Senator Bayh's State of Indiana. In every State in the Nation, there \nare areas blighted by run-down, abandoned properties and unsightly \nvacant lots. They are the shut down manufacturing facilities, deserted \nwarehouses and gas stations that are all too familiar to us. On these \nproperties once stood vibrant and productive enterprises, but changing \ntimes and events have drained their vitality. They are now in desperate \nneed of revitalization and redevelopment. Compounding the problem is \nthat over the years, the activities on these sites have left the soil \nand water tables contaminated with environmental pollutants.\n  The negative social and economic effects that these sites have on \ntheir surrounding communities are significant. There are serious \nfinancial impacts not only to the market values of the brownfield \nproperties themselves, but also to property values in the surrounding \nneighborhoods. As middle class citizens are working to gain assets and \npotentially be able to borrow against, or even sell their homes in the \nfuture, property values become a very serious issue. A reduction of \nproperty values in brownfield neighborhoods hits hardest the families \nwho can least afford it.\n  Brownfields have other serious repercussions, extending far beyond \nthe pocketbook. The unsightliness of brownfields can lead to the \ncharacterization of entire neighborhoods as rundown and undesirable. \nThe once vibrant spirit of these centrally located and thriving urban \nareas can be dampened as these eyesores drag down residents' morale and \nsense of connection with their community.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Government Accounting Office \nestimate that there are over 400,000 brownfield sites across the \ncountry. According to a recent U.S. Conference of Mayors survey of 187 \ncities throughout the nation, redevelopment of their existing \nbrownfields would bring additional tax revenues of approximately $2 \nbillion annually and could create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  Many brownfields are located in prime business locations near \ncritical infrastructure, including transportation, and close to an \nalready productive workforce. Putting these sites back into use will \ngenerate good-paying jobs and affordable housing in areas where they \nare most needed. Rehabilitating and reusing these sites also serves to \nhelp prevent urban sprawl. We should encourage the cleanup and use of \nthese brownfield sites rather than abandon them and instead always look \nto develop at new locations. A powerful example from my state of a \nsuccessful brownfield revitalization effort and how it can have \nsubstantial and positive effects on a community is the City of Chester.\n\n  In the midst of a major revitalization, Chester is redeveloping its \nblighted and vacant waterfront district, including the former PECO \npower station. The City is striving to turn a former industrial site \ninto a business center. Chester will be able to create new office \nspace, and by working with a private developer Chester has received an \ninitial commitment to move 2,000 jobs into the area. This initiative \nwill help bring more business and infrastructure back to the community, \nadding to the area's prosperity and making Chester a safe and more \npleasant place to live.\n  Unfortunately, a big reason that so many brownfield properties are \nlanguishing in a state of decay and disrepair is the substantial \ncleanup costs associated with them and the unfavorable tax treatment of \nthose costs.\n  As part of the Community Renewal and Revitalization Act of 2000, \nCongress enacted Section 198 of the Internal Revenue Code, which \nallowed cleanup costs to be expensed in the year they were incurred. \nPrior to that, these costs had to be capitalized to the land, \npostponing any recovery of these costs for tax purposes until the \nproperty was sold.\n  This expedited write-off of cleanup expenses helps a redeveloper \nmanage the cost of rehabilitating existing properties--which typically \nis much more expensive than developing new sites. Brownfield cleanup \ncosts can be an imposing obstacle to redeveloping. While the price tag \nvaries with each site, it is not unreasonable for the cleanup of a \nmajor site to run between $500,000 and $1 million.\n  We in the Senate, and our colleagues in the House, were wise to enact \nSection 198. It is the right policy. However, Section 198 expired at \nthe end of 2003. Now, the law must be renewed retroactively. I am \npleased that the pending FSC/ETI bill, S. 1637, at the behest of \nChairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, would renew Section 198 for two \nyears. That is a start and the Administration supports it. But more \nneeds to be done in this area.\n  The bill my colleagues and I are introducing today has three \nprovisions. First, it makes Section 198 a permanent provision in the \nCode. Second, it broadens the definition of ``hazardous substances'' in \nSection 198 to include petroleum. Finally, it repeals the provision in \nthe law requiring the recapture of the Section 198 deduction when the \nproperty is sold.\n  The tax policy of allowing the expensing of cleanup costs should be a \npermanent fixture in the Tax Code. Brownfields are a long-term problem \nand this solution will allow us to continue addressing this important \ntask.\n  Furthermore, a shortcoming of the law passed in 2000 was the absent \nof petroleum as a contaminant that allowed a site to qualify as a \nbrownfield under section 198. A large percentage of brownfields across \nthe country are contaminated with petroleum. Extending the law to cover \npetroleum contamination makes more sense and the law more effective.\n  Finally, the provision in Section 198 that requires a taxpayer who \nuses the cleanup deduction to pay income tax on that amount when he or \nshe sells the property is illogical. This sends a message to developers \nthat if they undertake the worthy endeavor of remdiation of brownfield \nsites, they will be subjected to substantial tax penalties for doing \nso. This policy is counterproductive to the efforts we are trying to \nencourage and it should be repealed.\n  The benefits of brownfield cleanup are obvious. Remediation of these \nsites revitalizes our neighborhoods and communities, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5044-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Bennett, John Ensign, Olympia J. \n           Snowe, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Don Nickles.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the live quorum under rule XXII be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I mentioned in my remarks last night the \nimportance of finishing this bill. Members on both sides of the aisle \nunderstand the importance of this legislation, the importance of jobs \nin manufacturing in this country, and the importance of addressing this \nEuro tax that each month we don't act goes up by $30 million, $40 \nmillion, $50 million--a tax on products we all use in this country.\n  I hoped we could have finished the bill this week. I set out both \nseveral weeks ago and at the beginning of last week with the objective \nof finishing this bill over this last week. We have spent, I should \nadd, 12 days on this particular bill. The Democratic leader and \nassistant leader have stated they are willing to lock in a short list \nof amendments with short time agreements to complete this bill. I have \nheard them. We discussed this both on and off the Senate floor. \nUnfortunately a number of those amendments are controversial and are \nnot germane to this legislation.\n  We have had a fair process on this bill. We have given Members ample \nopportunity to offer their relevant amendments and have them debated. \nWe voted on a whole range of amendments thus far. Issues like the \novertime amendments, the trade assistance amendment, and others, to my \nmind, would have been better suited on other bills.\n  We do have an amendment pending on unemployment insurance which, \nagain, is not germane to this particular bill; but, having said that, \nthe UI, this unemployment insurance amendment, has been pending and, as \nboth implied last night and in discussions off the Senate floor, it may \nbe possible for us to reach an agreement to vote in relation to that \namendment prior to cloture.\n  I say that because I just filed cloture, which doesn't rule out \ngermane amendments. After cloture is obtained, if we obtain cloture, \nand I hope that we will, we will still have 30 hours to debate the \ngermane amendments. I do hope we will invoke cloture. That cloture vote \nwill occur on Tuesday so we can bring this bill to conclusion.\n  Again, I want to remind my colleague, if we invoke cloture, \namendments are in order. There would still be up to 30 hours remaining \non that bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we discussed at some length our desires to \nhave the few amendments that we have debated and voted on. It would \ntake just a short period of time. There is no need to go into that \nagain. We feel it would be appropriate to do that. This bill could have \nbeen completed yesterday had we spent yesterday on these amendments \nthat we talked about.\n  Of course it goes without saying that I am very confident that \ncloture will not be invoked unless there is an opportunity to vote on \nthe unemployment matter. Even if that is disposed of, there is no \nguarantee cloture will be invoked.\n  I have said on two separate occasions yesterday and I say today, with \nour managers on the bill here, how hard they have worked. Certainly, \nwhat has happened on this bill or has not happened does not reflect in \nany way adversely on the good work they have done. They have done an \nexcellent job.\n  With all due respect to the distinguished majority leader--and I know \nthe burdens of his office are significant--I really believe the Senate \nshould be treated as the Senate, as we have done for all these many \nyears. I think it would be much better if we work that way. We are not \nthe House of Representatives. We do not have to have a rule from a \nrules committee to tell us what is going to happen on the floor.\n  We have had hundreds of amendments on bills we wind up finishing. We \ndon't have hundreds of amendments here, even though we started out on \nour side with 75 and we have been able to dispose of some. We have a \ncouple of amendments that will be relevant and debatable postcloture. \nWe know that. Those are the Hollings amendment and the Landrieu \namendment, and there may be some others we can work in there. But I \njust think to avoid some contentious issues we are causing the Senate a \nlot of undue problems. As I said here last night, this legislation is \ngoing to pass; it is only a question of when. This is ``must do'' \nlegislation. It has to pass before we leave here this year.\n  I, again, recognize the problems the majority leader has. All his \nproblems are not on our side, I say with some degree of understanding. \nHe has problems on his side. This bill is certainly an example of that.\n  So we will do whatever we have to do to meet the demands of our \nslight minority here. As you know, the Senate is almost equally \ndivided. That is one reason everything we do here is made more \ndifficult. It is 51-49 on every issue that comes up. We are all looking \nfor a little advantage.\n  I think unemployment compensation, where we have more than a million \npeople who would receive this money immediately, certainly makes our \ncase strong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much commend and thank my \ncolleagues, the majority leader and assistant minority leader, in \ntrying to work through this bill as we are approaching the endgame. We \nare about there. We are very close to being there.\n  I might recall, a few weeks ago many observers had written off this \nbill and said the bill was deadlocked--for example, over the overtime \nprovision. But to paraphrase Mark Twain, his comment to the New York \nJournal years ago: The report of this bill's death was an exaggeration.\n  Instead, we are now back to doing what the Senate does best; that is, \nworking through amendments, doing our work, doing our business, doing \nwhat we should do. We have considered 28 amendments. We have already \nadopted 17 amendments to this bill. I will not read them all, but they \nare very important amendments. We have been on the bill 13 separate \ndays over the course of 4 separate weeks.\n  It has been the desire of this Senator to have the Senate consider as \nmany relevant amendments as possible. Since we have already adopted 17, \nI think we are virtually there. Regrettably, we are at a point where \nseveral Senators are not agreeing to the setting aside of pending \namendments so other Senators may offer amendments, which is making it a \nlittle difficult to move forward. But nevertheless, I believe that the \nresolution that has been worked out by the majority leader and the \nassistant minority leader and others of us who have been working on \nthis, by having a vote on the pending Cantwell amendment on \nunemployment insurance, is a real key. It is very important to the \nsuccessful conclusion of this bill. It is something we sought all along \non our side, and I think it is also something that would be \npresumptively in the best interests of the majority side as well. Now \nthat a cloture\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\nmotion has been filed, we still expect to proceed to additional \namendments--there are not many--that will be germane: the Hollings \namendment, the Levin amendment, the McCain amendment, also Senator \nLandrieu's amendment, and maybe one or two others. We will continue to \nseek agreement on the amendments and, therefore, we will be doing what \nthe Senate should be doing--simply facing the issues and voting. That \nis when the Senate is at its best.\n\n  Let me also make it clear that this Senator believes it is entirely \nreasonable to bring this debate to a close. We have worked hard on the \nbill. We have done a great deal of work, much more than many expected. \nThis is an important bill. It is important to creating jobs in America. \nIt is important to ending the European tariffs that mount on American \nbusinesses, growing higher.\n  The coming cloture vote will be a true test on this bill, a test of \nwhether we do address the jobs problem, whether we address the European \ntariffs. It is our duty to do so. Thus, when the roll is called, I will \nvote for cloture. I will also urge my colleagues to do so as well. If \nwe do so, we may best hope to conclude action on this bill by next \nTuesday or perhaps on Wednesday.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation.\n  Mr. REID. While the distinguished manager of the bill is on the \nSenate floor, I direct a question to him through the Presiding Officer.\n  Hearing the statement of the Senator from Montana, I wonder, would \nthe Senator vote to bring debate to a close if we do not have a vote on \nthe unemployment compensation matter, the Cantwell amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my good friend, it puts me in a very awkward \nposition, frankly. I say awkward because it is a hypothetical which I \nhope does not occur. It is very important.\n  Mr. REID. I accept that answer.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is very important that the Cantwell amendment be \nbrought up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of both of my \ncolleagues. Both reflect we want this bill completed. It is an \nimportant bill that will take bipartisan cooperation to finish.\n  I restate that we have spent 12 days on this bill. The purpose of the \ncloture motion is to allow us to continue to debate, to continue to \namend, but to bring closure to a process that has gone on 12 days, that \nhas included 20 individual amendments that have been adopted in the \nSenate, 11 of those amendments by voice vote and 9 disposed of by \nrollcall votes. Of the 20 amendments, 8 were Democrat amendments, 8 \nwere Republican amendments, and 4 were from the Finance Committee, 1 of \nthose being the substitute amendment. The new substitute, in itself, \nhad 64 amendments that had been requested by Members of the Senate.\n  We have voted on amendments that meant a lot to the Democrats, \nincluding Senator Harkin's amendment on the Department of Labor \novertime regulations and Senator Wyden's amendment on the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program. We made huge progress. Now is the time \nto give definition to closure where we will still debate the germane \namendments and have that debate and vote.\n  I want to give adequate time, but I plead to my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to understand we have the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act that I hoped we would do on Monday, an \nimportant bill that affects about 4 to 5 million Americans that we must \nget to, that we will bring to the Senate. We have unanimous consent to \ndeal with it once we get it to the Senate, but I cannot get it to the \nSenate as long as we are debating amendments. All of the amendments \nhave substance to them, but we need to take a bill and concentrate on \nthe amendments that are germane to that bill, and then we move to the \nnext bill.\n\n  I have the Individuals with Disability Education Act; I have \nbioshield. Right now bioterrorism is an existential threat which \naffects all of us. There is an important bill called bioshield that I \nneed to bring to the Senate to address the safety and welfare of this \nNation. We have the Department of Defense authorization that I have to \ngo to in about 8 days. Again, we are trying to do the Nation's \nbusiness. We are fighting a war right now that is affecting this Nation \nand the entire world. It is our responsibility to be able to address \nand give that adequate time in the Senate.\n  Again, this bill we are on, FSC/ETI, is as important as any, but we \nneed to stay on it in a focused way. The managers have done a great job \nto date. We are giving further definition to it by hopefully invoking \ncloture.\n  We have seven ambassadors to bring to the Senate to be confirmed. We \nhave 33 judges. Under the current system, we bring a judge, have a \nrollcall vote on each judge. I am having a difficult time getting \njudges to the Senate floor. Thirty-three judges are waiting to be \nconfirmed by action of this body. I say that because--and I know my \ncolleagues know this--we have a lot to do in a very short period of \ntime. Thus, we have to use our time in the Senate as efficiently as \npossible and consider those amendments which are appropriate and \ngermane to the bill under consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express something I know sounds like \nheresy: One thing we could do is work more days. I came here many years \nago. The distinguished manager of the bill has worked in the House of \nRepresentatives, as I. I still use the House gym. I say to everyone, I \nown the gym. They are never there. They are there Wednesday and \nThursday morning. That is about it. And late Tuesday night. They left \nyesterday afternoon. They were out at 2. When we worked there, we \nworked Mondays, Fridays, all night.\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished majority leader, I know people \nare campaigning. When we were in the majority, we got tremendous \npressure from Members wanting to leave and catch airplanes, but maybe \nwe could try working a little bit longer around here and get judges \nconfirmed and other things that need to be done. I know it is heretical \nasking for longer hours, but that is something we should consider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will move on to other topics, given the \nfact that some people think we work too many hours already. And I \ncomment--because a lot of people are listening now--there are committee \nmeetings going on right now, actually very important hearings and a \nmarkup of the defense bill that will go on until probably 7 o'clock \ntonight by Senators in our Nation's Capital. Although we are not right \nhere, because we are going to try to close down in a few minutes, our \ncolleagues are working, doing very important business in committee \nmarkup at hearings on Capitol Hill. They will go until probably early \nthis evening.\n  I take the opportunity to comment on the economic news from this \nweek. It is dramatic and encouraging. Although we wake up, turn on the \ntelevision, read the paper, and we cannot help, by the time we get to \nthe second page, being depressed about what is going on in the world, \nwe have some great news that affects America, every American, every \nworking American, every family member out there. The news is about \njobs. It is nothing short of amazing what can be said about the \neconomic statistics that have come out over the last 48 hours.\n  With today's report of 288,000 payroll jobs being created in the \nmonth of April, the economy has created over 1.1 million jobs over the \nlast 8 months. The job gains were widespread, and the revised figures \nat the end of each month--you go back and revise the figures for the \nprevious month--now show manufacturing jobs have grown for the last 3 \nmonths. That is the first time we have had a sustained 3-month growth \nin years.\n  Second, the past 2 months have been the strongest 2-month job gain in \nover 4 years. The number of persons unemployed dropped by 188,000 last \nmonth. That is still unacceptable, to have 8.1 million unemployed. But \nthis is the lowest it has been since the winter of 2002. So it is \nprogress. We are moving in the right direction.\n\n  Thirdly, construction spending was reported this week at the highest \nlevel in history--at the highest level in history.\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\n  Fourth, the service sector is growing at its fastest pace, not just \nin 1 year or 2 years or 3 years or 5 years, but the fastest pace in 7 \nyears.\n  Finally, in terms of great news, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated, yesterday, that revenues are running $30 billion to $40 \nbillion higher than anticipated for the year. Of course, that goes \nright to the bottom line in terms of reducing the Federal deficit.\n  All this is good news, but we have so much more to do. So I say, it \nis good news, but we cannot rest until we make sure everybody who is \nlooking for a job can get a job. It really ties into our previous \ndiscussion on the importance of bringing to closure passing this FSC/\nETI JOBS legislation. But it has been a remarkable past 8 months.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not much for giving advice to the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, but here is some advice I would \nlike to give you.\n  In the morning, when you get up, just as I do--I grab the newspaper, \nbut I go immediately to the sports page. That way, there is good news. \nI feel pretty good then. And then I work my way to the front page. I \nwould suggest you do that because there is always good news on the \nsports page.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, is that in the first section or the back \nsection?\n  Mr. REID. I go right to the front page of section C. Usually all of \nit is the sports.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will take that counsel, and consider the previous \ncounsel on working harder and later and more days, but I am not sure I \nwill take that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5047-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STAR PRINT--S. 2376\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Uganda Crisis \n     Response Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and the Republic of Uganda enjoy a \n     strong bilateral relationship and continue to work closely \n     together in fighting the human immunodeficiency virus and \n     acquired immune deficiency syndrome (``HIV/AIDS'') pandemic \n     and combating international terrorism.\n       (2) For more than 17 years, the Government of Uganda has \n     been engaged in a conflict with the Lord's Resistance Army \n     that has inflicted hardship and suffering on the people of \n     northern and eastern Uganda.\n       (3) The members of the Lord's Resistance Army have used \n     brutal tactics during this conflict, including abducting and \n     forcing individuals into sexual servitude, and forcing a \n     large number of children, estimated to be between 16,000 and \n     26,000 children, in Uganda to serve in such Army's military \n     forces.\n       (4) The Secretary of State has designated the Lord's \n     Resistance Army as a terrorist organization and placed the \n     Lord's Resistance Army on the Terrorist Exclusion list \n     pursuant to section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)).\n       (5) According to Human Rights Watch, since the mid-1990s \n     the only known sponsor of the Lord's Resistance Army has been \n     the Government of Sudan, though such Government denies \n     providing assistance to the Lord's Resistance Army.\n       (6) More than 1,000,000 people have been displaced from \n     their homes in Uganda as a result of the conflict.\n       (7) The conflict has resulted in a lack of security for the \n     people of Uganda, and as a result of such lack, each night \n     more than 18,000 children leave their homes and flee to the \n     relative safety of town centers, creating a massive ``night \n     commuter'' phenomenon that leaves already vulnerable children \n     subject to exploitation and abuse.\n       (8) Individuals who have been displaced by the conflict in \n     Uganda often suffer from acute malnutrition and the mortality \n     rate for children in northern Uganda who have been displaced \n     is very high.\n       (9) In the latter part of 2003, humanitarian and human \n     rights organizations operating in northern Uganda reported an \n     increase in violence directed at their efforts and at \n     civilians, including a sharp increase in child abductions.\n       (10) The Government of Uganda's military efforts to resolve \n     this conflict, including the arming and training of local \n     militia forces, have not ensured the security of civilian \n     populations in the region to date.\n       (11) The continued instability and lack of security in \n     Uganda has severely hindered the ability of any organization \n     or governmental entity to deliver regular humanitarian \n     assistance and services to individuals who have been \n     displaced or otherwise negatively affected by the conflict.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Government of the \n     United States should--\n       (1) work vigorously to support ongoing efforts to explore \n     the prospects for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in \n     northern and eastern Uganda;\n       (2) work with the Government of Uganda and the \n     international community to make available sufficient \n     resources to meet the immediate relief and development needs \n     of the towns and cities in Uganda that are supporting large \n     numbers of people who have been displaced by the conflict;\n       (3) urge the Government of Uganda and the international \n     community to assume greater responsibility for the protection \n     of civilians and economic development in regions in Uganda \n     affected by the conflict, and to place a high priority on \n     providing security, economic development, and humanitarian \n     assistance to the people of Uganda;\n       (4) work with the international community, the Government \n     of Uganda, and civil society in northern and eastern Uganda \n     to develop a plan whereby those now displaced may return to \n     their homes or to other locations where they may become \n     economically productive;\n       (5) urge the leaders and members of the Lord's Resistance \n     Army to stop the abduction of children, and urge all armed \n     forces in Uganda to stop the use of child soldiers, and seek \n     the release of all individuals who have been abducted;\n       (6) make available increased resources for assistance to \n     individuals who were abducted during the conflict, child \n     soldiers, and other children affected by the conflict;\n       (7) work with the Government of Uganda, other countries, \n     and international organizations to ensure that sufficient \n     resources and technical support are devoted to the \n     demobilization and reintegration of rebel combatants and \n     abductees forced by their captors to serve in non-combatant \n     support roles;\n       (8) cooperate with the international community to support \n     civil society organizations and leaders in Uganda, including \n     Acholi religious leaders, who are working toward a just and \n     lasting resolution to the conflict;\n       (9) urge the Government of Uganda to improve the \n     professionalism of Ugandan military personnel currently \n     stationed in northern and eastern Uganda, with an emphasis on \n     respect for human rights, accountability for abuses, and \n     effective civilian protection;\n       (10) work with the international community to assist \n     institutions of civil society in Uganda to increase the \n     capacity of such institutions to monitor the human rights \n     situation in northern Uganda and to raise awareness of abuses \n     of human rights that occur in that area;\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\n       (11) urge the Government of Uganda to permit international \n     human rights monitors to establish a presence in northern and \n     eastern Uganda;\n       (12) monitor the creation of civilian militia forces in \n     northern and eastern Uganda and publicize any concerns \n     regarding the recruitment of children into such forces or the \n     potential that the establishment of such forces will invite \n     increased targeting of civilians in the conflict or \n     exacerbate ethnic tension and violence; and\n       (13) make clear that the relationship between the \n     Government of Sudan and the Government of the United States \n     cannot improve unless no credible evidence indicates that \n     authorities of the Government of Sudan are complicit in \n     efforts to provide weapons or other support to the Lord's \n     Resistance Army.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORT.\n\n       (a) Requirements.--Not later than 6 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit \n     a report to the appropriate congressional committees on the \n     conflict in Uganda.\n       (b) Content.--The report required by subsection (a) shall \n     include a description of the following:\n       (1) The individuals or entities that are providing \n     financial and material support for the Lord's Resistance \n     Army, including a description of any such support provided by \n     the Government of Sudan or by senior officials of such \n     Government.\n       (2) The activities of the Lord's Resistance Army that \n     create obstacles that prohibit the provision of humanitarian \n     assistance or the protection of the civilian population in \n     Uganda.\n       (3) The practices employed by the Ugandan People's Defense \n     Forces in northern and eastern Uganda to ensure that children \n     and civilians are protected, that civilian complaints are \n     addressed, and that any member of the armed forces that \n     abuses a civilian is held accountable for such abuse.\n       (4) The actions carried out by the Government of the United \n     States, the Government of Uganda, or the international \n     community to protect civilians, especially women and \n     children, who have been displaced by the conflict in Uganda, \n     including women and children that leave their homes and flee \n     to cities and towns at night in search of security from \n     sexual exploitation and gender-based violence.\n       (c) Form of Report.--The report under subsection (a) shall \n     be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a \n     classified annex.\n       (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and \n     the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5048-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF MAJORITY RULE IN THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Anti-Semitism Review \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Acts of anti-Semitism in countries throughout the \n     world, including some of the world's strongest democracies, \n     have increased significantly in frequency and scope over the \n     last several years.\n       (2) During the first 3 months of 2004, there were numerous \n     instances of anti-Semitic violence around the world, \n     including the following incidents:\n       (A) In Australia on January 5, 2004, poison was used to \n     ignite, and burn anti-Semitic slogans into, the lawns of the \n     Parliament House in the state of Tasmania.\n       (B) In St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 15, 2004, \n     vandals desecrated approximately 50 gravestones in a Jewish \n     cemetery, painting the stones with swastikas and anti-Semitic \n     graffiti.\n       (C) In Toronto, Canada, over the weekend of March 19 \n     through March 21, 2004, vandals attacked a Jewish school, a \n     Jewish cemetery, and area synagogues, painting swastikas and \n     anti-Semitic slogans on the walls of a synagogue and on \n     residential property in a nearby, predominantly Jewish, \n     neighborhood.\n       (D) In Toulon, France, on March 23, 2004, a Jewish \n     synagogue and community center were set on fire.\n       (3) Anti-Semitism in old and new forms is also increasingly \n     emanating from the Arab and Muslim world on a sustained \n     basis, including through books published by government-owned \n     publishing houses in Egypt and other Arab countries.\n       (4) In November 2002, state-run television in Egypt \n     broadcast the anti-Semitic series entitled ``Horseman Without \n     a Horse,'' which is based upon the fictitious [conspiracy \n     theory know as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion] \n     ``Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion''. The Protocols \n     have been used throughout the last century by despots such as \n     Adolf Hitler to justify violence against Jews.\n       (5) In November 2003, Arab television featured an anti-\n     Semitic series, entitled ``Ash-Shatat'' (or ``The \n     Diaspora''), which depicts Jewish people hatching a plot for \n     Jewish control of the world.\n       (6) The sharp rise in anti-Semitic violence has caused \n     international organizations such as the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to elevate, and \n     bring renewed focus to, the issue, including the convening by \n     the OSCE in June 2003 of a conference in Vienna dedicated \n     solely to the issue of anti-Semitism.\n       (7) The OSCE will again convene a conference dedicated to \n     addressing the problem of anti-Semitism on April 28-29, 2004, \n     in Berlin, with the United States delegation to be led by \n     former Mayor of New York City Ed Koch.\n       (8) The United States Government has strongly supported \n     efforts to address anti-Semitism through bilateral \n     relationships and interaction with international \n     organizations such as the OSCE, the European Union, and the \n     United Nations.\n       (9) Congress has consistently supported efforts to address \n     the rise in anti-Semitic violence. During the 107th Congress, \n     both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed \n     resolutions expressing strong concern with the sharp \n     escalation of anti-Semitic violence in Europe and calling on \n     the Department of State to thoroughly document the \n     phenomenon.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n        It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Government should continue to \n     strongly support efforts to combat anti-Semitism worldwide \n     through bilateral relationships and interaction with \n     international organizations such as the OSCE; and\n       (2) the Department of State should thoroughly document acts \n     of anti-Semitism that occur around the world.\n\n     SEC. 4. [REPORT] REPORTS.\n\n       [Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and annually thereafter] (a) One-Time Report.--Not \n     later than November 15, 2004, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     and the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives a report on acts of anti-Semitism around the \n     world, including a description of--\n       (1) acts of physical violence against, or harassment of, \n     Jewish people, and acts of violence against, or vandalism of, \n     Jewish community institutions, such as schools, synagogues, \n     or cemeteries, that occurred in each country;\n       (2) the responses of the governments of those countries to \n     such actions;\n       (3) the actions taken by such governments to enact and \n     enforce laws relating to the protection of the right to \n     religious freedom of Jewish people; and\n       (4) the efforts by such governments to promote anti-bias \n     and tolerance education.\n       (b) Information Required in Annual Department of State \n     Reports.--The Secretary of State shall include the \n     information required under subsection (a) in the annual \n     reports of the Department of State known as the Annual Report \n     on International Religious Freedom and the Annual Human \n     Rights Report.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Acts of anti-Semitism in countries throughout the \n     world, including some of the world's strongest democracies, \n     have increased significantly in frequency and scope over the \n     last several years.\n       (2) During the first 3 months of 2004, there were numerous \n     instances of anti-Semitic violence around the world, \n     including the following incidents:\n       (A) In Australia on January 5, 2004, poison was used to \n     ignite, and burn anti-Semitic slogans into, the lawns of the \n     Parliament House in the state of Tasmania.\n       (B) In St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 15, 2004, \n     vandals desecrated approximately 50 gravestones in a Jewish \n     cemetery, painting the stones with swastikas and anti-Semitic \n     graffiti.\n       (C) In Toronto, Canada, over the weekend of March 19 \n     through March 21, 2004, vandals attacked a Jewish school, a \n     Jewish cemetery, and area synagogues, painting swastikas and \n     anti-Semitic slogans on the walls\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\n     of a synagogue and on residential property in a nearby, \n     predominantly Jewish, neighborhood.\n       (D) In Toulon, France, on March 23, 2004, a Jewish \n     synagogue and community center were set on fire.\n       (3) Anti-Semitism in old and new forms is also increasingly \n     emanating from the Arab and Muslim world on a sustained \n     basis, including through books published by government-owned \n     publishing houses in Egypt and other Arab countries.\n       (4) In November 2002, state-run television in Egypt \n     broadcast the anti-Semitic series entitled ``Horseman Without \n     a Horse,'' which is based upon the fictitious ``Protocols of \n     the Learned Elders of Zion''. The Protocols have been used \n     throughout the last century by despots such as Adolf Hitler \n     to justify violence against Jews.\n       (5) In November 2003, Arab television featured an anti-\n     Semitic series, entitled ``Ash-Shatat'' (or ``The \n     Diaspora''), which depicts Jewish people hatching a plot for \n     Jewish control of the world.\n       (6) The sharp rise in anti-Semitic violence has caused \n     international organizations such as the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to elevate, and \n     bring renewed focus to, the issue, including the convening by \n     the OSCE in June 2003 of a conference in Vienna dedicated \n     solely to the issue of anti-Semitism.\n       (7) The OSCE will again convene a conference dedicated to \n     addressing the problem of anti-Semitism on April 28-29, 2004, \n     in Berlin, with the United States delegation to be led by \n     former Mayor of New York City Ed Koch.\n       (8) The United States Government has strongly supported \n     efforts to address anti-Semitism through bilateral \n     relationships and interaction with international \n     organizations such as the OSCE, the European Union, and the \n     United Nations.\n       (9) Congress has consistently supported efforts to address \n     the rise in anti-Semitic violence. During the 107th Congress, \n     both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed \n     resolutions expressing strong concern with the sharp \n     escalation of anti-Semitic violence in Europe and calling on \n     the Department of State to thoroughly document the \n     phenomenon.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n        It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Government should continue to \n     strongly support efforts to combat anti-Semitism worldwide \n     through bilateral relationships and interaction with \n     international organizations such as the OSCE; and\n       (2) the Department of State should thoroughly document acts \n     of anti-Semitism that occur around the world.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTS.\n\n       (a) One-Time Report.--Not later than November 15, 2004, the \n     Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives a report on acts of \n     anti-Semitism around the world, including a description of--\n       (1) acts of physical violence against, or harassment of, \n     Jewish people, and acts of violence against, or vandalism of, \n     Jewish community institutions, such as schools, synagogues, \n     or cemeteries, that occurred in each country;\n       (2) the responses of the governments of those countries to \n     such actions;\n       (3) the actions taken by such governments to enact and \n     enforce laws relating to the protection of the right to \n     religious freedom of Jewish people; and\n       (4) the efforts by such governments to promote anti-bias \n     and tolerance education.\n       (b) Information Required in Annual Department of State \n     Reports.--The Secretary of State shall include the \n     information required under subsection (a) in the annual \n     reports of the Department of State known as the Annual Report \n     on International Religious Freedom and the Annual Human \n     Rights Report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5050-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 10, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will be in morning \nbusiness. It is possible that the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe FSC/ETI JOBS bill Monday afternoon to consider amendments relevant \nto the bill. Moments ago, I filed a cloture motion to the bill which \nprovided for a vote on Tuesday. I believe the managers will be prepared \nto dispose of the relevant amendments prior to that cloture vote, and \nwe will continue to discuss that option on Monday.\n  Also, on Monday, we expect that the Senate will vote or will act on \nthe Iraqi prisoner resolution. It is important for the Senate to speak \nout in a formal way. Most colleagues have spoken out individually on \nthis issue in a bipartisan, single voice. Therefore, I would like to \nput Senators on notice that we can expect a rollcall vote at \napproximately 5:30 p.m. on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/07/senate-section/article/S5050-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 10, 2004, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
