Mr. President, first of all, I should welcome everybody \nback because this is the formal convening of the second session of the \n108th Congress. As everyone knows, we have a fairly short legislative \nsession this year. I know in our leadership meeting this morning, and I \nam sure in the Democrats' leadership meeting this morning, we both \nbegan to outline the agenda for the year. When you look at the calendar \nand you look at the amount that we will be addressing, it is going to \nbe challenging. We all recognize the challenge that is before us. \nEverybody is returning rested and ready to go, and I am delighted to \nhave everybody back once again.\n  Under the order entered into on December 9, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2673, the \nOmnibus appropriations measure. A cloture vote will occur today on that \nconference report at 3 p.m., and that will be the first rollcall vote \nof this session. The consent agreement allows for equally divided \ndebate until that vote on invoking cloture.\n  As a reminder, the Senate will be in recess from the hours of 12:30 \ntoday to 2:15 for the weekly party conferences to meet.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues that this evening at 9 p.m. the \nPresident will deliver the State of the Union Address and therefore \nSenators should assemble in the Senate Chamber at 8:35 so that the \nSenate may proceed at approximately 8:45 this evening to the Hall of \nthe House of Representatives for that address.\n  I do thank all Members for their attention and I look forward to a \nproductive second session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S1-6", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1-S2]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will be having a cloture vote today at 3 \no'clock and thus I would like to use my leadership time over the next \n10 or 12 minutes, rather than to state the goals and planning for this \nsession, which I will try to do at some point tomorrow, to address the \nissue before us and that is to finish up the unfinished work of the \nfirst session. The question before us, as I mentioned, is the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2004. It is important legislation, \nand I think how we handle that legislation will in large part set the \ntone for the remainder of this Congress. I just want to spend a few \nminutes on that.\n  First, I thank the distinguished chairman, who is occupying the \nChair, and the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nand their staff, for the tremendous work, hard work, dedicated work \nlast year. We asked a great deal of that Appropriations Committee. They \nproduced. They delivered. Today it is my hope we will be able to bring \nan end to that work with the passage of the seven remaining \nappropriations bills.\n  As you look back over the last 12 months, you see the committee \ncompleted action on 27 regular appropriations bills, completed action \non 3 major supplemental bills, completed action on 4 continuing \nresolutions, and now finally the 7 remaining regular appropriations \nbills for 2004.\n  One thing is certain, that people have had sufficient time to review \nwhat is in this Omnibus appropriations bill, to review the legislation. \nIt has been available now for 57 days. It was filed on November 25, \n2003.\n  It is obvious that the legislation is not such that everybody is \npleased; some people want more projects; some people want more \nspending; some people want less spending. There are many provisions in \nthere that I personally would have liked to see turn out differently. \nBut it is a product of months of work last fall and last winter, and it \nis the nature of all legislation, as we in this body know, that \ncompromises are in order--compromises with the House\n\n[[Page S2]]\n\nof Representatives, compromises with the administration.\n  But now, today, at 3 o'clock, is the time to move ahead and complete \naction on this legislation and thereby start that critical funding. I \nam sure as we discuss this over the next several hours it will become \napparent that every single Senator in this body has a stake in passage \nof this legislation.\n  I did write to each of the Senators last week that no Senator should \nbe under any illusion as to what will happen if we were to fail to pass \nthis legislation. It is a clear, it is a stark alternative to a \ncontinuing resolution of the seven outstanding appropriations bills. \nFailure to pass this Omnibus appropriations bill, to approve this \nlegislation, would really shortchange--it would curtail our efforts in \nfighting terrorism. It would weaken our food security system. It would \ncreate hardships for millions of veterans. It would put at risk \nmillions of lives of those who suffer HIV and AIDS overseas. It would \nshortchange the needs of our schools and of our States and needy \nAmericans.\n  I do also want to add, in addition to stating the importance of \npassing this Omnibus bill, that the legislation itself adheres to the \nagreement, the general agreement between Congress and the executive \nbranch in terms of spending limits. I have set aside the emergency \nspending for the Iraq war supplemental. As I mentioned, some would wish \nthere was more spending and some would wish that there was less \nspending. Whatever the arguments that people put forth, what it is \nimportant for people to understand, I believe, is that the spending \nunder these appropriations bills is consistent with the budget \nblueprint that we adopted last April for this fiscal year.\n  It is a fact that, excluding the expenditures of the major \nsupplementals for the operations in Iraq--one last April and most \nrecently in October--appropriations funding authority between 2003 and \n2004 is held to slightly less than a 3-percent increase.\n  Second, while remaining within this agreed-to spending restraint, the \nlegislation funds important bipartisan priorities. A number of examples \nwill be talked about on the floor, but let me cite just a few.\n  Education funding for title I programs would be funded at $12.4 \nbillion, and special education--or IDEA--would be funded at $10.1 \nbillion. These two programs combined would increase funding by $2 \nbillion for education over last year. Both increases are necessary to \ntruly see that we leave no child behind. If we had to resort to a full \nyear of a continuing resolution, these education programs would lose $2 \nbillion.\n  In education, we have a wonderful program--the Pell Grant Program--\nfor needy college students. Under this bill, they would receive $12.1 \nbillion. If we had to take that stark alternative of a continuing \nresolution, funding would be reduced for these Pell grant recipients by \n$700 million. That is clearly unacceptable.\n  Head Start spending in this bill would increase to $6.8 billion--a \n$150 million increase that would be forgone if we resorted to that \nstark alternative of a continuing resolution.\n  In the field of health, if you look at the area of research, NIH \nwould receive $28 billion--an increase in this bill, once it is passed, \nof over $1 billion. Under a full year of a continuing resolution, this \nincrease would be zero. Veterans' medical care spending would receive \n$28.6 billion--an increase of over $3 billion over last year--if, and \nonly if, we pass this bill.\n  The list continues in terms of highway funding, the Millennium \nChallenge Account, and election reform. Global HIV/AIDS funding--with a \nstrong bipartisan policy in this body--would reach $2.4 billion. But \nfailure to pass this legislation would clearly jeopardize that 5-year \ncommitment of $15 billion in funding to which Congress and the \nPresident have agreed.\n  The Small Business Administration, through the Guaranteed Loan \nProgram, would receive $9.5 billion. These are critical loans to small \nbusinesses that create jobs out of this increasingly strong economy.\n  FBI funding would increase by $423 million once we pass this bill. If \nwe don't pass the bill, the new FBI agents, who we know are needed, \nwould not be funded; AmeriCorps, USDA's Animal Plant and Health \nInspection Service--the list goes on.\n  I address only a few of the critical funding items. People will talk \nabout the others.\n  There are other provisions in the bill such as providing a 4.1-\npercent Federal pay increase that is important to all of our Federal \nworkers listening to me now.\n  There is over $200 million in assistance to Southern California for \nlast winter's disastrous forest fires that will not occur without this \nbill.\n  I am sure the chairman of the committee can list many other important \nfunding items in this legislation needed for the basic functioning of \ngovernment.\n  But the time has come to pass this legislation and to move forward \ninto next year's budget--the fiscal year 2005 budget, which I remind \nall of my colleagues will arrive in less than 2 weeks. It is time for \nus to move ahead in 2004 rather than remain stuck in 2003.\n  I ask my colleagues to weigh their votes on this legislation very \ncarefully this afternoon.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd for their tremendous \nwork this past year, and particularly their staff for their dedication \nand long hours expended.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S2-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Senate Democrats have set as our goal the \npassage of legislation that we call an ``Opportunity Society'' for all \nAmericans--not just the privileged few. It includes proposals for more \njobs--especially in manufacturing where we have lost nearly 2.5 million \njobs just in the past 3 years--8,000 in my State of South Dakota. \nNothing could create those jobs faster than early passage of a highway \nbill. We have already lost 90,000 jobs by the failure to take up the \nbill last year when the last bill expired. We can create over 800,000 \njobs this year if we act expeditiously.\n  Not only do we believe in the need to create jobs but we want those \njobs to pay a decent wage. Nothing can be more critical in that regard \nthan to increase the minimum wage for the first time in 7 years.\n  Democrats also believe this Senate should address the cost and \navailability of health care which is fast becoming the preeminent issue \nin our country. I have vivid recollections of my hundreds of \nconversations with South Dakotans throughout my State last year, \nconversations which revealed the anxiety and the physical and financial \npain now experienced by so many with and without health insurance. We \nbelieve one of the very first steps in reaching this goal should be the \npassage of legislation which authorizes the Government to negotiate \nlower prices for all seniors on prescription drugs as we already do for \nveterans and military retirees.\n  We will also advocate that this country devote far more attention to \neducation, from preschool to higher education, with more resources and \ngreater priority to fully funding childcare, title I, special \neducation, and the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  We are determined to see that the Senate addresses retirement \nsecurity for all Americans by protecting our seniors' pensions and \nproviding them with the confidence that their retirement income will \nnot be squandered or lost because of corporate mismanagement. It is \nimperative that Social Security be protected, and we will continue to \nfight this year to see that it is.\n  We also seek to provide opportunities here at home, and we ask that \nwe not\n\n[[Page S3]]\n\nforget we are a nation at war and are asking a great deal of the men \nand women in our Armed Forces as well as their families. Democrats want \nto ensure that all of our Nation's reservists have access to quality \nhealth care. Democrats will try to make certain that no veteran has to \nchoose between his disability pay and his retirement pay. We will seek \nto provide additional resources to end the lengthy waits at VA \nhospitals that are a fact of life for too many of our veterans today.\n  It is also our hope that this session will allow us the opportunity \nearly on to address a good energy bill. I have said on several \noccasions, should the MTBE liability immunity provisions be stricken \nfrom the provisions in the energy bill, there would be sufficient votes \nto pass it on the Senate floor. The decision is up to the majority.\n  It is also our goal this year to pass the Mental Health Parity Act, \nwelfare reform reauthorization, and the legislation to outlaw hate \ncrimes.\n  As I said, we hope we can do this and much more on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  It is with sadness that I note the way the last session ended. The \nmajority didn't seek consensus or cooperation of the Democratic caucus \non either the Medicare bill or the energy legislation. It was a process \ndesigned to find agreement among those who already agreed not to bridge \nthe differences or broaden support. It was marked by procedural abuses.\n  Many Americans are still dismayed that the House kept the Medicare \nvote open for 3 hours while one Member actually admitted he was offered \na bribe from another Member on the House floor to support the bill. \nThat isn't how the American people expect us to do their work. We can \ndo better. This year we must.\n\n  While I am on matters that cause Democrats very grave concern, I am \ncompelled to note the onerous recess appointment of Judge Charles \nPickering. The President could not have started off this session of \nCongress in a worse way. The Senate has repeatedly rejected this \nnomination. The timing, during the Martin Luther King, Jr., weekend, \nalso could not have been worse. It was a deplorable decision and one \nthat is deeply regrettable on several levels.\n  As we begin this session, our first order of business will be the \nconsideration of the Omnibus appropriations bill. The Omnibus \nappropriations bill was once a good bill. In the Senate we were able to \nwork out compromises. We accomplished many things and the process \nworked. But the administration intervened at the eleventh hour and \ndemanded changes, laid down an ultimatum, and even forced the \nconference to take positions in direct conflict with earlier positions \ntaken on rollcall votes in both the House and the Senate.\n  Its insistence on provisions affecting the mad cow decision, overtime \nregulations, and media concentration made the bill unsupportable to \nmany Senators. We should take the time to fix the bill's problems \nbecause they affect millions of American families. We owe it to them to \ntake the time to do it right.\n  I take a moment for some additional comments on matters unrelated to \nour legislative agenda. First, I know I speak for all Senators in \nexpressing praise for our troops in Iraq for their inspiring \ndemonstration of bravery and patriotism. Nearly 500 soldiers have died \nand 3,000 have been wounded since the war began. Our country owes them \nour debt of gratitude. I am particularly mindful of the sacrifices made \nby thousands of South Dakotans, including 800 who departed for Iraq \nduring the recent holiday season.\n  Recently, I attended a funeral for Chris Soelzer, a young man from \nSturgis who lost his life in Iraq on Christmas Eve. He was a remarkable \nrole model, a leader, and soldier. The agony felt by his family, \nfriends, and his community is another poignant reminder of the horrific \nsacrifice that war demands.\n  We honor those who are there and express our heartfelt gratitude for \nthe job they continue to do under the most difficult of circumstances. \nWhile we praise them for finding Saddam Hussein and for continuing the \neffort to ensure democracy for the 23 million people of Iraq, we remain \nconcerned that our troops face violent attacks daily and our troops and \nour taxpayers are bearing a disproportionate share of the burden.\n  Second, I note the decision made by our colleague, Senator John \nBreaux, to retire at the end of this session. I have had the good \nfortune to work with Senator Breaux now for 25 years, 17 in the Senate. \nI am proud to call him a close friend.\n  He will leave the Senate with many accomplishments, many admirers, \nand many good friends. He has earned our respect and affection by his \nmanner, his work, and his never-ending desire to seek consensus and \nbipartisan achievement. For that reason, he will also leave a hole in \nthis institution, one that will be very hard to fill. We thank John \nBreaux for his service to his country, his remarkable leadership, and \nhis friendship. I wish Lois and John well in the months and years \nahead.\n  In the spirit of John Breaux, let me close by reiterating our desire \nto work in a constructive, bipartisan way for legislation that will \ntruly create an ``opportunity society'' for all Americans. I look \nforward to the coming months and the challenges that we will confront \nas they unfold.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S3-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n      RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I apologize for my voice. I hope I can \nkeep it long enough to make this statement.\n  Republicans and Democrats worked together to adopt this omnibus \nconference report that is before the Senate today. It contains seven \nappropriations bills. It was my hope that the Senate would pass this \nbill last December, and it was a great disappointment to me that we did \nnot pass it then.\n\n[[Page S4]]\n\n  Now, however, we still have the opportunity to send this report to \nthe President, and I do urge all Senators to vote for cloture now.\n  The Senate should pass 13 separate appropriations bills each session. \nSenator Byrd also favors that approach. An omnibus bill is an option of \nlast resort. Unfortunately, once again this fiscal year, this was our \nonly way to do our duty to provide funding for essential services of \nour national Government.\n  Throughout his life, Ben Franklin reminded his colleagues that \ncompromise was an essential part of government. He said:\n\n       Both sides must part with some of their demands.\n\n  That spirit is important when we must join the work product of \nseveral Appropriations subcommittees in an omnibus bill like the one \nbefore us now.\n  Are there provisions in this bill to which either the majority or the \nminority object? Yes. Does the White House endorse each of the \nprovisions in this bill? Absolutely not. Are there parts of this bill I \nwould rather not support at this time? Yes.\n  But the conference has concluded. The conference no longer exists, \nand a majority of the members on the conference agreed to this \ncompromise that is before the Senate now.\n  The report before the Senate funds critical programs and services. \nCountless Americans have already been affected adversely because it has \nbeen delayed so far.\n  Already the Department of Housing and Urban Development has had to \nsuspend all activities related to the FHA General Insurance and Special \nRisk Insurance Funds. Since January 14, HUD has been unable to fund \nprograms related to the construction and rehabilitation of multifamily \napartment projects, health care facilities, Hawaiian homelands \nmortgages under section 247, and home equity conversion loans that \nbenefit elderly homeowners.\n  Our failure to pass this bill prevented key Government programs and \nagencies from fully responding to our Nation's crises and challenges. \nThe recent bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE--mad cow--diagnosis \nwill require a significant increase in animal health surveillance and \nfood safety inspections. This bill contains $29.5 million over the \nfiscal year 2003 budget for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService and an additional $36.6 million for the safety inspection \nservice.\n  That funding will go a long way in helping these agencies respond to \nthis recent crisis.\n  The impact of this delay has been felt throughout the country in a \nwide range of programs and services. This report includes a $38 million \nfunding increase for the Health and Human Service Department's domestic \nAIDS drug assistance program and $2.4 billion to combat AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria around the world. That money is needed right \nnow to purchase medications for people suffering with AIDS, but \ninstead, because this report is stalled here on the Senate floor, many \nhuman beings continue to go without our humanitarian aid.\n  Our veterans have also suffered from the delay because new funding, \nnot previously available, has been withheld. Because we are operating \nunder a continuing resolution the VA was forced to curtail the hiring \nof new physicians and nurses. It has been unable to open 48 high \npriority community-based outpatient clinics. As pharmacy costs \ncontinued to rise, the VA was forced to strip funds from other priority \nareas because it could not meet the increasing demand for prescription \ndrugs without new funds.\n  Several important new education programs do not have the funds \nneeded. This bill includes $1.26 billion in new funding for State \nprograms to help children with learning disabilities and physical and \nmental challenges, $57 million in new funds for reading programs, $50 \nmillion for our Nation's colleges, and $148 million in additional funds \nto expand and improve Head Start programs. Those funds did not reach \nour Nation's children because this conference report was delayed.\n  There are many more programs that remain underfunded while operating \nunder the continuing resolution. The continuing resolution provides \nfunds we believed in fiscal year 2002 were sufficient for fiscal year \n2003, but that does not mean they are sufficient for this year--fiscal \nyear 2004. Many Americans will continue to be denied benefits needed in \n2004 if we do not support this omnibus bill. I ask the Senate to come \ntogether to demonstrate we will respond to these needs now by voting \nfor cloture and in favor of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask to be notified when 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nare up. I am entitled to 5 minutes.\n  This bill shows the widening gulf between this administration's words \nand its deeds.\n  No doubt tonight, the President will talk about healthy families. But \nthis bill weakens our clean air laws. And it postpones steps we need \nright now to protect our food supply from mad cow disease.\n  The President will talk about education. But this bill fails the test \nwhen it comes to funding for schools. And it diverts scarce public \neducation dollars to private schools.\n  The President will talk about the safety of our communities. But this \nbill weakens our gun laws.\n  The President will talk about fairness. But there is nothing fair \nabout giving away good jobs of dedicated government workers to the \ncheapest bidder that may even send those jobs abroad.\n  So it is a Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde Presidency, where what you see is not \nwhat you get.\n  But the greatest outrage in this bill is that it denies the right to \novertime pay to 8 million hard-working Americans.\n  We may be fighting a war in Iraq, but this President and this \nadministration are also waging a war on workers here at home.\n  Majorities in both the Senate and the House agreed that the Bush \nadministration was wrong to deny overtime protections to workers. By a \nvote in the U.S. Senate of 54 to 45 and the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives of 221 to 203, we said to the President, ``You are \nwrong.''\n  But here it is, in this bill.\n  I know who I am fighting for.\n  I am fighting for the nurse who burns the midnight oil day in and day \nout caring for our sick and elderly with no extra pay.\n  I am fighting for the firefighter and first responder, the heroes of \nhomeland security, standing watch and working nights and weekends to \nprotect our liberty. They are our generations Paul Reveres--prepared to \nact when called to arms. They deserve fair compensation.\n  I am fighting for our veterans and our men and women serving so \nbravely now in Iraq and across the world, who return to civilian life \nonly to find that the training they earned in the military is cruelly \nused to deny them their right to overtime pay.\n  Under current regulations, workers can be denied overtime protection \nif they fall within the category of what they call professional \nemployees, workers with a 4-year degree in a professional field. It is \nchanged this year under the Bush administration. The plan would do away \nwith the standard and allow equivalent training in the Armed Forces. \nYou go and serve in Iraq and get the training to serve in Iraq, and \ncome back here and you are ineligible, under these regulations, for \novertime pay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the relevant statute be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Subpart D, Professional Employees, Sec. Sec. 541.300-.304\n\n       The current regulations pertaining to the professional \n     exemption contain four separate categories of exempt \n     employees: learned professionals, artistic professionals, \n     teachers, and computer professionals. As with the executive \n     and administrative exemptions, the regulations contain both \n     ``short'' and ``long'' duties tests, depending upon the \n     salary level of the employee. The long test contains a \n     separate primary duty requirement for each of the four \n     categories of employees. The long test for learned \n     professionals requires that the primary duty consist of work \n     requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science \n     or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of \n     specialized intellectual instruction and study, as \n     distinguished from a general academic education and from an \n     apprenticeship, and from training in the performance of \n     routine mental, manual, or physical processes. For creative \n     professionals, the primary duty must consist of\n\n[[Page S5]]\n\n     work that is original and creative in character in a \n     recognized field of artistic endeavor (as opposed to work \n     which can be produced by a person endowed with general manual \n     or intellectual ability and training), and the result of \n     which depends primarily on the invention, imagination, or \n     talent of the employee. For teachers, the primary duty must \n     consist of teaching, tutoring, instructing, or lecturing in \n     the activity of imparting knowledge by an employee who is \n     employed and engaged in this activity as a teacher in the \n     school system or educational establishment or institution by \n     which the person is employed. The duties tests for computer \n     employees are discussed in subpart E. The long test also \n     requires that an exempt employee: Perform work requiring the \n     consistent exercise of discretion and judgment; do work that \n     is predominantly intellectual and varied in character, such \n     that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be \n     standardized in relation to a given period of time; and \n     devote no more than 20 percent of work hours in a week to \n     activities that are not an essential part of and necessarily \n     incident to exempt work. The short test in the current \n     regulations for both learned professionals and teachers \n     contains the specific primary duty requirement discussed \n     above, and requires that the employee perform work requiring \n     the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment. For \n     artistic professionals, the work must require invention, \n     imagination or talent in a recognized field of artistic \n     endeavor.\n       The proposed regulations pertaining to the professional \n     employee exemption would make changes similar to those we \n     propose for the executive and administrative exemptions. The \n     goal is to clarify and simplify the regulations defining the \n     professional employee exemption, while remaining consistent \n     with the purposes of the FLSA. For ease of reference, and \n     making no substantive changes, we propose to move the \n     provisions pertaining to computer professionals to new \n     subpart E, which will contain all information pertinent to \n     such employees. We also propose to simplify the regulations \n     by eliminating the separate short and long tests for each of \n     the remaining three categories and substituting a single \n     standard duties test for each. This restructuring and \n     simplification would eliminate the percentage limitation on \n     nonexempt work and the consistent exercise of discretion and \n     judgment requirement. As discussed above in connection with \n     similar proposed changes to the executive and administrative \n     exemptions, we are proposing to eliminate these subsections \n     because they have proven difficult standards to apply \n     uniformly.\n       For learned professionals, the proposed new standard test \n     in Sec. 541.301 would provide that employees qualify for \n     exemption as a learned professional if they have a primary \n     duty of performing office or non-manual work requiring \n     advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning \n     customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized \n     intellectual instruction, but which also may be acquired by \n     an equivalent combination of intellectual instruction and \n     work experience. This proposed standard test for learned \n     professionals would focus on the knowledge of the employee \n     and how that knowledge is used in everyday work, not on the \n     educational path followed to obtain that knowledge. Although \n     some flexibility to focus on the worker's knowledge exists in \n     the current regulation, it is very limited and rarely used. \n     The clarified test reflects changes in the 21st century \n     workplace in how some ``knowledge workers'' acquire \n     specialized learning and skills: in the modern workplace, \n     some employees acquire advanced knowledge through a \n     combination of formal college-level education, training \n     and work experience, even where other employees in that \n     field customarily acquire advanced knowledge by obtaining \n     a baccalaureate or advanced degree. The proposed changes \n     would clarify that, so long as such an employee's level of \n     advanced knowledge is equivalent to the knowledge \n     possessed by an employee with the typical academic degree \n     generally required by the profession, the employee may \n     qualify as an exempt professional. Thus, for example, an \n     employee who obtained advanced knowledge by completing \n     college courses in a field such as engineering, and who \n     worked in that field for a number of years, could qualify \n     for exemption if the knowledge acquired was equivalent to \n     that of an employee with a baccalaureate degree in \n     engineering. We have not proposed any specific formula in \n     the regulations for determining the equivalencies of \n     intellectual instruction and qualifying work experience, \n     although some examples from the current rule have been \n     included and expanded. Public comments are invited on \n     whether the regulations should specify such equivalencies.\n       The view that several years of specialized training plus \n     intensive on-the-job training for a number of additional \n     years may be equated with a college degree in certain fields \n     has found support in reported judicial decisions. For \n     example, the professional exemption has been applied to \n     employees with a combination of training and academics in \n     Leslie v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., 899 F. Supp. 1578 (D. \n     Miss. 1995). In Leslie, the court concluded that an employee \n     who had completed three years of engineering study at a \n     university and had many years of experience in the field of \n     engineering was properly classified as a professional \n     employee, even though the employee did not satisfy one of the \n     usual minimum qualifications for an engineering position of \n     having a bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline. The \n     court considered the employee's combination of education and \n     experience as satisfying the requirement for a prolonged \n     course of specialized intellectual instruction and study.\n       For creative professionals, we propose to adopt the current \n     short test, slightly modified, as the new standard test in \n     proposed Sec. 541.302. This new standard test would apply the \n     creative professional exemption to any employee with the \n     primary duty of ``performing work requiring invention, \n     imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of \n     artistic or creative endeavor.'' This language, although \n     simplified, is not intended to make any material changes from \n     the existing regulations. This standard was applied in the \n     case of Freeman v. National Broadcasting Company, Inc., 80 \n     F.3d 78 (2nd Cir. 1996), in which employees who researched \n     facts, developed story elements, interviewed subjects, wrote \n     scripts, and supervised the editing of videotape were deemed \n     to have been correctly classified as artistic professional \n     employees. On the other hand, employees of small news \n     organizations who spent their time gathering facts about \n     routine community events such as municipal, school board, and \n     city council meetings, and gathering information from the \n     police blotter and real estate transaction reports, and then \n     reporting those facts in a standard format were deemed not to \n     be artistic professional employees in Reich v. Newspapers of \n     New England, 44 F.3d 1060 (1st Cir. 1995) and Reich v. \n     Gateway Press, Inc., 13 F.3d 685 (3d Cir. 1994).\n       The standard test for teachers in proposed section 541.303 \n     would be unchanged from the current short test, with the \n     exception of the deletion of the requirement that the \n     employee's work require the consistent exercise of discretion \n     and judgment, a requirement that, as discussed above, has \n     engendered significant confusion. Provisions on teachers from \n     current Sec. Sec. 541.3, 541.301(g), and 541.314 have been \n     consolidated into proposed new Sec. 541.303. The minor \n     editorial changes are not intended to cause any substantive \n     changes.\n       In addition, the proposed regulations utilize objective, \n     plain language that can be easily understood by employees, \n     small business owners and human resource professionals, and \n     eliminate outdated and uninformative examples. The proposed \n     regulations also would address a number of specific \n     occupations that have been the subject of ambiguity and \n     litigation. For example, we propose to update and clarify the \n     circumstances under which employees working as newspaper \n     journalists or as radio or television commentators are \n     exempt, because the case law regarding such employees has \n     been evolving over the years, and the existing regulations \n     discussing such employees are outdated.\n       Provisions of the current regulations in Sec. Sec. 541.3 \n     and 541.314 that provide an exception to the salary or fee \n     requirements for physicians and lawyers have been \n     consolidated and moved to proposed Sec. 541.304. Current \n     Sec. 541.307 entitled ``Essential part of and necessarily \n     incident to'' has been combined with current Sec. 541.108 \n     (``Work directly and closely related''), 541.202 \n     (``Categories of work''), and Sec. 541.208 (``Directly and \n     closely related''), and moved to proposed new Sec. 541.702 \n     (``Directly and closely related''), for a streamlined \n     discussion of the principles for distinguishing exempt and \n     nonexempt work. Although these sections have been \n     consolidated and simplified, we do not intend any substantive \n     changes.\n       Finally, we propose to move sections that pertain to salary \n     issues (Sec. Sec. 541.311, 541.312 and 541.313) to subpart G, \n     where all such issues will be consolidated. Other sections \n     relevant to several or all of the exemption categories (such \n     as the definition of primary duty, a section regarding \n     application of the exemption to trainees, and a section \n     discussing nonexempt work generally) would move to the \n     proposed subpart H (Definitions and Miscellaneous Provisions) \n     to eliminate unnecessary repetition. Current Sec. 541.305 \n     entitled ``Discretion and judgment'' and current Sec. 541.309 \n     entitled ``20-percent nonexempt work limitation'' have been \n     deleted from the proposed regulations for the same reasons \n     similar changes are being proposed in the executive and \n     administrative exemptions as discussed above.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senate should reject this bill and demand that the \nright to overtime pay be restored; we should demand that our schools be \nproperly funded and that private school vouchers be rejected; we should \ndemand that illegal guns be removed from our streets; and we should \ndemand a food supply safe from mad cow disease.\n  Finally, Americans work more than workers in any other industrial \nsociety in the world. This chart shows that. We are working about 500 \nhours more than any other society in the world. American workers are \nworking harder, and now this administration is trying to deny them at \nleast the fairness of being compensated for it.\n  This chart shows what happens if you have overtime protection or if \nyou don't have overtime protection. For all the overtime that is used \nin this country today, only 19 percent of it is applicable to those who \nget paid for the overtime while 44 percent for those\n\n[[Page S6]]\n\nwho don't get the overtime. That is 3 to 1 with regard to individuals \nwho work 50 hours a week. We know what this is all about because the \nadministration has given a guide to employers about how they can avoid \npaying overtime. I ask that those regulations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Methodology for Estimating Costs\n\n       The principal database used in the PRIA is the 2001 Current \n     Population Survey (CPS). A complete description of the \n     methodology used for determining the employees who are \n     potentially exempt and nonexempt from the overtime \n     requirements of the current and proposed rule is contained in \n     the PRIA available by contacting the Wage and Hour Division \n     at the address and telephone number provided above.\n       The economic impact of the proposed rule includes two \n     components: One-time implementation costs; and recurring \n     incremental payroll costs incurred by employers for those \n     employees presently treated as exempt from overtime under the \n     current rule, who become nonexempt.\n       The implementation costs contain two parts. The first part \n     includes the amount of time employers would take to: (1) Read \n     and understand the proposed rule; (2) update and formulate \n     their overtime policies; (3) notify employees of any changes; \n     and (4) all other time taken to implement the proposed rule. \n     The second part of the implementation costs is the amount of \n     time employers would take to review their job categories to \n     determine (1) whether or not a particular job category is \n     exempt or nonexempt under the proposed rule, and (2) how to \n     adjust to the new salary levels and duties tests. To estimate \n     the implementation costs of the proposed rule, the department \n     contacted six human resource specialists from around the \n     country to obtain information on the amount of time small and \n     large businesses would take for each of these activities. \n     High and low estimates of the implementation costs were \n     estimated by varying the amount of time taken to review job \n     categories and other time taken to implement the proposed \n     rule.\n       The second component of the economic impact of the proposed \n     rule is the recurring incremental payroll costs incurred by \n     employers for those employees presently treated as exempt \n     from overtime under the current rule, who become nonexempt as \n     a result of raising the salary levels and revising the duties \n     tests.\n       Affected employers would have four choices concerning \n     potential payroll costs: (1) Adhering to a 40-hour work week; \n     (2) paying statutory overtime premiums for affected workers' \n     hours worked beyond 40 per week; (3) raising employees' \n     salaries to levels required for exempt status by the proposed \n     rule; or (4) converting salaried employees' basis of pay to \n     an hourly rate (no less than the federal minimum wage) that \n     results in virtually no (or only a minimal) changes to the \n     total compensation paid to those workers. Employers could \n     also change the duties of currently exempt and nonexempt \n     workers to comply with the proposed rule.\n       For the second choice above, paying overtime premium pay, \n     employers typically have two options, with differing cost \n     implications, for meeting their statutory overtime \n     obligations. For example, assume an employer paid an employee \n     a fixed salary of $400 per week with no overtime premium pay, \n     for which the employee worked 45 hours per week, and the \n     employer must now begin to pay this employee overtime pay. As \n     one option, the employer could assume that the former weekly \n     salary of $400 represents compensation for a standard 40-hour \n     workweek, and pay this employee in the future time-and-one-\n     half the $10 hourly rate for any overtime hours worked beyond \n     40 per week. For a 45-hour workweek, total compensation due, \n     including overtime, would equal $475 ((40 hours x $10/hour) + \n     (5 hours x $15/hour) = $475), compared to $400 formerly. As a \n     second option, the employer could pay the fixed salary of \n     $400 per week as total straight time pay for all hours worked \n     in the week (provided it equals or exceeds the federal \n     minimum wage), and pay additional ``half-time'' for each hour \n     worked beyond 40 in the week. This method of payment is known \n     as a ``fixed salary for fluctuating hours'' (see 29 CFR \n     778.114). For a 45-hour workweek, total compensation due \n     under this method, including overtime, would equal $422.22 \n     ($400 + (($400  45) x \\1/2\\ x 5) = $422.22).\n       The third choice above is straightforward--an employer \n     could simply raise the salary level for currently exempt \n     salaried workers earning less than $22,100 to at least the \n     new proposed salary level or more and have them remain exempt \n     salaried workers.\n       Nothing in the FLSA would prohibit an employer affected by \n     the proposed rule, or under the current rule, from \n     implementing the fourth choice above that results in \n     virtually no (or only a minimal) increase in labor costs. For \n     example, to pay an hourly rate and time and one-half that \n     rate for 5 hours of overtime in a 45-hour workweek and incur \n     approximately the same total costs as the former $400 weekly \n     salary, the regular hourly rate would compute to $8.421 ((40 \n     hours x $8.421) + (5 hours x (1.5 x $8.421)) = $399.99).\n       Most employers affected by the proposed rule would be \n     expected to choose the most cost-effective compensation \n     adjustment method that maintains the stability of their work \n     force, pay structure, and output levels. Given the range of \n     options available to an employer confronted with paying \n     overtime to employees previously treated as exempt, the \n     actual payroll cost impact for individual employers could \n     range from near zero to up to the maximum cost impacts \n     estimated in the Department's PRIA. However, for the PRIA it \n     is was assumed that, for any nonexempt employee who satisfies \n     the pertinent duties test, the employer will choose to pay \n     the smaller of either the additional weekly salary required \n     to qualify the employee exemption or the usual weekly \n     overtime payment for the employee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, this is the list of the individuals who will be \naffected. Who are those individuals? Police officers, nurses, \nfirefighters; those are the home guard personnel. You talk about safety \nand security in our communities and in our neighborhoods; these are the \nindividuals who stand watch for all Americans. Why is this \nadministration fighting decent fair pay for these hard-working \nAmericans who represent the best of our country and are involved in \nhomeland security? This legislation should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Omnibus appropriations bill contains \nelements that contradict the express votes of this body and the other \nbody, bipartisan votes that in fact protected workers against losing \ntheir overtime, that insisted upon country-of-origin labeling, that \ndealt with media ownership. And at the last moment, at the direction of \nthe administration, these provisions were overridden and contradicted. \nThere are other provisions that have been included in this measure that \nshould not stand a fair vote on the Senate floor.\n  There is a provision, inserted in this bill by the House Republican \nleadership over the objection of the Republican subcommittee chairman \nof the Commerce-State-Justice and Judiciary Committee, that would \nrequire the FBI to destroy records of gun sales within 24 hours. They \nhave now, under the law, the Brady bill, the authority to keep these \nrecords for 90 days to conduct audits of the system of instant checks.\n  A study analyzing just 6 months' activity conducted by the General \nAccounting Office showed that the FBI was able to retrieve 235 firearms \nthat had been sold to illegal purchasers, prohibited purchasers, wife \nbeaters, murderers, the whole parade of perpetrators. If this \nlegislation passes and the 24-hour rule stands, then instead of \nrecovering 235 of these weapons, 7,228 firearms will be in the hands of \nmurderers, wife beaters, robbers, those people who endanger the \nAmerican public.\n  This provision should not be allowed, without a vote, to become the \nlaw of the land. In the words of Los Angeles Police Chief William J. \nBratton:\n\n       I'm very opposed to this effort to make the Brady law \n     toothless, and I just don't understand how Members of \n     Congress can even consider it. Obviously, they haven't shown \n     up at the scene of enough officer shootings.\n\n  What we hear from the NRA and their allies is ``just enforce the \nlaws.'' How can you enforce the law if you don't have the information \non the sale?\n  This provision should be stricken. In addition to that, there are \nprovisions about vouchers for public schools in the District of \nColumbia. We don't have enough resources to fix the public schools of \nthis country, and diverting them to private schools is a mistake. It is \npassing out parachutes; it is not fixing the airplane. We can do \nbetter.\n  Indeed, these vouchers go to schools that don't have to stand up to \nthe rigors of the No Child Left Behind Act. Those people who go about \nthis country saying that critics of the No Child Left Behind Act--those \npeople who will not embrace these provisions--are somehow undermining \neducation reform but they say, let's give money to schools that don't \neven have to follow the No Child Left Behind Act. That is also wrong.\n  As my colleague Senator Kennedy pointed out, this bill strips away \novertime protections for Americans who work very hard. These workers \ndepend on overtime to support their families. Costs go up, hours of \nwork are going up, and still families find themselves stretched \nterribly thin. We are in a position now not only to override both the \nsense of the House and Senate but\n\n[[Page S7]]\n\nthe common sense of the American people. They understand that without \nadequate overtime people cannot support their families.\n  In addition to this provision that would strip away overtime pay for \nfirefighters, nurses, and police officers, the Department of Labor had \nthe audacity to suggest ways in which overtime can be prevented from \napplying to everyone. That is not a Department of Labor that is working \nin the best interest of the American workers.\n  We understand something else, too, which is that the great economic \ncrisis of this country at this moment is the fact that we cannot \nproduce jobs. Employers are not willing to hire, so they require more \novertime. Well, if they have less incentives, less requirements to pay \novertime pay, they will make the current workers work even harder, and \nthere will not be the opportunity to hire more Americans for these \njobs. This provision goes right to the heart of what we all should be \nabout: getting more work for Americans, not penalizing workers by \ntaking away their overtime pay.\n  These are just a handful of provisions that are not only \ncontradictory to what we did on a bipartisan basis--Republicans and \nDemocrats in both the House and Senate--but they are fundamentally \nagainst the interests of safe streets, opportunities to work, and \nopportunities to educate the children of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself 1 minute, Mr. President.\n  President Bush is supporting this bill that will be before us. He is \ngoing to sign it. I want to speak to my colleagues and any and all who \nare watching this debate. Understand with that signature 8 million \nAmericans will lose their guarantee to overtime pay. Eight million \nAmericans--those earning roughly over $24,000 a year in my State--just \nlike that, with President Bush's signature, people will lose their \novertime pay.\n  What does that mean? It means that an employer can work you harder \nand you don't get any more money; you are pulled away from your family \nand not getting fair pay. You could be spending more time with them, at \na minimum.\n  This is a harmful bill. Not only does it do this, but it turns the \nclock back in many other areas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to voice my concern over secret \nriders that were jammed into the Omnibus appropriations bill behind \nclosed doors, in the dark of night, that are contrary to the bipartisan \nwishes of the Senate and, in some instances, both the House and Senate. \nIt is an abomination of a process that has taken place. It has very \nreal negative consequences.\n  The bill, as a whole, does some good things. I commend Chairman \nStevens for his hard work in that regard. But there are these riders \nthat were stuck in the bill that make no sense. Some have been alluded \nto already, such as the allowance of greater media concentration than \nthis Senate wanted; the privatization of FAA air traffic control \npersonnel; the question of vouchers, at a time when we are $9 billion \nshort of funding No Child Left Behind as it is, and that funding is \nfurther undermined by subsidization of private schooling.\n  The question of overtime pay is perhaps the most outrageous of all. \nEight million American workers are going to be denied overtime pay \nunder this rider that was stuck into the bill. There was no conference \nin a meaningful sense. They were simply done behind closed doors. The \ndeliberations were, frankly, the Republican leadership working with the \nWhite House, and they stuck the provisions in and came back to this \nbody and said: Take it or leave it.\n  I believe we can have the merits of the larger portion of the Omnibus \nbill and simply have these provisions struck. It would be simple to do.\n  One of the provisions that is most troubling in my State of South \nDakota, and in rural areas, is a provision that would delay country-of-\norigin meat labeling for 2 years--probably beyond that--at a time when \nwe are struggling with BSE, mad cow disease.\n  Our consumers should understand that our Nation has the safest, \nhighest quality meat in the world, bar none. Canada has struggled with \nthe BSE issue. One of their cows showed up in the U.S. We need to see \nto it that we respond aggressively to make sure Americans have \nconfidence in our meat supply, and that the world community also \nunderstands the quality product that comes from the United States.\n  Right now Japan, Korea, and the rest of the buyers of American beef \nabroad have told the United States: We like your beef, the meat \nproducts you produce, but we don't want to buy it if you cannot certify \nto us that it is, indeed, an American product.\n  We are one of the few industrialized democracies in the world not to \nhave country-of-origin labeling. We don't have it. It is long overdue \nthat we join the rest of the industrialized world in allowing our \nconsumers to know the origin of the meat products they buy so they can \nbuy an American product if they choose, and when it comes time to \nexporting our product, that the Japanese, Koreans, and the rest of the \nworld will know it is an American product they are buying, as opposed \nto being a mingling of U.S., Canadian, and Heaven knows what else that \ngoes through the U.S. into the export market.\n  So for the sake of our domestic confidence and of our export markets, \nthe time is overdue that we join the rest of the world--the EU and the \nCanadians--in identifying the origins of these meat products.\n  What has happened is that this 2-year delay, which would lead to \nstill further delay, ironically at a time when the USDA is telling us \nthey want to implement an electronic tracking system for every animal \nin the U.S., which is a far more expensive, far-reaching proposal than \ncountry-of-origin labeling ever was; every country has been able to do \nit without expense, without bureaucracy, or any problem for the \nproducers. There is no reason the U.S. cannot do it as well.\n  So what we have is a convergence of those who are profiting by not \nallowing American consumers to know the difference in what they are \nbuying, along with those in the White House who have a philosophy of a \nglobal agricultural market with no borders whatever, which leads, of \ncourse, to that race to the bottom, where whoever can sell the product \nfor the cheapest price wins. American producers deserve better. This \nCongress deserves a better bill than what we have before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the President pro tempore of the Senate has \nagreed to allow Senator Harkin 3 minutes of his time. I ask unanimous \nconsent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 5 months ago the Senate voted in support \nof my amendment to block the administration's effort to kill overtime \npay for millions of American workers. The bipartisan vote of the Senate \nwas 54 to 45. The House followed suit with a 221-to-203 vote.\n  The Congress spoke up clear as a bell and said: No, the \nadministration must not strip overtime rights from 8 million American \nworkers. But as we all know, the administration refused to accept the \nclear will of Congress. The administration ordered the conferees to \nstrip this provision from the omnibus bill.\n  Senator Specter and I fought to keep it in, but the administration \nrefused any cooperation or compromise. In the end, with a snap of its \nfingers, the administration nullified the clear will of both Houses of \nCongress and the American people.\n  This is just another example of the brazen abuse of power by the \nadministration. The administration seems to believe in Government by \none branch: the executive branch. Time and again, we see this \nadministration running roughshod over the will of Congress.\n  The administration's new overtime rule is a stealth attack on the 40-\nhour workweek, pushed by the White House without a single public \nhearing.\n  There was one positive part of the proposal that would raise the \nbasic income that guarantees overtime pay for low-income workers from \n$8,000 to\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\n$22,100. My amendment did not touch that part of the proposal. But now \nwe find that the Labor Department is advising employers on how to get \naround it.\n  The Labor Department example suggests cutting workers' hourly wages \nand making them work longer. That means there will be no net gain by \nthe worker. This is disgraceful.\n  Here is what they have done: ``How to Avoid Paying Your Employees \nOvertime,'' courtesy of the Department of Labor. Lower existing wages \nso when workers accrue overtime, their net pay will not grow. In other \nwords, pay them less; work them longer.\n  Change workers' duties so they are exempt from the overtime rules.\n  Raise workers' wages to levels required to be exempt, $22,100.\n  Don't let them work more than 40 hours a week.\n  This is what is in the Bush proposal. This is like the IRS giving \nadvice to tax cheats on how to avoid paying their taxes. This is a \ndirect violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that \nestablished the 40-hour workweek for American workers.\n  Right now, Americans work longer hours than workers in other \nindustrialized nations. This is a slap in the face to workers who give \nup their premium time with their families to work overtime, and we are \nnot talking about spare change here. We are talking about taking away \nsome 25 percent of the income of many American workers.\n  Congress did the right thing in voting to block this new rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But Congress voice and vote were nullified.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a New York Times article \ndated January 20, 2004, and a letter to the President signed by several \nSenators dated January 16, 2004, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 20, 2004]\n\n                            Gaming Overtime\n\n       Some ominous fine print has turned up in the Bush \n     administration's promise to help long-suffering low-wage \n     workers get the overtime pay they have long been denied. As \n     initially presented, the White House estimated that its new \n     rules governing nonunion workers would mean $895 million in \n     guaranteed time-and-a-half pay for 1.3 million of the \n     nation's poorest-paid workers. That inviting proposal was \n     coupled with a far more controversial plan to allow employers \n     greater leeway to close out overtime pay for a midrange of \n     white-collar professionals by designating them as managers.\n       That part was questionable enough--critics warned that it \n     could cut earnings and force unpaid overtime on millions of \n     workers, and even the Republican-led Congress became leery. \n     But now, in delving into the sweetener half of the plan \n     covering the lowest-paid, The Associated Press has discovered \n     that the Labor Department's advisory includes suggestions to \n     employers about ways they can keep their costs from actually \n     going up.\n       One tip from those helpful bureaucrats theoretically \n     protecting struggling breadwinners is that an employer could \n     consider ``the most cost-effective compensation adjustment \n     method.'' This translates into cutting a worker's hourly wage \n     so the new overtime requirement will produce the old net \n     salary, not an actual boon.\n       To be fair, the Labor Department also suggests that \n     employers are free to raise workers' salaries to the new \n     higher threshold of $22,100 a year, the level at which \n     eligibility for time and a half ends. Still, those helpful \n     hints to anxious employers only compound suspicions about the \n     plan.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2004.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you know, bipartisan majorities in \n     both the House and Senate voted to oppose the Department of \n     Labor's proposal to deny overtime protections to more than 8 \n     million hard-working men and women--regulations that actually \n     provided instructions on ways for employers to avoid paying \n     overtime to their workers. This is shocking, given that the \n     Department of Labor's mission is to promote ``the welfare of \n     the job seekers, wage earners, and retirees of the United \n     States.''\n       Instead of accepting the clear will of bipartisan \n     majorities in the Congress and the American people on this \n     issue, your Administration used its leverage to threaten \n     vital funding for cancer research, fighting AIDS, job \n     training for millions of out-of-work Americans, and financial \n     aid for children to attend college unless the provision \n     protecting workers was removed. We believe that protecting \n     workers' pay should not come at the expense of funding these \n     vital programs.\n       We call on you to rescind the overtime regulation and \n     instruct your Labor Department to require all employers to \n     meet their obligations to pay workers for the overtime they \n     have earned. At a minimum, we ask you to call on the \n     Republican leadership to reinstate the Senate-passed and \n     House-endorsed provision to protect overtime.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Tom Harkin,\n     Tom Daschle.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a provision that \nwas added to the omnibus appropriations bill at my request. The \nprovision is designed to halt temporarily the implementation of \namendment 13 to the Northeast groundfish fishery management plan. With \nthis 5-month delay, which will be in effect for the remainder of the \nfiscal year, a more equitable form of amendment 13 can be developed. \nWithout this delay, amendment 13 would devastate the fishing industry \nof my home State. Amendment 13 would deny at least a quarter of Maine's \nfishermen their traditional access to fish stocks, and would jeopardize \nthe ability of many related small businesses to survive financially.\n  Amendment 13 would impose a series of regulatory changes to New \nEngland's groundfish management system. These new regulations would \nreduce the number of fishing days allocated to most Maine fishermen. \nThe average Maine fishing vessel that received any fishing days would \nbe allocated roughly 52 fishing days each year that they could use off \nMaine's shores. These, of course, are the most fortunate of Maine's \nfishermen, as many would receive smaller allocations of fishing days \nunder amendment 13. Imagine trying to make ends meet practicing your \nprofession only 1 day per week.\n  There are further problems with amendment 13 in its current form. The \nplan relies on targeting healthy fish stocks in order to mitigate \neconomic impacts while less abundant fish stocks rebuild. This has led \nto the creation of two classes of fishing days: A and B days. On ``A'' \ndays, a fisherman may target any fish stock. On ``B'' days, fishing is \nrestricted to a handful of healthy species in designated areas.\n  Unfortunately, Maine's small boats will have difficulty using any of \ntheir B days due to safety concerns. These B fisheries are restricted \nto areas far out to sea that small boats cannot fish safely. There is \nsimply no B fishery that Maine's smaller fishing boats can access.\n  Further, Maine's large boats will penalized under amendment 13 \nbecause they are forced to lose valuable fishing time in transit to \nfish stocks located far to the south of Maine. Groundfish regulations \nwould count transit time, ``steaming time,'' as fishing time, putting \nMaine's fishermen at a severe disadvantage to fishermen located in \nsouthern New England. Fishermen based in southern New England could \noperate at a considerable competitive advantage, as they are able to \nspend more time fishing and less time steaming to and from fertile \ngrounds, such as the Georges Bank. The result could well be the \nmigration of Maine's fishing industry south to Massachusetts. In fact, \nwe have already seen some large boats relocate from Portland to \nGloucester.\n  Under amendment 13, Maine's larger fishing boats will continue to \nexperience problems with steaming time. Fishermen from Portland, ME, \nwho chose to take part in the cod exemption program and fish on stocks \nlocated on Georges Bank must travel 18 hours before they can put their \nnets in the water. In contrast, fishermen leaving from Gloucester, MA, \ncan begin fishing after traveling for only 3 hours. Therefore, it makes \nperfect economic sense for vessels to relocate to southern ports, and \nsome already have and more will do so. Maine suffers as these landings \nof fish and the revenues generated from these fish move south.\n  Furthermore, Maine's small-boat fishermen took drastic cuts in days-\nat-sea allocations. In fact, amendment 13 would allocate zero days-at-\nsea to 57 Maine groundfish fishermen; this is over 30 percent of \nMaine's groundfishing fleet that would be denied access to this \nresource. Maine's share of the groundfish resource has only diminished \nin recent years, and denying 30 percent of our fleet access to \ngroundfish will only accelerate this trend. A larger portion of Maine's \nfleet\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nwill be denied access to groundfish than in any other New England \nState.\n\n  Amendment 13 would also harm Maine's fishing-related businesses such \nas gear manufacturers, ice suppliers, and small boat repair shops. \nMaine's fishing infrastructure, which already is at a critical minimum, \nwould lose revenue due to restricted access to the resource and due to \nthe southward migration of Maine's groundfish fleet. If the current \nform of amendment 13 were implemented, Maine's working waterfront could \nvanish, to be replaced by coastal development. These regulations may \nwell mean that Maine would have neither the fishermen nor the fishing \ninfrastructure needed for a healthy groundfish fishery.\n  In response to concerns regarding loss of fishing infrastructure, \ninequities in steaming time, and the immense social and economic costs \nof amendment 13, the Portland City Council unanimously passed a \nresolution addressing amendment 13 on September 15, 2003. This \nresolution called on Maine's congressional delegation to ``root out all \nprovisions of regional groundfish management which discriminate against \nvessels fishing from the State of Maine in general and, in particular, \nfrom the Port of Portland.'' Amendment 13, in its current form, \ndiscriminates against Maine's fishermen. The delay in implementation \nwill provide the time needed to ``root out'' the unfair aspects of \namendment 13.\n  Anyone who has followed the amendment 13 process has been confronted \nwith a litany of bad news; bad for New England, and especially bad for \nmy home State of Maine. Newspapers throughout the State of Maine have \ndetailed how amendment 13 would devastate Maine's fishermen and related \nbusinesses.\n  Maine's groundfishing industry has already suffered in recent years. \nSince 1995, Maine's groundfishing fleet has shrunk by roughly 40 \npercent. In the past two decades, Maine has lost nearly 50 processing \ncompanies. Amendment 13 would only accelerate this trend. In fact, \nanalysis by the National Marine Fisheries Service shows that amendment \n13 would allocate so few days-at-sea to Maine's fishermen, that few, if \nany, of Maine's boats would be able to break even.\n  I want the New England groundfish fishery to be sustainable. But that \ngoes for fish and fishermen alike. If fishermen cannot make a living at \nsea, they will have no choice but to turn to other businesses.\n  As part of the National Marine Fisheries Service's economic analysis \nof amendment 13, a break-even analysis is performed. This analysis \nmakes a number of assumptions. First, this break-even analysis assumes \na boat owner makes no profit, a grim prospect for any business. Second, \nthis analysis assumes standard overhead and crew costs that must be \novercome for a vessel to break even. By paying crew members the bare \nminimum pay of $25,000, most boats will need well over 60 days-at-sea \nto break even. Unfortunately, the average Maine fishermen will be \nallocated only 52 days-at-sea that they can actually use. Only a very \nsmall portion of Maine's fleet will be able to break even under \namendment 13.\n  Amendment 13 is fundamentally unfair to Maine's fishing community. \nYet, it was scheduled to be implemented by May 1, 2004, which marks the \nstart of the next fishing season. Surely, we need a better, fairer \napproach. The amendment I included in the omnibus spending bill is \nmeant to halt implementation of amendment 13 in the current fiscal year \nin order to provide an opportunity for the council to reconvene to find \na management plan that is fair to all New England States; not a plan \nthat ties the laboring oar of rebuilding the fisheries to the hands of \njust one State, Maine.\n  I have also sought this delay because we need time to make sure we do \ndevelop an equitable management plan before one is put into place. The \ngroundfish fishery is recovering. Fish stocks have tripled in recent \nyears; more important, they continue to rebuild under current \nregulations. This delay is not irresponsible; fish stocks are not \ndeclining. The condition of the fishery will continue to improve while \na fair set of regulations are developed. The strict regulations that \nare currently in place, and that will stay in place because of my \nfunding restriction, are undeniably working.\n  Because this matter is so important to so many people in Maine and \nthroughout New England, I want to take a moment to make my intent in \ndrafting this amendment perfectly clear.\n  My amendment prohibits funds in the omnibus from being used to \nimplement a fisheries management plan for New England other than the \nfinal emergency rule published by the Department of Commerce in the \nFederal Register on June 27, 2003, at page 38234. According to the \nDepartment of Commerce, the final emergency rule was promulgated ``to \nensure that there exist measures to reduce overfishing until \nimplementation of amendment 13.'' This is still the goal under my \namendment--the timeframe has just been extended.\n  I intend, through my amendment, to keep the final emergency rule in \nplace through the end of the fiscal year. This is the case in spite of \nany provisions of law--including, but not limited to, 16 U.S.C. \nSec. 1855(c)--that might otherwise limit the duration of the provisions \nof the final emergency rule. Indeed, my amendment is intended to \nsuspend the application of provisions such as 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1855(c) to \nthe final emergency rule. And, in any event, my amendment would not \nprohibit the terms of the final emergency rule from being implemented, \nagain, were they found by the court to have expired.\n  My amendment restricts the use of funds appropriated in the omnibus. \nHence, the restrictions apply only through fiscal year 2004. \nPractically speaking, this means that no new management plan for New \nEngland can be implemented by the Department of Commerce before October \n1, 2004. My amendment imposes this delay in order to provide time for \nthe council to develop a plan that, unlike amendment 13, is fair to \neach of the New England States. The court, of course, is free to set a \nnew implementation date that falls later than October 1, 2004, and \nmight consider setting the new date at May 1, 2005, to coincide with \nthe start of the fishing season.\n  In addition, my amendment in no way prevents the National Marine \nFisheries Service from implementing regulations to allow the east coast \nscallop fleet and tuna purse seine fleet to access special management \nareas. I encourage the National Marine Fisheries Service to move \nforward and address these issues separate from the overfishing and \nrebuilding requirements in amendment 13.\n  It is my expectation that the New England Fishery Management Council \nwill use the additional time my amendment will provide to develop a \nplan that all States can support. It is particularly encouraging that, \nafter I announced that I would be pursuing this amendment, the New \nEngland Fishery Management Council's Groundfish Committee agreed to \nconvene an emergency meeting in January to examine the concerns that I \nhave raised. The Groundfish Committee did, indeed, address some of the \nissues that are important to Maine's fishermen, and I encourage the \nfull council to follow the committee's lead and take positive steps \ntoward resolving these critical issues.\n\n  The delay afforded by my amendment is so important because it \nprovides time for the council to correct the inequities of amendment \n13. The council was under severe, and in many ways artificial, time \npressure to develop a new management plan. Moreover, much of what has \nbeen included in amendment 13 was brought to the council at a very late \nhour.\n  My amendment will provide time for the council to consider necessary \nchanges that must be made to amendment 13. I do not expect the council \nto go back to the drawing board entirely. I believe that amendment 13 \ncan be altered so that it is fair to all New England States. Problems \nwith steaming time must be addressed by the council. Also, the council \nmust deal with minimum days-at-sea allocations in a fair manner. There \nis room to improve the conservation tax on days-at-sea transfer to make \nthis program viable, and the Groundfish Committee has forwarded a \nrecommendation to the council that provides welcome relief. Finally, I \nbelieve that the leasing program should be extended to provide a \nmeasure of certainty to New England fishermen.\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\n  I am very pleased that, just last week, the Groundfish Committee \nforwarded several positive recommendations to the council for its \nconsideration. The recommendations address many of the issues I have \nraised on behalf of Maine fishermen; issues that caused me to seek a \ndelay in the implementation of amendment 13 in the first place. The \ncouncil is scheduled to consider these recommendations next week. If \nthe council makes similar, positive progress, I will happily reconsider \nthe need for my amendment, and act accordingly.\n  In the end, I believe that the council can come up with a consensus \nproduct. That is not to say it will be a product that fishermen \napplaud. No one appreciates the Government taking away the livelihood \nfamilies have relied upon for generations. But, until the inadequacies \nof our fisheries laws are addressed head on, we owe it to our fishermen \nto administer them, such as they are, with an even hand. That is \nprecisely the goal of my amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the omnibus. \nThis bill contains several objectionable items that deeply concern me, \nas chair of the Ocean, Fisheries and Coast Guard Subcommittee, because \nthe language drastically and fundamentally changes U.S. fisheries \npolicy, including authorization language for Individual Processor \nQuotas, a prohibition on implementing a groundfish management plan, and \nother new fishing quota authorizations. These provisions have serious \nconsequences for our National fisheries policy and the natural \nresources upon which America's fishermen depend.\n  Allow me to explain my concerns in detail. I have many concerns about \nthe language in this bill that would authorize what is being called the \n``Crab Plan'' for the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island crab fishery. This \nplan contains provisions for establishing a system of Individual \nProcessor Quotas, or IPQs, which would allocate the right to process \ncrab among a group of predetermined processors. IPQs are not allowed \nunder current law--without express authorization IPQs would violate our \nantitrust laws--and that is why this plan has come before Congress in \nan appropriations bill.\n  I must make it perfectly clear, up front, that I have worked \nconsistently and forcefully, to reach an agreement with the advocates \nfor IPQs. Twice I scheduled a markup in June for a comprehensive bill \nwhich would have created uniform national standards for fishing quotas. \nThe bill was withdrawn from the first markup the evening before it was \nscheduled to occur because, regrettably the prior existing agreement on \nthe bill fell through. I withdrew the bill from the second markup after \nI was not able to reach consensus to preserve the original intent of \nuniform national standards for fishing quota plans in the hopes of \nfinding a future agreement.\n  As chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries and Coast Guard, I \nhave worked hard to address fisheries policy in a consistent basis that \nis national in scope but flexible enough to allow for regional \ndifferences, which is the underlying tenet of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. \nTherefore I am adamantly opposed to another circumvention of the \nauthorization and fishery management process.\n  This provision circumvents the Magnuson-Stevens Act and provides \nNorth Pacific processors and fishermen special treatment under the law. \nIf we allow this provision to proceed, we will set a national precedent \nthat has the potential to further undermine the regional fishery \nmanagement system established under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. This \nprovision will send us further down the road of having Congress \ndirectly managing fisheries--something Congress expressly decided not \nto do under the landmark 1976 law. Why should we have an established \nfishery management system if we only follow it in part of the country?\n  Under existing law, if a Fisheries Management Council wants to create \na safer fishery with fishing quotas, they already have the option of \ndoing so. However, it appears this legislation will only allow fishing \nquotas if processors get a separate quota system. Because of my great \ninterest in encouraging fishermen's safety, I find it deeply disturbing \nto make a fishing quota plan approval contingent on a processor quota \nplan. Essentially, these fishermen are being told that they must \ncontinue to fish in the current, unsafe, derby-style manner unless \nCongress approves this processor quota plan.\n  The processor quota system proposed in the omnibus would work by \nrequiring that crab fishermen deliver 90 percent of all future catch, \nindefinitely, to predetermined processors. This effectively divides \nmarket share so that processors are guaranteed a certain amount of \ncrabs to process, thereby removing competition from the dock-side price \nsetting process. Would we tell any other business that they had to sell \n9 out of every 10 products to only one buyer, regardless of what price \nis offered? Not in this country.\n\n  Another effect of the processor quota program is that it would \nconstrain new businesses from entering and competing in the processing \nsector. Technically, under this plan a new processor could try to start \na business by buying another company's share of processing quota, but \nat what price? What processor would want to sell their guaranteed \nmarket share?\n  The greatest concern I have, however, is that processor quotas do not \nimprove fishermen's safety or conservation. Fishing quotas can help \nachieve these goals, but the only purpose of processor quotas is to \nchannel market share and bargaining power into processing companies. We \nmust not forget that the whole point of fishery management is to \npromote a safe and orderly fishery, and processor quotas do nothing to \nmake a fishery safer or better conserve their fishing stocks. It just \nlets the big processing companies get richer.\n  Nevertheless, those who want IPQs often claim that my attempts to \nsimply question this plan is preventing a safer plan from ever \nhappening. This could not be further from the truth. To suggest that \nIPQ opponents are putting fishermen at risk is completely unacceptable \nand inaccurate. As long as IPQs remain part of the crab plan, however, \nCongress must properly address the very serious economic and public \npolicy questions they present.\n  So let's get to the heart of the matter. The Congress is being asked \nto grant individual companies a guaranteed share of the crab market, in \nperpetuity. Should Congress also put similar limits on to whom \nprocessors can sell their product? Shall we legislate to which fish \nmarkets and restaurants this seafood can then go?\n  Those who want IPQs claim that processors need these quotas to \nprotect their investment if a fishing quota system is allowed. They \nthink that their processing plants would sit unused if a fishing quota \nsystem brings fish in at different times, and that they would lose \nmoney. The problem is, all these claims are based on speculation. How \ndo we know what economic harm would occur? Even if processors were to \nlose money, how do we know that IPQs are the best or only answer?\n  The fact is, the in-depth studies needed to answer these questions \nhave not been done. The sensitive economic data necessary for these \nstudies have not even been released by processors. What has been \noffered as the ``analysis'' for this plan is incomplete and its \naccuracy cannot be verified through independent reviewers. In short, \nprocessor quotas are a very broad and costly response to a speculated \nproblem.\n  Clearly, I have a lot of questions about this plan, as do fishermen \naround the country, several branches of the Federal Government, and the \neditorial boards of at least 11 major newspapers. I have been seeking \nanswers for more than a year, and I have yet to receive satisfactory \nresponses. As chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, and Coast \nGuard, I take my fisheries oversight and authorization responsibility \nvery seriously. Proper oversight demands answers to these very basic \nquestions.\n  Make no mistake--the proposed IPQ plan is indeed precedent setting. \nBecause of this, processors and fishermen around the country are \nwatching our actions in the Senate very carefully. Already processors \nare pursuing an IPQ system for other west coast fisheries, and some are \neven advocating processor quotas for the entire country.\n  Fishermen's concerns about IPQs are justified, according to the \nDepartment of Justice. As chart I shows, on August 27, 2003, the \nAssistant Attorney General's Antitrust Division wrote a letter\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\nto the Department of Commerce General Counsel, stating that the IPQ \nplan would, and I quote, ``likely reduce beneficial competition among \nprocessors with no countervailing efficiency benefit.'' They also said \nthat the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which manages \nour fisheries, should oppose IPQs. This is a very strong condemnation \nof the proposed IPQ plan and validates many of the fishermen's \nconcerns.\n\n  In addition, as two other charts illustrate, the National Research \nCouncil and the General Accounting Office studied the impacts of \nfishing quota systems on the processing sector in other fisheries, and \nthey found that impacts of other fishing quota plans on processors was \ninconclusive; some processors were adversely impacted while other \nprocessors clearly benefited. As such, these studies determined that \nthere is no compelling reason to authorize a processor quota system. \nThey recommend that if a fishing quota system does result in economic \ndamage for processors, then more directed remedial action should be \npursued based on what harms actually occur.\n  Most notably, however, the administration has gone on record as \nsaying that they do not support IPQs as proposed for the crab plan. Dr. \nBill Hogarth, NOAA's Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, testified \nat the October 22 fisheries management hearing which I chaired, and he \nstated that the administration only supports the idea that processors \ncould buy fishing quota--not processing quota--if a fishery management \ncouncil deemed it appropriate. It is clear that the administration does \nnot support the IPQ system.\n  Beyond my grave concerns with this language, I also have many \nconcerns about the language added only days before the House voted on \nthis package, that threatens to send New England groundfish management \ninto a tailspin. This is a fishery that has existed for more than 400 \nyears, and has struggled to survive through years of significant \nreductions in fishing.\n  In 2001, several environmental groups sued the administration for not \nfollowing the rebuilding requirements of the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries \nAct. They won this suit, and ever since this ruling the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia has been overseeing the creation of \na new groundfish management plan that adheres to the law and will help \nthis fishery--which has already made substantial recovery in the last \nseveral years--be further restored. On November 6, 2003, the New \nEngland Fishery Management Council proposed a new plan, known as \n``amendment 13,'' for this fishery. The Secretary of Commerce is now in \nthe final phases of improving this plan before it is approved and \nimplemented this coming May.\n  This plan, as proposed, incorporates a great deal of input from \nfishermen and fishing communities throughout New England, and many \nmembers of the industry support the key elements of this plan. It is \ntrue that, as originally proposed, the plan would have shifted much of \nthe effort toward Massachusetts and have drastic economic impacts on \nMaine, and that is why I have secured commitments from the Secretary of \nCommerce to ameliorate these impacts in the final version of the plan.\n  For these reasons, New England groundfish managers have made progress \nin moving fisheries management out of the courtroom. This whole \nprocess, however, would likely be derailed by the language in this \nbill. Instead of allowing the Secretary to complete work on a plan that \nfollows the law and helps fish and fishermen, this language would \nprevent the administration from spending any money on implementing the \nnew plan.\n  In fact, this language would outlaw any plan from being implemented, \nother than a specific set of interim regulations that were put in place \nwhile the new plan was being developed. The problem is, these interim \nregulations do not follow the conservation requirements of the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act, they unfairly keep the small-boat groundfishing \nfleet throughout New England at an economic disadvantage, and they \nexpire in a few short months.\n  If this language passes, it will be illegal for the Secretary of \nCommerce to follow the very requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. \nThis language does not lift the requirements that this Federal \nfisheries law be followed, but it simply makes it impossible for the \nlaw to be followed and makes it impossible for the Secretary to assist \nin its implementation even if it is to ensure the law is being \nfollowed. If this passes, Secretary Evans could be held in contempt of \ncourt, and the future of the New England groundfishery may revert to \ncourt order, indefinitely.\n  Moreover, according to this language, the only regulations that could \nbe implemented maintain crippling cuts on the small boat, inshore \ngroundfishing fleet. This sector of the groundfishery forms the \neconomic backbone of small coastal communities throughout New England, \nand many of these fishermen have worked diligently to contribute to the \nnew management plan that the Secretary is now refining. The small-boat \nsector employs thousands of independent fishermen and fishing-related \nbusinesses throughout New England, and most of them do not support this \nlanguage--and for good reason.\n  Proponents of the rider try to make a compelling case that the \nSecretary's proposed rebuilding plan is flawed because it relies on \nunreasonably high fish population rebuilding goals and that the \ngroundfish stocks are already rebuilding, so a new plan is not needed. \nBoth of these statements are true, and that is why I have been working \nwith the administration to refine the council's plan in ways that \nbetter take these facts into account and asked it to conduct an \nindependent socioeconomic analysis of the potential impacts of the new \nregulations. Also, as chair of the subcommittee with oversight of \nfisheries I am actively working to address the problems with the \nunderlying law and change fisheries management so our nation truly \nbenefits. I will be pushing a reauthorization of the act during this \nsession of Congress that will address the existing problems in \nfisheries management.\n  The bill language in question does nothing to change these facts, and \nit does nothing to factor them into a more reasonable rebuilding plan \nor change the underlying law. The fishing rules that this language \nwould in fact allow simply try to ignore the reality that rebuilding \ntargets do exist. This language will not lead to any management system \nthat complies with the law, and it will not change the reality facing \nour small-boat groundfishermen. Let me be clear: this language risks \nputting the management of the New England groundfish industry back \nbefore the court, allowing the judge to make any and all subsequent \nmanagement decisions.\n  In short, this language undercuts years of hard work, sacrifice, and \ncompromise that have gotten the New England groundfishery back on \ntrack. It forces the Secretary of Commerce to break the law, and it \nrisks further damaging the hardworking men and women who want to \ncontinue to move forward on groundfish sustainability. This language \nrisks harming Maine, New England, and our entire Nation's fisheries \npolicy. If this provision becomes law it has the potential to lead to \nthe downfall of the council-based fishery management process, and risks \nending a way of life that has sustained New England fishermen for \ncenturies.\n  The omnibus contains other undesirable fisheries policy changes, such \nas authorization language for Alaskan rockfish processor quotas and \nAleut corporation quotas. These other two quota programs have never \nbeen presented to the authorizing committee in any form--nor have they \ngone through the Fisheries Management Council process--so I must object \nto fisheries policy authorization language that has circumvented all \nproper review channels.\n  Because of these highly objectionable authorizations, I see no other \nchoice than to oppose any bill that contains these provisions. I urge \nthose of my colleagues who have an interest in proper fisheries \nmanagement and sound economic policy to oppose this as well. We, in \nCongress, are entrusted with the great responsibility to thoughtfully \nreview such policy matters; we owe no less to our fisheries \nconstituents. Those that support this bill would be responsible for \ncreating a cartel that would effectively control an entire market, and \nfor undermining the basis of council-based fisheries management\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\nin the United States as well as the very foundation of our Nation's \nfree market system.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced charts in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The Department supports implementation of a new fishery \n     management plan that would end the ``race to fish'' inherent \n     in the current derby-style management plan. Under the current \n     derby-style program, the season ends as soon as the total \n     allowable catch has been fished, producing an undesirable \n     ``race to fish'' among harvesters. The race to fish is \n     economically inefficient for both harvesting and processing \n     and likely dangerous to the participants. The Department \n     therefore recommends that NOAA support individual fishing \n     quotas (``IFQ'') for harvesters, a reform that will end the \n     race to fish. Provided that IFQ are easily transferable, the \n     gains in efficiency from ending the race to fish--reducing \n     overcapitalization and improving safety--are likely to \n     outweigh the harm of any loss of competition among \n     harvesters. The Department recommends that the plan allow \n     easy transferability of IFQ shares; otherwise the incentive \n     for market participants to make efficient investment \n     decisions will be reduced.\n       The Department further recommends that NOAA oppose \n     individual processor quotas (``IPQ''), because IPQ will \n     likely reduce beneficial competition among processors with no \n     countervailing efficiency benefit. This lost competition \n     could deter the development of new processed crab products, \n     reduce the incentives for processors to make efficient \n     investment decisions and reduce welfare for consumers of \n     processed crab products. While harvester quotas should \n     eliminate the harmful race to fish, processor quotas are not \n     justified by any such beneficial competitive purpose.\n       If the goal of using IPQ is to compensate processors for \n     overcapitalization, we urge NOAA to consider advocating more \n     direct solutions, such as a program to buy excess processor \n     equipment. We also understand that there are concerns with \n     social goals such as preserving jobs in historic fishing \n     villages. To the extent NOAA agrees with these goals, we \n     recommend it consider advocating more direct solutions.\n       The Department also urges NOAA to oppose any form of \n     sanctioned price arbitration. Allowing an arbitrator, rather \n     than the market, to set price may distort the incentive of \n     processors and harvesters to make efficient investments. \n     Further, processors and harvesters must be cautious not to \n     use the arbitration program as a way to agree on price with \n     their competitors, which could violate the antitrust laws.\n\n   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose the omnibus \nappropriations bill that the Senate is voting on today. It is the \nlatest example of the annual breakdown in the congressional \nappropriations process. Once again, instead of considering \nappropriations bills individually, the Senate today is voting on a \nmassive spending bill that includes many--in this case, seven--of the \nannual appropriations bills.\n   This process just invites the kind of problems--unauthorized \nspending, special interest provisions and legislative riders that go \nagainst the will of a majority in Congress--that we see in this Omnibus \nbill. Take, for example, the Bush administration's proposed sweeping \nchanges to regulations governing overtime pay for white-collar workers. \nThese proposed changes would weaken overtime protections for these \nworkers by changing the way that eligibility for overtime is \ndetermined. Both the House and the Senate are on record in favor of a \nprovision that would block these changes from going into effect. \nNonetheless, that provision was dropped in conference after the \nadministration exerted tremendous pressure on those negotiating the \nfinal bill.\n   Similarly, language that would have prevented the Federal \nCommunications Commission from moving forward with its plan to loosen \nthe national cap on television ownership was badly weakened. And, of \ncourse, there are numerous bad provisions in the bill, including one \nthat would create a voucher program in Washington, DC, public schools \nand another that would prevent country of origin labeling on many \nagricultural products.\n   I wish I could support this bill as there are a few worthy things in \nit, such as funding for global AIDS programs and for the rural AED Act, \na program I created with Senator Susan Collins to increase access to \ndefibrillators in rural areas. I am pleased that the bill contains \nlanguage I fought for that would require Federal agencies to report on \ntheir purchases of foreign-made goods. As manufacturing jobs continue \nto disappear across the country, particularly in my home State of \nWisconsin, the Federal Government should be doing everything it can to \nsupport American manufacturers. I am also pleased that the bill \nincludes a provision I fought for to prohibit the Department of \nVeterans Affairs from enforcing its policy of prohibiting VA employees \nfrom taking proactive steps to let veterans know about the health care \nbenefits for which they may be eligible.\n   Those provisions do not outweigh the many bad ones in this bill, \nhowever. This is simply no way to fund the Federal Government. I regret \nthat this ``must-pass'' bill is being used as a platform for bad \nfunding decisions and for bad policy decisions, many of which override \nthe will of a bipartisan majority of Congress. We need to go back to \ntaking up and passing appropriations bills one by one, rather than \nthrowing everything but the kitchen sink into a single, bloated piece \nof legislation.\n  I am deeply disturbed that the Omnibus appropriations bill that is \nbefore the Senate today does not include a provision previously \napproved by the Senate that would have prevented the Bush \nadministration from rewriting Federal labor law to roll back \nregulations that guarantee millions of workers overtime pay.\n  I am dismayed that a small number of Members of Congress and the \nadministration were able to run roughshod over the will of a bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate and the House to resuscitate the \nadministration's ill-conceived overtime proposal. And I regret that the \nadministration resorted to veto threats and backroom negotiations to \nsave a proposal that will rob millions of workers of badly needed \novertime pay.\n  This is the latest in a series of assaults on working Americans that \nhave been perpetrated by this administration. Right out of the gate, \nthe President made it his first legislative priority to overturn a \nFederal ergonomics standard that was more than 10 years in the making. \nIn addition, this administration has launched a campaign to \naggressively contract out Federal jobs, systematically dismantle the \nFederal civil service system, gut worker protections, and undermine \ncollective bargaining rights.\n  In March of last year, the Bush administration proposed a regulation \nthat builds upon these efforts to tear down worker protections by \ndenying millions of Americans vital overtime pay.\n  This proposed rule would change the process by which a worker can be \ndeclared to be exempt from the wage and hour protections of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act--FLSA, thus opening the door to denial of overtime \nbenefits to more than 8 million workers who currently are entitled to \nthis extra pay for working more than 40 hours per week.\n  In essence, this rule, that apparently will move forward despite \nbroad opposition from the Senate and the House, will create a larger \nforce of employees who can be required to work longer hours for less \npay. This could also mean fewer opportunities for paid overtime for the \nworkers who would remain eligible for it, and fewer new jobs for those \nlooking for employment.\n  I am deeply disturbed that, in its attempts to sell its new rule, the \nadministration actually provided tips to employers who wanted to get \naround paying overtime to 1.3 million employees who would become \neligible for benefits under the new rule. The administration advised \nemployers to require employees to strictly adhere to a 40-hour work \nweek, to raise employees' salaries to the $22,100 annual threshold to \nmake them ineligible for overtime pay, or to decrease hourly wages so \nthat those plus overtime wages equal the employee's original salary.\n  Time and again, the administration has said that this rule is about \nmodernizing overtime regulations and not about taking overtime away \nfrom workers. But the administration's actions run counter to their \nwords. The administration has fought tooth and nail to block the Harkin \nlanguage, which simply states that any new overtime rule cannot take \novertime away from workers who are currently eligible for it. And the \nAdministration is offering advice to employers on how to avoid paying \novertime. From these actions, it is pretty clear to me, and to millions \nof workers, that the goal of this proposed rule is to make fewer\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nworkers eligible for overtime benefits and to require more employees to \nwork longer hours for less pay.\n  Who are the 8 million workers who will be affected by this rule \nchange? According to the Economic Policy Institute--EPI, 257 ``white \ncollar'' occupational groups could be impacted. EPI did a detailed \nanalysis of the effect of this rule on 78 of those occupational groups, \nand found that 2.5 million salaried employees and 5.5 million hourly \nworkers would lose their overtime protections under the proposed rule. \nThat is less than half of the occupational groups that will be covered \nby this rule change.\n  By broadening the FLSA wage and hour exemptions, the administration \nis seeking to deny overtime benefits to a wide range of workers, \nincluding police officers, fire fighters, and other first responders, \nnurses and other health care workers, postmasters, preschool teachers, \nand social workers, just to name a few.\n  I am deeply troubled that the administration would propose a rule \nthat would deny overtime benefits to the people who put their lives on \nthe line each and every day to protect our communities and to those who \nwork in health care professions, which already face severe staffing \nshortages.\n  I am also troubled that the administration has pulled out all of the \nstops to make this rule a reality, despite broad opposition from \nmembers of both parties. I regret that the Omnibus appropriations \nbill--and the process in which it was drafted--has been used as a \nvehicle to move this rule forward. With so many long-term unemployed \nworkers and with others working more than one job and depending on \novertime just to make ends meet, it is unfortunate that the \nadministration dug in its heels on a proposal to deny overtime to many \nof those who need it most.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the conference report to \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill that the Senate has been considering. \nWithout question, we have a duty to ensure the continuing operations of \nour Government, and the package before us would enable this for a \nmajority of the agencies and programs of the U.S. Government. I thank \nthe appropriators on both sides of the aisle, including the senior \nSenator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, for their efforts in crafting this \nmassive funding package, and particularly for their agreement on \nseveral provisions significant to the people of Hawaii that will meet \nurgent needs in transportation, education, agriculture, and juvenile \njustice. For example, funds included for the Juvenile Justice \nInformation System will significantly enhance efforts by law \nenforcement officials and child-serving agencies in Hawaii to address \nthe root causes of juvenile criminal behavior. This promises to have a \ntremendous impact on Hawaii's efforts to address juvenile crime.\n  I am also pleased that this package includes $1.5 million to initiate \nprograms under the Excellence in Economic Education Act, to increase \nfinancial and economic literacy in our country. I also am a strong \nproponent of the $100 million in funding for the Mentoring and \nMentoring Children of Prisoners programs, to ensure that young people \nin Hawaii and the Nation have access to the support, guidance, and \nassistance they need to help them through life's difficult and varied \nsituations. These are a couple of the many initiatives that I feel very \nstrongly about and worked on with my colleagues during the fiscal year \n2004 appropriations process.\n  However, on balance, the flaws in this Omnibus package overshadow its \nfavorable provisions. It is important to remember that we are here to \nserve in the best interest of our Nation. While differences in \nphilosophy will always exist, as Members of Congress, we still have an \nobligation to work together, to look beyond those differences and find \nsolutions. I do not believe that the Omnibus contains solutions that \nbest serve all who live in our great Nation.\n  For example, as the ranking member of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nFinancial Management Subcommittee, and the Armed Services Readiness and \nManagement Support Subcommittee, I object to the elimination of two key \nmeasures from the Senate-passed Transportation-Treasury-General \nGovernment appropriations bill that would have improved fairness and \ncost-efficiency in Federal contracting. The Omnibus deletes a provision \nwhich would promote equity by granting Federal workers the same rights \nas private contractors to appeal decisions to contract out Government \njobs. The Omnibus also strikes a requirement for minimal cost savings \nbefore decisions are made to contract out Federal work. To ensure \naccountability and transparency, Government contracting policies must \nachieve the best return on the dollar and be fair to Federal workers. \nThese two goals are complementary.\n  The measure before us today fails to ensure diversity of our airwaves \nand deprives millions of workers of their right to overtime pay. In \nboth cases, the other body and the Senate were in agreement on how to \nrectify these matters. However, the conferees, in working with the \nadministration, determined that there should be a limit on the Federal \nCommunications Commission's ability to grant licenses to only those \nstations that reach more than 39 percent instead of 35 percent of a \nmarket. In addition, the package before us will allow the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor to continue working on and finalizing its proposed \nrule to modernize and redefine exemptions from the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, which many employees have said will take away their right to be \nfairly compensated for work performed above their normal work schedule. \nThe majority in Congress rejected the DOL proposal and urged the \nleadership to maintain the Senate approved provision that would have \nprohibited the DOL from using funds to promulgate or implement its \nproposed rule.\n\n  The conference report fails not only in the case of worker's rights \nand consumer rights, but also in consumer safety. During consideration \nof the Agriculture appropriations bill, I offered an amendment that \nwould have prohibited the U.S. Department of Agriculture from using any \nfunds to approve for human consumption any meat products from downed \nanimals. This amendment was agreed to in the Senate. While the other \nbody defeated a similar amendment offered by Representative Gary \nAckerman of New York, many of his colleagues later indicated that they \nwere unable to vote that day and would have supported his amendment. \nThe support would have been enough to accept the amendment. It is \nunfortunate that Congress, in earlier legislative vehicles, and the \nconferees in this package, chose not to be proactive in protecting our \nfood supply. For more than 12 years, I have been working to address \nthis matter, and my amendment was the most recent example of that. \nWhile the USDA is making some strides to now address mad cow disease in \ncattle, we need to codify their efforts and expand the ban to all \ndowner livestock that may pose a risk to human health, the importance \nof which was highlighted recently with the discovery of a diseased \ndowner cow in the Pacific northwest.\n  Related to the Commerce Department, the provisions funding ocean \nexploration activities, marine aquaculture development, and coral reef \nresearch are disappointing. At the proposed levels, our country will \nnot be able to promote an economically viable and environmentally \nfeasible aquaculture industry to address the $7 billion seafood trade \ndeficit. Activities exploring the deep ocean, one of the last \nscientific frontiers on Earth, need to be a greater priority in order \nfor us to properly manage and protect these fragile marine communities. \nI am also concerned that an estimated 25 percent of the world's coral \nreefs have been lost and at least 30 percent are threatened by human \nactivities. Funding levels in this conference report are insufficient \nto support research and monitoring activities for coral reefs, one of \nthe most biologically diverse ecosystems on Earth that is worth \nhundreds of billions of dollars in marine services for our country and \nis certainly very important for Hawaii.\n  Although important education priorities are provided for, this \nconference report continues to fall short on major programs, \nparticularly those that help disadvantaged and special education \nstudents. Public schools in every State are struggling to comply with \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. However, budget shortfalls at the State \nlevel resulting from a fragile economy have restricted the resources \navailable to our\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\nclassrooms. Our failure to fully fund the Federal commitment Congress \nmade when it enacted the No Child Left Behind Act further strains the \nsituation and sets even more schools up for ``failure'' and more \nteachers unable to become ``highly qualified.'' The same goes for the \ncommitment that we made even earlier in our history to fund the Federal \nportion of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. It may have \nbeen many years since I led a classroom as a teacher or a school as its \nprincipal, but I remember the support that we needed to ensure that all \nof our children receive a top-notch education.\n  Everything that I have recounted here--sentiments echoed by several \nof my colleagues--leads me to conclude that I am unable to support the \npackage before us, in its current form. I urge the appropriators in \nboth bodies of Congress to improve this package so that it can be \nsomething that all of us can support.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Americans believe in fair play: the right \nfor everyone to have his say, the opportunity to get a job and make \nyour own way in the world, a fair wage for a day's work.\n  This is not just idealism--we figure we are all better off if the \nsystem we live in is open and fair.\n  That belief in fair play is the foundation of this Senate and indeed \nof our constitutional system itself.\n  My father worked hard and he taught me that fairness is our most \nfundamental value. He taught me that we always have to stand up against \nthe abuse of power at every level. Whenever someone uses their \nadvantage, be it wealth, education, size, strength, whatever it may be, \nagainst someone else, it is wrong, and it goes against everything we \nstand for, everything we are as a nation and a people.\n  Not just the process is flawed. The product of that process, the \nOmnibus appropriations bill before us today, is flawed, too. It is \nunfair.\n  That back-room, unrepresentative process has produced legislation \nthat deserves to be defeated, not just because of the way it was \ncobbled together, but because of what will happen if it becomes law.\n  Here is one result of that process: millions of men and women who \nwill lose their right to time and a half overtime pay, a cornerstone of \nour workers' rights for over half a century.\n  Both the House and the Senate, with bipartisan majorities, voted last \nyear to block new Labor Department rules that weaken overtime \nprotections. But this bill cancels out that decision, allowing those \nrules to go forward.\n  The latest news from the jobs front--that hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans have given up looking for work after we have gone through 3 \nyears of job losses--sent a shock through financial markets. It should \nworry us all.\n  Now is not the time to be cutting the pay of those Americans who have \njobs. But that is just what weakening overtime pay will do.\n  While recent economic news has been positive, there is little hope \nfor sustained, healthy economic growth without solid, good-paying jobs. \nConsumer confidence and consumer spending--the keys to our economy--\nultimately depend on Americans' confidence that they have a secure job, \na job that pays a fair wage for a fair day's work.\n  For over half a century, American workers have known what that \nmeant--a 40-hour workweek, and time and a half if you worked overtime. \nYou could count on that extra pay in exchange for the extra burden of \nworking more than 40 hours a week.\n  Many workers often have no choice about working overtime--it is up to \ntheir boss. But if they have to work those extra hours, their employer \nis required to pay them time and a half. This has been a cornerstone of \nthe social contract between labor and management, between workers and \nemployers.\n  But despite the key role of the 40-hour workweek, despite the wide-\nspread reliance on time and a half pay for work past those 40 hours, \nthis administration has proposed radical changes in the regulations \ngoverning overtime pay.\n  When I spoke here as a cosponsor of Senator Harkin's amendment here \non the floor of the Senate back in September, we heard from some \nsupporters of the rule changes that they would not decrease the number \nof workers eligible for overtime pay.\n  But if there was any doubt about the real motivation behind these \nregulations, just look at the regulations themselves. They provide \nexplicit instructions to employers on methods they could use to avoid \nincreasing the pay of employees who, we are told, will become eligible \nfor overtime pay.\n  So all of those workers we were told would benefit, who would \n``automatically'' qualify for time-and-a-half overtime pay, if their \npay is under $425 a week, could easily see not one dime of new pay.\n  Employers are coached on ways to avoid any new costs and still comply \nwith the regulations. So don't tell me this is going to add to workers \nwages--that claim is refuted in the regulations themselves.\n  And for other workers, with pay over that threshold, the regulations \nclearly threaten to take away overtime protections. They want to make \nit easier for employers to reclassify as many as eight million hourly \nworkers who now get overtime pay, to make them ineligible for overtime \npay.\n  Right now, if you are not ``white collar''--working in management, \nessentially--your boss has to pay you time and a half for all the work \nyou do over 40 hours a week. The idea is that more highly educated \nworkers, who participate in management, who have significant authority \nover the workplace, are more properly classified as salaried, not \nhourly workers. They get a fixed amount of pay, no matter how many \nhours they may put in a week.\n  Hourly workers, on the other hand, who do not manage the conditions \nunder which they work, who have less to say about how the workweek is \norganized, must be compensated if they work more than the basic 40 \nhours. That has been the definition of a fair day's work for a fair \nday's pay for more than half a century, and its basic fairness still \nmakes sense today.\n  But the administration's new regulations would make it easier--would \nactually create an incentive--for employers to classify workers who \nhave little advanced education and little or no authority, to classify \nthose workers as white collar workers.\n  Overnight, under these new regulations, millions of workers could \nlose the right to overtime pay. These rules are designed not only to \nmake it easier to reclassify workers, but to make it pay for employers \nwho do so. They will save money, since they will no longer be required \nto pay workers the time and a half rate that they are now guaranteed.\n  No change in the number of hours they could be required to do, no \nchange in their education, no change in their responsibilities--just a \nchange in the regulations in Washington, and they are out overtime pay.\n  That is one of the many reasons this legislation should be defeated, \nbut it is not the only one.\n  Right now we have a law on the books that makes sure everyone who \nbuys a gun is checked to see if they have a criminal record--or if they \nare on our terrorist watch list.\n  Those records are kept for 90 days--long enough to find out if a gun \nwas sold to a criminal or terrorist, someone who initially may have \nappeared to have no criminal record or other ``red flag'' that would \nsignal he is a bad guy.\n  Ninety-seven percent of the times that the reporting system \ndiscovered that a bad guy--a terrorist, a wife-beater, whatever--had \nmistakenly been sold--a weapon, it took more than 24 hours to figure it \nout. Destroying those records in 24 hours will destroy our chances of \ncatching bad guys.\n  The change in this legislation will mean that 97 percent of the \ncriminals or others who are mistakenly sold a weapon will go undetected \nby a system that was supposed to make us safer. Does the public know \nabout this? I don't think so. That is because of the closed-door, \nbackroom deal making that cobbled this massive bill together. This \nprovision has never previously been considered by the House or the \nSenate.\n  Bad process, bad product.\n  And that is true for what the leadership did with the issue of media \nownership.\n  Last year, the FCC decided to abandon its long-standing limitation \nthat said no company or person could own television stations reaching \nmore than\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\n35 percent of the Nation's viewing audience. The FCC raised that limit \nto 45 percent, threatening harmful consolidation among media outlets \nthat could undermine competition and diversity among broadcast voices.\n  The FCC's actions were met with consternation from all sides of the \npolitical spectrum, and both the House and Senate voted with bipartisan \nmajorities to forestall this change. But the will of the Congress was \ncast aside.\n  The leadership of the Congress--mind you, not the Members of the \nHouse and Senate--under pressure from an administration eager to take \ncare of large corporate interests, removed the 1-year restriction on \nthe FCC's changes and replaced it with a new permanent 39 percent cap.\n  The list of bad provisions goes on. When we wrote the farm bill in \nthe last Congress, with the support of both parties, we included a \nrequirement that when we shop at the grocery store, we know what \ncountry our produce and meats come from.\n  That rule--requiring labeling that indicates the country of origin--\nwas to go into effect this year. But this legislation delays that rule \nfor 2 years.\n  It rewrites the farm bill to delay that rule--something neither the \nHouse nor the Senate voted to do.\n  Since that change was put into this bill, we have now found out that \nmad cow disease made its way into our country from Canada. Not a major \ncause for alarm, but certainly a lot of folks would now want to know \nwhere their beef comes from. But it will be 2 years before they get \nthat information, if this bill passes.\n  There is one other thing that has to be mentioned here today. We have \ncome through the last 3 years, including several months of strong \neconomic growth, but we are still not creating new jobs.\n  For the first time since the Great Depression, we have gone 3 \nstraight years without creating a single new job. Not one. The \nunemployment rate has come down recently, but that is because the job \npicture is so bleak that over 300,000 people just stopped looking.\n  Long-term unemployment is a much bigger problem these days, \nespecially in our hard-hit manufacturing sector.\n  The kinds of changes we have gone through in recent years means that \nmany of those jobs just won't be coming back. Those that will come back \nwill return slowly. That leaves hundreds of thousands of Americans \nrunning out of their long-term unemployment benefits.\n  But we went out of session last fall and let the extended \nunemployment compensation program just expire, at the worst possible \ntime. And we come back today with this appropriations bill, leaving \nthat program expired and those Americans without benefits.\n  There are now 2.4 million fewer jobs overall than there were when the \nlast recession began. Every month, about 100,000 more workers exhaust \ntheir existing benefits. The most recent report of people dropping out \nof the job hunt altogether is all the proof we need that long-term \nunemployment is a key feature of this economy right now.\n  This is not the time to let the program expire, but this bill, which \ncovers so many programs and so many policies in so many parts of our \nGovernment, fails to address this problem.\n  That is unacceptable.\n  For the bad policies that are in it, and for the good policies that \nhave been dropped from it or simply ignored, I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in voting against cloture on this bill.\n  This conference report continues the administration's attempt to undo \nthe equation we put in place when I wrote the 1994 Crime Bill: more \npolice equals less crime. The conference report cuts COPS by 24 \npercent, and cuts the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program almost \nin half. These are proven programs that help local police departments \nbeef up their staffs and modernize their equipment, and the cuts \ncouldn't be coming at a worse time.\n  There is only $756 million for COPS in the conference report, a \ndrastic cut from the fiscal year 2003 level of $978 million. COPS' core \nprogram--the initiative that helps local police departments hire new \ncommunity police officers--is funded at just $120 million, a 30-percent \ncut from last year and a far cry from the late nineties when the hiring \nprogram regularly received over a billion dollars per year.\n  These cuts are shortsighted, ill-conceived, and I fear they will \nsignificantly hurt local law enforcement's ability to fight crime. In a \ntime of color-coded alerts, a rising murder rate, and an FBI \nincreasingly focused on counterterrorism and away from violent crime, \nwe are inexplicably asking the men and women of law enforcement to do \nmuch more with much less.\n  When asked to justify this approach, the administration responds that \nFederal resources for ``first responders'' are way up. Respectfully, \nthat simply is not an adequate answer, and it reflects a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the needs of local law enforcement. Defending the \nhomeland against a terrorist attack and preventing a woman from being \nraped are simply two different problems that require different \nsolutions and different sets of contributions from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I think Massachusetts Public Safety Secretary Edward Flynn is on the \nright track when he says, ``terrorism is the monster that ate criminal \njustice''.\n  We need to dedicate sufficient resources to fight international \nterrorism and local crime at the same time, but this conference report \nfalls far short in this regard.\n  I recently received a letter from the International Association of \nChiefs of Police where they express ``grave concern'' over the funding \nlevels for COPS and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant contained in \nthis conference report. In their letter, the IACP states their ``belief \nthat at this crucial time in our history, we cannot afford to reduce \nthe effectiveness of our nation's state and local law enforcement \nagencies by cutting vital federal assistance programs.''\n  The Nation's police chiefs are not alone in their concern. According \nto the U.S. Conference of Mayors:\n\n     too many families are still being ravaged by illegal drugs, \n     too many citizens and law enforcement officers are put in \n     danger due to drug and gun related crimes, and property and \n     violent crimes are still a major issue in too many \n     communities.\n\n  They also strongly oppose the cuts in this conference report.\n  The National Association of Police Organizations wrote me to say that \nthis conference report ``does not sufficiently address the needs of \nAmerica's police officers in their dual fight against terrorist threats \nand domestic crime.'' I cannot support the cuts this conference report \nproposes, and I encourage my colleagues to listen to their mayors and \npolice officers before casting their vote.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, because of time constraints, my comments \nwill be brief. I will, however, make extensive remarks about the \nomnibus bill at a later time.\n  We are nearly 4 full months into fiscal year 2004 and we are still \nwithout 7 of the 13 annual appropriations bills. For the second time in \nless than a year, we are considering a massive omnibus appropriations \nbill, with this one totaling a whopping $820 billion. Sadly, this \nconference report is loaded with over $11 billion in special interest \npork-barrel projects and legislative riders that have no business in \nthis or any other spending bill.\n  This omnibus appropriations bill has received considerable and \njustifiable criticism in the press and it should serve as an alarming \nwake up call. We are facing a $500 billion deficit. That's half of a \ntrillion dollars--the largest ever. And what do we do when faced with \nsuch a problem? We spend even more. An article in Sunday's Washington \nPost pointed out what really drives the agenda here on Capitol Hill. \nThe article states:\n\n       Today, the country still faces serious problems--oil \n     dependence, child poverty, new gaps in health care coverage, \n     deteriorating rural communities and failing public schools. \n     One doesn't have to be an advocate of big government to \n     believe Congress has a role in crafting pragmatic solutions \n     to these problems. Yet as Congress returns this week, none of \n     these issues is on the agenda. What is on the agenda? Why, \n     things Congress has always excelled in: dispensing pork \n     barrel projects and using taxpayer's money to reward \n     supportive lobbies.\n\n  Additionally, an editorial in today's Wall Street Journal states:\n\n       The bottom line is truly shocking. Passage of the omnibus \n     would raise total discretionary spending to more than $900 \n     billion in 2004. The editorial goes on to note that this \n     increase should not be blamed on the war. It states that, At \n     18.6 percent, the increase in non-defense discretionary \n     spending under the 107th Congress, 2002-2003, is far and away \n     the\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\n     biggest in decades. In 2003, total Federal spending topped an \n     inflation-adjusted $20,000 per household for the first time \n     since World War II. Let me point out just a few of the things \n     that are included in this bill: $450,000 for the Johnny \n     Appleseed Heritage Center in Ohio; $200,000 to the Rock and \n     Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, OH for the Rockin' \n     the Schools education program; $175,000 to paint a mural on a \n     flood wall in a city in Missouri; $325,000 for construction \n     of a swimming pool in Salinas, CA.\n\n  In addition to literally thousands of earmarks, this conference \nreport contains major policy changes. Some of these provisions include \nlegislative language authorizing the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands \ncrab fisheries rationalization plan, which would divide 90 percent of \nthat crab market among just a small group of processors. Fishermen \ncould only sell to those processors and only those processors would \nsell to consumers. This proposal has not been considered by the \nauthorizing committees of jurisdiction, nor requested by the \nAdministration.\n  Another legislative item included in this bill include media \nownership provisions to undo a June 2 FCC regulation. Further, language \nis included mandating that the background check approval records issued \nafter the purchase of a firearm be destroyed within 24 hours instead of \nthe current policy of 90 days. This omnibus legislation also contains \nan environmental rider meant to benefit Briggs and Stratton, a major \nmanufacturer of small engines. There is also language that redirects \n$40 million for construction of a cargo terminal at the Port of \nPhiladelphia that is designed to support high speed cargo vessels for a \nprivate venture. Today, not only do the vessels not exit, but their \ndesign is based on unproven technology.\n  We have to change the way we do business around here. Through our \nwasteful spending practices, we have succeeded in tying a millstone of \ndebt around the necks of future generations of Americans. Today, we \nhave on opportunity to make serious and substantial change in the way \nwe treat the American taxpayer. Let's rise to the challenge. Let's not \nsquander this opportunity. I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture \non this horrendous piece of legislation.\n\n\n      construction of a port of philadelphia marine cargo terminal\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee regarding the designation and use of funds from the National \nDefense Sealift Fund for the construction of a marine cargo terminal in \nthe Port of Philadelphia. These funds were previously made available \nthrough prior appropriations bills. Specifically, these funds are to be \nused to complement funds being made available by State and local \nauthorities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey for the construction of a \nnew, dedicated, state-of-the-art marine cargo terminal for use by \nFastShip, Inc., in Philadelphia.\n  These funds were originally designed to provide for vessel loan \nguarantees for the construction of high-speed vessels capable of \nproviding additional sealift capacity consistent with the existing \nvessel Title XI loan guarantee program of the Maritime Administration. \nAs part of this program, certain equipment and infrastructure items can \nalso be included in the scope of the loan guarantee that would enhance \nand facilitate the use of the vessels to be constructed. Some of the \nfunds were to be used for equipment needed to load and unload the \nvessels and for state-of-the-art information technology and container \nand terminal security at FastShip's marine cargo terminal.\n  Specifically, these funds were intended to be used to support \nguarantees for the construction in a U.S. shipyard of vessels for \nFastShip to establish a high-speed cargo service operating out of a \nnew, state-of-the-art terminal in the Port of Philadelphia. These \nvessels will now be constructed without the benefit of this loan \nguarantee program, leaving a funding shortfall for infrastructure \nimprovements. Since the amounts to be made available through the vessel \nloan guarantee program for infrastructure improvements needed to \ncomplement state and local funding for the terminal are now not \nforthcoming, the reallocation of these previously appropriated funds \nspecifically for infrastructure at the FastShip marine cargo terminal \nis consistent with, and is a replacement for, the source of funding \nthat is no longer available. The Department of Defense should direct \nthese funds through the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority to ensure \nthat these funds are made available for this purpose.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to join the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, to reinforce the importance of this program. \nThe development of high-speed sealift capacity is critical to national \nsecurity and efforts like the one you have described are key to \nattaining this important objective.\n  I would inquire of the Senator if my understanding of the use of \nthese funds is correct and that the reallocation of these previously \nappropriated funds specifically for infrastructure at the FastShip \nmarine cargo terminal is to be directed through the Philadelphia \nRegional Port Authority to ensure that these funds are made available \nfor this purpose.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for his inquiry and would respond \nthat his understanding is correct. Further, I thank my distinguished \ncolleague for his support of this important project for the Port of \nPhiladelphia and indeed for the development of enhanced sealift \ncapability that will provide the necessary support for our service \npersonnel who serve our country overseas.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, thank you for the clarification \nregarding the purpose and use of these funds for a state-of-the-art \nmarine cargo terminal in Philadelphia. I reiterate, this is an \nimportant project not only for the economic activity that will be \ngenerated for the Port of Philadelphia but also for the advancements in \nfast sealift in support of our national security interests.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am voting to help Washington \nState restart our economy, create new jobs, and invest in our future by \nvoting to move this Omnibus appropriations bill forward.\n  I am deeply angry that the White House and the Congressional Majority \nare trying to use this must-pass bill to sneak through some atrocious \npolicies that the Senate has already rejected, but I know that this \nbill is not the last word.\n  Since the first days of this administration, I have fought attempts \nto threaten workers, undermine our environment and weaken consumer \nprotections, and I'm not going to stop now.\n  While I continue my fight against the bad things that are in this \nbill, I will not let my State lose out on the many good things I worked \nto include. In fact, my experiences over the past few weeks have shown \nme just how big a difference these investments will make throughout my \nState.\n  I have spent the past month meeting with people in every corner of \nWashington--from teachers and students in Pasco, to farmers in the \nSkagit Valley, veterans in North Central Washington, and seniors in \nAberdeen and Ballard. I sat down with the people who grow our produce, \nrun our ports and operate our public utility districts. Together we \ncelebrated our victory in landing the Boeing 7E7 and in opening new \ncenters for research and tourism.\n  No matter where I went or with whom I met, one thing was clear. In \nevery corner of Washington, neighbors are coming together to create \njobs, rebuild our economy and create a better future. They are working \nto help our children, assist our seniors, and support our veterans and \nmilitary families. They are working hard to turn things around, and \nthey need the investments this bill will make in our schools, our \ninfrastructure, our economy, and our people.\n  Washington State is talking about moving forward. We have been hit \nhard by the recession and lost 75,000 jobs over the last 3 years, but \nwe are making progress. We had some great news in December when Boeing \ndecided that Washington workers would build the 7E7, the next \ngeneration airliner. We are moving forward on transportation \ninvestments that will create jobs and improve our productivity, economy \nand quality of life. And we're moving forward with new growth \nindustries from biotechnology to wine.\n  All across my State, I heard the message loud and clear. \nWashingtonians want to get our economy moving again and create new \njobs. They're concerned about our men and women serving in\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\nthe Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and throughout the world, and \nwant to make sure we provide for our veterans and military families. \nSo, as we begin the second session of the 108th Congress, I'm working \nhere in the Senate to help us move forward, and it starts with our \neconomy.\n  I am not satisfied with the economy and particularly job creation in \nmy State. I am disappointed that this administration's economic policy \ncreated just 1,000 jobs in the month of December while hundreds of \nthousands of unemployed workers abandoned job searches altogether.\n  I am outraged that the majority in Congress and the administration \nallowed 85,000 unemployed workers, including 7,500 in Washington State, \nto lose unemployment compensation just before the holidays. Over the \nnext few weeks, an additional 37,000 unemployed workers in Washington \nState will lose their extended unemployment benefits.\n  I am not satisfied with the Omnibus Appropriations measure now before \nthe Senate. The fiscal year started more than 3 months ago, and we \nstill haven't finished the important business of passing appropriations \nbills to fund some of the most important functions of our Government.\n  We are unanimous in support of our troops fighting the war on \nterrorism, yet we haven't passed the VA-HUD bill with its critical \nincrease in funding for veterans' health care.\n  The President travels the country celebrating the second anniversary \nof the No Child Left Behind legislation, but the funding we fought so \nhard to secure is still not at work on behalf of our kids. The money \ncontained in this bill is not nearly enough to allow schools to make \nthe reforms needed for our students to succeed.\n  Important transportation projects are stuck in neutral--jeopardizing \ntheir ability to move forward and create construction jobs now and to \nsupport long-term economic recovery. We should be talking about \nreauthorizing the 6-year highway bill rather than finally approving the \nlong overdue funding measure for one fiscal year.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am outraged that the \nhard work of the committee has been delayed and compromised by the \nMajority and the administration who are jamming Senators to force \nthrough bad policies.\n  I want to commend Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd for their hard \nwork to pass the appropriations bill. We are here to debate an omnibus \nappropriations bill that the Appropriations Committee worked so hard to \navoid.\n  I understand why many of my Democratic colleagues have chosen to \noppose this bill. I share their anger at the administration's role in \nthis process and our Republican colleagues' willingness to abandon \nissues like overtime protections that they voted for right here on the \nSenate floor. I seriously considered voting against this measure.\n  But I am a realist, and I am passionate about the needs of Washington \nState. People need jobs, transportation improvements need to move \nforward, veterans need health care, our students need support, and that \nis what I am voting for today.\n  As awful as some of the administration-backed provisions in this bill \nare, defeating the Omnibus appropriations bill will put our economy, \nour schools and our health care system at even greater risk.\n  It is a horrible choice the majority is forcing us to make. But \ntoday, I am voting for the jobs, security and growth that this bill \nwill bring to the people of Washington State. I will vote for cloture \nand final passage of the Omnibus because I know my State needs the \ninvestments in this bill, and I do not want to deny or delay important \nFederal assistance to my State.\n  Before I close, I want to talk about some of the harmful and hurtful \nprovisions that Republicans have inserted into this bill--particularly \nthose targeting workers and consumers.\n  The only reason they attached them to this must-pass bill is because \nthey know these horrible policies cannot stand on their own. In fact, \nwith my support the Senate has defeated the administration's plans to \nerode overtime pay for workers and to increase media concentration. And \nwe led the fight in the last Farm Bill to give consumers important \ncountry of origin information about our food supply. Despite the \nRepublicans' maneuvers, this bill is not the last word on these \npolicies. The fight is not over.\n  I am particularly outraged that the administration and the Republican \nleadership ignored the will of the majority of Members in both Chambers \nby removing the Harkin overtime amendment from the Labor/HHS \nAppropriations bill.\n  The Harkin amendment would have protected hard-working Americans who \nrely on overtime pay, like our first responders--our police, \nfirefighters and nurses. One international police association estimates \nthat 200,000 midlevel police officers will lose about $150 million in \novertime pay if the new draft overtime regulations are implemented. The \nBush administration will also prevent more than 230,000 licensed \npractical nurses from getting overtime pay.\n  According to the Economic Policy Institute, the Bush overtime rule \nwill mean a pay cut for up to 10 million working Americans.\n  Even more astounding, the Bush administration had the gall to \nactually give employers detailed suggestions on how they could cut \nworkers' pay. To me it is unbelievable that our Government would \nproactively look for ways to hurt American workers.\n  These families are working hard, they are playing by the rules, they \nare trying to make ends meet, but the Bush administration and the \nRepublican majority in this Congress are squeezing them once again.\n  Apparently, it wasn't enough for this administration to preside over \na dramatic loss of manufacturing jobs. It wasn't enough for this \nadministration to let out-of-work Americans lose their unemployment \nbenefits before the holidays. Now this White House is attacking the \ntake-home pay of those Americans who are lucky enough to even have \njobs. It's appalling, it's wrong, and I'm going to keep fighting this \nadministration's attacks on working families.\n  I am deeply disappointed that this bill diverts taxpayer dollars away \nfrom struggling public schools and spends them on a vouchers scheme in \nthe District of Columbia. I will continue my fight against vouchers and \nmy efforts to give our public schools the resources our students need.\n  In the end, I am confident that we will win because these awful \nRepublican policies cannot stand up to public scrutiny. We will have \nmore votes on the overtime issue. We will have more votes on the \ncountry of origin labeling and important food safety issues, and we \nwill have more votes on vouchers and media concentration.\n  I vote for this bill today because of the many programs funded in \nthis Omnibus bill.\n  Throughout my State, people are working hard to get our economy \nmoving, and I am voting for this bill to give them the Federal support \nthey deserve.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to cloture \non the Omnibus appropriations bill. I cannot fathom why the Senate \nwould agree today to cut off debate on a measure that is fundamentally \nflawed precisely because it was put together without the input of the \nfull House and Senate. We have before us a bill that allocates billions \nof dollars through a plan clabbered together behind closed doors by the \nWhite House a very few Republican Members. It was a partisan, \nundemocratic process and the result is a bill that both thwarts the \nwill of our constituents and makes a mockery of Congress's obligation \nto control this Nation's purse strings.\n  A vote for cloture today is a vote to rubberstamp the \nadministration's wish list of policies and spending they couldn't get \npassed through the regular legislative process. And when you take a \ngood look at what is in this bill--or what was forced out by the White \nHouse--you can understand why they had to put it together in a back \nroom and why they want to push it through the Senate with little \nopportunity for debate.\n  The issues of concern in this massive bill are numerous--let me just \nhighlight a few of the worst.\n  This Omnibus bill drops a provision to block a change in the rules \nthat determine which workers are eligible for overtime pay. Both the \nHouse and the Senate voted in favor of maintaining the current rules. \nBoth Houses agreed on a policy that would protect overtime for millions \nof working families--\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\nbut White House insisted on going ahead with their changes regardless \nof the bipartisan will of Congress.\n  Overtime is crucial to helping families make ends meet. In an economy \nthat has lost 3 million jobs, those that have managed to hold onto \ntheir livelihood need the extra money that overtime provides more than \never. On average, workers who receive overtime receive almost 25 \npercent of their pay that way. And the President pushed for, and won, a \npolicy of cutting that vital income for 8 million workers. Lowering \nwages for working people is not the way to stimulate this economy. \nSending as many as 8 million people home with less money in their \npocket is not going to spur investment and boost productivity.\n  And while the backroom negotiators chose to ignore the needs and \nconcerns of workers with their overtime policy, they turned their backs \non countless more consumers when they scuttled the country-of-origin \nlabeling provisions passed by the Senate. If one thing comes through \nloud and clear from the BSE/mad cow experience, it's that consumers \nwant basic information about the food they eat. To deny them such \ninformation takes from them a fundamental right to make decisions about \ntheir purchases, and their families' health.\n  I had hoped that we might discuss country-of-origin labeling--along \nwith several other issues--during the conference on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill. Unfortunately, the conference didn't work that \nway. Rather than bridge the difference between the House and the Senate \non labeling, the conference went behind closed doors and chose another \ndirection entirely. It dismissed the Senate resolution in support of \nlabeling, then went on to embrace and even expand on the House's ill-\nadvised rider. The result, a public kept in the dark by the Government \nabout where and how the food they eat is made.\n  The Omnibus also inappropriately compromises what Congress enacted \nregarding broadcast ownership rules. Both the House and Senate passed \nmeasures that would have reimposed the 35 percent national TV ownership \ncap, undoing a misguided FCC regulation that raised the cap to 45 \npercent. However, a deal with White House negotiators flouts \nCongressional intent and instead establishes a 39 percent limit--which \nseems less like a compromise and more like a favor to certain networks \nthat currently own close to 39 percent of the Nation's broadcast \nstations.\n  Overtime pay, FCC rules, country-of-origin labeling--all policies \ninserted into this bill by the administration and against the will of \nCongress and numerous constituencies we were sent here to represent. \nBeyond these glaring flaws, there are many--too many--funding and \npolicy decisions that are just plain wrong--and need further debate, \nfurther votes, further negotiation.\n  One obvious example is the administration's decision to slash funding \nfor the Manufacturing Extension Partnership to a fraction of its past \nlevel. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership is one of the most \nsuccessful Federal/State partnerships in Government. This program \ntargets small and medium sized manufacturing firms, boosting \nproductivity and increasing competitiveness as these firms face \nincreasing pressure from global markets. The manufacturing sector has \nsuffered devastating job losses during this past term, and the recent \nupturn in the economy left the manufacturing sector lagging far behind \nthe rest of the country. MEP is a sound investment: MEP clients \nreported sales of $2.2 billion, nearly 24,500 new or retained workers \nduring fiscal year 2001.\n  Manufacturing is vital to building a strong economy, creating good \njobs that contribute to a better standard of living for American \nfamilies and a critical rung on the ladder of opportunity for those \nworking toward a better life. The MEP has a proven record of preserving \njobs and stimulating productivity in those firms utilizing MEP \nservices. This vital program will be unable to maintain its public \nmission to serve small manufacturers without adequate Federal support. \nMEP has enjoyed wide bipartisan support due to the effectiveness of its \nprograms and fine record of achievement, and failure to adequately fund \nthis program is a disservice to our struggling manufacturing industry.\n  I am also very disappointed that this bill includes inadequate \nfunding for education. When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we \nmade a deal with our State and local partners in education. We insisted \non real reform and accountability for results from States, school \ndistricts and teachers. And we authorized large increases in Federal \nfunding to help them succeed. This was a bipartisan bargain that \nacknowledged that reform and resources must go hand in hand if we \nexpect our Nation's public schools to improve.\n  But once again the appropriations bill before us falls far short of \nCongress' commitment. It is $8 billion short of the authorized funding \nlevels in No Child Left Behind. It provides only $12.4 billion for \ntitle I, which serves disadvantaged, low-income students and was \nauthorized at $18.5 billion for fiscal year 2004. It provides only \nlevel funding for afterschool programs, which give students a safe and \neducational place to go during afterschool hours. The list goes on and \non; this bill provides inadequate or reduced funding for many other \nprograms under No Child Left Behind, leaving our schools--which are \nalready struggling with budget shortfalls at the State and local \nlevel--with even greater challenges. In addition, while this bill \nprovides an increase for Special Education, it is far short of meeting \nthe Federal Government's promise to fund 40 percent of the costs.\n  This bill also shortchanges our most vulnerable youth by inadequately \nfunding juvenile justice programs for the second straight year. The \ntitle V At-Risk Children's Program, which provides juvenile crime \nprevention funding to local communities, will only net $25 million in \nthis bill--this program should be funded about three or four times that \namount. Overall, juvenile justice funding will receive more than $100 \nmillion less in fiscal year 2004 than last year. This is unacceptable \nand we must do better.\n  If we are serious about our youth in this country, this bill \ncertainly doesn't show it. We need to make their education and their \nwell-being a top priority. Instead this bill cuts corners.\n  We can and should do better than this. We have done better than this \nin the bills and policies we put together on a bipartisan basis last \nyear. I cannot support this bill or any motion to speed its passage. \nNot when it--against the will of Congress--steals necessary overtime \nincome from over 8 million workers. Not when it--against the advice of \nthe Senate--trashes a program that lets consumers make informed \ndecision about the safety of the food they eat. Not when it overturns \nthe clear decision of Congress to limit concentration in the media \nindustry. Not when it violates common sense, common decency and the \ncommon good by slashing funding for programs that educate our children \nand nurture our manufacturing industries. I will vote against cloture \ntoday and against the bill if it comes to a vote. I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a specific provision \nin the Omnibus Appropriations bill. The bill before the Senate includes \na 2-year delay in the implementation of country of origin labeling for \nall products except fish. I am highly frustrated with this delay \nbecause the conference committee went beyond the scope of its \nconference. The House bill only had a 1-year delay for implementation \nof country of origin labeling for meat and meat products. The Senate \nbill included an amendment indicating the strong support that country \nof origin labeling had in the Senate. The discovery of bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy, BSE, within our borders this holiday season \nwas a wake-up call to the urgency of country of origin labeling \nimplementation and the detriments of further delays.\n  After the announcement of a ``presumptive positive'' BSE cow in the \nU.S. domestic herd, the national and international response was \nimmediate. Domestic markets plunged and our international trading \npartners slammed their doors shut to our meat products. Exports account \nfor almost 10 percent of total U.S. beef production. Our largest export \nmarkets are refusing our product and bloating the domestic market. \nWe've already lost a majority of our export market, a void that other \nbeef exporting countries are\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\neager to fill. Unless we act now to restore the confidence of those \nmarkets, the relationships we have built for many years will be lost \nfor good. In this situation, our trading partners need to be reassured \nthat meat they purchase is ``born, raised, and slaughtered'' in the \nU.S. American consumers deserve this assurance, too. Country of origin \nlabeling does this.\n  We have already paid for this lack of country of origin labeling. \nExhaustive traceback and research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nhas shown that the cow infected with BSE was imported from Canada. The \nrules that govern whether a country maintains ``BSE Free'' status are \nfound in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of 2003 generated by the \nOffice of International Epizootics, OIE. The code say that a country \ncan maintain its BSE-free status despite the discovery of a diseased \nanimal if the animal was imported and all progency--calves--of the \ndiseased animal are disposed of. With country or origin labeling in \nplace, the United States could have begun the fight for ``BSE-free'' \nstatus immediately. Instead, we were forced to wait weeks until it was \nconfirmed beyond doubt that the diseased cow was born Canada.\n  I understand that some people say that we don't need to have country \nof origin labeling with the USDA is already pursing a national animal \nidentification program. This is simply not the case. A national ID \nprogram will be useful for health safety reasons. It will help pinpoint \nand track the spread of disease, but this informatin will not be passed \non to the consumer. Tracking disease is not the only concern. \nRebuilding consumer confidence should also be a high priority, and the \nonly consumer-focused program is country of origin labeling.\n  Clearly, the answer to bolstering consumer confidence is country of \norigin labeling. We would do a great disservice to American consumers \nif the Senate suppressed country of origin labeling when the need for \nlabeling is heightened.\n  The regulations for country of origin labeling were intended to be \ncompleted and implemented this year. I urge my colleagues to take the \nnecessary steps to make sure this is the case. Now more than ever, we \nmust stabilize the confidence of our consumers and let them enjoy the \nprivilege of knowing that they are eating from the safest food supply \nin the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The remaining time is \ncontrolled by the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to my friends, I have no request \nfor time, and there are 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have no more requests for time. So for 5 \nminutes, I suggest the Senate be in a quorum call.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will notify the two leaders. They still have reserved \ntime, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Until 10 till.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum with the time coming \nout of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to comment on \nthe pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are all eager to hear the President's \nagenda for the year. Before we move on, the Senate has some unfinished \nbusiness from last year. This time last year Republicans promised a \nsmooth appropriations process. In fact, it broke down to an \nunprecedented degree. It didn't have to be this way. Chairman Stevens \nand Senator Byrd steered this process in an open, bipartisan fashion. \nWorking together, they produced 12 appropriations bills that passed \nwith broad, bipartisan support. As the majority leader noted this \nmorning, we owe both of them a debt of thanks.\n  I am confident, had they been able to conclude the process they \nbegan, this debate would not have been needed. But because of the \nhubris of the White House and House Republican leadership, \nbipartisanship ended at the door to the conference negotiations. Hidden \nfrom the light of day, the White House hijacked the appropriations \nprocess, excluded Democrats, and wrote a bill to satisfy little more \nthan special interest wish lists.\n  Today we are already 4 months into the fiscal year. We cannot undo \nthe entire process, nor do we seek to. Democrats are united in our \nsupport for the vast majority of what is contained in this bill. But we \nshould fix this bill before we finish it.\n  We want to give the majority a few days to work with the \nadministration and the House to fix the most egregious provisions in \nthis bill, provisions that have already been rejected by both Houses of \nCongress and bipartisan majorities. I have discussed our plans with \nChairman Stevens and the majority leader, and I believe they understand \nthat we have no intention to block this bill. There is no reason to \nconsider a full year continuing resolution and absolutely no risk of \nany interruption to the operation of the Government. The existing CR \ndoes not expire until January 31.\n  We could fix this bill with a simple correcting resolution and pass \nthe Omnibus bill with broad, bipartisan support this very day. If we \nfail to do so today, all we ask is a few days to reconsider their \nactions. In doing so, we hope to salvage this process and begin this \nyear on a note of bipartisanship, openness, and cooperation.\n  Three provisions demand particular attention.\n  American ranchers and farmers meet the highest safety standards in \nthe world. But the discovery of mad cow disease in one imported \nCanadian cow has cast an unfair shadow of uncertainty over the American \nfood industry.\n  There is a simple fix--implement the country of origin labeling law \nCongress has already passed.\n  This rule would put a ``100% American Beef'' sticker only on meat \nthat was born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States.\n  Consumers want and deserve the right to make informed choices. In a \nrecent poll, 85 percent said they would be more likely to buy food if \nit's American.\n  At a time when the rural community is struggling, the economic \nbenefit of COOL to farmers and ranchers could be pivotal. That is why \nCOOL is supported by 167 farm organizations representing 50 million \nAmericans.\n  The Senate passed rule on two occasions with strong bipartisan \nsupport, in May 2002 as part of the farm bill, as well as in November.\n  It is time to enforce the will of the Senate and respond to the \nwishes of the American people.\n  The second issue is overtime. This bill would allow the White House \nto end overtime protection for American workers. This plan has already \nbeen rejected by the Senate by 54-45 and the House 221-203.\n  There is a simple reason why: It is bad for working families, bad for \nthe economy. It would deliver a pay cut to 8 million workers, including \nemergency medical personnel, criminal investigators, nurses, physician \nassistants, teachers, agriculture inspectors, and more. Overtime pay \naccounts for nearly a quarter of take-home pay. For millions of \nfamilies, it represents college savings, down payment for a house, \nmedical bills.\n  At a time when manufacturing jobs continue to be shipped overseas and \nfamilies are anxious about their finances, it would be cruel to end \nthis vital protection that workers have depended upon for 70 years.\n  Finally, as to media ownership, when a few companies control the vast \nmajority of media outlets in our country, our national discourse \nsuffers and the vitality of our democracy is undermined.\n  There has been broad bipartisan support for maintaining limits. Last \nyear, these limits won wide majorities in both the House and the \nSenate.\n  After first agreeing to retain language passed by the House and \nSenate to limit the number of stations a network can own, conferees \nbowed to White House pressure and included language that helps media \nconglomerates consolidate control over the airwaves.\n  This is special interest giveaway that directly harms the national \ninterest, and it should be stopped.\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\n  There is more in this bill that could be improved. Provisions hidden \nwithin this 1,200 page bill would also threaten the education of \nWashington D.C. children through an untested vouchers scheme, undermine \ngun enforcement laws and allow more dangerous criminals to get their \nhands on guns, and contract out Federal jobs in key areas of \ngovernment, leaving both Federal workers and citizens less safe and \nsecure.\n  There are many more shortcomings. My colleagues could certainly point \nto other issues that deserve attention.\n  The Senate should not look the other way while a small minority \noverrides the will of the majority merely in order to reward one \nspecial interest after another.\n  We ask just a few days to improve this legislation. Let us fix this \nbill before we finish it. A few extra days of debate could prevent this \nbill from causing enduring damage to the Senate, our government, and \nour Nation.\n  Last year, with the White House and House Republican leadership at \nthe controls, the appropriations process jumped the tracks. We have a \nchance to set things right and establish a tone of bipartisanship and \ncooperation for the coming year. I urge the Senate to make the most of \nthis opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on leader time, I would like to make some \nclosing statements on the importance of this bill, especially in light \nof the fact that although we have had 57 days for people to study the \nparticular bill and what is in this bill, I want to put in a larger \nperspective why it is important to vote for cloture today and for us to \nbring to closure the unfinished business from several months ago so we \ncan move ahead with the Nation's business this year.\n  I think first and foremost, every Senator has a real stake in passage \nof this legislation. Indeed, not just every Senator but the country has \na stake in passage of this legislation. If we don't invoke cloture and \nsubsequently pass this legislation, we will be shortchanging our \ndiligent efforts and dedicated efforts in the fight against terrorism. \nWe will be weakening funding for our food security and for our food \nsafety system. We will be directly impacting in this vote millions of \nveterans. Those people who suffer from HIV/AIDS all over the world--our \nvote both today and subsequently for or against this appropriations \npackage will affect them, whether it is in the prevention phase or in \nthe treatment phase of HIV/AIDS. If we don't vote for cloture, if we \ndon't vote for passage of this Omnibus bill--this collection of seven \nbills that addresses so many of the needs--we will be shortchanging the \nneeds of schools in terms of Pell grants and in terms of Head Start. We \nwill be shortchanging the lives of millions of Americans.\n  Many people have argued for a lot more spending in these bills, and \nmany people have argued for a lot less spending. Whatever the merits of \nthese arguments, again the whole process is a part of negotiations and, \nyes, compromise with the Senate, within the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the administration. But this is the product before \nus. Whatever the merits of those arguments for spending more or \nspending less, it is important that everyone understand the bill does \nabide by those spending limits that were agreed on between Congress and \nthe executive branch, once you include the two emergency supplemental \nbills enacted last year, the ones enacted for the conflict in Iraq.\n  The appropriations spending authority will increase slightly--barely \nover 3 percent from 2003-2004--once this bill is enacted.\n  I spelled out briefly this morning the alternative to the bill. It is \nimportant for people to understand the alternative to passing this \nOmnibus appropriations bill. No Senator should be under any illusion, \nespecially with regard to the fact that we are already one-quarter of \nthe way through the fiscal year. One-quarter of it has already been \ncompleted. The alternative to a defeat of this appropriations package--\nthis Omnibus package--is a full year of continuing resolution for the \nseven remaining appropriations bills.\n  I have to remind Senators because it has been a while since we have \ncome back on the floor, and we haven't spent all day today going \nthrough all of the programs and what is in this bill in terms of \neducation, title I, and special education programs, if we don't pass \nthis package, will be cut by $2 billion. The National Institutes of \nHealth, if we don't pass this bill, would be cut by $1 billion. \nVeterans health care--the health care for our veterans--would be \nreduced by $3.1 billion if we don't pass this bill; highway funding by \n$2.2 billion.\n\n  I mentioned global HIV/AIDS funding--people right now who are looking \nto America for that leadership--which would be reduced by nearly $1 \nbillion.\n  States would not receive the $1.5 billion for the Help America Vote \nAct so we can increase funding for our election system.\n  The FBI's domestic terrorism fight would be curtailed by over $400 \nmillion.\n  AmeriCorps would not be fully funded at the $313 million level in \nthis bill.\n  Agencies within the Department of Agriculture charged with animal \nhealth and food security would be reduced by $80 million.\n  I just close by showing this chart. I know it can't be read clearly \nby my colleagues. Here you see scores and scores of organizations that \nhave let us know over the last 48 hours of their strong support for \nthis Omnibus bill. Again, I will not go through the list, but in the \nlist you will find everything from the Public Lands Council, to the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, to the Disabled American \nVeterans, who say let's pass this bill, and let's pass this bill now. \nYou see the Alzheimers Foundation, the American Foundation for AIDS \nResearch, and you see the National Association for Biomedical Research. \nYou see the International Association of Bridge, Structural, \nIncremental and Reinforcing Iron Works--again, scores of organizations \nthat say pass this bill now.\n  What we all know is there is no perfect bill on this floor. All bills \ncome as a product of compromise. That is a requirement of the \nlegislative process.\n  It is now time to invoke cloture, to pass this bill, and to move on. \nI urge Senators to vote for cloture now--to vote for this bill and give \nchildren, veterans, schools, States, and needy Americans what they \ndeserve.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Roth, Jr. was elected to the House of \n     Representatives in 1966, and served the State of Delaware \n     with distinction until his election to the United States \n     Senate in 1970;\n       Whereas William V.

Roth, Jr.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. I thank the clerk for reading the \nresolution in its entirety.\n  Mr. President, my friend, our colleague, Bill Roth, died while the \nSenate was out of session. Otherwise, I am certain there would have \nbeen a profuse outpouring of sentiment on the floor, as when any person \nof consequence dies.\n  Bill Roth was a man of the Senate and a man of consequence. He was \nalso, even though we were on opposite sides of the aisle, one of my \nclosest friends in the Senate. We had the honor, as my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Carper, and I do, of riding Amtrak together. In \nBill's case and my case, we rode the train together almost every day \nfor 28 years. Literally, for the first 24 years probably every day the \nSenate was in session.\n  You can't have that kind of proximity with a man or a woman without \ngetting to know them pretty darn well. I got to know Bill very well. I \ngot to know his family. I got to know his hopes, his dreams, his fears, \nand his concerns, as he did mine, my family, my hopes, dreams, and \nconcerns.\n  An unusual thing developed: a bond of trust. I can and will say for \nthe record that there is no person in public life I came to trust more \nthan Bill Roth. I trusted him with my concerns. I trusted him with \nfamily issues. I trusted him with personal issues. And I trusted his \njudgment on political issues, even when he and I disagreed.\n  We would ask each other questions: What do you think would happen if \nI do the following? What do you think the consequence would be? Even \nthough we were in opposing parties, neither hesitated to give our \nfriend the best advice we could.\n  I once said that running against Bill Roth was like running against a \nwheat thrasher: big, gobbles up everything in his way, and he was very \nsilent. Before it was all over, everything was harvested.\n  Bill Roth, I think, was the most underestimated man with whom I have \nserved going into my sixth term as a Senator.\n  I might note for the record that Bill Roth's family is incredibly \ntalented. His wife, Jane Roth, is one step away from the Supreme Court \nas a Third Circuit Court of Appeals judge. None of us\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\nwho know her ever hesitated to support her. We pushed her. She is \nhighly regarded and, as my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, \nknows--and no one knows the Third Circuit better than he does; \nliterally no one knows it better than he does--is one of the most \nrespected jurists on that venerable circuit.\n  His son, Bud, is a lawyer who is an extremely talented young man, and \nhis daughter, Katie, is a doctor. I might note that Bill finally had a \nnamesake. Just shortly before he died, he got to see his daughter's son \nwho they named William. Bill actually died here in Washington visiting \nKatie.\n  This is a man who lived a full life, raised a great family, and will \nbe missed not just by his family, but by our entire State and all those \nwho knew Bill.\n  I can say without equivocation that I would have been honored, quite \nfrankly, to have any one of his senior staff members work on my staff. \nOne of the ways I think you measure the mark of a national leader is to \nlook at the people with whom he or she surrounds himself or herself. \nLook at the people who they pick to represent them. Look at the people \nwho they choose to be their alter ego.\n  Without exception, Bill Roth chose administrative assistants and \nsenior staff members out of the same mold as himself: always totally \nhonorable, balanced, straightforward, not at all ideological.\n  I have close friendships, personal friendships, with Bill's former \nstaff directors, people who still live in Delaware and, I might add--I \ndon't want to ruin their reputations--support me politically, support \nme in my races. It is hard, as I said, in a State as small as ours--I \nsee my friend from Utah, which has grown to be a very large State \nrelative to us, but when I first arrived here, when his dad was here, \nwith whom I served, I think we were a little bit bigger than Utah at \nthe time.\n  In small States, everyone knows everyone. Everyone has a sense of who \neveryone else is. It is hard in a State as small as ours, when you are \nin close proximity to people you respect, not to let it show, and that \nis exactly what happened in Delaware.\n  We went through 28 years of serving together, and I cannot think of \none single solitary time--not one single occasion--where Bill Roth had \nor I ever had even a negative inference asserted about the other guy. \nWe have a tradition in Delaware of not being very negative and \npartisan. I can tell you with the single exception of one highly \ncontested political race, you never heard Tom Carper, you never heard \nour sole Congressman and former Governor, Mike Castle, you never heard \nin my State any of us criticizing the other. It has been a wonderful \nState to represent.\n  Bill Roth set the pattern. He surrounded himself with people of \ncharacter such as himself, and that is something that should be strived \nfor.\n  Bill, as I said, was known on the Senate floor, known in the country \nlike few of us will be for the Fulbright scholarships, for the Roth \nIRAs. Everybody knows that Bill Roth was a man who promoted savings. He \nwas a man who was tight with the taxpayers' money, which is a great \nasset. We used to kid. Every once in a while we would go to a function \nhere in Washington and we would take a cab together. I remember once \nBill leaning in to talk to the cab driver.\n  I said: What are you doing?\n  He said: I gave him a dime tip and told him to vote Democrat.\n  He also had a sense of humor, which most people on the floor never \ngot a chance to see.\n  I don't know anybody who worked with Bill Roth who ever suggested \nthat you could not work with Bill Roth; that he would not weigh in.\n  One of the things I want to mention about Senator Roth, though--and I \nam trying to move through this in the interests of time because I know \nwe have the State of the Union and I know matters are going to be \nbrought up today--is that one of the hallmarks of his career is he had \na real sense of proportion, a sense of proportion that is missing today \nin much of public life. He fully understood that the Federal Government \nwas both dangerous and necessary, that it is of value and sometimes \npart of the problem. He never had any trouble distinguishing between \nwhen it should be proactive and when it should not be active at all. He \nwas not driven by ideology that blinded him to the needs of the people \nof my State, the Nation, or blinded him to civil liberties and civil \nrights.\n  He used to always surprise many of my Democratic colleagues because \nBill was always so conservative on tax policy. I hope I don't get my \nfriend from Utah in trouble, but one of the things about him is he is a \nman of independence. I think it surprised some of my colleagues when he \nvoted against the constitutional amendment on the flag.\n  They said: Wait a minute, this guy is a conservative. It is because \nhe is a conservative, I might add, that he did vote against it. But it \nwould always surprise my colleagues on the Democratic caucus. They \nwould say: Wait a minute, Bill Roth is a strong proponent of Title IX. \nThat is the title that says you have to spread a proportionate amount \nof money on women in sports and colleges and universities. Bill Roth \nwas very strong on women's rights.\n  To the chagrin of his colleagues and some of mine, he is in large \npart a reason there is no drilling in ANWR. Bill Roth is a Republican \nleader of the effort to see there was no drilling in ANWR. We have the \nTongass Forest in Alaska, which is multiple times the size of my State, \nbecause of Bill Roth. Bill Roth had an environmental record that could \neasily have been associated with a liberal Democrat. Bill Roth's views \non women's rights, civil rights, was moderate to liberal.\n  It always used to surprise people on this side of the aisle when they \nwould say, whoa, was that Bill Roth who just voted on this, that, or \nthe other thing?\n  Bill Roth was a complex man, a man who could not be pigeonholed or \ncharacterized by a single label. But he was ultimately a practical guy, \na man who knew what he thought, what he believed, and very quietly and \nunhesitatingly never, never ceased or backed off from what he thought \nwas a right thing to do.\n  On a personal note, like all of you in these cynical times--I would \nlike you all to know that Bill Roth was anything but cynical. Bill Roth \nwas not only an honorable man, Bill Roth was a noble man. The word \n``nobility'' comes to mind, to me. When I learned of his death--and I \nwas caught off guard as I was asked by the press about it--the first \nthing that came to mind was: He's a noble man. He's a noble man.\n  Let me explain what I mean by that. It is the way he dealt with \npeople. It is the way he acted. Name someone for me in contemporary \npolitics who was a winner of the Bronze Star and never once mentioned \nit. You cannot find a single piece of campaign literature that I am \naware of. I never heard him speak of it. I never heard his campaign use \nit. Who, today, would not be out there talking about having been the \nrecipient of a Bronze Star--to prove their patriotism, to prove their \nbravery? Bill Roth never, never mentioned it.\n\n  This is a politician who was not afraid to use gimmicks. This is a \nguy who rode an elephant to make a point, out here in front of the \nCapitol. This is a guy who talked about the $3,000 toilet seats and \nwould hoist up toilet seats. He was a bit of a showman in that regard. \nBut when it came to talking about himself, Bill Roth never did. He had \nthis sense of nobility about him.\n  The other thing I loved about Bill Roth, in an environment where--I \nguess it has always been this case in politics--where money is king, \ncampaigns cost so much money--Bill Roth was the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. Bill Roth could have raised more money than the Lord \nAlmighty. But he always used to drive his chiefs of staff crazy when he \nwouldn't do what other people legally would do. He wouldn't call in the \nheads of the corporation and the business community and others who had \ngreat interest in what went on before the Finance Committee. He \nwouldn't do it. Bill Roth had trouble raising money. He was \nuncomfortable. I loved him for it. I loved the fact that he was \nuncomfortable doing it.\n  The other thing that used to drive me crazy sometimes, to show you \nhow he was, I remember we had a little fight on the floor here about a \nthing most people don't know much about but in Delaware it is a big \nticket item financially for the State--escheatment. Escheatment means \nwhen somebody dies and leaves no heir and owns a security, under the \nrules that exist now,\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\nthat money reverts to the State of incorporation.\n  So let's say you owned 1,000 shares of stock of General Motors and \nyou passed away, you had no heirs, the estate was left--the State gets \nthe estate. But which State gets it? Historically it has been the State \nwhere you are incorporated. So if General Motors is incorporated in \nDelaware, even though its business is in Michigan, the money goes to \nDelaware. That is a big amount in their budget.\n  There was a suit filed in the Supreme Court but the Supreme Court \nsaid, no, it is OK to do it that way, but it is up to the Congress to \nchange it if they wanted to.\n  Mr. President, 78 Senators said let's change that, and 370-some \nCongressmen said let's change that. I didn't think it was a good idea \nto change it. I have a simple rule. I say it straightforward. I think I \nnever take personally the competition for highway funds or bridges or \nprograms. We all compete, each of our States, for that. I take it very \npersonally when my colleague or a colleague in the Senate decides to \ntake an action that would benefit his State only marginally, but would \ndo great damage to my State. I take that very personally.\n  Changing law on escheatment would have been marginally beneficial to \n47 other States but a gigantic detriment to my State. So I went to \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan; New York was affected by this. I went to my \nfriend, my friend who is no longer here, Al D'Amato--affectionately \nreferred to as pothole Al. And I went to my friend Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts, and we said we are going to do what we can to see this \ndoesn't change.\n  I will tell you the end of the story. We ended up winning. Even \nthough over three-quarters of the Senate cosponsored the change and \nmore than that in the House, we ended up winning in the end of the day. \nThat was because our colleagues realized we took it personally, it \ndidn't affect their States very positively, and they in fact saw the \nbetter part of valor here and were willing to help us.\n  I remember standing in the well of the Senate saying to Bill: Bill, \nyou are chairman of the Finance Committee. Let your colleagues know \nthis is important to you.\n  He said: I don't know. You tell them. You tell them.\n  He was even uncomfortable saying that. He was one of the most \npowerful men in the Senate and he wouldn't say: Hey, look, Bennett, \nthis is important to me. Please help me. He wouldn't even do that.\n  Although he had all this power, the thing that was so beautiful about \nhim, he was uncomfortable with power. I think it is always healthy when \npeople are uncomfortable with wielding power. But he never hesitated to \nwield it when he thought it was absolutely clear cut.\n  So this was a guy who was a noble man. I just watched him. I watched \nhim operate for over 28 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is a quotation engraved on the wall \nat Union Station. It goes like this:\n\n       Be noble, and the nobleness that lies in other men sleeping \n     but never dead will rise in majesty to meet thine own.\n\n  Bill Roth also brought out the humility in those who worked with him \nand those who were around him.\n  There is much more to say about him. I have said too much.\n  I apologize. I did not realize that time was controlled. My colleague \nfrom Delaware, a cosponsor of this resolution, Senator Carper, would \nlike to speak. I ask whether my colleagues would object if Senator \nCarper is able to proceed.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have already talked to the Senator from \nDelaware. The junior Senator expects to speak 5 minutes, and I would \nlike to be recognized to speak very briefly about Senator Roth and then \nintroduce a bill. May I put that in the form of a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to be allowed to speak very \nbriefly about Senator Roth as well. I don't have a prepared statement. \nCould I go for 1 minute between Senator Carper and Senator Specter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nBiden, in offering this resolution commemorating Senator Roth. I thank \nSenator Specter for his willingness to let me slip in ahead of him.\n  I recall any number of times visiting the Senate when I was Governor. \nI have had the privilege of testifying before the Senate Finance \nCommittee that Senator Roth chaired. I remember revisiting him in his \noffice in the Hart Building from time to time.\n  It is not uncommon when you walk into the office of Senators that you \nsee their pictures on the wall. There were, I am sure, a few pictures \nof Senator Roth and his family and others on the wall of his office. It \nis less common to walk into a Senate office today as a person who \nsucceeded in a case where you ran against an incumbent, as I did \nagainst Senator Roth, and find the photograph of the Senator who was \ndefeated, in this case in my race against Bill Roth.\n  We have a tradition in Delaware called ``Return Day.'' Every Thursday \na few days after the election of even numbered years, winners and \nlosers gather in our county seat in southern Delaware, Georgetown, DE, \nand have a great breakfast at the Delaware Technical Community College. \nThen the winners and losers ride together in a horse-drawn carriage \nthroughout the streets of Georgetown. Thousands of people come from all \nover the State to cheer those who won. The town crier comes out on the \nbalcony of the White House in Georgetown in the circle and calls out \nthe results from the election 2 days earlier.\n  On that Thursday after the election in November of 2000, I rode in a \nhorse-drawn carriage with Senator Roth and members of his family, and \nsome members of my own family. It was an open-air carriage. It was a \nbeautiful day. I asked if he would like to stand. We stood. The driver \nand the horses were ahead of us as we started down the parade route \nsitting there with our hands on the seat behind the driver.\n\n  I said to him: Why don't we do something else? Let me hold your hand. \nI held his hand up in the air as one does at the end of a prizefight \nholding up the hand of a winner. We went through the entire parade that \nday holding up the hand of the winner who won so many elections during \n34 years as if there really wasn't a loser but only a winner in this \nsituation--a real winner. That picture of us holding hands is still in \nmy office today. It is a great picture. It tells a lot about the spirit \nof politics in Delaware and about the respect for Senator Roth as well.\n  Senator Biden talked about some of the legislative accomplishments \nand the work that Senator Roth did with respect to NATO and the \nreorganization of the Federal Government.\n  While those issues are important and what he did legislatively with \nrespect to NATO and others is important, in Delaware, a State with \nabout 800,000 people, you also have an extraordinary opportunity to \nhelp people with problems in their lives. For folks who are trying to \ngrapple with the IRS on issues that need to be resolved or on Social \nSecurity issues and veterans issues, you can quite literally every year \nchange the course of about 1,000 or 2,000 families who come to your \noffice for help.\n  That day as we went through Georgetown, DE, on ``Return Day'' in the \nparade, I am sure Senator Roth got bigger cheers than I did. They were \nfrom Democrats and Republicans and Independents. In part, those cheers \nwere the result of the kind of staff he put around him. He hired \nexcellent people. They set the gold standard for constituent service in \nour State. If you were a Democrat or Republican or Independent and you \ncalled his office for help, you got it. They did a terrific job.\n  Bill Roth understood that we are servants of the people. They pay our \nsalaries. We have an obligation to give our very best effort. He made \nsure that was what his staff provided--and he provided it during the 34 \nyears he served in the Congress.\n  I said to him after the election: You set the gold standard. The \nchallenge for me and my staff is to try very hard\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\nto match that standard. Maybe eventually, through new technology and \ntraining and services experience, we can even exceed it.\n  I have won statewide in Delaware 11 times. I have been fortunate 11 \ntimes. I have run against very good people but none more decent than \nBill Roth.\n  At his memorial service at the University of Delaware a week after \nhis death, we were joined by Senator Specter and others. Hundreds of \nthousands of people came from all over our State. One of the speakers \nsaid Bill Roth was a gentleman and a gentle man--a gentleman and a \ngentle man. He treated his staff, the folks who work in the cafeteria \nhere, and the folks who run the elevators here with the same kind of \nrespect as with his colleagues and his peers. I doubt that you can \nevery day find that in a person who rises to the kind of power he \nenjoyed in this city and in this country. It says a whole lot about the \nman he was.\n  One of the persons who spoke at Senator Roth's memorial service was \nhis former chief of staff, John Duncan, who is now Assistant Secretary \nof Legislative Affairs at the Department of the Treasury. I ask \nunanimous consent that excerpts of the very eloquent comments of John \nDuncan be printed in the Record. He said it certainly better than I \ncould. It is the kind of tribute that belongs in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenator William V. Roth, Jr., Memorial Service, Clayton Hall, December \n                                21, 2003\n\n       Today we celebrate a unique man whose legacy will live on \n     for us, our children and our grandchildren.\n       As the representative of the Roth staff, I appreciate this \n     opportunity to honor the man who had such a significant \n     impact on our country and the lives of so many people.\n       Just a few weeks ago, the Senator was in Washington and \n     some of us got together for lunch. After an hour or so of \n     laughter and story telling we all returned to our jobs.\n       On my way back to the office, I couldn't help but reflect \n     on what a big influence Bill Roth has had on those of us who \n     worked with him over the years.\n       Some had started working for him as interns, others as \n     subject matter experts. Some were form Delaware and knew \n     about the Senator before they went to work for him. Others \n     were from outside Delaware and came to know the uniqueness of \n     this man only after they came within his orbit. All, in their \n     subsequent careers, had gone on to great success in business, \n     government and academia.\n       One participant at lunch that day was a very high ranking \n     official in the Commerce Department who had been the \n     Senator's top trade advisor. He had the best of jobs. He \n     traveled the world working on trade agreements that would \n     shape the future of our country in the world economy.\n       For twenty minutes in great animation he regaled us with \n     stories about the exciting thing he was doing. Listening, you \n     couldn't help but be envious that any job should be so \n     important and so much fun.\n       But at the end he paused and, in serious vein, told the \n     Senator ``This job is great. But the best job I ever had was \n     working for you.''\n       The reason I tell this story is that Bill Roth is known for \n     many accomplishments. But his biggest impact was on the lives \n     of the people who did things with him, many of whom are in \n     this hall today.\n       Whenever we reflect on the nature of a person's life we \n     experience an interesting problem. We want, in our \n     reflections, to capture ``who'' they were. But with every \n     effort to describe ``who'' they were we inevitably end up \n     describing ``what'' they were and the uniqueness we \n     experienced and are trying to express escapes us.\n       This difficulty in no way lessens the importance of what we \n     are doing here as we remember the life of Senator Roth. For \n     it is at the end of a person's life that the uniqueness that \n     God gave each of us becomes most apparent.\n       Though the uniqueness of individual personality will always \n     escape being captured in words, I am pleased to join with the \n     others on this stage to add my contribution to the \n     appreciation of this highly unusual man.\n       I'd like to start my remarks by focusing on some of the \n     ideas the Senator brought to his work and how they led to the \n     achievements we so much associate with him.\n       Though those ideas were many and varied they all focused on \n     the concerns and worries of regular people--the people, from \n     all walks of life, who work hard, pay their taxes, and care \n     for their families.\n       Senator Roth believed that government exists to serve the \n     people. He started first with his own office.\n       Over the years he employed a number of fine and talented \n     caseworkers that citizens could turn to when the bureaucracy \n     became overwhelming. It's difficult to travel very far in \n     Delaware without meeting a person assisted by his office or \n     seeing something he helped fund, from Amtrak, to the Dover \n     Air Force Base to land set aside for conservation.\n       One of his first legislative accomplishments was the \n     creation of a source book for citizens that catalogued \n     available grant and assistance programs. How could the \n     government serve the people, he reasoned, if the people had \n     no idea what was available to them?\n       Years later he authored the Government Performance and \n     Results Act which set performance standards for government \n     agencies and held managers accountable for results. It was \n     this program, you may remember, that Al Gore adopted as his \n     central task as Vice President.\n       Evidence that the IRS had slipped beyond the control of the \n     Congress and was in danger of becoming a rogue bureaucracy \n     was what prompted the Senator to conduct hearings on the IRS.\n       To understand the importance of what he did you need to \n     know, that at the time of his hearings, a congressional \n     commission to modernize the IRS had finished its work and \n     legislation implementing its recommendations had been \n     introduced.\n       That legislation, though, was going nowhere. The IRS \n     opposed it. The Treasury Department opposed it. President \n     Clinton opposed it. But within months of Senator Roth's \n     dramatic hearings the Congress passed the restructuring bill \n     and the President swiftly signed it. Reform that normally \n     takes years was accomplished in months--all because of the \n     determination and timely leadership of Bill Roth.\n       It was as Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee \n     that the Senator first disclosed his thinking that \n     competition, so much a force for good in the private sector, \n     might be useful in government administration.\n       The principle that competition ensures innovation and \n     lowest cost operations was first applied by the Senator to \n     government procurement where he was an ardent opponent of the \n     practice of sole-source contracting.\n       Later, in interesting and artful ways, the Senator would \n     apply this principle to other areas of government.\n       He teamed-up with his friend and colleague Joe Biden to \n     expand NATO's membership and mission. Because of their \n     successful work, there are choices available for dealing with \n     international hot-spots and freedom and security are more \n     than just a dream for millions of people.\n       In the area of transportation, the Senator's vigorous \n     support of Amtrak, the Wilmington Trolley, and alternative \n     fuels was based on his belief that we are better off with \n     alternative modes of transportation and energy.\n       The Senator was best known for his work on tax policy. He \n     though that every person who wanted a job should have one.\n       While he never thought we would ever be free from the \n     business cycle, it upset him that the tax code--something we \n     did control--discouraged the creation of jobs. The best thing \n     to do, he reasoned, was to change the tax code in a way that \n     encouraged people to work, save and invest.\n       That was the principle behind the Roth-Kemp tax cuts. \n     Radical at the time, today the connection between low \n     marginal tax rates and jobs is conventional wisdom, not only \n     in America, but a good part of the world.\n       With tax policy moving in the direction of lower rates, the \n     Senator turned his attention to changing retirement policy \n     from income maintenance to asset ownership. He used his \n     committee leadership positions to develop savings accounts as \n     part of the Civil Service Retirement system and then created \n     the highly popular Roth IRA.\n       As you can tell from the variety of things I've mentioned, \n     Bill Roth was driven by big ideas and left a legacy of big \n     accomplishments.\n       Success in Washington, though, doesn't just happen on its \n     own. Anyone who knows the nature of public life can tell you \n     that having a vision of a preferred future is not enough for \n     success.\n       Abraham Lincoln, in one of his State of the Union Messages \n     to the Congress, summarized it best when he wrote, ``it is \n     not `can any of us imagine better?' but, `can we all do \n     better?' ''\n       There are as many visions of the future as there are \n     Members of Congress. The central task and art of political \n     leadership is gaining the consent of a majority of Members to \n     do the things that need to be done.\n       You can't get that consent, though, if don't know how to \n     work with your colleagues. Just as Bill Roth had a core set \n     of beliefs that guided him in what he did, the Senator had a \n     firm set of ideas about the conduct of business.\n       The Congress can be a complicated and difficult place in \n     which to act. The rules are complex. People are \n     unpredictable, emotions run high and the best of human nature \n     is often absent.\n       The legislative process can too easily become a game in \n     which each political party tries to score points at the \n     expense of the other. Relationships can too easily descend \n     into acrimony and bitterness.\n       Senator Roth avoided all that. To him, the conduct of \n     politics came down to a set of straightforward activities: \n     Express . . . Discuss . . . Persuade . . . Negotiate . . . \n     Compromise. It was primarily through these activities that he \n     gained consent and advanced his goals.\n       His basic technique was to carefully craft an initial \n     proposal that reflected common interests. He'd then bring the \n     Committee together and would not let anyone leave the\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\n     room until they reached agreement. His goal was agreement by \n     consent. And nobody knew how to build consensus like Bill \n     Roth.\n       He preferred persuasion to voting. But if the Senator \n     needed votes, he knew how to get them. He knew when to \n     negotiate. He knew how to compromise while remaining true to \n     his principles. And, most importantly from the standpoint of \n     his colleagues, he could be counted on to defend the products \n     of joint decision.\n       I learned a secret from Bill Roth. In politics, as in life \n     itself, means and ends are the same. To the Senator, how \n     things were done was as important as what was done.\n       To him political power flowed from treating each colleague \n     in a way that, as a group, they would never lose the ability \n     to do things together. That understanding served him well \n     and, in large measure, accounted for his success.\n       To the Senator the purpose of our political institutions is \n     to move us forward as a nation, and keep us together as \n     individuals.\n       Though he was a Republican and proud of his party's \n     heritage, Bill Roth did not see the world in partisan terms. \n     There is a nice irony here, because the ideas Bill Roth \n     worked for have transformed the Republican Party.\n       Bill Roth felt that any important undertaking had to be \n     done in a bipartisan manner. He had many friends on the other \n     side of the aisle.\n       One of his closest friends was Joe Biden. The attentiveness \n     and courtesies they showed each other convinced me that there \n     was, in reality, a third political party that might best be \n     called the Delaware Party.\n       As Senator Biden has often observed, Bill Roth led, but he \n     led quietly. He didn't hog the spotlight, intimidate or run \n     roughshod over his colleagues. In advancing his interests, \n     Bill Roth rarely played hard bill. It was not in his \n     personality to do so.\n       But if he had to, he could. I remember one time when he \n     did.\n       The Senate was considering an extension of unemployment \n     benefits. The legislation had been written in a way that \n     excluded Delaware and some other states under the notion that \n     their economies weren't suffering enough and didn't need the \n     help.\n       Senator Roth's view was that Delaware's unemployed deserved \n     to be treated just as well as the unemployed in other states. \n     The states that benefited from the legislation had the votes \n     to get it passed, but it was unclear whether they would break \n     a filibuster.\n       I remember Senator Roth calling me from the Senate floor \n     with a fire in his voice that I had never heard before and \n     would never have occasion to hear again. He instructed me to \n     locate a multi-volume history of the state of Delaware. I \n     knew immediately that he and Senator Biden were prepared to \n     read the entire history of Delaware to the U.S. Senate, if \n     they had to, in order to stop this unfair treatment.\n       After a short but tense period of time the leadership \n     backed off. The legislation was altered to include the \n     unemployed from all states and passed by unanimous consent.\n       When the standoff was over, the Senator returned from the \n     floor. The history of Delaware went back to the library. And \n     I developed a new appreciation for the use of history in the \n     development of public policy.\n       The Senator's personality was creative and fun-loving. He \n     was always game for the unusual. He had a live elephant at a \n     press conference when he was fighting to get attention for \n     his tax cut proposals.\n       He hung spare parts from a Christmas tree to dramatize \n     military procurement practices that were over-charging the \n     taxpayer.\n       And on the first anniversary of the Roth-Kemp tax cuts, he \n     wanted to celebrate everyone getting a bigger piece of the \n     economic pie. So he had prepared and served a giant baked \n     apple pie--a pie so large that it qualified for the Guinness \n     Book of World Records.\n       And as everyone in Delaware knew, the Senator campaigned \n     with a Saint Bernard. He told me about the Saint Bernard \n     once. He said it was his secret weapon.\n       People might resist a politician he told me, but nobody \n     could resist a dog--especially if that dog was a big and \n     happy Saint Bernard.\n       But even if parents could resist the dog, children \n     couldn't. When the children came so did their parents. And \n     there he'd be with his ``HI, I'm Bill Roth'' button ready to \n     greet and converse.\n       Hokey by some people's standards, but, when he told me that \n     story, I knew why he became Delaware's longest-serving \n     statewide lawmaker.\n       The Senator's love of his dogs was legendary in Delaware. \n     But it wasn't as well known in Washington until a prominent \n     local magazine did a profile on the Senator in which he \n     listed his dog Sweet Pea as his closest advisor.\n       When people talk about Bill Roth as an individual one hears \n     words like ``kind . . . shy . . . gracious . . . thoughtful . \n     . . considerate . . . humble . . . respectful.''\n       These words accurately reflect Bill Roth's personality. But \n     they need to be leavened with some additional qualities. Bill \n     Roth was a demanding leader. You couldn't do what he did in \n     Washington without focused drive and ambition.\n       Bill Roth came to Washington with grand purposes. As with \n     all big efforts there were setbacks, disappointments and \n     failures. But they never stopped him or even slowed him down.\n       Senator Roth had great expectations and desired to do well. \n     They were expectations he put on himself and the \n     organization. And they came, I think, at least to some degree \n     from Delaware's special role in America's founding and its \n     long history of quality political leadership.\n       No matter what he was working on or where he was in the \n     world, Delaware was never far from his mind. When crafting \n     important trade and tax legislation, he always considered its \n     effects on Delaware products and businesses. When traveling \n     abroad he pressed his hosts to open their borders to products \n     from Delaware.\n       Poultry was always prominent in those discussions. The \n     efficiency of the industry was astonishing to him. That \n     Delaware poultry could be grown, processed and shipped to \n     markets in foreign lands at prices competitive with local \n     producers had a big impact on his thinking about trade and \n     his confidence in America's ability to compete in a global \n     economy.\n       It was important to the Senator that he employ the best \n     talent. He insisted that everyone who worked for him have a \n     clear understanding of what was expected at work and that \n     they have the resources to do their jobs.\n       But the important element that stood out in Bill Roth's \n     office was the way he treated his employees. He did not use \n     and discard people. He cared about each of us as individuals. \n     His interest went beyond the workplace to family and career.\n       Though he was a very busy man pursuing important \n     objectives, he always had time--time to counsel, time to \n     celebrate and time to console.\n       He brought out the best in his employees and launched them \n     on their careers and took great satisfaction in everyone's \n     achievements.\n       This is very unusual. It is in our families that we expect \n     to be cared about for who we are. By treating his employees \n     as individuals and caring about their personal success, \n     Senator Roth made each of us a part of his family.\n       I'd like to close my remarks by relating a small incident \n     that I think says a lot about Bill Roth and his chosen \n     profession of politics.\n       One day Neil Messick, the person who preceded me in my job, \n     drove the Senator to a meeting. They parked in a large garage \n     and went to their destination. When they returned to the \n     garage Neil realized he had forgotten where he had parked the \n     car.\n       He took a guess at the right floor but he chose wrong. Neil \n     was new to the job and worried about the kind of impression \n     he must be making on his new employer.\n       After some initial wandering around Neil turned to the \n     Senator and said ``You wait here and I'll go find the car.''\n       The Senator, who had already sized-up the situation, said \n     ``Neil you've already lost the car, you're not going to lose \n     me, too.'' And off they went in laughter to find the car.\n       This little incident says a lot about the Senator's quick \n     humor and his desire to put people at ease. But it also says \n     something about the nature of the political experience \n     itself.\n       Politicians enter the public realism alone but they never \n     travel it alone. They travel it with the family who supports \n     them at home, the voters and friends who support them in the \n     state, and the staff who support them at work.\n       Bill Roth made the journey with the support of all of you. \n     He was a good man doing a tough job--a job he loved. You were \n     the source of his energy.\n       The Senator confided in me one time that he viewed himself \n     as a plodder. That self-assessment was accurate. But he was a \n     plodder with a vision.\n       As your Congressional delegation can attest, success, as a \n     legislator, requires the sustained and focused activity of \n     small steps over a long period of time. And, with each step, \n     elected representatives face unique and difficult challenges.\n       But, as Bill Roth's life has shown, if you have a vision, \n     stay on course, and are attentive to relationships, then \n     small steps lead to big accomplishments.\n       Last January, during a graduation ceremony at the \n     University of Delaware, the Senator was described as a \n     dedicated public servant, an esteemed leader on foreign \n     policy, an acknowledged leader of reform, and a respected \n     environmentalist. This is ``what'' Bill Roth was.\n       Later, in that same ceremony, a former employee and long \n     time political advisor, Pete Hayward, used a different \n     terminology to describe the Senator: ``caring employer, \n     patient teacher, supportive mentor, and trusted friend.'' \n     This is ``who'' Bill Roth was.\n       Today we bring both together--what he did and who he was--\n     and can appreciate the full measure of the man.\n       Thank you.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will not take a great deal of time. I \ndon't need to because all that needs to be said about Bill Roth has \nbeen said.\n  My wife and I had the privilege of going with Bill and his wife to \nRomania. We traveled with them to other countries throughout Europe \ntalking about NATO and other issues. In that process, we became well \nacquainted with two of America's finest public servants. But on that \noccasion, they became two of our best friends.\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\n  I join with all of the people from Delaware and all of the colleagues \nin the Senate in paying tribute to Bill Roth, saying goodbye to him for \nhis service, and extending my warmest sympathy and condolences to Jane \nfor the loss of her husband as well as recognition of her service to \nthis country. What a remarkable couple. America, as well as the State \nof Delaware, has been very well served for their willingness to \nparticipate in the public arena.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to \nSenator Roth. I had the privilege of working with Bill Roth in the \nSenate for some 20 years.\n  On the route from Washington to Philadelphia I frequently road with \nBill Roth as far as Wilmington. Frequently when I would catch the train \nin Philadelphia, I would see him board in Wilmington. During the course \nof 20 years, we had very many long and fascinating discussions.\n  Bill Roth was an outstanding Senator. He served in the House of \nRepresentatives in advance of coming to the Senate and was a native of \nthe State of Montana. He was Harvard Law School educated. He was \nchairman of the Finance Committee. He had very deep insight into \nfinances and taxes. He was a coauthor of the famous Roth-Kemp bill or \nKemp-Roth bill--it depends on whether you accentuate the House or the \nSenate--with very substantial tax cuts in the early days of the Reagan \nadministration. He later served as chairman of the Finance Committee, \nknown for the Roth IRAs, so people could set aside funds and make a \nreal contribution to the Nation.\n  My wife and I had the occasion to attend the memorial service for \nSenator Roth in Wilmington recently. As noted, his wife Jane is a very \ndistinguished judge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the \ncircuit which covers Pennsylvania as well as Delaware and also New \nJersey.\n  When Senator Roth finished his term at about his 80th birthday, it \nmarked a very outstanding contribution to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the pending \nresolution?\n  The resolution (S. Res. 284) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent the next remarks be in morning \nbusiness under the introduction of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 2008 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a man who is a \nhusband, a father, a grandfather, a friend, and a hero.\n  Chief Lee Leighton is retiring after a remarkable career of 34 years \nwith the fire department of Sparks, NV.\n  From the time Lee was born in Lynn, MA, he can never remember a time \nwhen he did not want to follow in his father's footsteps as a public \nservant. After the family moved to Nevada, his father joined the Washoe \nCounty Sheriff's office, and he showed Lee through example how \nimportant a job and a life's work can be.\n  Lee looked up to his dad. And as he looked toward his own future, he \nhoped to become either a policeman or a firefighter. As fate would have \nit, the fire department called him first, so he became a fireman.\n  Being the oldest of four children, Lee has always been a leader. He \nbegan his career in the fire department in August of 1969, and a few \nyears later became the pump operator driver. The department, \nrecognizing his ambition, promoted him to Captain in 1977. Over the \nyears, Lee's dedication to the fire department was acknowledged and he \nwas appointed battalion chief and then department chief. For the past \n3\\1/2\\ years he has been the fire chief of the Sparks Fire Department.\n  When Lee joined the department, it had about 30 people. Now there are \nalmost 100. He is leaving the department in good shape, with response \ntimes that are as good as any in the Nation.\n  His commitment to Nevada is evident not only through the years he \nspent working for the Sparks Fire Department, but through his passion \nand love for his job and life. This passion has also inspired his four \nsons to become firemen. They are serving Nevada through the Reno Fire \nDepartment, Storey County Fire Department, and Nevada Division of \nForestry.\n  Lee's life as a public servant went beyond the Fire Department. He \nserved 6 years in the Marine Corps Reserve, and Nevada Governor Kenny \nGuinn appointed him as a member of the Board of Fire Services. In \naddition, Lee participated as a member of the Department's Honor Guard, \nformer chairman of the Sparks Fire Department Commendation Review \nCommittee, and chairman of the Sparks Fire Department History Book \nCommittee.\n  Sixteen years ago he met his future wife, Roberta Leighton. Roberta, \nor ``Bobbi,'' was working as a police and fire dispatcher. Lee with his \nfour sons, and Bobbi with two daughters and one son, became good \nfriends. Over 8 years,\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\nthat friendship evolved into love, and they married in March of 1996. \nThis March they will celebrate their eighth anniversary.\n  Lee and Bobbi plan to spend a few well-deserved months in Mexico, \nrelaxing and enjoying the life they have established together. Of \ncourse, they will spend a lot of time with their seven children and six \ngrandchildren. And Lee will now have more time to ride his Harley, \npossibly in the upcoming Street Vibrations festival, an annual \ncelebration for motorcycle enthusiasts in Sparks and nearby Reno.\n  As they look forward to retirement, Lee and Bobbi can also look back \non a job well done, a life well lived, and the important role they \nplayed in Sparks, NV.\n  So today, on behalf of all Nevadans, I offer congratulations and \ngratitude to Lee and Bobbi Leighton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S27-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to CPT Chris \nSoelzer, a resident of Sturgis, SD who died on December 24, 2003, while \nserving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Captain Soelzer was a member of the Headquarters Company of the 5th \nEngineer Battalion, which was based out of Fort Leonard Wood, MO. He \nwas among three soldiers killed when a roadside bomb hit a military \nconvoy near Samarra.\n  Answering America's call to the military, Captain Soelzer wasn't sure \nhe was going to make a career out of the Army. However, according to \nhis brother, ``he was a soldier, that is what he lived for.'' A born \nsoldier, he had attended Kemper Military School and College after \ngraduating from Sturgis High School. A member of the school band, \nchorus group, and the track team, friends remember him as a quiet and \ngentle person. Captain Soelzer's former principal recalls that ``he was \na real gentleman, a real nice kid who was involved in a lot of \nthings.'' Dave Mueller, a friend from high school remembers Captain \nSoelzer as a bright individual and remarked that ``Academics was his \nbig thing. I think he was close to straight A's.''\n  Captain Soelzer served our country and, as a hero, died fighting for \nit. He served as a model example of the loyalty and dedication in the \npreservation of freedom. The thoughts and prayers of my family as well \nas the rest of the country's are with his family during this time of \nmourning. Our thoughts continue to be with all those families with \nchildren, spouses, and loved ones serving overseas.\n  Captain Soelzer led a full life, committed to his family, his Nation, \nand his community. It was his incredible dedication to helping others \nthat will serve as his greatest legacy. Our Nation is a far better \nplace because of Captain Soelzer's contributions, and, while his \nfamily, friends, and Nation will miss him very much, the best way to \nhonor his life is to emulate his commitment to service and community. \nIn the words of Dave Mueller, ``He was also a person who you'd barely \nhave to know him and he would do everything for you.''\n  I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my sympathies to the \nfamily of Captain Soelzer. I know that he will always be missed, but \nhis service to our Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                       sergeant dennis a. corral\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Dennis A. Corral, a fellow Nebraskan and Sergeant in the U.S. Army. \nSergeant Corral was killed on January 1 in Baghdad, Iraq. He was 33 \nyears old.\n  Sergeant Corral served as a supply sergeant in Company C, 1st \nEngineer Battalion, 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, based in Fort \nRiley, KS.\n  A resident of Kearney, NE, Sergeant Corral was a dedicated soldier \nwho was committed to his family and country. Sergeant Corral \nvolunteered to deploy early so that another soldier with a wife and \nchildren could spend more time at home, his mother, Yolanda, said. She \ndescribed her son as always willing to ``step forward if they need \nhelp.''\n  In addition to his mother, Sergeant Corral is survived by his father, \nVictor, and brothers, Peter, Christopher, and Rodney. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with each of them at this difficult time.\n  Sergeant Corral and thousands of brave American service men and women \nconfront danger every day in Iraq and their tremendous sacrifices must \nnever be taken for granted or forgotten. For his service, bravery, and \nsacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring \nSergeant Dennis Corral.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S27-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S27-S28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. DAY, 2004\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, throughout California and across America, \nmillions of people gathered yesterday to celebrate the 75th anniversary \nof Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birth. Each year, thanks to a 1983 \nFederal law that I was proud to vote for, we take the third Monday of \nJanuary to commemorate Dr. King's birthday.\n  In his immortal ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Dr. King shared his vision \nof a land where people of every religion, race, and creed could realize \nthe American dream of freedom and opportunity. In the words of his \nwife, Coretta Scott King, we honor Dr. King's dream of ``a vibrant, \nmultiracial nation that has a place at the table for children of every \nrace and room at the inn for every needy child.'' On Martin Luther King \nDay, we take this opportunity to reflect on the dream of an inclusive \nsociety in which all people are truly created equal.\n  On this day and all year long, Americans share in Dr. King's \nextraordinary commitment to improving the lives of others. We remember \nhis dream and take an active role in making it a reality. Throughout \nour Nation, people help those in need: they feed the hungry, house the \npoor, heal the sick, and offer a guiding hand to at-risk youth.\n  This week, as we mark the national celebration of Dr. King's \nbirthday, let us not merely reflect on his work, let us live his \nlegacy. On this Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, I ask you to join me in \nvowing to make Dr. King's dream a reality. Let us come together to take \npositive--yes, affirmative--action to give every American a real shot \nat the dream.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, yesterday, we celebrated Martin Luther King \nDay. For many of us, this day was a time to reflect on the progress we \nhave made in protecting civil rights and the work that remains. Dr. \nKing once said:\n\n       Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n\nNo matter how far our Nation has come, we must never rest contented \nwith the mistaken notion that we have done enough to protect our fellow \ncitizens.\n  In 1998, a young man named Matthew Shepard was brutally beaten and \nleft for dead simply because he was gay. He lived for 6 days in the \nhospital, just long enough for his family to gather and say goodbye. \nMatthew's story, and the heinous dragging murder of James Byrd 6 months \nearlier, brought hate crimes to the forefront of the national \ndiscourse. It taught us a profound lesson about the hatred that still \nlives in some of our citizens.\n  Hate crimes are violent acts intended by their perpetrators to send a \nmessage of animus and intimidation towards those whose religion, race, \nor sexual orientation might differ from their own. They are a violation \nof everything our country stands for. As Attorney General Ashcroft has \nsaid:\n\n       Criminal acts of hate run counter to what is best in \n     America--our belief in equality and freedom.\n\n  Sadly, the number of reported hate crimes continues to grow at an \nalarming rate. The FBI catalogued over 9,700 hate crimes in 2001. That \nis an average of 26 hate crimes a day. At that pace, in the last 5 \nyears, more than 47,000 hate crimes have been committed.\n  The current hate crimes law was enacted after the assassination of \nDr. King, and it is woefully outdated. It does not apply to hate crimes \nbased on sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Even in cases of \ncrimes based on race, religion, or ethnic background, the law only \nprotects victims who were attacked when engaged in ``federally \nprotected activities'' such as jury service, interstate travel, or \nvoting.\n  It is time to update this law, and I believe we have finally \ndeveloped compromise legislation that can pass Congress. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act, LLEEA, is a bipartisan bill that will \nprovide support to local authorities investigating and prosecuting hate \nviolence.\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\n  LLEEA requires the Attorney General to appoint a Federal prosecutor \nto promote cooperation between Federal and local law enforcement. In \naddition, the bill recognizes that not all violence constitutes a hate \ncrime, and provides that only those motivated by bias, with the intent \nto terrorize the victim, may be prosecuted as hate crimes.\n  LLEEA has been endorsed by more than 175 law enforcement, civil \nrights, and religious organizations, including attorneys general for 22 \nStates, the National Sheriffs' Association, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police; and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  Nobody should live in fear because of who they are. Congress cannot \ncontinue to sit silently by while hatred spreads. And as Americans, it \nis time for us to send a message that we are prepared to confront this \nnational plague and take another step closer to making Dr. King's dream \na reality.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, yesterday we celebrated the life and legacy \nof a great man, a bold leader who inspired courage, unity and \ncompassion. He changed the path of America's conscience, and he left \nhis mark on Arkansas in so many ways. Dr. King time and time again came \nto the aid of Arkansans and supported others who were making \nsignificant sacrifices for civil rights.\n  In May of 1958, Dr. King stood in the audience at Central High School \nto witness the graduation ceremony of Ernest Green from Little Rock \nCentral High. Ernest was the first of the nine black teenagers who \nintegrated Central High School in 1957. Ernest, along with Elizabeth \nEckford, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown \nTrickey, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, Thelma Mothershed Wair and \nMelba Pattillo Beals shaped history by valiantly attending a previously \nall-white school.\n  Of her experience, Melba Pattillo Beals recalls:\n\n       I had to become a warrior. I had to learn not how to dress \n     the best but how to get from that door to the end of the hall \n     without dying.\n\n  These students' selfless act of courage changed history for all \nAmericans in a tale that continues to have immediacy today.\n  As a student of Central High, I can tell you the impact of the Little \nRock Nine is felt in the halls and in the hearts of its student body \nand teachers today.\n  Central High was designated as a unit of the national park system in \n1998. In 2002, over 24,000 people visited the historic site with \nestimates of a potential 60,000 visitors by 2007. Incidentally, 2007 \nwill be the 50th anniversary of the 1957-1958 Little Rock desegregation \ncrises.\n  Dr. King was a man of eloquent and powerful words, and he exemplified \nhis principles of love, tolerance, reconciliation and equality. As we \nall know, he sacrificed his life to usher in opportunity and freedom \nfor all individuals. I remind my colleagues that we must do more than \nquote the empowering words of Dr. King. We must do more walking and \nless talking. As we honor Dr. King, I must approach a subject that has \nbeen so heavy on my mind.\n  I am disappointed to learn that the $267,000 that I requested for \nplanning the National Park Service's Little Rock Central High School \nVisitors Center was not funded in the Interior Appropriations bill, as \nI and other members of the Arkansas congressional delegation had hoped \nit would be.\n  The conference report notes that Central High was authorized in 1998 \nand that the general management plan was completed in 2002 and \nrecommended a visitor facility. But then it goes on to say generally \nthat this project is not a construction priority.\n  I am putting my colleagues on notice that I am going to fight for \nfunds for not only planning but building this visitors center in this \nyear's budget, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a \nproposal that will complete the Little Rock Central High Visitors \nCenter in time for the 50th anniversary in 2007.\n  The Little Rock Nine brought us closer to realizing Dr. King's dream \nof ``the promised land,'' but we are not there yet. The visitors center \nwill remind us where we once were, but also how much farther we need to \ngo if we are to truly open the doors of opportunity for all \nindividuals. Join me in supporting a message that is as important today \nas it was in 1957. Join me in supporting Dr. King's teachings and the \nbravery of nine black children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S28-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \ndistinguished life and career of my friend and former colleague, \nSenator Paul Simon.\n  Paul will forever be remembered for the great respect he earned \nduring his 40 years of public service, thanks to his sharp intellect \nand tremendous leadership. These traits were as much a signature for \nhim as his famous bow tie.\n  Paul's life is a testament to the fact that public service truly can \nbe a noble calling. His service to his constituents was an inspiration. \nHis office often handled more cases than any other Senate office. \nDuring his tenure he held over 600 town meetings in his home State of \nIllinois. Senator Simon's dedication to those he represented made him a \nrole model to many, including myself. That is why I am proud to have \ncampaigned for Senator Simon during his 1988 run for the Democratic \nnomination for the presidency.\n  Paul Simon was dedicated to education. He played a vital role in \nimproving literacy and supporting adult education. His hard work on \nmaking student loans more affordable allowed many Americans the chance \nto go to college. He was also committed to helping working Americans \nand, throughout his long career, he never lost touch with their \nconcerns.\n  Senator Simon's dedication to public service and the education of \nothers continued after his retirement when he founded the Southern \nIllinois University Public Policy Institute.\n  I was fortunate enough to serve with Senator Simon on both the \nJudiciary and Foreign Relations Committees. We worked together on many \nissues, but I will especially remember him for his commitment to \ncampaign finance reform. His support during the early days of campaign \nfinance reform was invaluable. I truly regret that he passed just 1 day \nbefore the Supreme Court's historic decision to uphold the Bipartisan \nCampaign Finance Reform Act.\n  During a time when many feel that political partisanship is on the \nrise, Paul Simon remains an example of decency and integrity. He was a \nmentor to me and so many others who were fortunate enough to have known \nand worked with him. He will be deeply missed. I will remain forever \ngrateful for the work he did, for the example he set, and for his \nfriendship, which I will always treasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S28-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S28-S30]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In early May 2003, Jessica Mercado, a Latina transgender woman was \nfound dead in her apartment. According to police reports, Mercado was \nstabbed twice in the neck in her New Haven, CT apartment which was then \nset on fire in a possible attempt to cover up the crime.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S30-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S30-S31]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TROUBLING PRE-ELECTION DEVELOPMENTS IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as co-chairman of the Helsinki \nCommission and the sponsor of the 2002 Senate-passed resolution urging \nthe Ukrainian Government to ensure a democratic, transparent and fair \nelection process in advance of their parliamentary elections, I find \nrecent developments relating to upcoming presidential elections in \nUkraine deeply troubling.\n  Ten months before these critical elections, a constitutional \namendment is making its way through the Ukrainian parliament designed \nto ensure that the current, corruption riddled powers-that-be retain \ntheir grip on power, neutralizing the leader of the biggest democratic \nfraction in parliament and Ukraine's most popular politician, Victor \nYushchenko. The amendment calls for abbreviating the presidential term \nfor the October 2004 elections to 2 years, with the election of a \npresident by the parliament in 2006, notwithstanding opinion pools \nindicating that the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians support \npreserving direct presidential elections. This amendment had been \napproved by Ukraine's Constitutional Court in a decision which has led \nmany observers both within and outside of Ukraine to question the \nindependence of the court. The court's decision a few weeks ago to \nallow President Kuchma to run for a third term, despite the 1996 \nconstitution's 2-term limit, has only raised more questions.\n  Media repression continues, including the issuance of directives sent \nto media by the presidential administration on what and how issues and \nevents should be covered, especially in the electronic media. A recent \nFreedom House report concludes that:\n\n       The current state of affairs of Ukraine's media raises \n     serious questions as to whether a fair and balanced electoral \n     contest can be held.\n\n  Newspapers critical of the authorities are subjected to various \nmethods of repression, including attacks against journalists, arrests \nof publishers, ``special attention'' via tax inspections, \nadministrative controls over distribution and pressure on advertisers.\n  At the same time, administrative measures are being taken to prevent \nlawful political activity, the most stark example of which was the \ndisruption--instigated by the authorities--of a national congress of \nthe Yushchenko-led Our Ukraine bloc in Donetsk last November. Most \nrecently, a presidential decree dismissed the elected Our Ukraine mayor \nof Mukachevo, despite a ruling by the Supreme Court which confirmed \nthat he had been elected in a legitimate way. In a telling twist, an \nacting mayor from the political party led by the head of the \npresidential administration, Victor Medvedchuk, has been installed.\n  As co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I share the concern of \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle that the presidential elections \nin Ukraine scheduled for October be free, fair, open and transparent \nand conducted in a manner consistent with Ukraine's freely undertaken \ncommitments as a member of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe--OSCE. The Helsinki Commission, consistent with \nour mandate to monitor and encourage compliance with OSCE agreements by \nall participating states, will continue to follow the situation in \nUkraine closely.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a recent Washington Post \neditorial on troubling pre-election developments in Ukraine be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 12, 2004]\n\n                        A Resolution for Ukraine\n\n       According to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, the Bush \n     administration's first foreign policy resolution for 2004 is \n     ``to expand freedom.'' And not only in Iraq and the Middle \n     East: In an op-ed article published in the New York Times, \n     Mr. Powell promised to support ``the consolidation of freedom \n     in many new but often fragile democracies . . . in Latin \n     America, Europe, Asia and Africa.'' We hope that support will \n     extend beyond the rhetoric that too often has substituted for \n     genuine democratic advocacy during President Bush's first \n     three years--and that it will be applied even where the \n     United States has interests that make toleration of autocracy \n     tempting.\n       One region where such U.S. engagement, or its absence, \n     might prove decisive is the band of former Soviet republics \n     to the west and south of Russia. Several are struggling \n     democracies; others are ruled by autocrats. Almost all are \n     under threat from Moscow's resurgent imperialism. As the tiny \n     state of Georgia recently demonstrated, democracy is the best \n     defense against Russian President Vladimir Putin's attempts \n     to create a Kremlin-dominated sphere of influence. Countries \n     that have held free and fair elections have tended to \n     gravitate toward strengthening their independence and seeking \n     good relations with the West, while unstable autocrats are \n     more likely to yield to Mr. Putin.\n       The country closes to a tipping point may be Ukraine. Like \n     Russia, Ukraine has an electoral democracy tainted by \n     corruption and strong-arm tactics and an economy warped by \n     clans of oligarchs. Much of its population, however, aspires \n     to integration with the West. President Leonid Kuchma has \n     been linked to corruption and serious human rights \n     violations. In recent months he has\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\n     been moving steadily closer to Mr. Putin, allowing a Russian \n     takeover of much of Ukraine's energy industry and signing an \n     economic integration treaty.\n       Now Mr. Kuchma appears to be looking for ways to curtail \n     Ukraine's democracy so that he can prolong his own hold on \n     power when his term expires this year. Last month his allies \n     in Parliament pushed through the first draft of a \n     constitutional amendment that would cut short the term of the \n     president due to be elected in October and provide that \n     future presidents be chosen by Parliament--where Mr. Kuchma's \n     forces retain control. Then the judges he appointed to the \n     supreme court ruled that the constitution's two-term limit \n     does not prevent Mr. Kuchma from serving again. The \n     president's cronies protest that they are only moving the \n     country toward a more parliament-centered system, and Mr. \n     Kuchma coyly says he has not ``yet'' decided to seek another \n     term. But the effect of his moves would be to neutralize the \n     country's most popular leader, Viktor Yushchenko, who, polls \n     say, would win the next presidential election if it were \n     fairly held.\n       More than Mr. Kuchma's quest for continued power is at \n     stake, Mr. Yushchenkjo is popular precisely because he is \n     associated with those Ukrainians who seek to consolidate an \n     independent democracy and move the country toward integration \n     with Europe. Mr. Putin surely will be sympathetic to Mr. \n     Kuchma's subversion of the system. The question is whether \n     the Bush administration will work with Western Europe to \n     mount an effective counter. Freedom could be consolidated \n     this year in Ukraine or slip away. The outcome may just \n     depend on how well Mr. Powell keeps his resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S31-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S31-S32]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  POEMS FROM RUSTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, each year I try and take \nadvantage of the opportunity to visit some of the high performing \nschools in my State. This past year, I had the privilege of spending \ntime with the students of Ruston Elementary School in Ruston, LA. I was \nvery impressed by them and their level of achievement. The fifth grade \nstudents had just spent the semester studying the U.S. Senate and its \nrole in American democracy. They were eager to learn about our work and \nthe many traditions that make the Senate one of the most deliberative \nbodies in the world.

Mr. President, 35 years ago Lois and I, along with \nJohn Jr. and Bill Breaux, rented a U-Haul truck and headed north to \nWashington, D.C.\n  Lois tells the story about Bill the night before we left saying his \nprayers and concluding with ``Good-bye God, we are moving to \nWashington.'' And, we had to pull John Jr. from under the house.\n  Well, today, John Jr. is 38 years old. Bill is 37, and Beth is \nmarried to Jeff Shepherdson and has three children--Anna Kate, 6, \nCampbell, 4, and C.J., 2 years old, and Julie, our youngest is now 28, \nworks in New Orleans, and is here with us today.\n  I'll always remember that trip. My mother, who is deceased, and my \nfather, followed us to D.C. We got there at night. I had never even \nvisited Washington, so we drove right to the Capitol, and that evening \nthe Marine Corps band was in concert on the Capitol steps. It was \nbeautiful, and I thought they were playing just for us.\n  It's been a great 35 years--a few years as a staff person, 14 years \nas a Member of the Congress, representing southwest Louisiana, and it \nwill be 18 years as a U.S. Senator, representing our State of \nLouisiana. I had the privilege of serving with five Governors and seven \nPresidents.\n  I have said for a year now that I would announce my decision whether \nto seek another term as U.S. Senator after the governor's election this \nyear. I further said that I would make that announcement between \nNovember 15 and December 15. The difficulty of that decision is shown \nby the fact that today is December 15.\n  Lois and I have spent a lot of time discussing this decision--not \nformally, but, ``what do you think?'' type discussions. Although one \ntime she actually sat up in bed, drew a line down the middle of a page, \nand listed the pros and cons of running--not surprisingly, they came \nout just about even.\n  We have received lots of advice--from my staff, from family and \nsupporters here in Louisiana, and from around the country. Some of the \nletters from total strangers were so touching and heartfelt that we \nwill forever treasure them.\n  My colleagues in the Congress, especially in the Senate, spoke to \nboth Lois and me frequently with their thoughts and suggestions. \nColleagues, actually from both sides of the aisle, urged me to run \nagain, and for their encouragement and friendship I cannot begin to say \nhow much Lois and I appreciate them. My special appreciation also goes \nto Tom Daschle, Harry Reid and Mary Landrieu.\n  The citizens of Louisiana have greatly honored my family and me by \nallowing me to serve these 30-plus years as their Congressman and U.S. \nSenator. I can honestly say I enjoyed every moment and appreciated the \nopportunity that I have had to serve.\n  But there comes a time in every career when it is time to step aside, \nand let others step up and serve. And for my family and me that time \nhas arrived. I will not seek re-election to the U.S. Senate.\n  Throughout my years in Congress I have been guided by a simple \nphilosophy to make government work for everyone. I did not go to \nWashington to get nothing done other than argue about whose fault it \nwas when we failed to make government work.\n  My sincere hope is that future Congresses will be able to pursue the \ncenter- out coalitions that I have advocated. It is my hope that \ncooperation and legitimate compromise between our political parties \nwill not be seen as political failure, but rather as a means of \nbuilding a stronger democracy that better serves our Nation.\n  To my wife Lois, we started this journey together many years ago and \nyou have been there every step of the way--through the good times, and \nthere were many, and through the not so good times, and there a were a \nfew. I could not have asked for a more helpful and supportive partner \nand friend. No one has been more lucky and fortunate than me in finding \nyou.\n  To my staff here in Louisiana and in Washington, let me say I could \nnot have accomplished anything without you. Our office has the greatest \nof reputations and all of you are truly part of our family--and will \nalways be.\n  To my father Ezra and to Lois' mom, Doris, I say thank you for \nputting up with all the things we dragged you through, whether you \nwanted to be there or not. And to our children, John, Bill, Beth and \nJeff, and Julia, I say thank you for being there--you have made us very \nproud every step of the way.\n  I am not leaving today. There is still a lot to get done this \nCongress. We have to get the energy bill passed, and I want to get \nstarted on legislation for the 40 million Americans who have no health \ninsurance. I look forward to co-chairing with Governor-elect Kathleen \nBlanco the very important summit meeting on healthcare in Louisiana.\n  So this is not goodbye. After working more than half my life on \nissues important to Louisiana, I intend to continue that involvement in \nthe future, but in a different capacity. But for now, thank you for the \nprivilege and honor of serving Louisiana and our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S32-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S32]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING MARCIA COGGS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to remember Marcia \nCoggs, a trailblazer in Wisconsin politics and a dear friend, who \npassed away in December.\n  Words cannot fully express the impact Marcia Coggs had on the lives \nof the people of Wisconsin. She was the first African-American woman \nelected to the State's legislature and was widely known as ``the \nConscience of the State of Wisconsin.'' Marcia also became the first \nAfrican-American to sit on the State legislature's joint finance \ncommittee. Better housing, the best in public education, integration \nand human rights were just some of the causes Marcia championed during \nher 16 years in the Wisconsin Legislature.\n  First elected to the State assembly from Milwaukee in 1976, she \nforced the State to listen and pay attention to the troubling issues \npeople in her district often faced. Civil rights, both in Wisconsin and \nthroughout the world, were always at the forefront of her mind. Those \nwho knew her were not surprised when she protested against apartheid in \nSouth Africa, even joining a demonstration outside that nation's \nWashington, DC, embassy in 1985.\n  I had the honor and privilege of working with Marcia on several \nissues, including a successful effort to make Martin Luther King Jr. \nDay a legal holiday in Wisconsin. We also joined together in fighting \nto establish a private cause of action for civil rights violations.\n  I am honored to have been associated with her and proud to have \ncalled her both a mentor and a friend. Marcia made an outstanding \ncontribution to the lives of countless Wisconsinites and left a legacy \nthat the people of my State will honor for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S32-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S32-S33]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RETIREMENT OF PETTY OFFICER FIRST CLASS FREDERICA MONIQUE WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ngreat American a true patriot: Hospital Corpsman, First Class Petty \nOfficer Frederica Monique Williams, a resident of Selma, AL. Petty \nOfficer Williams began her career as a deck Seaman Recruit at Naval \nHospital Great Lakes as an administrative clerk. There she was selected \nfor Hospital Corpsman ``A'' School at Great Lakes in October 1984, and \nupon graduation, she was assigned to Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune as a \ngeneral duty corpsman where she refined her exceptional patient care \nand organizations skills, and developed into a strong leader and \nmanager.\n  Petty Officer Williams served overseas on numerous occasions to \ninclude a tour at Naval Hospital Rota, Spain. While in Rota, she worked \non a busy Labor and Delivery Unit. Once again her proven clinical \nexperience, caring demeanor, organizational ability and ``can-do'' \nleadership style allowed her to excel. While assigned to National Naval \nMedical Center Bethesda, Maryland, Petty Officer Williams deployed\n\n[[Page S33]]\n\non the Hospital Ship USNS Comfort, T-AH-20, during Desert Shield/Desert \nStorm as member of the Surgical Directorate. There she cared for \nhundreds of reservists that sustained orthopaedic injuries. For her \nfinal assignment, she was assigned as the Administrative Department \nHead at the TRICARE Mid-Atlantic, Lead Agent Office Norfolk, VA.\n  In every assignment, First Class Petty Officer Williams met the \nchallenge, and was rewarded with greater responsibilities and \nopportunities. Her talent for teaching and mentoring junior personnel \nabout the delivery of quality patient care, customer service, and \nadministrative attention to detail was instrumental in providing Navy \nMedicine, the fine cadre of hospital corpsman serving today. She is a \nhospital corpsman and leader who always put the welfare of her staff \nand patients first. Petty Officer William's performance reflects \ngreatly on herself, the United States Navy, and our country. I extend \nmy deepest appreciation to Hospital Corpsman First Class Petty Officer \nFrederica Monique Williams for her 20 years of dedicated military \nservice and wish her and her family all the best in the years to \nfollow. I am glad to hear that she expects to be returning to Selma. \nOur State will greatly benefit from her return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S33-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S33]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO MR.

He \nwas chosen by the more than 500 union members who work at that plant to \nbe their voice. During his tenure as president, Mr. Owens fought for \nhis fellow workers and led them through an important, but difficult, 5-\nmonth strike in 2003. His leadership on this issue helped to protect \nthe jobs and interests of the people of Paducah.\n  Aside from this highly publicized event, Mr. Owens worked tirelessly \non plant cleanup, worker health and economic development issues. He \nshared his expertise and time with me and my colleagues in Congress, \ntestifying most recently at the Energy Committee field hearing in \nPaducah in December and at a hearing here in November.\n  Mr. Owens also serves on the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker \nHealth which advises the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the \nimplementation of NIOSH's responsibilities under the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program Act. This important and \ncomplicated issue is just another example of Mr. Owens's dedication to \nthe workers in Paducah.\n  The working people of Kentucky are fortunate to have had the \nleadership of Mr. Owens. His example of dedication, hard work and \ncompassion should be an inspiration to all throughout the Commonwealth.\n  Thank you, Leon, for your leadership during a difficult period of \nhistory for the Paducah Plant. You have shown fortitude and compassion \nand I have sincere appreciation for your work.

Mr. President, as the Senate convenes for its \nfirst session of the new year, I would like to call attention to a \nmilestone reached 4 days ago by a financial institution with a long \nhistory in Lincoln, IL: the State Bank of Lincoln.\n  On Friday, January 16, 2004, the State Bank of Lincoln celebrated the \ncompletion of 100 years of financial service to the community of \nLincoln and the people of Logan County. The bank first opened its doors \nfor business on January 16, 1904, and it has operated as an independent \nbank ever since.\n  When the bank began to serve the people of Lincoln, it had $50,000 in \nstarting capital. By the end of its first year, the bank's assets had \nnearly doubted to $93,000. That growth has continued through the years. \nToday, the bank has total assets in excess of $170 million, serves the \ncommunity in four locations, and has received an A+ rating from the \nWeiss Rating Service.\n  The State Bank of Lincoln has more than $140 million in local \ndeposits, and has provided more than $100 million in loans to \nbusinesses, farmers, and other individuals, to help them achieve their \ngoals and dreams. The bank also has invested in the bonds of local \nschool districts, colleges, and public entities.\n  As the State Bank of Lincoln passes this important milestone in its \nhistory, I would like to extend my congratulations to all who have \nhelped this financial institution serve the community for so many \nyears, along with my best wishes for another 100 years of committed \nservice to the people of Lincoln and Logan County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S33-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S33]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING SPRING LAKE HEIGHTS, NJ MAYOR FRANK ADAMS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

By \nbringing hope to the oppressed, and delivering justice\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\nto the violent, they are making America more secure.\n  Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are \ntracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger \nlists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are \npatrolling our coasts and borders. And their vigilance is protecting \nAmerica.\n  Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in \nthe world. The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief you \npassed is working.\n  Tonight, Members of Congress can take pride in great works of \ncompassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible. You are \nraising the standards of our public schools; and you are giving our \nsenior citizens prescription drug coverage under Medicare.\n  We have faced serious challenges together--and now we face a choice. \nWe can go forward with confidence and resolve--or we can turn back to \nthe dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw \nregimes are no threat to us. We can press on with economic growth, and \nreforms in education and Medicare--or we can turn back to the old \npolicies and old divisions.\n  We have not come all this way--through tragedy, and trial, and war--\nonly to falter and leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to \nthe tasks of history, and they expect the same of us. In their efforts, \ntheir enterprise, and their character, the American people are showing \nthat the state of our Union is confident and strong.\n  Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American \npeople. Twenty-eight months have passed since September 11, 2001--over \n2 years without an attack on American soil--and it is tempting to \nbelieve that the danger is behind us. That hope is understandable, \ncomforting--and false. The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta, \nCasablanca, Riyadh, Mombassa, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Baghdad. The \nterrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world. \nAnd by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated.\n  Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to \ngive homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they \nneed to defend us. And one of those essential tools is the PATRIOT Act, \nwhich allows Federal law enforcement to better share information, to \ntrack terrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets. \nFor years, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug \ntraffickers. If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are \neven more important for hunting terrorists. Key provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act are set to expire next year. The terrorist threat will not \nexpire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vital \nlegislation to protect our citizens--you need to renew the PATRIOT Act.\n  America is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this \nwar. Last March, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a mastermind of September \n11th, awoke to find himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani \nauthorities. Last August 11th brought the capture of the terrorist \nHambali, who was a key player in the attack in Indonesia that killed \nover 200 people. We are tracking al-Qaida around the world--and nearly \ntwo-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed. \nThousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on a \nmanhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and \ncaves--and, one by one, we will bring the terrorists to justice.\n  As part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the \nregimes that harbor and support terrorists, and could supply them with \nnuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. The United States and our \nallies are determined: We refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate \ndanger.\n  The first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made \nAfghanistan the primary training base of al-Qaida killers. As of this \nmonth, that country has a new constitution, guaranteeing free elections \nand full participation by women. Businesses are opening, healthcare \ncenters are being established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan \nare back in school. With help from the new Afghan Army, our coalition \nis leading aggressive raids against surviving members of the Taliban \nand al-Qaida. The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation \nthat is free, and proud, and fighting terror--and America is honored to \nbe their friend.\n  Since we last met in this chamber, combat forces of the United \nStates, Great Britain, Australia, Poland, and other countries enforced \nthe demands of the United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein--\nand the people of Iraq are free. Having broken the Baathist regime, we \nface a remnant of violent Saddam supporters. Men who ran away from our \ntroops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows.\n  These killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a serious, \ncontinuing danger. Yet we are making progress against them. The once \nall-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole, and now sits in a \nprison cell. Of the top 55 officials of the former regime, we have \ncaptured or killed 45. Our forces are on the offensive, leading over \n1,600 patrols a day, and conducting an average of 180 raids every week. \nWe are dealing with these thugs in Iraq, just as surely as we dealt \nwith Saddam Hussein's evil regime.\n\n  The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America \nhas always been willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last \nJanuary, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man. Today our \ncoalition is working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic \nlaw, with a bill of rights. We are working with Iraqis and the United \nNations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the \nend of June. As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom \nwill do all in their power to spread violence and fear. They are trying \nto shake the will of our country and our friends--but the United States \nof America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. The \nkillers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom.\n  Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own \nsecurity and their own future. And tonight we are honored to welcome \none of Iraq's most respected leaders: the current President of the \nIraqi Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi. Sir, America stands with you \nand the Iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation.\n  Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for \nthe better. Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to \ndisclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction \nprograms, including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons. \nColonel Qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be better off, \nand far more secure, without weapons of mass murder. Nine months of \nintense negotiations involving the United States and Great Britain \nsucceeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not. \nAnd one reason is clear: for diplomacy to be effective, words must be \ncredible--and no one can now doubt the word of America.\n  Different threats require different strategies. Along with nations in \nthe region, we are insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear \nprogram. America and the international community are demanding that \nIran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons. America is \ncommitted to keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the \nhands of the world's most dangerous regimes.\n  When I came to this rostrum on September 20, 2001, I brought the \npolice shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended, and \na task that does not end. I gave to you and to all Americans my \ncomplete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies. \nAnd this pledge, given by one, has been kept by many. You in the \nCongress have provided the resources for our defense, and cast the \ndifficult votes of war and peace. Our closest allies have been \nunwavering. America's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been \nskilled and tireless.\n  And the men and women of the American military--they have taken the \nhardest duty. We have seen their skill and courage in armored charges, \nand midnight raids, and lonely hours on faithful watch. We have seen \nthe joy when they return, and felt the sorrow when one is lost. I have \nhad the honor of meeting our service men and women at many posts, from \nthe deck of a carrier in the Pacific, to a mess hall in Baghdad. Many \nof our troops are listening tonight. And I want you and\n\n[[Page S35]]\n\nyour families to know: America is proud of you. And my Administration, \nand this Congress, will give you the resources you need to fight and \nwin the war on terror.\n  I know that some people question if America is really in a war at \nall. They view terrorism more as a crime--a problem to be solved mainly \nwith law enforcement and indictments. After the World Trade Center was \nfirst attacked in 1993, some of the guilty were indicted, tried, \nconvicted, and sent to prison. But the matter was not settled. The \nterrorists were still training and plotting in other nations, and \ndrawing up more ambitious plans. After the chaos and carnage of \nSeptember 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal \npapers. The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United \nStates--and war is what they got.\n  Some in this chamber, and in our country, did not support the \nliberation of Iraq. Objections to war often come from principled \nmotives. But let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam \nHussein in power. We are seeking all the facts--already the Kay Report \nidentified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program \nactivities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed \nfrom the United Nations. Had we failed to act, the dictator's weapons \nof mass destruction programs would continue to this day. Had we failed \nto act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been revealed \nas empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance \nby dictators around the world. Iraq's torture chambers would still be \nfilled with victims--terrified and innocent. The killing fields of \nIraq--where hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children vanished \ninto the sands--would still be known only to the killers. For all who \nlove freedom and peace, the world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a \nbetter and safer place.\n  Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized. \nThis particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in \nBritain, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, \nItaly, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the \nNetherlands, Norway, El Salvador, and the 17 other countries that have \ncommitted troops to Iraq. As we debate at home, we must never ignore \nthe vital contributions of our international partners, or dismiss their \nsacrifices. From the beginning, America has sought international \nsupport for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much \nsupport. There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of \nmany nations, and submitting to the objections of a few. America will \nnever seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people.\n\n  We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the \ngreater Middle East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken, and \ncondescending, to assume that whole cultures and great religions are \nincompatible with liberty and self-government. I believe that God has \nplanted in every heart the desire to live in freedom. And even when \nthat desire is crushed by tyranny for decades, it will rise again.\n  As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny, despair, and \nanger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the \nsafety of America and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward \nstrategy of freedom in the greater Middle East. We will challenge the \nenemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher \nstandard from our friends. To cut through the barriers of hateful \npropaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are \nexpanding their programming in Arabic and Persian--and soon, a new \ntelevision service will begin providing reliable news and information \nacross the region. I will send you a proposal to double the budget of \nthe National Endowment for Democracy, and to focus its new work on the \ndevelopment of free elections, free markets, free press, and free labor \nunions in the Middle East. And above all, we will finish the historic \nwork of democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq, so those nations can light \nthe way for others, and help transform a troubled part of the world.\n  America is a Nation with a mission--and that mission comes from our \nmost basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of \nempire. Our aim is a democratic peace--a peace founded upon the dignity \nand rights of every man and woman. America acts in this cause with \nfriends and allies at our side, yet we understand our special calling: \nThis great Republic will lead the cause of freedom.\n  In these last 3 years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental \nstrengths of the American economy. We have come through recession, and \nterrorist attack, and corporate scandals, and the uncertainties of war. \nAnd because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this \neconomy is strong, and growing stronger.\n  You have doubled the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000, reduced \nthe marriage penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced taxes \non capital gains and stock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, \nand you have lowered taxes for every American who pays income taxes.\n  Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this \neconomy forward. The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of \n2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years. New home construction: the \nhighest in almost 20 years. Home ownership rates: the highest ever. \nManufacturing activity is increasing. Inflation is low. Interest rates \nare low. Exports are growing. Productivity is high. And jobs are on the \nrise.\n  These numbers confirm that the American people are using their money \nfar better than Government would have--and you were right to return it.\n  America's growing economy is also a changing economy. As technology \ntransforms the way almost every job is done, America becomes more \nproductive, and workers need new skills. Much of our job growth will be \nfound in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology. So we \nmust respond by helping more Americans gain the skills to find good \njobs in our new economy.\n  All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are \nsupposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too \nlong, for too many children, those skills were never mastered. By \npassing the No Child Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of \nliteracy the law of our country. We are providing more funding for our \nschools--a 36 percent increase since 2001. We are requiring higher \nstandards. We are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals. We \nare reporting results to parents, and making sure they have better \noptions when schools are not performing. We are making progress toward \nexcellence for every child.\n  But the status quo always has defenders. Some want to undermine the \nNo Child Left Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability. Yet \nthe results we require are really a matter of common sense: We expect \nthird graders to read and do math at third grade level--and that is not \nasking too much. Testing is the only way to identify and help students \nwho are falling behind.\n  This Nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children \nalong from grade to grade without them learning the basics. I refuse to \ngive up on any child--and the No Child Left Behind Act is opening the \ndoor of opportunity to all of America's children.\n  At the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can \ngain the skills they need to find work now. Many of the fastest-growing \noccupations require strong math and science preparation, and training \nbeyond the high school level. So tonight I propose a series of measures \ncalled Jobs for the 21st Century. This program will provide extra help \nto middle- and high school students who fall behind in reading and \nmath, expand Advanced Placement programs in low-income schools, and \ninvite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach \npart-time in our high schools. I propose larger Pell Grants for \nstudents who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school. \nI propose increasing our support for America's fine community colleges, \nso they can train workers for the industries that are creating the most \nnew jobs. By all these actions, we will help more and more Americans to \njoin in the growing prosperity of our country.\n\n  Job training is important, and so is job creation. We must continue \nto pursue an aggressive, pro-growth economic agenda.\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\n  Congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes. The tax \nreductions you passed are set to expire. Unless you act, the unfair tax \non marriage will go back up. Unless you act, millions of families will \nbe charged $300 more in Federal taxes for every child. Unless you act, \nsmall businesses will pay higher taxes. Unless you act, the death tax \nwill eventually come back to life. Unless you act, Americans face a tax \nincrease. What the Congress has given, the Congress should not take \naway: For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed should be \npermanent.\n  Our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and \nemployees with relief from needless Federal regulation, and protect \nthem from junk and frivolous lawsuits. Consumers and businesses need \nreliable supplies of energy to make our economy run--so I urge you to \npass legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote \nconservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of \nenergy. My Administration is promoting free and fair trade, to open up \nnew markets for America's entrepreneurs, and manufacturers, and \nfarmers, and to create jobs for America's workers. Younger workers \nshould have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their \nSocial Security taxes in a personal retirement account. We should make \nthe Social Security system a source of ownership for the American \npeople.\n  And we should limit the burden of Government on this economy by \nacting as good stewards of taxpayer dollars. In 2 weeks, I will send \nyou a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets \nimportant domestic needs, while limiting the growth in discretionary \nspending to less than 4 percent. This will require that Congress focus \non priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's \nmoney. By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Tonight I also ask you to reform our immigration laws, so they \nreflect our values and benefit our economy. I propose a new temporary \nworker program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers, \nwhen no Americans can be found to fill the job. This reform will be \ngood for our economy--because employers will find needed workers in an \nhonest and orderly system. A temporary worker program will help protect \nour homeland--allowing border patrol and law enforcement to focus on \ntrue threats to our national security. I oppose amnesty, because it \nwould encourage further illegal immigration, and unfairly reward those \nwho break our laws. My temporary worker program will preserve the \ncitizenship path for those who respect the law, while bringing millions \nof hardworking men and women out from the shadows of American life.\n  Our Nation's healthcare system, like our economy, is also in a time \nof change. Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives. \nThis dramatic progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising \ncosts of medical care and health insurance. Members of Congress, we \nmust work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits \nof modern medicine throughout our country.\n  Meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort--and 2 months ago, you \nshowed the way. By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription \ndrug benefit, you kept a basic commitment to our seniors: You are \ngiving them the modern medicine they deserve.\n  Starting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to \nreceive a drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the \nretail price of most prescription drugs--and millions of low-income \nseniors can get an additional $600 to buy medicine. Beginning next \nyear, seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against \ndiabetes and heart disease, and seniors just entering Medicare can \nreceive wellness exams.\n  In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare. For a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors who do not \nhave that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly \nin half. Under this reform, senior citizens will be able to keep their \nMedicare just as it is, or they can choose a Medicare plan that fits \nthem best--just as you, as Members of Congress, can choose an insurance \nplan that meets your needs. And starting this year, millions of \nAmericans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical \nexpenses, in a health savings account.\n  I signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices \nof our seniors, or to take away their prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare, will meet my veto.\n  On the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that \nAmericans can choose and afford private healthcare coverage that best \nfits their individual needs. To make insurance more affordable, \nCongress must act to address rapidly rising healthcare costs. Small \nbusinesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower \ninsurance rates, so they can cover more workers with health insurance--\nI urge you to pass Association Health Plans. I ask you to give lower-\nincome Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to \nbuy their own basic health insurance. By computerizing health records, \nwe can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs, and improve \ncare. To protect the doctor-patient relationship, and keep good doctors \ndoing good work, we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical \nlawsuits. And tonight I propose that individuals who buy catastrophic \nhealthcare coverage, as part of our new health savings accounts, be \nallowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their taxes.\n\n  A Government-run healthcare system is the wrong prescription. By \nkeeping costs under control, expanding access, and helping more \nAmericans afford coverage, we will preserve the system of private \nmedicine that makes America's health care the best in the world.\n  We are living in a time of great change--in our world, in our \neconomy, and in science and medicine. Yet some things endure--courage \nand compassion, reverence and integrity, respect for differences of \nfaith and race. The values we try to live by never change. And they are \ninstilled in us by fundamental institutions, such as families, and \nschools, and religious congregations. These institutions--the unseen \npillars of civilization--must remain strong in America, and we will \ndefend them.\n  We must stand with our families to help them raise healthy, \nresponsible children. And when it comes to helping children make right \nchoices, there is work for all of us to do.\n  One of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their \nlives and futures on drugs. Our Government is helping parents confront \nthis problem, with aggressive education, treatment, and law \nenforcement. Drug use in high school has declined by 11 percent over \nthe past 2 years. Four hundred thousand fewer young people are using \nillegal drugs than in the year 2001. In my budget, I have proposed new \nfunding to continue our aggressive, community-based strategy to reduce \ndemand for illegal drugs. Drug testing in our schools has proven to be \nan effective part of this effort. So tonight I propose an additional \n$23 million for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save \nchildren's lives. The aim here is not to punish children, but to send \nthem this message: We love you, and we don't want to lose you.\n  To help children make right choices, they need good examples. \nAthletics play such an important role in our society, but, \nunfortunately, some in professional sports are not setting much of an \nexample. The use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in \nbaseball, football, and other sports is dangerous, and it sends the \nwrong message--that there are shortcuts to accomplishment, and that \nperformance is more important than character. So tonight I call on team \nowners, union representatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, \nto send the right signal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now.\n  To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the \ndangers young people face--even when they are difficult to talk about. \nEach year, about three million teenagers contract sexually transmitted \ndiseases that can harm them, or kill them, or prevent them from ever \nbecoming parents. In my budget, I propose a grassroots campaign to help \ninform families about these medical risks. We will double Federal \nfunding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact of \nlife: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid \nsexually\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\ntransmitted diseases. Decisions children make now can affect their \nhealth and character for the rest of their lives. All of us--parents, \nschools, government--must work together to counter the negative \ninfluence of the culture, and to send the right messages to our \nchildren.\n  A strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I \nbelieve we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for \none of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization. \nCongress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense \nof Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton. That statute \nprotects marriage under Federal law as the union of a man and a woman, \nand declares that one State may not redefine marriage for other States. \nActivist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court \norder, without regard for the will of the people and their elected \nrepresentatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's \nvoice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will \nupon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the \nconstitutional process. Our Nation must defend the sanctity of \nmarriage.\n  The outcome of this debate is important--and so is the way we conduct \nit. The same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that \neach individual has dignity and value in God's sight.\n  It is also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the \ncompassion of America's religious institutions. Religious charities of \nevery creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country--\nmentoring children, feeding the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely. \nYet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to \nthese groups, just because they have a cross or Star of David or \ncrescent on the wall. By Executive Order, I have opened billions of \ndollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based \ncharities. Tonight I ask you to codify this into law, so people of \nfaith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again.\n\n  In the past, we have worked together to bring mentors to the children \nof prisoners, and provide treatment for the addicted, and help for the \nhomeless. Tonight I ask you to consider another group of Americans in \nneed of help. This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from \nprison back into society. We know from long experience that if they \ncan't find work, or a home, or help, they are much more likely to \ncommit more crimes and return to prison. So tonight, I propose a 4-\nyear, $300 million Prisoner Re-Entry Initiative to expand job training \nand placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help \nnewly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based \ngroups. America is the land of the second chance--and when the gates of \nthe prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.\n  For all Americans, the last 3 years have brought tests we did not ask \nfor, and achievements shared by all. By our actions, we have shown what \nkind of Nation we are. In grief, we found the grace to go on. In \nchallenge, we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people. In \nvictory, we have shown the noble aims and good heart of America. And \nhaving come this far, we sense that we live in a time set apart.\n  I have been a witness to the character of the American people, who \nhave shown calm in times of danger, compassion for one another, and \ntoughness for the long haul. All of us have been partners in a great \nenterprise. And even some of the youngest understand that we are living \nin historic times. Last month a girl in Lincoln, Rhode Island, sent me \na letter. It began, ``Dear George W. Bush.'' ``If there is anything you \nknow, I Ashley Pearson age 10 can do to help anyone, please send me a \nletter and tell me what I can do to save our country.'' She added this \nP.S.: ``If you can send a letter to the troops . . . please put, \n`Ashley Pearson believes in you.' ''\n  Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops has just been conveyed. \nAnd yes, you have some duties yourself. Study hard in school, listen to \nyour mom and dad, help someone in need, and when you and your friends \nsee a man or woman in uniform, say ``thank you.'' And while you do your \npart, all of us here in this great chamber will do our best to keep you \nand the rest of America safe and free.\n  My fellow citizens, we now move forward, with confidence and faith. \nOur Nation is strong and steadfast. The cause we serve is right, \nbecause it is the cause of all mankind. The momentum of freedom in our \nworld is unmistakable--and it is not carried forward by our power \nalone. We can trust in that greater power Who guides the unfolding of \nthe years. And in all that is to come, we can know that His purposes \nare just and true.\n  May God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, January 20, 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S37-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S37]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests \nthat concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to provide better protection against bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy and other prion diseases; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould strengthen consumer confidence in the safety of our nation's beef \nsupply while expanding our understanding of the many prion diseases \nthat affect both humans and animals. This bill, known as the BSE and \nOther Prion Disease Prevention and Public Health Protection Act \ncodifies some of USDA's recent steps, requires more aggressive testing \nof older cattle and expands surveillance for Chronic Wasting Disease \n(CWD) in deer and elk and Creutzfedt-Jacob disease (CJD) in people.\n  Our country has been blessed with the safest and most abundant food \nsupply in the world, but we can do better. The events surrounding the \ndiagnosis of the first Mad Cow case in Washington State demonstrate \nthat improvements are possible. Had the provisions of my bill been in \nplace in early December, the animal would never have been allowed to \nenter both the human food supply and the consumer product system and \ncontaminate 2.8 million pounds of products.\n  Currently, only 20,000 out of 35 million cattle presented for \nprocessing are tested for BSE. How many cattle in America have BSE? We \nare hopeful that there was only this one isolated case but the truth is \nthat we don't know because we test so few animals. Answering that \nquestion today is similar to trying to estimate the prevalence of HIV \ninfection in people by only testing individuals who have symptoms of \nAIDS. At the current level of testing, we have no real estimate of the \ntrue prevalence rate of BSE in our country.\n  A similar situation exists with respect to CWD, in deer and elk, or \nCJD in humans. The bill that I am introducing provides for more testing \nof all ruminants intended for human consumption as well as expanded \nsurveillance for the human prion diseases.\n  Better surveillance: The bill requires the use of rapid BSE tests for \nall cattle and bison over 30 months of age and for all sheep, goats, \ndeer and elk over 12 months of age. Rapid tests can provide results the \nsame day that they are taken instead of the current five to seven days. \nAlthough most sampling and testing for BSE will occur through USDA \ninspectors at slaughterhouses, the bill also provides for on-farm \nsampling of non-ambulatory animals. In addition, all ruminants of any \nage exhibiting neurological symptoms would be tested.\n  All tested animals would be held until the results of the test are \nknown rather than being released into the food supply and consumer \nproduct system, as was the case in Washington. An expensive and time-\nconsuming recall of products would be avoided.\n  The bill also requires the development of a mandatory ruminant \nidentification program to allow for trace back of diseased animals to \ntheir farm of origin within 48 hrs after diagnosis. This is significant \nnot only for BSE but for other reportable illnesses such as \nbrucellosis, tuberculosis and foot and mouth disease.\n  There are also provisions that require expanded coordination of \ntesting for CWD in farm-raised and wild deer and elk. To support \nexpanded ruminant testing for prion diseases, the bill calls for the \nexpansion of the national animal health laboratory network to include \nstate and university veterinary diagnostic laboratories.\n  Similarly, the bill expands the sampling of suspected cases of human \nCJD through the National Prion Disease Pathology Research Center at \nCase Western Reserve University.\n  Targeting Risk Materials: The bill updates and expands the definition \nof BSE specified risk materials and bans the use of such materials from \ncattle over 30 months of age for any use.\n  Importation of ruminant-based products: The bill expands the list of \nruminant derived products that must be labeled for contents and country \nof origin and bans imported products containing ruminant-derived \nmaterials from countries identified as at-risk for BSE transmission.\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\n  Feed Ban: The bill closes loopholes in the USDA rules on recycling \npet food and poultry litter back into ruminant feed. The legislation \nrequires FDA to develop a database for handlers of livestock, renderers \nand feed mills and feed blenders.\n  We currently have only a limited understanding of prions and the \ndiseases that they cause. To understand how these significant and \nchallenging misfolded bits of protein can affect us, we need better \ndata. We need data on which to base sound policy for our public health, \nfor our animal health and for the safety of our food supply.\n  While we are accumulating that data, we need to take every reasonable \nstep to ensure that we do not introduce infective material through \nimportation or through feeding our ruminant animals contaminated feed. \nAn expanded testing program will demonstrate to our trading partners \nthat they have nothing to fear in buying our meat products.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to strengthen consumer \nconfidence in the safety of our food supply. The BSE and Other Prion \nDisease Prevention and Public Health Protection Act can provide the \npublic with the confidence that our beef and venison is safe to eat and \ncan assure our trading partners that we are aggressively addressing BSE \nsurveillance in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2008. A bill to amend the Animal Health Protection Act to direct \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to establish an electronic nationwide \nlivestock identification system, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am now introducing legislation \nidentified as the National Farm Animal Identification Records Act on \nbehalf of Senator Leahy and myself.\n  Less than a month ago, on December 25, a case of mad cow disease was \ndiagnosed in a single nonambulatory dairy cow that was slaughtered in \nWashington State. This cow belonged to a herd of some 82 dairy cows \nwhich were cleared for clearance in the United States in 2002. This \ncase of mad cow disease has caused quite an alarm, with enormous impact \non the industry for providing meats in the United States. It has caused \na lot of concern throughout the country.\n  This legislation is directed to having an identification system, an \nelectronic nationwide livestock identification system which will enable \nthe Federal Government, the Department of Agriculture, to identify \nanimals. There is a chip in the animal's ear and it will be possible to \nidentify the animals and where they came from so that in the event \nthere is any diagnosis of mad cow disease, there will be a way to deal \nwith it and to prevent its spread and provide public confidence that \nthe meat is not infected with mad cow disease.\n  This disease has had a very major impact on the livestock industry, \ntouching Pennsylvania, my State, as well as many other States in the \ncountry. This is a salutary, preventive legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent a full copy of the text be printed in the \nCongressional Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                                S. 2008\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Farm Animal \n     Identification and Records Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONWIDE LIVESTOCK IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM; REVIEW OF \n                   USDA RESPONSES TO OUTBREAKS OF DISEASE IN \n                   LIVESTOCK.\n\n       Section 10411 of the Animal Health Protection Act (7 U.S.C. \n     8310) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Nationwide Livestock Identification System.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall establish \n     an electronic nationwide livestock identification system for \n     the identification of individual animals to enhance the speed \n     and accuracy of the response of the Department of Agriculture \n     to outbreaks of disease in livestock.\n       ``(2) Capabilities.--The livestock identification system \n     shall be capable of tracing, within 48 hours, an individual \n     animal from birth to slaughter.\n       ``(3) Participation by states.--The States shall provide \n     information for inclusion in, and shall have access to, the \n     livestock identification system.\n       ``(4) Use of existing technology.--The Secretary may use \n     technology developed by private entities before the date of \n     enactment of this subsection to operate the livestock \n     identification system.\n       ``(5) Financial assistance.--The Secretary may provide \n     financial assistance to producers to assist the producers in \n     complying with the livestock identification system.\n       ``(6) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this subsection for fiscal \n     year 2004 $50,000,000, of which $25,000,000 shall be \n     available to carry out paragraph (5).\n       ``(g) Review of Responses to Outbreaks of Disease.--The \n     Secretary may appoint an international panel of scientific \n     experts to provide an objective review of a response by the \n     Department of Agriculture to an outbreak of disease in \n     livestock and identify areas for improvements in such \n     responses.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the National Farm \nAnimal Identification and Records Act or the FAIR Act, with my friend \nand colleague Senator Specter. This legislation would establish a \nuniform national electronic animal identification program to trace \nanimals from birth to slaughter, within 48 hours, in order to combat \nanimal disease outbreaks.\n  As the recent discovery of a cow infected with bovine spongiform \nencephalopathy, BSE, or mad cow disease, in Washington State \ndemonstrated, a verifiable nationwide animal identification system is \nurgently needed to enhance the speed and accuracy of USDA's response to \ndisease outbreaks. Unfortunately to date only, 23 of the 81 cows that \ncame from Canada with the infected mad cow have been able to be located \nbecause of inadequate records. The National Farm Animal Identification \nand Records Act FAIR Act would require the Department of Agriculture to \nestablish a national animal identification program for individual \nanimals that could trace an animal's history within 48 hours.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nCommittee, I have long advocated for the establishment of a national \nanimal identification system. For the last 5 years I have worked with \nthe Holstein Association in Brattleboro, Vermont to begin the process \nof creating a national animal identification program. The Holstein \nAssociation's pilot program, a precursor to this national animal \nidentification program legislation, electronically identifies \nindividual animals and tracks their movements from birth to slaughter \nwithin 48 hours. To date Holstein's pilot program has close to a \nmillion bovines enrolled from over 7000 farms in 42 States and has \nproven its electronic animal tracking capabilities.\n  The Holstein project demonstrates electronically tracing individual \nanimals immediately is achievable. The technology and expertise \ndeveloped by the Holstein Association is a prime example of how the \nDepartment could immediately begin tracking individual newborn animals \nelectronically with a system similar to National FAIR. The Holstein \nAssociation could be an important partner with USDA in reducing the \nimpact of future animal diseases.\n  I would also like to applaud Secretary Veneman's announcement last \nmonth of additional mad cow safeguards, including moving toward a \nnational animal identification system. I believe this was a positive \nstep toward protecting American farmers and consumers. Unfortunately \nUSDA's current plans do not call for individual animal identification \nto be completed until mid 2006. The FAIR Act would require the \nDepartment to begin implementation of a national system within months \nof passage. In addition, it is clear USDA will need additional \nresources to carry out a national animal identification program, thus \nour legislation will provide additional funding for USDA to begin this \nwork immediately. Furthermore to ensure producers are not hurt by the \npotential costs of a national system, our bill will provide financial \nassistance for producers to carry out a national identification system.\n  It is time for the United States to take serious steps to combat \nanimal diseases, like BSE, that have broad public health implications \nfor our Nation. A national animal identification program is long \noverdue. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH:\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\n  S. 2009. A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to \nrequire the Secretary of the Interior to give greater weight to \nscientific or commercial data that is empirical or has been field-\ntested or peer-reviewed, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today as my first legislative action of the \nnew session, I am introducing important legislation that would require \na higher standard for the science used in administering the Endangered \nSpecies Act. The Sound Science for Endangered Species Act Planning Act \nof 2004 would require independent scientific peer review of certain \nactions taken by the regulatory agencies under the Endangered Species \nAct. In addition, it would require the Secretary of the Interior and \nthe Secretary of Commerce to give greater weight to scientific or \ncommercial data that is empirical or has been field-tested or peer-\nreviewed.\n  In recent years, we in the northwest have experienced a number of \nsituations in which Federal agency scientists either demanded actions \nnot supported by scientific data, or actually fabricated the data \nitself. In December 2001, it was revealed that Federal employees had \nsubmitted hairs from a captive Canada lynx as though they had been \nrecovered during field surveys in several national forests to determine \nthe range and habitat of this threatened species.\n  It was also revealed in an Oregon newspaper that a Forest Service \nbiologist criticized his own agency for shoddy work. This employee \ncalled into question much of the information collected over 18 years on \none national forest, claiming that determinations for projects were \nbased on sketchy information that was not accomplished according to \nprotocol, or not collected at all. Rather than denying these charges, \nthe Forest Service acknowledged that they had some validity, and \nlaunched an investigation.\n  The most egregious example of decisions not based on scientific \nevidence, however, occurred in the Klamath Basin in 2001. As many of \nyou may recall, I have come to the floor of the Senate on many \noccasions over the last several years to plead the case of the farmers \nand ranchers in the Klamath Basin. In 2001, field-level biologists with \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries \nService developed two separate biological opinions on the operation of \nthe Klamath Project, as it related to suckers and coho salmon, \nrespectively.\n  Taken together, these two biological opinions sought to both raise \nthe lake of level of Upper Klamath Lake and increase flows in the \nKlamath River, at the time the basin was experiencing a severe drought. \nOn April 6, 2001, the Bureau of Reclamation announced that the agency \nwould deliver no water to most of the agricultural lands that had \nreceived irrigation water from the Federal project for almost 100 \nyears.\n  I cannot begin to describe the human toll that these biological \nopinions exacted on the farmers and ranchers in the Klamath Basin. \nThose who still have their farms lost most of their farm income that \nyear. Many depleted their life savings just to hold onto their land. \nRanchers were forced to sell off livestock herds that year. Stable farm \nworker communities were decimated as families moved to find work.\n  The real tragedy is that none of this had to occur. Late last year, \nscientists with the National Research Council found that the two key \ndecisions regarding the operation of the Klamath Project that deprived \nfarmers of their water lacked ``substantial scientific support.''\n  This situation should never be repeated. Decisions of this magnitude \nunder the Endangered Species Act must be peer reviewed, and some \nstandard for the science used in these decisions must be established.\n  I was in Klamath Falls the day after the decision was made to cut off \nwater to the farmers. I will never forget the anguish on the faces of \nthe people I met with that day. Many were World War II veterans who \nreceived homesteads in this Basin after the war or their children, none \nof whom could believe that this action was being taken by a government \n``of the people, for the people, and by the people.''\n  Our constituents deserve better from their Government. They will get \nit if this bill is enacted. There is an identical bill in the House \nthat has bipartisan support, and 63 cosponsors. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in cosponsoring this reasonable bill to help restore sound \nscience to agency decisionmaking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/20/senate-section/article/S56-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S56]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 284--COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM V. \n       ROTH, JR., FORMER MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE FROM \n       THE STATE OF DELAWARE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Frist, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, \nMr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nChafee, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nDayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Graham of South \nCarolina, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, \nMr. Hollings, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \nLott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Miller, \nMs. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Sununu, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \nWyden) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Class action lawsuits are an important and valuable \n     part of the legal system when they permit the fair and \n     efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties \n     by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action \n     against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.\n       (2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the \n     class action device that have--\n       (A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and \n     defendants that have acted responsibly;\n       (B) adversely affected interstate commerce; and\n       (C) undermined public respect for our judicial system.\n       (3) Class members often receive little or no benefit from \n     class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where--\n       (A) counsel are awarded large fees, while leaving class \n     members with coupons or other awards of little or no value;\n       (B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at \n     the expense of other class members; and\n       (C) confusing notices are published that prevent class \n     members from being able to fully understand and effectively \n     exercise their rights.\n       (4) Abuses in class actions undermine the national judicial \n     system, the free flow of interstate commerce, and the concept \n     of diversity jurisdiction as intended by the framers of the \n     United States Constitution, in that State and local courts \n     are--\n       (A) keeping cases of national importance out of Federal \n     court;\n       (B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against \n     out-of-State defendants; and\n       (C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on \n     other States and bind the rights of the residents of those \n     States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members \n     with legitimate claims;\n       (2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States \n     Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of \n     interstate cases of national importance under diversity \n     jurisdiction; and\n       (3) benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering \n     consumer prices.\n\n      SEC. 3.

Coupon Settlements.\n\n       ``(a) Contingent Fees in Coupon Settlements.--If a proposed \n     settlement in a class action provides for a recovery of \n     coupons to a class member, the portion of any attorney's fee \n     award to class counsel that is attributable to the award of \n     the coupons shall be based on the value to class members of \n     the coupons that are redeemed.\n       ``(b) Other Attorney's Fee Awards in Coupon Settlements.--\n       ``(1) In general.--If a proposed settlement in a class \n     action provides for a recovery of coupons to class members, \n     and a portion of the recovery of the coupons is not used to \n     determine the attorney's fee to be paid to class counsel, any \n     attorney's fee award shall be based upon the amount of time \n     class counsel reasonably expended working on the action.\n       ``(2) Court approval.--Any attorney's fee under this \n     subsection shall be subject to approval by the court and \n     shall include an appropriate attorney's fee, if any, for \n     obtaining equitable relief, including an injunction, if \n     applicable.

The court, in its \n     discretion, may also require that a proposed settlement \n     agreement provide for the distribution of a portion of the \n     value of unclaimed coupons to 1 or more charitable or \n     governmental organizations, as agreed to by the parties. The \n     distribution and redemption of any proceeds under this \n     subsection shall not be used to calculate attorneys' fees \n     under this section.\n\n     ``Sec. 1713.
