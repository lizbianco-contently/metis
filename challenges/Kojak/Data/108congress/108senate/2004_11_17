Mr. President, today the Senate will begin consideration \nof the debt limit extension bill. Last night we were able to lock in \nthe time agreement of up to 6 hours on the measure with no amendments \nin order. I do not believe all the debate time will be required and \ntherefore would like to vote on that measure, if at all possible, this \nevening. I will talk to the Democratic leadership about that \npossibility. I remind all Members that the House has to consider this \nafter we act. Initially we thought about possibly doing it tomorrow \nnight, but we have come to the general agreement to move ahead today \nbecause the House is waiting for us to act. Therefore, I appreciate \neveryone's consideration to go ahead and debate this afternoon and \nbring this to a vote.\n  I also announce that we want to set aside some time tomorrow to pay \ntribute to our departing Members. We want to let our colleagues know, \nas we look further in the day, what time tomorrow that will occur.\n  Finally, I remind Members we are still trying to close out other \nbusiness. I was talking to the Democratic leader about the other items. \nOne is the intelligence bill, the 9/11 Commission. Under our \nleadership, we set out a plan in late July. I hope we will be able to \ncomplete that over the course of today and tomorrow.\n  Of course, we have the omnibus bill, and we have tremendous \ncooperation on all parts. It is a large bill. It is a complicated bill. \nThe good news is that in a bipartisan way the subcommittees have been \nable to address all of these issues over the last several months. It is \na matter of packaging it, bringing it to the floor, and making sure our \nSenate colleagues have the appropriate opportunity to review that bill.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I continue to ask for everyone's \nassistance and patience as we proceed along these final days and this \nlegislative and executive session and address calendar items.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the views just expressed by the \nmajority leader that we are at a point where we may be able to collapse \nthe time that has been originally requested on the debt limit. I know \nthere are a number of Senators who have expressed a great deal of \ninterest in addressing the issue. The distinguished ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee is here and prepared to speak. But it would be my \nhope, and I would share it with all my colleagues, especially on this \nside of aisle, we could complete the debate today rather than tomorrow \nand have a vote sometime prior to the time we leave for the evening. \nThat, I think, is now doable, and I hope that with both sides of the \naisle cognizant of our expectation we could complete our work this \nevening rather than tomorrow, people might take that into account as \nthey consider the amount of time they may want to request.\n  I understand we are taking up the tax bill, and I am very pleased we \nhave reached an agreement on that. I compliment particularly the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon for his work in that regard.\n  I share the cautious optimism just expressed by the majority leader \nwith regard to appropriations. I think we are still making substantial \nprogress, and it would be our hope that prior to the end of the week we \nwill have an opportunity to address the conference report on that as \nwell, in addition to other matters.\n  It is shaping up to be a reasonably productive week and I look \nforward to completing our work sometime before the end of this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11398-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 150\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the extension of the \ndebt limit. First of all, I thank my colleague from Montana for his \ngreat courtesy in allowing me to go first, because we have a hearing in \nthe Indian Affairs Committee, so I thank my colleague from Montana for \nthis courtesy.\n  Before us is a proposal to extend the debt limit by $800 billion. I \nwill oppose that expansion of the debt limit because there is no plan \nto reduce the deficits and the increase in the debt we are now facing.\n  I think it is a mistake for this body to extend the debt limit by \n$800 billion without a plan to get the deficits under control, to get \nthe debt under control. Instead, what we are doing here is writing \nanother blank check and saying to this administration: Go ahead, \ncontinue to run record budget deficits. Continue to increase the \nnational debt. Do not worry about a plan to reduce this increasing \ndependency on foreign governments, on foreign citizens. Forget about \nfiscal responsibility.\n  An $800 billion increase in the debt. Now, make no mistake, we need \nto extend the debt limit. We have to pay the bills of the United \nStates. So there is no question that we need to extend the debt limit. \nThe question is, by how much. The question is, should we not only do it \nwith a plan to reduce this dependency on borrowing.\n  I believe the answer to those questions is absolutely. We ought to \ninsist that there is a plan to get the deficit under control. We ought \nto insist there is a plan to reduce the buildup of debt. We ought to \ninsist that this administration and this Congress face up to the \nmounting challenges facing this Nation.\n  To review the dramatic change in our fiscal condition, in January of \n2001, we were told we could expect over the next 10 years nearly $6 \ntrillion in surpluses. Now we are told, just 3 years later, nearly 4 \nyears later, instead of trillions of dollars of surpluses, we can \nexpect trillions of dollars of deficits, over $3 trillion deficits. \nThat is a change in our fiscal condition in 4 years of $9 trillion. If \nthat does not cry out for a response, if that does not cry out for this \nCongress and this administration to come up with a plan to address \nthese burgeoning deficits and debt, I do not know what would require a \nresponse.\n  If we look at the last 4 years, we can see that in 2001 the Federal \nGovernment ran a surplus of $127 billion. In 2002, that had turned to a \n$158 billion deficit. In 2003, that deficit had exploded to $377 \nbillion--the biggest deficit in dollar terms in our Nation's history--\nand now in 2004, another record deficit, a deficit of $413 billion--\nrecord red ink and no plan to address it.\n  The President has told us, told us repeatedly, that he has a plan to \ncut the deficit in half over the next 5 years. Do not believe it. Do \nnot believe it any more than the claims the President made that there \nwould be no deficit if we adopted his fiscal plan. The President told \nus--in fact, the President assured us--that we could count on a record \npaydown of the debt if we adopted his fiscal plan. Well, we did, and he \nwas wrong because not only have we not had record paydown of the debt; \nwhat we have had is a dramatic increase in the debt. As we look ahead, \nhere is what we see the deficit looking like over the next 10 years. I \ndo not see any cutting of the deficit in half. The only way the \nPresident gets to his claim that he is going to cut the deficit in half \nis he leaves out things. He leaves out war costs. He leaves out the \nneed to address the alternative minimum tax. He leaves out the effect \nof his own tax proposals.\n  If we take all of those into account--making the tax cut permanent, \nwhich the President has recommended; his defense buildup; the \nalternative minimum tax reform; and ongoing war costs--this is what we \nsee, as the deficits going forward, in the amount that is actually \ngoing to get added to the debt every year. This is an ocean of red ink \nfacing this country. Part of the reason, as I have indicated, is that \nthe President, I am afraid, hid from the American people the true \neffects of his policies.\n  One way he has hidden it is he has changed from 10-year budgeting to \n5-year budgeting. Here is why I believe he did that. This shows the \ncost of extending the tax cuts as the President has proposed. This \ndotted line on this chart shows the end of 5 years. But beyond the 5 \nyears, the effect of the President's tax proposals explode in cost. \nThat is the nature of the President's tax proposal. The cost explodes \noutside the 5-year budget window, just beyond the view of those who are \nresponsible for making budgets for this country. The result is that the \nred ink the President has promised to reduce will explode right beyond \nthe 5-year budget window.\n  It is not just with respect to the tax cut proposal, but we see the \nexact same pattern with the alternative minimum tax. The alternative \nminimum tax is the old millionaire's tax, which is now affecting 3 \nmillion taxpayers. In the next 10 years, it will affect 30 to 40 \nmillion taxpayers. It has to be dealt with. The President only provides \nfunding to address this crisis for 1 year.\n  But look at the pattern of cost. Again, right beyond the 5-year \nbudget window, right beyond this dotted line, which represents the next \n5 years, the cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax absolutely \nexplodes, at a cost of over $600 billion. The President does not have \nthat in his budget.\n  Nor does he have the true cost of the war effort. We have had $25 \nbillion put in a contingent reserve for fiscal year 2005, but we know \nthat is a fraction of the cost. The Congressional Budget Office tells \nus that the true ongoing cost of war is over $315 billion. None of it \nis in the budget, other than the $25 billion. None of this $315 \nbillion, other than the $25 billion down payment, is reflected in these \nnumbers in which the President assures us he is going to cut the \ndeficit in half.\n  I am told the Pentagon is about to propose, the administration is \nabout to propose an additional $70 to $75 billion in a war cost \nsupplemental some time early next year.\n  I think this hiding of the true financial condition of the country is \nwrong, and I think it is reckless.\n  The President told us when we adopted his fiscal plan: I can fully \nprotect Social Security. I won't be taking Social Security money and \nusing it for other purposes. Wrong again. The President is taking every \ndime that is available to take from Social Security over the next \ndecade--$2.4 trillion--and using it to pay for other things. Mr. \nPresident, $2.4 trillion, every dime of which has to be repaid, and the \nPresident has no plan to do so.\n  It is not just there that we see the problem. We also see that the \nPresident has a plan to privatize parts of Social Security. Most of the \nestimates are they would cost some $2 trillion in transition costs. \nAgain, the President has no plan to pay for it other than to borrow the \nmoney to do it. More borrowing, more deficits, more debt: no plan to \naddress the issue. These decisions have real consequences.\n  We can see all of this is happening at the worst possible time, right \nbefore the baby boomers start to retire. The baby boom generation is \nout there. It is not a projection. They have been born. They are alive \ntoday. They are going to retire. They are going to be eligible for \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  This is what it looks like when you plot the increase on a graph of \nthose who are going to be eligible for Federal benefits. Right now, we \nhave around 40 million people who are eligible, but over these next \nyears the number is going to double. This is the dramatic demographic \ntimebomb that is out there with the baby boom generation.\n  When we look at the long-term implications--this is not a projection \nby this Senator or a projection by the Democrats; this is a projection \nby the Congressional Budget Office--the long-term budget outlook in \nterms of the effect on deficits, what they show is some improvement \nover the next couple of years but then an explosion of deficits and \ndebt if the President's proposals are adopted.\n  We have record deficits now, the biggest in dollar terms in our \nhistory, and they pale in comparison as to what is to come if the \nPresident's proposals are adopted. There is no response. There is\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\nno response from the Congress of the United States. There is no \nresponse by this administration to these growing deficits and debt. It \nis just more of the same, business as usual, steady as she goes. That \nis a risky course for this country.\n  We remember so well the President telling us there would be maximum \npaydown of the debt if we adopted his fiscal plan. Instead of maximum \npaydown of the debt, we see the debt exploding.\n  The gross debt of the United States was less than $6 trillion when he \ntook office. We now see, by 2014, that debt will approach $15 \ntrillion--a stunning reversal in the fiscal condition of the country. \nIn just these 3 years, there is an increase in the debt limit of $2.2 \ntrillion under President Bush; an increase, in 2002, of the debt limit \nof $450 billion; in 2003, of $984 billion; and now another $800 \nbillion. Mr. President, $2.2 trillion, after we had, from 1998 to 2001, \nno increase in the debt limit, none.\n  Now, the President describes these policies as compassionate \nconservatism. I do not know where the conservatism comes in. I do not \nknow what is conservative about exploding the debt of the Nation. I do \nnot know what is conservative about running up record deficits--and not \njust at a time of economic slowdown but even now, as the economy is \nrecovering, deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  The result of these policies, the result of this increase in deficit \nand debt is soaring Federal interest costs. From the estimate in \nJanuary of 2001 that the interest cost over the next 10 years would be \nsome $600 billion, now estimates are that the interest cost to the \nFederal Government over that same period will be $2.4 trillion, from an \ninterest cost projection of $600 billion to $2.4 trillion. That \ninterest does not build a bridge, does not construct a highway, does \nnot finance an aircraft carrier or a tank. That is money just to \nservice the debt.\n  These massive increases in deficits have enormous implications, not \nonly for our finances but for our economic strength. Deficits and debt \nwill ultimately slow economic growth. This is a quote from the CBO \nDirector, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, before the Senate Budget Committee last \nyear.\n  Mr. Holtz-Eakin is an appointee of the Republican majority in the \nCongress. He came from the President's own economic advisory staff. He \nsaid this:\n\n       To the extent that going forward we run large sustained \n     deficits in the face of full employment, it will in fact \n     crowd out capital accumulation and otherwise slow economic \n     growth.\n\n  Mr. President, that is why these decisions matter. This is not just \nnumbers on a page. This isn't just graphs. This is not just pictures on \na chartboard. These decisions have a real impact on the economic health \nof this Nation, on the creation of jobs, on the development of economic \nopportunity, on the future economic prospects of our Nation and, \nfundamentally, of the economic strength of America.\n  I don't believe we can be militarily strong if we are financially \nweak. This President has us on a course to financial weakness. Make no \nmistake about it, these higher interest rates will burden families. For \nthe typical American family, a 1-percent increase in interest rates \nwill raise the payment on a 30-year home mortgage of $150,000 by $1,200 \nper year. When the Federal Government has to borrow more money, that \nputs it in competition with the private sector for borrowed funds. When \nthat happens, that forces up the cost of borrowing. The more demand for \nmoney, the more interest costs have to go up. That is true especially \nat a time of economic recovery.\n  Mr. President, these decisions have real consequences in the lives of \nreal people. I believe paying down debt is also a moral values issue. \nThe President said himself in 2001:\n\n       Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money \n     that we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to \n     our children and grandchildren.\n\n  On this issue, the President was right. We should not pass on these \ndebts to future generations. But that is now precisely what the \nPresident is doing--again, not at a time just of economic slowdown; we \nhave now got a resumption of economic growth. Yet the President \nproposes more and more deficit, more and more debt. I think it is a \nmistake. I think it is a mistake for this body to extend the debt limit \nin an almost unlimited way, by $800 billion, without any requirement \nfor a plan to address these burgeoning deficits and debt.\n  The deficits we are running are not just budget deficits, they are \nalso trade deficits--approaching over $650 billion in the most recent \nyear. Not only are we running a budget deficit of over $400 billion, we \nare also running a trade deficit of over $650 billion, or in that \nrange.\n  Where is the money coming from in these massive deficits? Well, we \nare borrowing the money, as I indicated, from the Social Security trust \nfund--some $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years. We are also borrowing \nfrom countries all around the world. We have borrowed over $700 billion \nfrom Japan. We have borrowed over $170 billion from China. We have \nborrowed $100 billion from the so-called Caribbean banking centers. I \nthink many in America would wonder what is going on here. We are \nborrowing money from Caribbean banking centers? We have borrowed over \n$60 billion from South Korea. Who would have believed it? Growing up in \nNorth Dakota, I would never have believed we would be out with a tin \ncup borrowing money from countries such as South Korea.\n  Mr. President, here is what has happened under this President in \nterms of foreign holdings of our debt. They have increased by 83 \npercent in just less than 4 years of this administration. Prior to this \nadministration, total foreign holdings of U.S. debt were just over a \ntrillion dollars. In less than 4 years, that has now increased by over \n80 percent. We are now approaching $2 trillion of foreign-held debt.\n  Mr. President, who cares? What difference does it make? I have had a \nchance to go and teach classes in my home State at the universities and \ncolleges. I have asked them what difference does it make if we are \ndeeper and deeper in debt to other countries? Well, the response of \nthose students has been overwhelming and clear. They have said: Of \ncourse, it makes a difference. How does it change any relationship if \nyou are borrowing money from people? It makes you dependent on those \npeople. It means you are less able to challenge them on unfair trade \npractices. It means you are less able to confront them if we are faced \nwith a military confrontation.\n\n  I noticed with great interest a New York Times article of Tuesday, \nOctober 19, headlined, ``Private Investors Abroad Cut Their Investments \nin the U.S.'' It indicated that ``Asian central banks bail out America, \na nation of spenders rather than savers.''\n  The U.S. economy is now increasingly dependent on a handful of \nforeign central banks for our economic stability and security. This is \na vulnerability for our country. To more and more owe money to foreign \nnations and foreign central banks puts them in a stronger position with \nrespect to America's economic future and puts us in a weaker position.\n  In that article, it indicated:\n\n       New data accentuated how dependent the United States has \n     become on purchases of dollar securities by the Chinese and \n     other Asian governments with links to the dollar. ``Foreign \n     central banks saved the dollar from disaster,'' said Akhraf \n     Laidi, chief currency analyst of the MG financial group. He \n     said, ``The stability of the bond market is at the mercy of \n     the Asian purchases of U.S. treasuries.''\n\n  We are at the mercy of foreign central banks, of Asian central banks. \nI don't think that is where we want to be. I don't think that is where \nwe want to be as a nation, dependent on foreign central banks. In that \nsame article, the New York Times indicated that a large amount of \nforeign-held debt could lead to economic turmoil. Here is what it said:\n\n       A disorderly situation would occur if foreign money dried \n     up suddenly when the United States still needed it.\n\n  Let's think about where we are headed here.\n\n       Then, the adjustment in the American savings might happen \n     involuntarily. Interest rates would rise sharply, and the \n     dollar could fall abruptly. This could induce a sharp \n     economic contraction, even stagnation.\n\n  Mr. President, what are we doing here? There is absolutely no \nresponse from this Congress or this administration to this gathering \nfinancial threat. No response. The only response is: Let's go borrow \nmore money. Let's increase the debt more.\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\n  This article appeared in the Wall Street Journal on November 8, \nheadlined, ``Dollar Lacks Backers as Deficit Worries Dominate.''\n  This article asks the question:\n\n       What is going to prop up the sliding dollar?\n\n  It went on to say:\n\n       Despite unexpectedly strong job creation and another jump \n     in the stock market, the dollar dropped against key \n     currencies . . . breaking through the record low against the \n     euro set nine months ago.\n       Currency strategists say the dollar's inability to \n     capitalize on news of 337,000 jobs created in October reveals \n     the market's skepticism about whether a second term for \n     President Bush will reverse deficit spending and a reported \n     current-account deficit--\n\n  That is our trade deficit--\n\n     the broadest gauge of the nation's balance of payments.\n\n  We are here, steady as she goes, headed right for a potential fiscal \ncrisis, and there is no response.\n  Here is what happened to the value of the dollar against the Euro \nsince 2002: The dollar has dropped 30 percent against the Euro in that \ntime. This is a warning. This is a warning, I say to my friends. People \nare losing confidence in the fiscal policy of the United States. This \nhas potentially ominous consequences that I think we all understand.\n  The CBO Director believes deficits can no longer be blamed on just a \nweak economy. He said:\n\n       Policy choices will determine where we go. We will not grow \n     our way out of this. It is no longer the case that we can \n     blame everything on the economy.\n\n  I talked about the budget deficit. Here is the U.S. trade deficit. \nSame pattern: explosive growth in our deficits, both budget and trade, \nrequiring more and more foreign borrowing, making us more and more \ndependent on the decisions of foreigners as to our economic stability \nand strength.\n  Today in the Washington Post, Robert Samuelson, an economist, wrote \nan article headlined, ``The Dangerous Dollar.'' He points out the risks \nto our country of what could happen if there was continuing flight from \nthe dollar and a collapse in its value. He points out the risk to this \ncountry and says:\n\n       No one knows what will happen. The massive U.S. payments \n     deficits could continue for years, with foreigners investing \n     surplus dollars in American stocks and bonds. Gradual shifts \n     in currency values might reduce the world's addiction to \n     exporting to the United States. Or something might cause a \n     dollar crash tomorrow. In that case, massive intervention by \n     government central banks . . . might avert a calamity. Or it \n     might not. We're in uncharted waters. If we hit a shoal, it \n     will be bad for everyone.\n\n  The warning is clear. The risks are there. The question is: Do we \njust stay on this current course, or do we respond to this growing \nthreat? I think it is inappropriate to extend the debt of the United \nStates by $800 billion without a plan to reduce this dependency on \nforeign capital.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Baucus, the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, for his courtesy in allowing me to speak first \nso that I may make a hearing going on in the Capitol complex.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is here today to respond to the \nadministration's request once again to increase the statutory limit on \nthe Federal debt. More fundamentally, we are here in response to a \nwarning. Like a proximity alert on an aircraft, the debt limit warns \nthe Government is headed for a crash. We need to change course.\n  Unless we change course, the administration's fiscal policy will \nconsign American families to a lower standard of living. Unless we \nchange course, American workers will have lower incomes than they would \notherwise have, and the dollars they earn will be worth less than they \notherwise would have been worth.\n  Unless we change course, millions of Americans will live poorer \nlives. That is what we are really debating today when we debate the \ndebt limit, and that is why I shall vote against the bill, to signal \nthat we must change course.\n  Narrowly speaking today, we are considering the ceiling on Federal \ndebt, the cap that the law places on borrowing by the Federal \nGovernment. The legislation before us would raise the debt ceiling to \n$8.184 trillion. It would increase the debt ceiling by $800 billion.\n  As this chart to my left shows, it will be the third largest increase \nin the history of the country. This chart indicates debt limit \nincreases since 1982, and in roughly 1990, it was $915 billion, and \nthen the highest was $984 billion, and this $800 billion is the third \nhighest increase in the debt ceiling. Unfortunately, this large debt \nceiling increase, and particularly the recent increases, are becoming \nall too common.\n  Just last year we were forced to raise the debt ceiling by a record \n$984 billion. Almost $1 trillion in additional Federal borrowing, that \nlimit was raised in 1 year. In just the year before that, the debt \nceiling had to be increased by $450 billion. That is more than $2.2 \ntrillion in debt in just 3 years. In contrast, prior to those 3 years, \nthere had been no increase in the debt ceiling for 5 years.\n  An increase of $800 billion of debt that is requested in this \nlegislation before us means $2,700 more debt for every man, woman, and \nchild in America, and a total of $8 trillion in total debt means about \n$25,000 of debt for every man, woman, and child. That is a $25,000 \nburden on each of us, our children, and our grandchildren.\n  I believe that each of us who runs for public office and serves has a \nmoral obligation, and that obligation is to leave this place in as good \na shape or better shape than we found it. It is that simple. As this \nPresident and this Congress keeps piling up more and more debt, clearly \nwe are leaving this place in worse shape than we found it. We are \nputting a huge additional obligation and burden on our successors and \nupon, more importantly, the people we represent and, even more \nimportantly, those who follow the people we represent. That is not the \nmoral, correct thing to do. My judgment is that it is not only not \nresponsible, it is irresponsible.\n  This chart shows per capita total Federal debt outstanding. This is \nper capita, on a per person basis in America. It has steadily been \nrising from 1997 from close to $20,000 to more than double, to $25,000 \nbeing asked for today.\n  Today's increase also will not be the end of large increases in the \ndebt ceiling. It will not be the end because before the next year runs \nout, we will need to raise the debt ceiling once again.\n  The reason for these record increases in the debt ceiling is the \nrecord Federal budget deficits that our Government is running.\n  To clarify for those who may be unsure about the terminology here, \nthe term ``deficits'' obviously means annual deficits that this \nGovernment runs, and the term ``debt'' means the accumulation of all \nthe deficits. That is why the deficits sound a little less. It is some \n$400 billion, whereas the total publicly held debt is over $8 trillion.\n  I must add to this, I don't want to lay the blame totally in the \nhands of the President, but the President submits budgets to the \nCongress. Congress tends to work with the budgets that the President \nsubmits. Every year the President submits a budget and Congress does \nwork around the edges, maybe add a little, subtract a little, but it is \nPresidents, not Congress, in the main, who actually determine the \namount of either surplus or the amount of deficits that are actually \nenacted. It is primarily the Presidents.\n  Since the current administration took office, there have been record \nannual surpluses that have turned into record annual deficits. In the \nfiscal year 2001--that is the transition year between the two \nadministrations--the Federal Government ran a surplus of $127 billion, \na surplus. We actually ran a surplus of $127 billion in fiscal year \n2001. For the next year, 2002, the first full fiscal year in the \ncurrent administration, the Government ran a deficit--not a surplus but \na deficit--of $158 billion. In the next fiscal year, the Federal \nGovernment ran a record deficit of $377 billion. Last year, in fiscal \nyear 2004, there was yet another record deficit of $413 billion.\n  This chart basically outlines what I just said; namely, we start with \na reduction in Federal debt. That is the total. Beginning about 2001 it \nstarts skyrocketing back up again.\n  These record deficits are even more painful when they are compared \nwith the record annual budget surpluses that preceded them. In fiscal \nyear 1998,\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\nthe Government ran a surplus of $69 billion. This was a record budget \nsurplus at the time and the first budget surplus since fiscal year \n1969.\n  In fiscal year 1999, this was another record surplus, $126 billion. \nThat was followed by yet a third record surplus of $236 billion in \nfiscal year 2000. So we had 3 years of growing surpluses. So in just 4 \nyears, the Government has moved from a record surplus of $236 billion \nto a record deficit of $413 billion, which is quite a dramatic swing of \nabout $650 billion in our annual Federal budget outcome just over a 4-\nyear period of time.\n  That is why we are here today. That is why we have to, in a technical \nlevel, raise the debt ceiling. It is because we are running record \nbudget deficits. It is that simple.\n  In contrast, when we were running budget surpluses, the Government \nwas doing what it should do. It was beginning to pay off the debt held \nby the public. That is what took place the second half of the previous \nadministration. So between 1998 and 2001, our Government paid off about \n$450 billion worth of debt. Indeed, when the current administration \ntook office, there was serious talk that all debt held by the public \nwould be paid off within about 10 years or so. I think we all remember \nthat. Gosh, if we totally pay off our national debt--is that possible? \nPeople were saying it would be bad if we paid off our total national \ndebt. But we were on the glidepath at that time, a few years ago, to \npay off the national debt, and there was very serious talk about what \nwould we do when we got down to zero national debt. How soon we forget.\n  What a sad turnaround we experienced. The turnaround can clearly be \nseen in this chart here which outlines the dramatic change. Our \nnational debt was steadily coming down as we had annual deficits and we \nwere using the deficits to pay off the national debt. That is what \nhappened in 2001. Then in 2002 and 2003 and beyond it is just the \nopposite.\n  Is this going to continue, this trend? Unfortunately, if we are \nobjective about this, I think the answer is yes. The President claims \nhe will cut the deficit in half in 5 years. Indeed, Senator Kerry \ncampaigned for the Presidency and said he would cut the deficit in half \nin 5 years. But I must say, to be totally candid, those estimates are a \nlittle rosy. That is not going to happen.\n  For example, the independent nonpartisan Concord Coalition projects a \ndeficit of about $450 billion 5 years from now. That will be higher \nthan last year's record. Don't forget the Concord Coalition is known by \nmost Members of Congress as being a fair, objective, \nnonpartisan organization looking at these matters very closely and very \nfairly and accurately.\n\n  Ten years from now the Concord Coalition projects the deficit will be \nan astronomical $734 billion. The Concord Coalition says it is going to \nget worse, much worse, with each passing year and the total deficit, \nthey say, for the next 10 years will be almost $5 trillion. That means \nthe Federal borrowing for the public will be $5 trillion in 10 years, \nand the debt ceiling will have to be raised by $5 trillion as well just \nto accommodate that increase.\n  Some may ask, Does it matter if Federal Government borrowing \nincreases by $5 trillion? Does it really matter? Mr. President, it \ndoes. It really matters.\n  When the Federal Government borrows money from the public, it \nthreatens two bad results. First, the Federal borrowing could compete \nwith borrowing by businesses and consumers. What does that mean? That \nmeans that interest rates would go up. They have to go up. They are \ncompeting for the supply of money. Borrowing by businesses for new \ninvestments would have to go down. Borrowing would have to go down, all \nthings being equal, and with fewer business investments, economic \ngrowth would, therefore, decline relative to what it could be.\n  High interest rates are killers. High interest rates, more than \nalmost anything else, are a drag on the economy. It really slows the \neconomy down and could deepen any recession that might occur.\n  Conversely, very low interest rates help businesses borrow, help \nhomeowners buy homes, et cetera. It is very good for economic growth. \nIn addition, because of this crowding out effect, our future standard \nof living could be lower than otherwise it would be.\n  Moreover, the rise in interest rates caused by increased Federal \nborrowing would make household purchases by credit more expensive. The \nincreased costs would cause households to have less purchasing power \nand, therefore, would have to buy less. You may have to postpone or \nmaybe not be at all able to buy that new refrigerator, to buy that new \nstove, that TV set, whether it is a plasma TV or regular TV, whatever \nit might be. The increased cost would cause households to have much \nless purchasing power.\n  For example, an increase in mortgage rates of just 2 percentage \npoints would increase home buyers' annual payments on a $200,000 home \nby about $1,700. Potential home buyers would decide whether to buy \nthese homes or, in the alternative, reduce other purchases. In either \ncase, the home buyer's standard of living would be lower.\n  The second bad outcome that the additional Federal borrowing could \ncause is that Americans would owe more to foreigners. Foreigners would \nincrease their holdings of U.S. assets. What does this mean? This would \nlower our future standard of living, as the earnings from American \nassets would have to go to foreigners, not to Americans. Thus, when the \nFederal Government borrows more, the standard of living of the American \nfamilies suffers. It is zero sum, axiomatic; it by definition has to \nhappen.\n  There is another danger from added Federal borrowing as well. If \nforeigners, especially foreign central banks--that is the governments, \nforeign governments--buy a significant portion of our debt, our U.S. \neconomy will be subject to serious jolts, particularly if these lenders \ndecided to sell off that debt precipitously. At the very least, they \nwill have a little hold on us as they increase their holdings of \nAmerican Treasurys, American securities--which is what they buy mostly \nthese days, partly because it is more liquid, which means they could \nget rid of them much more easily, more quickly. But they have a little \nhold on us, a little leverage on us in any trade negotiation, any \npolitical negotiation, any foreign policy negotiation with these \ncountries. Whether it is China or Japan or wherever, there would be a \nlittle edge because this country might hint that, gee, maybe we might \nstart pulling out our purchases, sell the U.S. Treasurys we have unless \nyou Americans go along with something we want. I am not saying it will \nbe a huge factor. It may be a huge factor. I am saying it will be a \nfactor we would not want to have to deal with.\n\n  Suppose the U.S. dollar declines further. It has come down about 30 \npercent in the last couple of years against the Euro. When the Euro was \nfirst announced, the dollar was fairly strong compared to the Euro. Now \nit has fallen about 30 percent. As Federal debt and interest payments \nfrom our national debt are denominated in U.S. dollars, what happens? \nThe value of those assets starts to drop. That is what is happening. \nThe U.S. dollar, compared with other currencies, is starting to fall \nsignificantly.\n  What happens then? Foreigners, including foreign central banks, might \nbe afraid the dollar will go further. That is the trend. It is going \ndown. Why is it going down? Because of the huge deficits and debts. A \nlittle less confidence in America. The more it goes down, then central \nbanks in other countries will ask, do they want their dollar-\ndenominated assets, as U.S. Treasury, to decline further? Probably not. \nSo what are they going to do about that? Sell. Sell before they fall. \nOnce they start to sell, what happens? The fall is greater.\n  That is the danger we are facing. I am not saying this is actually \ngoing to happen. Nobody knows if this is going to happen. There is a \nschool of thought that there is so much savings in the world this will \nnot happen. But we all know it is getting more and more risky and more \nlikely this will happen.\n  If we exercise a little common sense as we run our household, we know \nthere comes a point we cannot continue to borrow. There comes a point \nwhen the bank says no. There comes a point when we have to be more \nresponsible as a household. The same is true here. There comes a point \nwhen the bank says--in this case it is foreign banks, or in this case \nthe taxpayers--Enough is enough.\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\n  We do not know there will be a huge, precipitous decline. We do not \nwant there to be a precipitous, huge decline. If there is, we do not \nwant to know when it is because we do not want it to happen, but we do \nknow if we are irresponsible and turn a blind eye to all of this, it is \nmuch more likely to happen and we will pay the consequences and rue the \nday when we, at an earlier date, did not take the necessary steps to \ncorrect this.\n  There is a real danger that foreign banks, as they look at their hole \ncard, may sell off some of the Federal debt they now hold. Half of the \nforeign holdings are held by central banks. That would cause a spike in \ninterest rates. Why? Because as they begin to sell, what does the U.S. \nGovernment have to do? It has to raise interest rates to keep the \ncompanies in America securities. Raise interest rates, and we will have \nall the other consequences I mentioned earlier--higher mortgage \ninterest rates, consumer interest rates go up, companies cannot borrow \nas much because the banks are charging them much more. This is not some \nfringe possibility; this is real.\n  Why do I say it is real? Why am I very concerned about this? Let me \nquote the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker. He said \nquite recently he thought there is a 75-percent chance of a currency \ncrisis in the United States within 5 years. Those are odds we do not \nwant to have to deal with.\n  One of the hardest things to do is managing economic affairs early \nbefore you get in real trouble. It is so easy to postpone and put off. \nIt is a bit of an abstraction right now. We do not know what will \nhappen. It does not hit Americans right in the gut. It is not like \nraising taxes or lowering taxes which people feel immediately in their \nhousehold budgets. I can guarantee if these problems do occur, and all \nthe evidence indicates it is very likely to occur unless we take some \nvery serious steps today, it is going to hit Americans so hard in the \ngut, it will have such an impact on Americans that this country is \ngoing to have a very serious problem.\n  Something else we should consider is the international \ncompetitiveness we Americans face with other countries worldwide, \nirrespective of our current deficits and trade deficit--which is \nhumongous, which we will have to pay for sooner rather than later--with \nother countries. Take China, for example. We graduate in the United \nStates of America about 65,000 engineers a year. Engineers can build \nnew products and help make America strong. Guess how many engineers \nChina graduates each year. Over 300,000 yearly. Are they brighter or \ndumber than our engineers? No, they are smart, progressive young men \nand women. And they are hungry. For those who have been to China \nrecently, it is stunning to see the degree to which the Chinese people \nare hungry. They are going to compete very aggressively on the world \nmarket.\n  We are in a sense almost fiddling while Rome is burning. That is, not \nonly not paying attention to our fiscal problems but also not paying \nattention to the competitiveness we have around the world; that is, not \nmaking sure we have more trained engineers who can do better worldwide. \nWe will find ourselves not too many years from now in a real pickle. I \nam saying, right now, start taking measures so we do not have huge \nproblems we otherwise would have.\n  I mentioned earlier central banks, if this trend continues, might \ndecide to change their holdings and Federal debt for political reasons. \nNot only economic, but also for political reasons. For example, a \nforeign government might be involved in a trade dispute with the United \nStates. This foreign government would know it could roil markets for \nthe U.S. Federal debt and U.S. economy if a central bank sold a large \nportion of its holdings of U.S. Federal debt. It knows that. So what \ndoes it do? That government or country might hint around or might \nthreaten to sell off, roil international markets, with an adverse \neffect on U.S. currencies, undercutting the United States' position in \nthat trade dispute.\n  At the end of September this year, foreigners held about $1.9 \ntrillion of our debt, close to $2 trillion of the total. Japan alone \nheld $720 billion. China was next with $174 billion. Moreover, of $1.9 \ntrillion of total debt held by foreigners, foreign central banks held \n$1.1 trillion. That is significantly more than half owned and \ncontrolled by central government banks. That is the government banks in \nthose countries which, therefore, are in a great position of control. \nThose total amounts are nearly double the totals of 3 years ago. This \nhas accelerated dramatically, almost double, over the last 3 years. \nTotal debt held by foreigners is now 43 percent of all debt held by the \npublic. Pretty close to half of all our national debt is held \nby foreigners--not by Americans, but by foreigners--and foreign central \nbanks hold a full 30 percent of all such debt, one-third.\n\n  That is significant. Before I got in the Government, I worked for the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and I can remember back then the \ncontrolling interest was 10 percent. We are talking about 30 percent \nhere. That is much more than a controlling interest in an entity's \nfinancial position.\n  The forecast for future Federal deficits and borrowing does not look \ngood. I must add, this is not the worst of it. It gets worse. President \nBush, for example, has made it clear he wants to pursue a plan for \npartial privatization of Social Security. Under that plan, part of a \nworker's and employer's Social Security payroll taxes we divert into \nnew private savings accounts for the workers. That sounds good, but \nwhat does that mean? That means there would be less revenue left in the \nFederal budget for other spending. The Federal Government would have to \nborrow more money to cover the difference. That adds even greater \npressure on the Federal debt and greater upward pressure on interest \nrates.\n  For many of the various partial privatization plans being proposed, \nthese revenue losses would not be small. They would be more than \nsignificant, between $150 and $200 billion a year in each of the next \n10 years. The losses would be even larger in subsequent years. These \nrevenue losses, these additional revenue losses, and the associated \nincreases in interest costs on top of that, would raise annual deficits \nto previously unimaginable heights. For example, the annual deficit \nprojected by the Concord Coalition for 10 years from now would rise to \nover $1 trillion. That is in addition. Federal debt would rise by an \nadditional $2 to $3 trillion in the next 10 years to a total of about \n$7 to $8 trillion of new borrowing during that period. That is on top--\nthat is in addition--$8 trillion today, double in 10 years.\n\n  So we should take two lessons from this dismal picture. The first is \nwe need to exercise true fiscal discipline. That is just common sense. \nAmericans sit around that kitchen table very often--maybe it is weekly, \nmaybe it is monthly--trying to make ends meet. Some cannot keep \nspending more than they take in each year. Most cannot. No one can \ncontinue that indefinitely because at some point the banks just won't \nlend people any more money. They will insist that existing loans be \npaid off.\n  We have bankruptcies. We have chapter 11. We have chapter 7. The \npoint of all that is to stop the hemorrhaging, to pay off creditors to \ntry to get the economic houses of Americans and companies back in \norder. I am not saying we have to declare bankruptcy. That would be \nsomething else, wouldn't it, if the United States of America declared \nchapter 11 and tried to reorder all the creditors. It is unimaginable, \nbut if that were to happen, just think what would happen to the value \nof the dollar, what the value of the U.S. dollar would be then.\n  In the world of borrowing China and Japan now play the role of the \nbanks. They are our bankers. They hold 30 percent of our debt and \nforeign individuals own another, what, roughly 23 percent of our debt. \nAll of this will force the United States at some point to begin to live \nwithin its means--at some point. And it could happen suddenly.\n  Remember not too many years ago when the financial markets just \ncollapsed. The first was in 1987, I remember, and the stock market just \nwent whoosh. Back in the Asian currency crisis not too many years ago \nthings went haywire immediately. The deck of cards totally collapsed. \nIt doesn't take much, and it is usually unforeseeable. It is usually \nsome little event which is not predictable but which happens which \ntriggers this selloff and collapse.\n  We do not want that to happen, and it will not happen, it is less \nlikely to\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\nhappen if we today begin constructing a path where we do live within \nour means. This increase in the national debt today obviously signals \njust the opposite. There is no plan at this point.\n  So I say we would be far better if we were to eliminate our annual \ndeficits on our own rather than having foreigners force us to that \npoint. We can take concrete steps to reduce our Federal budget \ndeficits. We can enact tough but reasonable caps in spending, renewed \neach year, and we can institute a requirement that all new tax cuts and \nnew permanent spending be fully paid for. We can do that if we have the \ncommon sense and if we have the moral courage to do so as we are \nexpected to do by the people who elect us. We could do all this without \nresorting to gimmicks.\n  This town, this country, this Government has been full of too many \ngimmicks--the lockbox for Social Security. There are a lot of gimmicks \nthis President has proposed. We have almost reached the end of our \nstring of gimmicks. We have reached the point of reality. We have to do \nwhat is right. We can enact a tough requirement that new tax cuts and \nnew permanent spending be fully paid for. That was in place actually, \nas you recall, from 1990 until the spring of 2003. This requirement \nhelped the budget turn from deficit into surplus. We should restore \nthat. We should restore that quickly.\n\n  The second lesson we need to learn is that we should not enact the \npartial privatization of Social Security. There are a number of \nimportant reasons to stay clear of this. For example, these plans would \nlikely cut total retirement income for many beneficiaries, have the \neffect of cutting income, not increasing it. Even this lowered income \nwould be subject to great risk in the private market. Social Security, \nit may not pay hugely but it is stable. It is there. You can count on \nit.\n  I know a lot of young people say it won't be there. I disagree with \nthat. I say it is going to be there. Why do I say that? I say that \nbecause with each passing year there are more and more voters who are \nseniors. There are more and more people who are age 55 up to 60 who \nreally care about Social Security. I have forgotten the exact date. I \nsaw one estimate that by about the year 2030 half of all voters will be \nage 60 or over. I do not know if that estimate is true. It was made by \na reputable person--I won't mention his name today but it is someone we \nall know who is quite reputable.\n  But in addition to that, partial privatization would dramatically \nincrease Federal borrowing. It would increase annual Federal budget \ndeficits and it would increase the Federal debt. This would further \nlower both our current and our future standard of living. It would also \nmake the U.S. economy even more vulnerable to recession and it could \nput the U.S. Government in a vulnerable position, even more so in its \nrelationships with foreign governments. These fiscal dangers alone are \nsufficient reason to reject the partial privatization of Social \nSecurity.\n  Clearly, we should look for new vehicles to increase savings. We \nshould look for more ways to assure that our seniors are more secure in \ntheir retirement. We could bolster Social Security. We could find more \nprivate savings vehicles. We could help our pension system. But the \npartial privatization of Social Security will have the effect of \nlowering the benefits to those currently 50, 60, 62, or 63, unless \nthere is a massive enough additional borrowing by the Federal \nGovernment. And that is the low estimate, $1 trillion over 10 years, \nand the higher estimate is $2 trillion. That is in addition.\n  I ask from where is that money going to come? Can we really borrow \nthat much more compared to what we have already borrowed? We cannot.\n  So we need to respond to the debt limit. I started out saying really \ntechnically this is an increase in the debt limit, which is required by \nstatute, but more fundamentally the issue being raised today is how \nmuch more can this Government go into hock? That is really the \nquestion. And how quickly can we get ourselves out of it?\n  We need to respond to the warning of the debt limit increase. We need \nto change course. We need to prevent that crash. We still have time. We \nshould heed Paul Volcker's warning of a 75-percent chance of a currency \ncrisis in the United States in 5 years. I think I know what he is \ntalking about. He may not be right, but if Paul Volcker says that, we \nshould listen. We should take his warning very seriously. We should, \nobviously, act with a sense of urgency and do what we can to avoid that \ndangerous result. We should change course now. We should wait no \nlonger. With next year's budget, we have an opportunity.\n\n  The President, in his submission to Congress this January, February, \nwhenever it is, in working with the Congress, can begin to chart a \nproper course, begin to chart a course or begin to actually honestly \nget our Federal budget deficit under control. We have that opportunity. \nWe have that obligation. The time is now. The time is January when the \nPresident submits his budget and the next months when the Congress \nworks with the President as we begin to get our Federal fiscal house in \norder.\n  We have to change course so American families can hope for a better \nstandard of living in the future, so American workers can have good \njobs with good incomes and we have a strong dollar with real value in \nthe international trade. We need to change course to make all that \nhappen so future generations of Americans lead richer lives.\n  I will end with the statement I mentioned in the beginning. We have a \nmoral obligation to leave this place in as good shape or better than we \nfound it. It is an obligation we have--I assert whether environmental \nmatters, whether Federal budget--to inspire confidence and togetherness \nin our people. I urge us very much to take the course of action that we \nwell know is correct.\n  Mr. President, I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin, \nMr. Feingold, who is a real leader in the fight for fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana not \nonly for his leadership in the body but for his words about the fiscal \nsituation our country faces. I particularly thank him for his emphasis \non the need to return to those important fiscal budget rules, the pay-\ngo rules that guided us so well for so many years. I hope and trust \nthis will be the first of many times he will address the body about the \nneed to get back to that discipline. I intend to do the same here \ntoday. I think very few things are more important to our country than \nto return to the fiscal discipline we actually accomplished on a \nbipartisan basis during the 1990s after the very reckless policies of \nthe 1980s.\n  Today we are again forced to consider legislation to raise the \nNation's debt limit. It is obvious to anyone but those who refuse to \nsee that we are here because of the grossly reckless fiscal policies \nthat have been advanced by the administration and Congress over the \npast 4 years.\n  The last 4 years have seen a dramatic deterioration in the \nGovernment's ability to perform one of its most important and \nfundamental jobs, and that I do not need to tell the Presiding Officer \nabout because he is a stalwart on this issue; and that is, the \nbalancing of the Nation's fiscal books.\n  We are all familiar with the history. In January of 2001, the \nCongressional Budget Office projected that in the 10 years thereafter, \nthe Government would run a unified budget surplus--surplus--of more \nthan $5 trillion. Almost 4 years later, we are staring at almost a \nmirror image of that estimate--a 10-year, $5 trillion surplus--except \nthat instead of healthy surpluses, under any reasonable set of \nassumptions, we are now facing immense deficits.\n  We absolutely cannot afford to continue to run up these massive \ndeficits. Doing so causes the Government to use the surpluses of the \nSocial Security trust fund, and use them for other Government purposes, \nrather than to pay down the debt and to help our Nation prepare for the \ncoming retirement of the baby-boom generation.\n  Every dollar we add to the Federal debt is another dollar we are \nforcing our children to pay back in higher taxes or fewer Government \nbenefits. So today's vote to raise the debt limit basically ratifies \nthe actions taken by the administration and the Congress to stick \nfuture generations with an immense credit card bill.\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\n  That is what we are doing when the Government, in this generation, \nchooses to spend on current consumption and to accumulate debt for our \nchildren's generation to pay. It does nothing less than rob our \nchildren of their own choices. We make our choices to spend on our \nwants, but we saddle them with the debts they must pay from their tax \ndollars and their hard work.\n  Obviously that is not right. This has to stop. We have to rein in the \nfiscal policies that have forced today's vote. That means making some \ntough spending cuts. It means putting a stop to the inexcusably \nreckless tax policies of the past 4 years. And it means putting some \nmeaningful, tough, and sustainable budget enforcement mechanisms in \nplace that return us to what the Senator from Montana was talking about \nand what I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks.\n  Earlier this year a bipartisan majority in this body supported just \nsuch a mechanism. The amendment I offered during the Senate's \nconsideration of the budget resolution would have reinstated the pay-\nas-you-go rule for taxes and mandatory spending that served our Nation \nso well during the 1990s. It was adopted by a bipartisan majority. I \nsalute the Presiding Officer for his courage in siding with me and \nothers across party lines to try to institute--actually reinstitute--\nthose pay-as-you-go rules that we had a pretty good bipartisan \nconsensus about during the 1990s.\n  I actually believe it would have passed the other body but for some \nheavyhanded maneuvers by House leadership. Instead, the \nadministration's election year agenda steamrolled over efforts to \nreturn some fiscal sanity to our budget process.\n  I also believe there are many in this body who did not support my \namendment but who know, in their heart of hearts, that reinstating the \npay-go rule is simply the right thing to do. They know how essential it \nis to impose some self-restraint on congressional appetites. I suspect \nwe would have gotten an even bigger majority vote if not for the \nexertion of some of the strong pressure on Members that is more common \nmore often in the other body.\n  We need a strong budget process. We need to exert fiscal discipline. \nThis Congress failed to do so, and left the Nation worse off for their \nfailure.\n  When we look at this fiscal mess, it boils down to a lack of \nrestraint and a lack of judgment. Wisconsin families face tough choices \nabout their budgets every day, and they shoulder tough financial \nburdens. But they do not throw up their hands and keep spending. They \nhave to make the choices that need to be made; and they do it. They do \nnot do it because it is easy. They do it because they have to. They \nhave to; and so do we.\n  We have to get our house in order, like so many Americans do every \nday. Reinstating pay-go and adopting some other strong budget reforms \nshould be among the highest priorities of the next Congress. We should \nreturn to the rules by which Congress played for the decade of the \n1990s. We should eliminate the loopholes carved in the pay-go rule as \npart of the budget resolution adopted in 2003. Those loopholes only \nfacilitated more damage to the Federal budget bottom line.\n  Reinstating the pay-go rule by itself will not balance the books. But \nit will make it harder for this body to make the deficit worse. It does \nnot make it impossible, it just makes it harder, and that is exactly as \nit should be.\n  Given our current budget position, we ought to make it harder to make \nthe deficit worse. We ought to require 60 votes if we are to pursue tax \npolicies or new mandatory spending that is not fully paid for. I do not \nthink that is too much to ask. And those rules worked well just a few \nyears back.\n  We know this debt limit bill is going to pass. It was made necessary \nby irresponsible budget policies that were pushed by the administration \nand aided and abetted by Congress. This ought to be the last debt limit \nbill we ever consider, but unless we change things, it won't be. We \nhave to change things on this pay-go rule and beyond or we will simply \nbe in the same position time and time again.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the \nSenator from Wisconsin for his long-time concern about budget deficits. \nI can think of no one in the Senate who has been a more articulate \nadvocate of getting our house in order.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for the 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Johnson are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is not a lot of time left on the debt limit for \ndebate. I urge Senators who want to speak to come over now because, \notherwise, I will yield back the remainder of our time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I see the Senator from Florida on the floor. I yield 5 \nminutes to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished \nformer chairman, now ranking member, of the Finance Committee, my \nfriend, the Senator from Montana, for the time.\n  I wanted to share with the Senate that, for the third time in as many \nyears, I find myself wondering how in the world can we continue to be \nin such a fiscal posture that we find ourselves in. We are constantly \nreminded by the administration how rosy our economic outlook is, and \nthere are some economic indicators that say that. On the other hand, we \nhear from the Department of the Treasury that if the debt ceiling is \nnot raised, the Government is in danger of defaulting on our loans.\n  By the way, where are a number of those loans? A huge amount of those \nloans to the U.S. Government are from the banks of Japan and China, of \nall places. In the 108th Congress alone, we have had to increase the \nstatutory maximum debt the Government can carry by over $2.2 trillion.\n  The last time we engaged in this exercise a year or year and a half \nago, in May of 2003, we needed the single largest increase to the debt \nlimit in U.S. history. That was almost a trillion dollars--$945 \nbillion. That lasted us only until today. Now the Treasury is \nexplaining that they have resorted to ``extraordinary measures'' just \nso they can meet their current obligations.\n  So here we go again. Three times we have done this in 3 years. Let me \nput it in context. From 1996 to 2001, the debt limit was increased by a \ntotal of only $400 billion, in relative terms. Today, we are asking \nthat be doubled in the increase of the debt limit.\n  There certainly are new expenses we are now facing, such as terrorism \nand the war in Iraq, which have put a tremendous strain on our budget. \nBut these are not new expenses. We ought to be doing a better job of \nanticipating those needs and budgeting accordingly and not digging \nourselves deeper into debt.\n  Instead, the huge budget deficits year after year have put us on a \nreckless fiscal path that will take us decades to undo. And guess who \nis going to pay off that debt we keep adding to the tune of half a \ntrillion dollars a year. It is going to be our children and our \ngrandchildren who are going to have to pay off that debt.\n  I keep hearing a lot of folks here who want this to happen. They keep \nclaiming they have a conservative fiscal record, but I think the truth \nis that the ``tax cuts and spend'' mantra is not fiscally conservative. \nIt is fiscally reckless.\n  There will undoubtedly be more expenses that we face--emergencies \nfrom natural disasters, such as the four hurricanes that hit my State, \nand the floods in the Midwest. That is part of\n\n[[Page S11406]]\n\nthe reason for having a Federal Government, to respond to those \nemergencies. There are going to be necessities, such as the imminent \nretirement of the baby boomers, the unstable situation in trying to \nstabilize Iraq, and the terrorist threats all across the globe. We \ncannot continue to ignore those needs on our balance sheet.\n  Today's debt limit increase is something I have a great problem with \nsimply because of the way of the fiscal policy that has been thrust \ninto the running of our Government. I do not want to see this as an \nannual exercise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Carper, such time as he might consume.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana for \nyielding.\n  There was a lot of talk before the election about potential October \nsurprises. Perhaps there should have been more talk about potential \nNovember surprises, for that is what we are presented with this \nafternoon.\n  There was a great deal of rhetoric during the campaign about cutting \nour Nation's budget deficit in half. There was too little straight \ntalk, however, about the reality that our debt continues to rise.\n  We have heard a good deal of talk since the election about mandates, \nvoters' mandates and fulfilling campaign promises. If the majority in \nCongress is seeking a mandate for its economic policies, they would not \nhave withheld the results of those policies until after the election.\n  As far as campaign promises go, I do not recall anyone promising in \nthis year's campaign that Congress's first act after the election would \nbe to approve an increase in our Nation's indebtedness to more than $8 \ntrillion. That is exactly what Congress is about to do this afternoon \nbefore the sun sets in Washington, DC.\n  As the most profligate Presidential term and the most profligate \nsession of Congress in our Nation's history draw to a close, the bills, \nmeanwhile, are coming due. Bills, like facts, are very stubborn things. \nNo amount of rhetoric can make them go away. While it was inappropriate \nto hide from the public the true extent of our Nation's growing \nindebtedness until after the election, it is somehow fitting this vote \nwould come today. There is a symbolism in the fact that one of the last \nacts of the 108th Congress will be to place this country deeper in hock \nto our creditors around the world. There is also significance in the \nfact that this act will be undertaken just a day before the opening of \nthe Clinton Presidential Library in Arkansas.\n  The opening of the Clinton Library reminds us that when Bill Clinton \nleft office 4 years ago, America had a budget surplus. That surplus was \nsufficient to secure the future solvency of Social Security and \nMedicare and to put our country on course to be completely debt-free \nfor the first time in any living person's memory.\n  That is the legacy of President Clinton. I am sorry to say the legacy \nof the 108th and the 109th Congresses will be one of undoing in 4 short \nyears the decade of work and sacrifice that went into balancing our \nNation's books and strengthening our Nation's finances for the 21st \ncentury.\n  Let me say, credit for the budget surpluses that we were beginning to \ngenerate as a country 4 years ago is not entirely due to one President \nor to one party. But the fact is that he did provide a strong measure \nof the leadership that helped get us to the place we were just 4 short \nyears ago.\n  As a result of that rapid unraveling of fiscal restraint, our \nfinancial position is far more precarious than it was just 4 years ago. \nWith a large and growing budget deficit, we are stretched thin in our \ncapacity to meet the great challenges that inevitably confront us as a \ngreat people. New terms and new Congresses are times for new \nbeginnings--and for those of you who know me, I am an eternal optimist. \nI have no desire to dwell on the past. I, like most of us, am \ndetermined to look forward. My hope is that given the opportunity for a \nnew beginning, we will chart a new course in the new year to come.\n  In truth, we have no other choice, at least no other good choice. \nSustaining a protracted global war on terrorism requires discipline. \nKeeping the promise of Social Security and Medicare entails \nresponsibility. Ensuring that these challenges do not exhaust our \ncapacity so that we are still in a position to improve our schools and \ninvest in our children and their future demands sacrifice. Discipline, \nresponsibility, sacrifice--these are values that are familiar to \nfamilies in small towns across Delaware and across America and, \nfrankly, in big towns, too. They are the values by which our families \nlive each and every day, or at least attempt to. Our State and local \ngovernments share the values of our people when it comes to handling \ntheir people's money because, unlike the Congress, our State and local \ngovernments are required to share those values. Our State and local \ngovernments are required to live by two simple rules: Live within your \nmeans and pay as you go. We used to live by those rules here in \nCongress, but we have literally let those rules expire.\n  In hindsight, it is clear that by letting these simple rules expire, \nand with them the values of discipline, responsibility and sacrifice, \nwe have unleashed a frenzy of spending and borrowing. It is equally \nclear that this laxity in Congress now threatens America's economic \nvitality and even our national security.\n  Personally, I do not believe pundits who say fiscal recklessness is \ninevitable. Nor do I believe those who say bitter and polarizing \npartisanship is inevitable. They may be inevitable, but I don't believe \nit. I am ready to meet in the middle with anyone from the other side \nwho is interested in bringing responsibility and discipline to the \nHalls of Congress and the part of America outside the Congress that is \nwithin this beltway. I am interested in working with any and all of my \ncolleagues who want to work to reform and to improve the budget process \nin a way by going back to the future, going back to some of those \nvalues and some of the practices that got us to a place where we had a \nbalanced budget, including the notion that if a Senator wants to \nincrease spending, he has to come up with an offset--lower spending \nsomeplace or to raise revenues someplace.\n\n  If we want to cut the revenues from the Treasury, we have to come up \nwith an offset. Either raise revenues someplace else or cut spending to \noffset the loss to our Treasury from our tax cuts. Surely we can find a \ncommon cause and make sure the decisions we make in Congress truly \nrepresent the values by which those we represent live their lives. We \ncan do this. We should begin by restoring the old rules that require us \nto live within our means and, as I said earlier, pay as we go.\n  If we do that, perhaps we can save ourselves the embarrassment we \nfeel today. Perhaps we can save ourselves from standing once again on \nthe precipice of adding another billion, another hundred billion, or \nanother trillion dollars to the debt we are loading on the backs of our \nchildren and on future generations of Americans.\n  Sitting here before me today are young people. They are pages. They \ncome here to this Capitol when they are juniors in high school. They \nare the same as our oldest son. Someday somebody is going to have to \npay for the debt we, the Congress, are accumulating at the request of \nthe administration, the debt load whose ceiling we will raise later \ntoday. We do not just print money when we run deficits around here, we \nborrow money. We don't just borrow money from people who buy savings \nbonds, we don't just borrow money from people who buy Treasury \nsecurities, notes and bonds, we borrow money from people all over the \nworld.\n  We have become a huge debtor to some unlikely nations: China, Japan, \nSouth Korea, and a number of others. I am not talking about deficits of \na couple of billion dollars or even tens of billions of dollars, but \nhundreds of billions of dollars. They expect to be paid interest on \nthat debt. We have to pay\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\ninterest on that debt or default. Eventually they are going to want to \nbe repaid the principal of the money they have loaned to us.\n  My friends, if we are not careful, we are going to reach a tipping \npoint where the amount of our indebtedness becomes so great, so \nsignificant, so alarming to other nations around the world they are \ngoing to be reluctant to loan us more money unless we show some ability \nto better manage our finances.\n  When they see the threat to our ability to repay our debt go up and \nwe become a riskier investment, those other countries around the world \nare going to ask us, if we want to be able to get credit, to pay more \ninterest on our debt and to raise the interest rates. If we don't want \nto do that, we are not going to be able to roll over--renew--our debt.\n  On the other hand, if we pay the higher interest rates which we are \ngoing to be inevitably faced with, that has a dampening effect on our \neconomic recovery.\n  Someday these young pages, along with my children and their \ngeneration, are going to have to repay these debts. It is not fair to \nthem.\n  I will close with this. Does anybody in the Chamber have an idea of \nwhat the interest payment on our national debt is today? About $1 \nbillion. Just 1 day--not 1 week, 1 month--just 1 day. It is not \nprincipal, it is just interest. And we have to pay it today, tomorrow, \nand the day after that. In raising our debt ceiling today, that $1 \nbillion interest payment is not going to go down, it is going to go up.\n  We can do better than this. Beginning in January we have to. With \nthat having been said, I yield my time and thank my colleague from \nMontana for yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator. I thank the Senator from Montana \nfor the opportunity to use a few minutes to describe what I see as the \nlatest in a series that is rather discouraging for America. It is fair \nto say, using that expression that has been coined around the country \nover a number of years: Mr. President, there we go again. For the third \ntime in 3 years, President Bush has gone over the limit on our Nation's \ncredit card. So now the President is asking Congress to raise his \nlimit. That is often an expression used at gaming tables in Las Vegas \nand Atlantic City and other casino establishments. I don't know whether \nthat is what we have here. Is this a casino where we are willing to bet \ntable stakes, everything that we have, because we are out of control?\n  I want to say to President Bush that this solution may work for you, \nbut everyday Americans don't have the luxury of simply saying: You know \nwhat, give me a little more credit so I can continue to deal with this \nso irresponsibly. Banks simply will not agree to increase people's \ncredit limits when they rack up dollars and debt on their card. That is \nwhat President Bush is asking members to do today. We are the bank's \nchief lending officers and he wants us to raise his credit limit.\n\n  Simply put, what we are seeing in this administration is credit card \neconomics. It is totally irresponsible and among the most reckless \nadministrations in the history of this country with their fiscal \nmanagement.\n  Why are we in this mess? Because President Bush and the Republican \nmajority in the Congress decided they wanted to give the wealthiest in \nAmerica a big tax cut. A portion of the President's tax cut goes to \npeople like myself who are in the highest percentage of wage earners.\n  I had a successful business career. I was lucky I did what I did in \nthe computer industry many years ago when America presented all kinds \nof opportunities for me to work and create something of lasting value.\n  The top 1 percent of the wage earners are receiving this tax cut that \nequals $100 billion every single year. That is almost a third of the \ntotal cost of operating. The worst part about this mountain of debt we \nare being asked to authorize is it is going to be on the backs of our \nchildren and grandchildren. Who among us would say, I want to live high \non the hog, so here, kids, here grandchildren, you pay the bill while \nwe go ahead on this spending kick?\n  President Bush simply wants to leave this debt burden to future \ngenerations. I don't want to do it.\n  If colleagues vote to raise this debt limit, they are voting to \nsaddle every child in this country with an immediate debt burden of \n$27,764.\n  I look at the wonderful young people we have, known as pages, who get \na taste of government from their experience here, spending a term in \ntheir high school years. Each page will owe $27,000 as a result of what \nwe are doing here today. It raises the debt limit above $8 trillion for \nthe first time ever in our history.\n  It is sometimes hard to get a grasp on numbers like that, so let me \ntry to put that in perspective. I cannot imagine what $8 trillion is \nlike. We are not talking about stacks of $1 bills. It is two-thirds of \nthe value of the entire New York Stock Exchange. That is how much we \nare in debt. If we want to pay it off right now, we have to hand over \ntwo-thirds of our stock market. It is irresponsible. It is impossible \nto comprehend.\n  The deficit is a real problem that affects our lives and our Nation's \neconomy. When President Bush took over and got a resounding endorsement \nfrom people across the country for his second term, we were in a \nposition of surplus. I was on the Budget Committee. I was fairly senior \non the Budget Committee on the Democratic side. We struggled and we \npushed and President Clinton encouraged us and he twisted arms of both \nparties--not just the Democrats, but the Republicans--and we got a \nbalanced budget in place. We had over $200 billion in surplus in the \nyear 2002.\n  Now we are looking at a debt just for this year that could be \nsomewhere in the $600 billion range; $488 billion. But including the \ncost for the extra borrowing, it will be somewhere around $600 billion \nin debt. When President Bush took over we had an almost $300 billion \nsurplus. That is quite a change.\n\n  Tomorrow, there is an official dedication ceremony for the Clinton \nPresidential Center. What a difference between the economic policies of \nthose days and current times. President Clinton understood the \nimportance of fiscal discipline. Right now, there is no concept of it \nwhatever. What we have now is a deficit attention disorder. We look at \nthis credit card and we see what has been asked: Through November of \n2004, $7.384 trillion.\n  I was the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee in 1997 when \nwe negotiated the historic Balanced Budget Act that produced surpluses \nfor the first time in three decades. What we were looking for was a $5 \nto $7 trillion surplus in 10 years.\n  There is no fiscal discipline. We are running the biggest deficit in \nhistory. Because of the 1997 balanced budget agreement, the surpluses \nit produced, we were able to pay down $600 billion in debt. We were on \na path to pay off public debt by the year 2008. Now, because of the \nreckless tax cuts that President Bush and the Republican controlled \nCongress have pushed through, instead of being debt free, we are going \nto be at least $10 trillion in debt by 2008. No one on the other side \ncan seriously argue that we will be better off $10 trillion in debt.\n  The Republican plan is to borrow and spend, saddle future generations \nwith the responsibility for paying the bills. That is a terrible abuse \nof the financial future of our country. I don't think responsibility of \nour children should be just a Democrat or Republican value. It should \nbe an American value. We cannot abandon it.\n  We all know in our homes and families, if we spend more than we take \nin, if we spend more than our salaries, we have to be able to borrow to \nkeep our families afloat. That is what the United States of America is \ndoing right now, borrowing to keep us afloat, putting us ever deeper in \ndebt, and transferring that obligation from ourselves to future \ngenerations. My children, my grandchildren, and other people's children \nand grandchildren will have to shoulder part of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, elections obviously are an extraordinary \nopportunity to listen to the American people, to learn, to debate, and \nto test ourselves and our ideas. This election was\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\nno different. It was an honor to live out a great debate in our country \nin which we talked about the kind of nation we want to live in and what \nour responsibilities are to each other and, of course, to future \ngenerations.\n  Whatever lessons you learn about a campaign--and there were many--at \nthe core, obviously, are issues. Those issues did not go away on \nNovember 3 no matter the results.\n  We are here in the Congress with fundamental responsibilities to \ncontinue the fight for those things Americans care about and that \nmatter to the long-term health and welfare of our Nation. I intend to \ncontinue to fight on those issues as hard as I did in crisscrossing \nthis great country of ours.\n  At the heart of every issue I heard about from Oregon to Florida, \nIowa to Ohio, and every State in between, whether it was affordable \nhealth care or good jobs or taxes or energy independence or America's \nrole in the world and her respect, above all, Americans continually \nexpressed their understanding that our ability to meet all of those \nneeds rises and falls with our economy, with the strength of our \neconomy, the quality of the jobs that we create in America, the kind of \ninvestments we make in the lives of our children, and the quality of \nthe jobs of the future. All of those choices ride on the fiscal choices \nwe make as a government.\n  Those are lessons we have learned the hard way over the course of the \nlast century or more. That is why I believe, as do others who have \nspoken in this Chamber during the course of the day, we need to deal \ncandidly and immediately with some sense of urgency with the debt and \nthe debt limit of the United States. We have a fundamental \nresponsibility to restore fiscal responsibility rather than merely \nvoting again to raise the debt limit as if there is an endless credit \ncard at the expense of the American people.\n  Americans struggle to balance their budget. I heard about those \nstruggles all across this country, people who can barely afford to pay \ntheir bills, people who have seen their health care go up 64 percent, \ntheir tuition go up 35 percent, gasoline prices go up, cost of \npurchasing drugs go up, and their wages are down. The American people \nare struggling to be able to pay their bills. Congress is not \nexhibiting the similar kind of struggle or even effort. The American \npeople sit down at their kitchen tables and they try to play by the \nrules every single day. Congress seems ready to write new rules \nwhenever it wants. We used to understand the responsibility to future \ngenerations. In the 1980s, Washington dug an enormous hole, a deficit \nhole, and it became apparent to all on Wall Street and all of the \ncorridors of fiscal responsibility and power in America that we needed \nto make a better set of choices. So we made tough choices in the 1990s \nto dig ourselves out of that hole. And now here we are again, in 2004, \nback again with a new hole, deeper, with more grave consequences than \nat any time in American history. Neither Congress nor the \nadministration has been willing to face up to that reality, even as the \nconsequences grow and stare us in the face.\n  Let me put that in perspective. In less than 4 years, a 10-year $5.6 \nbillion budget surplus was turned into a $2.4 trillion debt. That is \nthe worst fiscal turnaround in our Nation's entire history. Since \nraising the debt limit last year, the Government has run up more debt \nthan all of the Presidents from George Washington through Ronald \nReagan. In fact, almost three-quarters of the entire debt of the United \nStates of America in our 228-year history has been run up during the \ncourse of the last three Republican administrations. Taxpayers have \nbeen left with a record deficit in both of the past 2 years, up to a \nrecord $413 billion for 2004. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, we are going to run $300 billion deficits every single year for \nthe next decade, and that is without including one of the President's \nnew proposals made in the course of the last year of the campaign. So \nthe United States is operating a borrow-and-spend Government, \ncontinuously stretched by demands for more tax cuts and by more \nspending. When there is not enough money to pay for those choices, \nwhich are voluntary choices, they simply go into debt and put the tab \non the national credit card and they send the bill to our kids. It is \nan economic policy of borrow and spend, and it simply cannot be \nsustained. After the new debt limit passes this week, and it will, the \nadministration will have added $2.1 trillion to the debt limit in less \nthan 4 years. That amounts to more than $7,200 for every man, woman, \nand child in the United States, and all of that money must eventually \nbe paid back, or at least partially paid back in significant amounts \nwith interest.\n  The interest payments alone are staggering and depriving us of \nchoices that we ought to be making for long-term investment in our \ncountry itself. The Government may spend it today, but Americans \nultimately will pay the bill. That means a child born today is going to \nenter the world owing more than $17,000 when our last and expected debt \nis totaled up. As everybody knows, our children grow up with a set of \nexpectations about their future that are now impacted extraordinarily \nby the choices we are making on their behalf, and whether it is a \nchoice to buy a car or home or save for their own families or save for \ncollege, all of those are going to be impacted negatively by the \nunwillingness of Congress to be responsible at that moment. Their \nability to save will be eaten away by their share of what this \nGovernment is going to have already spent in debt. This could be called \na birth tax, a birth tax that is dumped on the back of every American \nchild unwillingly.\n\n  I think, and I think most persons believe, to saddle our children \nwith this debt is wrong. As Republican Pete Peterson said, the ultimate \ntest of a moral society is the kind of world it leaves to its children. \nAnd I think about that concept as we are about to slip our own kids and \ngrandkids a check for our free lunch. I say we are failing the moral \ntest. That is Republican Pete Peterson speaking.\n  And it is not just the mountain of debt that is the problem. It is \nalso where the money comes from. To pay our bills, America now goes cup \nin hand to nations such as China, Korea, Taiwan, and the Caribbean \nbanking centers. China now holds $172 billion of our Nation's debt. \nKorea holds $63 billion, Taiwan holds $56 billion, and the Caribbean \nbanking centers hold more than $191 billion. Since 2001 alone, the \nshare of U.S. Treasury debt held by foreigners has risen to 42 percent \nfrom 30 percent. It is increasingly dangerous for so much of our \nGovernment and our standard of living to be dependent on foreign \ncapital. If foreign investors were to suddenly decide to stop financing \nour borrowing habits or to see weakness in the American economy, it \ncould have a spiraling impact on our own economy, international \ncurrency markets would be shaken, and our economy would quickly follow. \nIf those investors began to withdraw their capital, our financial \nmarkets would plummet and interest rates would climb. That will make \neverything American families need, from a home, to a car, to \nappliances, to education, all of it, more expensive. It will make it \nharder for businesses, and especially small businesses, to raise \ncapital and invest in jobs and economic growth.\n  What is more, with so much of our debt owned by other nations, U.S. \ndiplomatic and trade negotiators face increased difficulty in making \ndemands of major creditor nations. How do you go to a country that \nholds so much of your debt while your economy is closely linked to \ntheirs and start to make the powerful argument about nuclear \nproliferation or human rights, democratization, and other issues that \nare of importance and great consequence to our country?\n  It is only a matter of time before America learns the hard way that \ndebt is more than a financial liability, it weakens America's security, \nand it weakens our diplomacy and our trade. Our budget mismanagement, \nthe negligence of borrow-and-spend policies, leaves us vulnerable to \nthe priorities of foreign creditors. And that is unhealthy and \nirresponsible.\n  So what do we do about that? Well, we can argue over the cause of the \nproblem, of what made this borrow-and-spend institutionalized approach \nthe reality it is today. But I think it is more important for us now to \ntry to find a solution; that is, to work to find economic policies that \nare going to create opportunity and demand responsibility.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1985, the Federal deficit was \nsoaring,\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\nout of control, just like it is today. And in the 1980s, the National \nDebt Clock in New York City became a symbol for a Federal deficit and a \ndebt that were out of control. Back then, many Democrats thought we \ncould continue to spend and to spend without having to pay the bill. \nAnd back then most Republicans claimed that if you gave huge tax cuts \nto the wealthy, they were somehow going to pay for themselves.\n  At the same time, we were lucky to have leadership from a group of \nreformers on both sides of the aisle, people such as Republican \nSenators Warren Rudman and Phil Gramm, and Senator Fritz Hollings on \nthe Democratic side. They pushed for a deficit reduction plan that had \nreal teeth in it. They continued that fight until it was finally won.\n  The choice was tough. Fiscal sanity was won by exactly one vote in \nboth Houses of Congress. But finally, in 1997, we finished the job by \npassing a historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement. It not only \nbalanced the budget for the first time since 1969, but it extended the \nlife of Medicare, it expanded health care for children, and it cut \ntaxes for middle class Americans.\n  Four years ago, the numbers on the National Debt Clock were spinning \nbackwards. Today, in New York, the National Debt Clock has now been \nturned back on, and the numbers are rising faster than you and I can \nfollow. As Senator Hollings retires from the Senate, I think we need \nmore of that kind of effort that was offered in the 1980s and 1990s in \norder to find the common ground that he and Senator Rudman brought to \nthis debate almost 20 years ago. It is time again to follow that \nexample.\n  There are a lot of ideas out there. We can end tax cuts that do not \ncreate jobs but do create enormous debt. We can find incremental \nsavings by streamlining Government itself. We can reduce or eliminate \nprograms that we simply cannot afford. We could establish a commission \nto independently evaluate and eliminate corporate subsidies. But more \nimportant than any individual proposal is that the White House and \nCongress make a fundamental commitment to end this policy of borrow-\nand-spend economics.\n  We need to make economic opportunity and fiscal responsibility a \ncommon goal. And we have to live by some rules, rules such as a budget \nthat requires us to pay for what we spend, rules that give the debt \nlimit meaning. Today the debt limit is fanciful. It is just a number on \na piece of paper, and Congress raises it any time it wishes. It is no \nlimit at all. I believe we can do these other things. We could make \nthese other choices if we set clear national priorities, if we make the \ntough decisions, not just about the programs of others but about our \nown proposals.\n\n  We have to do this because it is critical to any credible economic \nplan and to the creation of new, good-paying jobs. An America that \nignores our national debt and the deficit will be an America that \ninvites inflation and recession. An America that pays for new \ninitiatives and follows real budget rules will be an America that \ncreates a new era of prosperity and opportunity for all Americans. We \nknow how to do this. We did it in the 1990s. Now it is time to return \nour Government to that fiscal responsibility and to invest in the \nfuture and to create new jobs in America that pay more than the jobs we \nare losing overseas, and to raise the standard of living for American \nworkers.\n  I will not vote for a borrow-and-spend economic policy when there are \nbetter alternatives.\n  Over the last year, in the cities and towns that I was privileged to \ntravel in all across our Nation, I have been reminded again and again \nof the hopes of the American people and of families that play by the \nrules and do what is right for their kids and try to do what is right \nfor aging parents and for a Social Security system and a Medicare \nsystem that are under increasing pressure and strain.\n  Those Americans are faced with tough choices every day. They expect \nus, similarly, to make tough choices. I think Washington ought to live \nby the same rules they do. None of these choices are about numbers and \nabout dollars and statistics alone. They are really about the \nresponsibility we have as one generation to another and, most \nimportantly, the responsibility we have vested in us as Members of the \nCongress and the need to try to work together and find the unity, as we \ndid in the 1990s, to come up with a solution that acts in the interests \nof Americans and that does not avoid that fundamental responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we reserve whatever time \nthere is for the leadership. I do not know if the Senator from Michigan \nwants to speak now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed for up to 15 minutes from the time under the control \nof the Democratic manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues and I appreciate the \neloquence of the Senator from Massachusetts in speaking about the \nserious challenges that face our country. And I rise today to oppose \nthe legislation in front of us that would raise the debt limit.\n  This bill will enable this Congress to incur the largest national \ndebt in the history of our country. I remember in 1997 coming to the \nU.S. House of Representatives. I was in my first term, and I had the \nopportunity, within 6 months of being elected, to vote on balancing the \nbudget for the first time in 30 years. That was one of my proudest \nvotes as a Member of the House and remains one of my proudest votes as \na Member of Congress.\n  When it comes to fiscal irresponsibility, though, at this time, this \nadministration has broken all records and turned the clock back from \nthat historic moment in 1997 when we balanced the budget for the first \ntime in 30 years. They have rolled back the clock now to a huge fiscal \nmess with redtape and red ink as far as the eye can see.\n  Despite inheriting the largest 10-year surplus in the history of our \ncountry, this administration turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into a $3.5 \ntrillion deficit. That is a lot of money. This $9.1 trillion turnaround \nis the largest we have ever seen. It is absolutely historic and \nextremely disturbing to all of us.\n  Also, in fiscal year 2004, this administration was responsible for \nthe largest deficit in the history of the country--$413 billion, the \nlargest deficit in the history of the country.\n  To make matters worse, the President is proposing even more debt over \nthe next 10 years. So we have in front of us an effort to raise the \ndebt ceiling instead of efforts to, in fact, lower the debt. And there \nare proposals on the horizon that will increase the debt even more. \nProposals to make tax breaks for the privileged few permanent will add \napproximately $1.2 trillion more to the debt.\n  The administration's Social Security privatization scheme would cost \nsomewhere between $1 trillion and $2 trillion more.\n  We need to take heed and the administration needs to take heed of the \nold saying that when you are in a hole, the first thing you need to do \nto get out of it is to stop digging.\n  We are in the middle of a war in Afghanistan and in Iraq. We must \nprovide our troops with whatever they need. Unfortunately, every time \nCongress has considered proposals to pay for these war costs, the \nleadership and the administration has pulled out all the stops to \ndefeat them, preferring not to budget for the war, still incurring the \ncosts; and we have the resulting deficit, rather than planning and \nbudgeting to make sure our troops have what they need.\n  Congress now has no budget discipline requirement. There has been a \nbipartisan proposal pending in Congress, which I support, to enact the \npay-as-you-go system of budget discipline. This passed earlier this \nyear as an amendment to the Senate budget resolution. It was dropped \nthen in conference committee and, as a result, this Congress never \npassed a final budget resolution. Therefore, Congress can go on cutting \nrevenue, having spending increases that are not budgeted, with no \ndiscipline whatsoever.\n  These massive deficits are pushing interest rates higher. This means \nthat\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nAmerican families will have to pay more for mortgage payments and car \npayments and student loans. Talk about a hidden tax. Every time we see \nincreases in interest rates, we are taking more money out of the \npockets of our middle-income taxpayers, working families, those who are \ntrying to have the American dream, to have a home for their families, \nsend kids to college, buy a new automobile, and pay for other costs \nthat involve borrowing. Those interest rates are a direct tax on our \nfamilies, and particularly hit hard are those in middle America.\n  If we don't have the fiscal discipline to be able to bring this \ndeficit down and bring this budget back into balance, as we did in \n1997, we will continue to see the hidden tax of interest rates hitting \nour families and our businesses.\n  Worst of all, fiscal recklessness means that, as adults, our children \nwill be hit with the needed tax increase to pay our bills. In fact, \nevery child born in America today effectively has over a $20,000 bill \nhanded to them to pay for the country's national debt. Our national \ndebt really ought to be called a birth tax on our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  These large deficits are bad for our economy and they do not \nrepresent real American values. American families know they need to pay \ntheir bills. We need to pay our bills. We all do. We sit down with our \nfamilies to figure out how to pay the bills. They cannot pass an \nincrease in their own personal debt limit every time they want to spend \nmore, which is what the Senate is doing today.\n  Families have to live within a budget. They must make tough choices \nevery month. They often must decide between things such as new school \nclothes for the children, saving for a college education, or buying the \nmedicine they desperately need for their families. Parents are \nresponsible for their household budgets. They pay mortgages and tuition \neither by working another job or doing without something. In other \nwords, families must borrow responsibly, live within their means. In \nother words, they must play by the rules. We should be doing the same.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Republican majority does not think the Congress \nshould have to play by the same rules as families. This is dead wrong. \nI believe it is hypocritical for us to talk about families needing to \nmake tough choices in balancing their budgets if we are not willing to \nbalance our own.\n  An increasing national debt also violates one of our most important \nvalues--that we want our children to be better off than we were. We \nwant to leave them a better country than we inherited. Parents all over \nAmerica care about this and do this every day. They work hard to pay \nfor their children's college so they can be successful, to build a \nbusiness so they can pass it on to their children; they build a little \nnest egg so that when they pass on, their children will get a small \ninheritance to help raise their own children and be able to have the \nAmerican dream.\n  These are true American values. They are our responsibility, playing \nby the rules, thinking about others other than yourself.\n  Instead of making life better for our children, we are doing just the \nopposite by focusing on raising the debt limit rather than paying down \nthe debt. We are leaving them a country that is worse off financially, \nand we are saddling them with a debt that will have consequences for \nthem throughout their lifetimes. Again, they will have to pay our \nbills. That is not the way it should be in the greatest country in the \nworld.\n  Our President talks about an ownership society, where Americans are \nfinancially independent and responsible. We need this same principle \napplied to this administration's fiscal policies.\n  Unfortunately, what the President's ownership society really means is \nthat our children will own all of the national debt. This is immoral, I \nbelieve. I believe it does not reflect our values as Americans. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this legislation. You know, it is kind of like \na ``get out of jail free'' card for a fiscally irresponsible situation \nhere, led by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and this \nadministration.\n  I believe we need to stay and take whatever time it takes in order to \nmake the tough decisions to deal with the budget and spending \npriorities. We need to focus on the real values and real priorities of \nthe people we represent, the families who are out there trying to \nbalance their budgets and make ends meet and provide for their families \nevery single day. They are making tough choices. They are making even \ntougher choices because of the decisions that are made here. I believe \nthat continuing a situation that will only raise interest rates on \nfamilies and on businesses, which is really a tax, is not what we ought \nto be doing in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, last year, I stood with several \nof my colleagues in the Senate and voiced concerns that the effort to \nincrease the debt limit by nearly $1 trillion was the wrong fiscal \ncourse to take this Nation. Indeed, I did not oppose the debt limit \nincrease because of any ideological opposition to doing so. In fact, \nduring my husband's administration, we raised the debt limit \npermanently on two separate occasions.\n  But what was different then was that we had a solid plan to balance \nthe budget, and thereby begin paying down our Nation's debt. That plan \nworked. We had the largest budget surpluses in the history of this \nNation and we retired nearly half a trillion dollars of our Nation's \ndebt while creating jobs, growing our economy and lifting millions of \nAmericans out of poverty.\n  With the current administration's agenda, there is no plan for \nrestraint or moderation, nor is there any solid framework for paying \ndown our Nation's debt. During these next four years, we know we will \nbe making a huge investment for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan and we \nknow that we will continue to make significant and increased \ninvestments in homeland security, education and health care. Faced with \nthese growing budgetary pressures, I am amazed that the same passion \nused to champion and implement this administration's agenda over the \nlast four years has been entirely muted when it comes to fiscal \nrestraint or responsible choices to balance the budget or pay down our \nnational debt.\n  This certainly wasn't the case during the 90's when, even though we \nwere making solid progress in reducing the deficit and the national \ndebt, we were warned that our national debt would ``threaten future \ngenerations, threaten the future of our children, threaten our Social \nSecurity system and threaten our ability to lead the way in the global \neconomy of the 21st century.''\n  Last year, when I opposed the last debt limit increase, I said that \nabsent any plan from this administration to address the growing deficit \nand exploding debt, we would be here again. Here we are one year later, \nabout to pass the third increase in 4 years, having permanently \nincreased the debt ceiling by over $2.2 trillion or $8,100 for every \nman, woman and child in the United States. However nothing from the \nadministration in terms of a plan to reduce the debt or making \nresponsible choices has changed. Indeed, the only thing that has \nchanged since the last debt increase is that our budget deficit has \ndeteriorated by $50 billion.\n  Given the reckless fiscal course taken over the last several years, \nand little evidence to indicate a shift from that course, I cannot, in \ngood conscience support another step that passes along the burdens of \nthis generation to the next because of our failure to address these \nproblems today. Raising this debt limit while embracing policies that \nfurther exacerbate the deficit is in essence a ``children's tax,'' a \nburden borne not by this administration or this Congress, but by our \nsons, our daughters, and our grandchildren.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2986, a bill to \nincrease the Federal debt limit.\n  I support this increase because it is necessary to preserve the full \nfaith and credit of the U.S. Government.\n  Without an increase in the debt limit, our Government will face a \nchoice between breaking the law by exceeding the statutory debt limit, \nor breaking faith with the public by defaulting on our debt. Neither \nchoice is acceptable.\n  To understand why we are here today seeking to increase the debt \nlimit, it is\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\nnecessary to explain a few things about the Federal debt.\n  Under current law, there is a statutory limit on the amount of debt \nthat can be issued by the Federal Government. This limit which now \nstands at $7.384 trillion applies to virtually all of the debt issued \nby the U.S. Government.\n  There is only one debt limit, but there are two types of debt--debt \nheld by the public and debt held by the various Government trust funds.\n  The amount of Federal debt held by the public is determined by the \nGovernment's annual cash-flow. When total spending exceeds total taxes, \nthe Government has a budget deficit.\n  To finance this deficit, the Government borrows from the public by \nselling debt, such as Treasury bills, notes, and bonds.\n  We will hear a lot of criticism that President Bush's tax cuts are \nresponsible for our rising public debt. But the facts show otherwise.\n  When President Bush took office in 2001, the Federal debt limit was \n$5.95 trillion.\n  The debt limit was increased to $6.4 trillion in 2002 and to $7.384 \ntrillion in 2003.\n  Assuming we increase the debt limit again today, it will be $8.184 \ntrillion.\n  Thus, the Federal debt limit will have increased $2.234 trillion \nsince President Bush took office in 2001.\n  However, the tax cuts that have been enacted since 2001 total less \nthan $700 billion through the end of the most recent fiscal year, and \nthat includes the interest cost as well.\n  Thus, the President's tax cuts account for less than 30 percent of \nthe increase in the Federal debt limit.\n  The rest of the increase in public debt is due to the recession, the \nwar in Iraq, and homeland security.\n  In addition to the debt held by the public, the Federal debt limit \nalso applies to the debt held by various Government trust funds--such \nas Social Security and Medicare.\n  Whenever a trust fund program collects more than it spends, the \nsurplus is invested in special issue Treasury securities. These special \nsecurities count toward the debt limit.\n  However, it is important to understand the amount of debt held by the \ntrust funds does not reflect the Government's unfunded obligations.\n  For example, the Treasury Department reports that the total amount of \nFederal debt held by all of the trust fund programs is just over $3 \ntrillion.\n  However, the Social Security and Medicare trustees report that the \nunfunded obligation of Social Security and Medicare is more than $72 \ntrillion.\n  Given these facts, it should be obvious to everyone that the Federal \ndebt limit provides a misleading and inaccurate picture of the \nGovernment's future liabilities.\n  Efforts to use the statutory debt limit to control Government debt \nand deficits cannot succeed because it ignores the long-term budget \nproblem.\n  Indeed, even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has suggested \nthe debt limit has outlived its usefulness and should be replaced with \na more accurate and useful alternative.\n  I would welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues to develop \nsuch an alternative.\n  However, pending the outcome of such an effort, I would strongly urge \nevery Senator to support this bill.\n  Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan in the Federal Reserve Board's \nsemiannual monetary policy report to the Congress before the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, February 11, 2003:\n\n       In the Congress's review of the mechanisms governing the \n     budget process, you may want to reconsider whether the \n     statutory limit on the public debt is a useful device. As a \n     matter of arithmetic, the debt ceiling is either redundant or \n     inconsistent with the paths of revenues and outlays you \n     specify when you legislate a budget.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I cannot in good conscience support \nthis request to raise the national debt limit to $8.1 trillion. Rather \nthan raising the debt limit by $800 billion, we should be taking \nconcrete steps to lower our budget deficit and reduce our national \ndebt.\n  If today's increase is adopted, President Bush will have raised the \nNation's debt limit by more than $2 trillion. In other words, just 4 \nyears into the job he has raised the debt limit more than any President \nin U.S. history.\n  The Federal budget deficit reached a record $422 billion for fiscal \nyear 2004, according to the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  Over the next 10 years the President's budget will create $2.3 \ntrillion in additional debt for our Nation. This is a stunning \nturnaround from 4 years ago, when the budget showed: a $127 billion \nbudget surplus, and a projected 10-year surplus of $5.7 trillion.\n  This is a mind-numbing $8.0 trillion turnaround in just 4 years.\n  Given these numbers, it is not surprising that the debt limit has \nbeen raised twice in the past 2 years--by $450 billion in 2002 and by \n$984 billion in 2003.\n  At the same time he is raising the debt limit, President Bush is \npromising to ``cut the deficit in half over the next five years.'' But \nhis numbers don't add up and he has provided no clear path to achieve \nthis goal.\n  In contrast, in 1998, following nearly 30 years of deficits and a 17-\nfold increase in Federal debt from $365.8 billion to $6.4 trillion, we \npaid off $448 billion of the Nation's publicly held debt.\n  For the first time in more than a generation, some of the funds which \nwould have gone to pay interest on the debt were instead spent actually \npaying down the debt.\n  I see no similar path being offered by President Bush and now \ndeficits and interest costs are growing once again. Net interest \npayments on the Federal debt will increase sharply, from $159 billion \nin 2004 to nearly $350 billion by 2014.\n  Not surprisingly, when this Nation runs a budget deficit, the \ngovernment must borrow money from other sources to balance its books.\n  What would surprise many, however, is that we largely borrow this \nmoney from foreign countries--like China and South Korea. And the \ndegree to which this administration has borrowed from foreign nations \nis shocking.\n  Over the past 4 years, the U.S. has increased its borrowing from \nJapan to the tune of $700 billion; by $167 billion from China, $130 \nbillion from Great Britain, and $60 billion from South Korea.\n  When President Bush came to office we owed $1 trillion to foreign \ncountries. We now owe more than $1.8 trillion. We are ceding control of \nour Nation's destiny for a quick payoff to wealthy taxpayers and this \ndebt limit increase bill simply enables that disturbing behavior.\n  The Committee for Economic Development, an independent, nonpartisan \norganization of 250 business and education leaders, estimates that if \nwe stay on our current course, the deficit will rise from 3.5 percent \nof GDP today to: 6.2 percent of GDP in 2020, and 21.1 percent of GDP in \n2040.\n  Deficit growth of this nature would absolutely crush any hope this \nNation has of addressing so many of our pressing problems, like better \nhomeland security, shoring up Social Security, and fully funding No \nChild Left Behind. Deficits do matter, and unless we face up to them, \nthey could seriously harm our Nation's economy. Here is why first, \ndeficits mean increased spending on interest instead of priorities.\n  In the short term, deficits can help stimulate the economy or pay for \nemergency spending. But in the long term, they limit our Nation's \nability to fund much needed priorities. This means less money for \neducation, less money for environmental protection, and less money for \nhealth care.\n  Second, deficits lead to interest rate increases. We have been \nfortunate in recent years: interest rates and inflation have remained \nlow. But as we have seen in the past few months, as the economy picks \nup, the downward pressure on interest rates are being relieved and the \nimpact of deficits are starting to be felt. This is adding huge \nexpenses to variable home mortgages and auto loans.\n  An increase of just 1 percent adds $2,000 per year to the cost of a \n$200,000 home mortgage. This is more than the majority of American \ntaxpayers received from the President's latest tax cut.\n  Third, deficits prevent us from addressing the looming Social \nSecurity and Medicare crises. This is an issue that we can not continue \nto avoid. The retirement of the baby boomers will place a tremendous \nstrain on our social safety net. In fact, if we do not address the \nproblem, the Medicare trust fund\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\nwill go broke by the year 2019, and the Social Security trust fund by \n2052.\n  Our Nation was poised to deal with these crises at the end of the \nClinton administration.\n  Not only have we failed to shore up the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds, but we are also tapping the Social Security trust fund to \npay our bills--to the tune of $164 billion last year alone.\n  So what do we do? One possibility is to simply continue along our \ncurrent path and pass our problems on to our children and \ngrandchildren. In fact, the debt limit increase that we are debating \ntoday enables the President to borrow from future generations and sends \nthe message that we are unable to muster the political will necessary \nto pay today's obligations today.\n  So I strongly believe that the time has come to chart a different \ncourse, and make the tough choices that the President and this budget \nresolution avoid making.\n  We must adopt a balanced approach to both taxes and spending and \nreturn to a program of fiscal sanity.\n  This is what we did when I first came to the Senate over a decade \nago. At that time, a small, bipartisan group of Senators came together \nto get our fiscal house in order: Democrats worked to bring spending \nunder control; and Republicans pledged not to push for additional tax \ncuts.\n  Today, we must come together again to address the deficit and restore \nour Nation's economic security.\n  On taxes, I believe that we must move to make our Tax Code more \nequitable, not make the President's tax cuts permanent. To make the \nPresident's cuts permanent at a time when the Nation is running \nhistorically high budget deficits represents the height of fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  The Tax Policy Institute estimates the cost of making these tax cuts \npermanent would cost $1.8 trillion over 10 years--$1.8 trillion at just \nthe time that baby boomers will start retiring and Social Security and \nMedicare need to be stabilized.\n  The tragedy of our current circumstance is that, given the surpluses \nhe inherited, President Bush should have the resources available to \ndevote additional spending to healthcare, education, and the \nenvironment. But the wrong policies, at the wrong time, combined with \nthe war on terror, escalating the 2001 tax cuts, and then extending \nmany of them, have contributed toward the largest budget deficit and \nlargest national debt in the country's history. And now, the fact of \nthe matter is that we are going to need to tighten our belts and bring \nspending under control.\n  I have no problem holding the line on spending, but believe that it \nmust be done in the context of a more responsible approach to tax \npolicy.\n  Finally, we need to take a good, hard look at Social Security and \nMedicare, and start addressing some of the deeper structural problems \nwith these programs now--before they fall into crisis.\n  These are not easy answers. But holding off on additional tax cuts, \nbringing spending under control, and dealing with Social Security and \nMedicare is the only path to long term fiscal order, a balanced budget, \nand a healthy and vibrant economy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the fact that we are being asked to raise \nthe debt ceiling to $8.0 trillion is further proof of the nation's \nbankrupt economic policy. It will be the third increase in the last 2 \nyears, collectively raising the debt limit by more than $2.2 trillion. \nThere is still no credible plan in place to bring the mushrooming \ndeficits under control.\n  President Bush's massive tax cuts for the wealthy have helped to turn \nthe record surpluses he inherited into record deficits. The $5 trillion \nsurplus projected 4 years ago has turned into a $3 trillion projected \ndeficit. If we continue to follow the administration's misguided \neconomic course, the federal debt could rise to more than $14 trillion \nin the next 10 years, and there will be large annual deficits as far as \nthe eye can see.\n  Over the long term, deficits that large will cripple the ability of \nthe private sector to obtain the capital needed for companies to grow \nand create new jobs. They will also cripple the federal government's \nability to make the needed investments in education, health care, and \nscientific research which are crucial to the nation's long-term \nwellbeing.\n  These projected deficits do not even tell the whole story because \nthey do not focus on borrowing from Social Security. The proposed Bush \nbudget would raid the Social Security Trust Fund for nearly $2.5 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. These are dollars which workers pay \neach year in payroll taxes to finance their retirement. It is wrong to \ntake that money out of Social Security and use it to finance the daily \noperations of government. In essence, Social Security is being used to \nfill a piece of the huge revenue gap left by the administration's \nexcessive and unaffordable tax cuts.\n  Mortgaging the future in this irresponsible manner has not even \nbrought American families a temporary prosperity. On the contrary, it \nhas increased the financial burden on them. Their jobs are less secure. \nIn fact, 2.5 million manufacturing workers have already seen their jobs \ndisappear over the last 4 years.\n  The cost of health insurance has soared more than 50 percent; and, as \na result, 5 million fewer workers receive health coverage.\n  Tuition at public colleges has risen by 28 percent, pushing higher \neducation beyond the reach of more and more students.\n  Workers wages have grown at the slowest rate in more than 2 decades, \nand minimum wage workers have not had any increase at all in 7 long \nyears.\n  As a result of the disastrous economic policies of this \nadministration, 4.3 million more Americans are living in poverty, and \nthe household debt of the average family has increased by one-third.\n  What is the Bush administration's response? How does the President \npropose to remedy these very serious problems? More tax breaks for the \nsame wealthy people who were the primary beneficiaries of his earlier \ncuts; transferring a larger share of the tax burden from those who live \noff their accumulated wealth to those who live from paycheck to \npaycheck. If the tax proposals in the President's budget are enacted \ninto law, they would add more than $2.0 trillion more in debt over the \nnext 10 years.\n  American families cannot afford more of the same. The financial \nsqueeze is getting steadily tighter. Working men and women are the ones \npaying the price for Washington's economic mistakes.\n  Hopefully, in the new Congress, we will start to seriously address \nthese critical issues with members from both sides of the aisle and the \nadministration working together to get our economic ship of state on a \nbetter course before it hits the rocks.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled by the pending \nlegislation, which would raise the federal debt limit by $800 billion. \nThe fact that we are considering this legislation illustrates how \ndeeply the policies of this administration have plunged us into \ndeficits and debt, and yet, the President continues to push for more of \nthe same: tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, which are not paid for \nand which will continue to run up deficits and debt as far as the eye \ncan see. I am very concerned that if the President continues to pursue \nthis reckless fiscal policy, our Nation's long-term economic strength \nwill be seriously compromised.\n  Despite the fact that the President signed into law the largest debt \nlimit increase in our country's history only 18 months ago, the \nTreasury Department has now informed us that it will need to borrow \neven more to keep the government functioning. The legislation we are \nconsidering today would allow federal debt to grow to $8.184 trillion, \ntruly a staggering sum.\n  When President Bush took office, he promised that his fiscal policies \nwould include ``maximum possible debt retirement.'' At that time, the \nCongressional Budget Office was projecting that our net debt to the \npublic would decline to $36 billion by 2008, when this President leaves \noffice. Now, instead of achieving ``maximum possible debt retirement,'' \nthe President is asking for historically high debt increases. In fact, \nthe CBO is now projecting that publicly-held debt will rise to $5.6 \ntrillion in 2008--almost 40 percent of our GDP. Gross Federal debt, \nwhich includes our commitments to Social Security and Medicare, will be \nalmost $10\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\ntrillion by the time this President leaves office.\n  These figures demonstrate how seriously our economic situation has \ndeteriorated under this administration. Let me just emphasize that \npoint with one further example. When the president took office, he \ninherited a 10-year surplus estimated at $5.6 trillion. Now, when you \nfactor in some of the costs we know are coming, such as the continuing \ncosts of the war in Iraq and the cost of reforming the alternative \nminimum tax, plus the cost of some of the President's proposals, such \nas making his tax cuts permanent and continuing his defense buildup, \nthe projections are for a $3.5 trillion deficit over that same period, \na reversal of $9.1 trillion. That is a seismic shift in our position.\n  Much of this shift is a direct result of the fiscal policies pursued \nby the President during his first term. For example, consider this \nyear's budget deficit. When President Bush took office, the CBO was \nprojecting a surplus for 2004 of $397 billion. Instead, we have a \ndeficit this year of $413 billion--a shift of $810 billion. More than \none-third--37 percent--of this reversal is directly attributable to the \ntax cuts this President has enacted, tax cuts that primarily benefitted \nthe wealthiest Americans. And the President is seeking to increase our \ndebt burden by permanently extending many of these tax cuts, utterly \nignoring the fact that these massive tax cuts for the rich have led to \nbudget deficits so large that they could jeopardize our future economic \nstrength.\n  In part, my concern for our economic future stems from a change in \nthe United States' international economic position. Two decades ago, \nthe United States was a creditor nation internationally, by about 10 \npercent of our GDP. Now, because of the deterioration of our position \nover those intervening two decades, we are a debtor nation, to the tune \nof about 22 percent percent of our GDP. Our status as a debtor nation \nhas worsened considerably since President Bush took office: between \nJanuary 2001 and July 2004, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury debt \nincreased by 79 percent. The large budget deficits that have appeared \nduring the last 4 years have made us inordinately dependent on the \ninflux of capital from abroad in order to sustain ourselves.\n  What will happen to the United States if foreign buyers of our debt \ndecide to make their investments elsewhere? As the Washington Post \nexplained in an article on October 19, 2004:\n\n       Foreign governments and individuals hold about half of the \n     $3.7 trillion in outstanding U.S. Treasury bonds, for \n     example, and the government has been heavily dependent on \n     continued overseas bond purchases to finance the roughly $1 \n     billion a day it has to borrow to pay its bills. Foreign \n     lending and investment are also needed to finance the \n     country's roughly $50 billion monthly trade deficit, while \n     foreign capital has been a key prop to U.S. stock prices. A \n     turn in overseas attitudes toward the United States could \n     ripple deeply through the economy, depressing the market, \n     raising interest rates and pushing down the value of the \n     dollar.\n\n  There are already signs that this is beginning to happen. The \nTreasury Department reported in October that net monthly capital flow \nfrom the rest of the world into the United States fell in August, for \nthe sixth time this year. As reported last week by the Wall Street \nJournal,\n\n       Since Election Day, the dollar has fallen 1.4 percent to an \n     all-time low against the euro. . . . The catalyst for its \n     most recent decline was President George W. Bush's re-\n     election last Tuesday. Investors perceive his policies as \n     likely to aggravate the steep U.S. budget deficit.\n\n  What is more, if it were not for the currency manipulation that many \nof our Asian trading partners are engaged in, the dollar would be \nsignificantly lower than it already is against those currencies as \nwell. If this trend continues, the United States could be in for a \nperiod of significant economic contraction.\n  As I said 18 months ago, during the debate on the last debt limit \nincrease, the United States' international financial position reminds \nme of Tennessee Williams's Blanche DuBois in ``A Streetcar Named \nDesire,'' who said: ``I have always depended on the kindness of \nstrangers.'' That is what has happened to the United States in the \ninternational economic scene. We have deteriorated into a debtor status \nso that we are now dependent upon the kindness of strangers. That is \nnot where the world's leading power should find itself.\n  This dramatic change in our economic situation comes at a time when \nthe United States is facing a demographic tidal wave as the baby boom \ngeneration approaches retirement. When President Bush first took \noffice, that retirement was almost a decade away. But time has run out. \nThe first of the baby boomers will begin to retire in 2008, on this \nPresident's watch. Unfortunately, rather than prepare for the \nobligations we know are coming, this President has squandered every \nopportunity to save for the future.\n  Moreover, his policy of deficit-financed tax cuts makes us less able \nto make needed investments today. Every increase in the government's \ndebt means we are siphoning off resources that could be used for other \npurposes simply to pay the interest on that debt. Net interest payments \non our debt are expected to consume more than $1 trillion over the next \n5 years. Instead of making investments in education, in health care, in \ntransportation, we are paying billions of dollars in interest costs \nthat would not have existed in the absence of the reckless fiscal \npolicy of the last 4 years.\n  Not only do these policies jeopardize our current and future economic \nstrength, they place a tremendous burden on our children and \ngrandchildren who will have to pay off this debt. By cutting taxes for \nthe wealthiest, the President is really raising taxes on everyone, \nincluding our children and grandchildren, by leaving them with the \nresponsibility for paying off this enormous debt.\n  It is unfortunate that this Administration has demonstrated such a \nsingle-minded focus on cutting taxes, regardless of the very serious \nchange in our economic situation and our country's current and future \nneeds. The fact that the President is calling for still more tax cuts \nat the same time the Congress is being asked to add $800 billion to the \nFederal debt ceiling is beyond reckless--it places in jeopardy our \nfuture economic strength and the economic security of all Americans.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support raising the limit on our \nnational debt to $8.184 trillion without taking other steps to restore \nfiscal responsibility. The fact that this is the third debt increase in \nthree years highlights the irresponsibility of the fiscal policies of \nthis administration. These policies have taken the nation from two \nyears of record surplus--when we were paying down our debt--to this \nadministration's record deficits and debt. A crippling burden is being \npassed to our children and grandchildren, and the economic security of \nour nation is threatened as a result.\n  The three recent increases in the debt limit reflect an astounding \nincrease of more than $2.2 trillion. And unless we make a significant \nchange in our fiscal policies, the outlook for avoiding future \nincreases doesn't look any brighter. The Congressional Budget Office, \nCBO, forecasts that our gross Federal debt, which includes debt the \nGovernment owes to the public plus funds owed to federal trust funds \nlike Social Security and Medicare, will climb from its 2003 level of \n$6.8 trillion to $13.3 trillion in 2014. And this shocking estimate \ndoesn't even include the costs of continued military operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan that we all know are coming. Nor does it take into \naccount the substantial cost of continuing to provide relief for \nmiddle-class families from the alternative minimum tax, which, when \napplied to them, produces totally unfair results.\n  The fiscal burden such massive debt puts on us and our children is \nstupendous. By 2014, each American citizen's share of the debt will be \n$42,903. Paying off a debt of this size will require either \nextraordinary tax increases or significant cuts in critical government \nprograms like homeland security and education. Furthermore, we will \nhave to spend an increasing amount of our precious dollars on interest \npayments. Even under the CBO's conservative estimates, net interest \npayments on the public debt will rise from $159 billion in 2004 to $348 \nbillion in 2014. Every family who has worked to balance its own budget \nknows that making interest payments diverts scarce resources from other \npriorities. Making these interest payments means fewer resources are \navailable for many of our national priorities, including shoring up the \nSocial\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\nSecurity and Medicare trust funds at a time when those programs' costs \nare about to skyrocket as members of the baby boom generation begin \nrelying on payments from those Funds to support their retirement.\n  Our rampant borrowing also threatens the economic security of our \nNation as we are forced to go deeper into debt to foreign countries. \nSince January 2001, the share of U.S. Treasury debt held by foreigners \nhas risen to 42 percent from 30 percent, and 90 percent of the new debt \nhas been purchased by foreigners. This large amount of foreign debt \nleaves our nation vulnerable to the priorities of foreign creditors. \nFor example, if foreign investors ever decide, for economic or \npolitical reasons, to stop financing our debt, U.S. and international \nmarkets could be thrown into turmoil. This provides other countries \nwith leverage during trade or other negotiations with us.\n  Our economic security is also threatened by the prospect that a \nlarger debt will lead to higher long-term interest rates. This means it \nwill be more expensive to buy a house, pay for college or pay off \ncredit card debt. This threat is made more serious by the recent \nincrease in indebtedness of American households. Since the beginning of \n2001, mortgage debt has increased by 44 percent and now stands at $7 \ntrillion. Home equity loans have jumped by 54 percent and installment \ndebt, including credit card debt, has risen 17 percent. Americans have \ntaken on these new debts largely in an attempt to maintain their living \nstandards in a struggling economy. Since much of this private debt is \nset at variable rates, any increase in interest rates will have a \nsevere and immediate impact on these families.\n  So before we raise the debt limit today, we should commit to pursuing \nmore responsible fiscal policies to prevent the need for future \nincreases. We should reinstate pay-as-you-go rules to require that in \naddition to paying for all spending, we pay for all tax cuts as well. \nThis concept is common sense for most families, who work to live within \ntheir means by balancing what goes out with what comes in.\n  We should also revisit this administration's irresponsible and unfair \ntax cuts that have driven us so deep into this deficit ditch. It is \nreckless and irresponsible that the top five percent of households in \nour country, whose average income is over $250,000 a year, received \nalmost half of these tax cuts. Restoring responsibility and \naccountability is essential to the economic and fiscal health of our \nnation. Simply raising the debt limit without taking other steps to \nrestore fiscal responsibility won't lead to that result.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Iowa on the floor. \nDoes he wish to speak now?\n  Mr. HARKIN. As long as the floor is open, I might as well speak now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana. I will not \ntake a lot of time. I wanted to talk a little bit about the measure in \nfront of us, raising the debt limit yet one more time on the American \npeople.\n  I liken it really to this right here. I will take it out of my \nbillfold. It is a credit card. You see, what the Republicans have done \nis they have put America on a credit card. What they are doing is sort \nof like: spend and pay later, feel good. There was an advertisement \nonce for a credit card company that said you can have it all. That is \nwhat the Republicans are telling us: You can have it all. We are going \nto put America on a credit card society. We can have tax cuts for the \nwealthy and the most privileged and we will put it on a credit card. We \ncan continue the war in Iraq, brought on by exaggerations and \nmisinformation to the tune of about $6 billion a month now. That is \nwhat we are spending in Iraq. I think it will $200 billion by the end \nof this fiscal year. Put it on a credit card. Put it on the credit \ncard. And, boy, does it feel good. We can have everything. We can have \nit all. That is what Republicans are telling us. All you have to do is \ngo in debt, put it on the credit card, put it on the country's credit \ncard. We all know what is going to happen. When you are running up the \ncredit card, boy, it feels good.\n\n  Who is getting all the advantages of this credit card, though? The \nwealthiest among us who got all these big tax cuts, and they are now \nshopping at Neiman Marcus. Check it out. High-end stores, the high-end \ncatalogs are doing very well. People are buying expensive trinkets, \nexpensive watches, yachts, and everything else. They made out.\n  Guess where it is coming from. It is on your credit card, America. It \nis on your credit card. And who will be paying? Working families. And \nnow they want us to extend the credit card limit one more time.\n  You see, they bumped against the limit on the credit card, so now \nthey are saying we have to extend the limit. That is what all this is \nabout. You have to put it in real-life terms. This is a real-life \ncredit card. You know what your limit is, you know what your income is, \nand you know what happens if you exceed your credit card limit and you \ncannot pay it. What happens? What happens when you cannot meet the \npayments? You either declare bankruptcy and go to bankruptcy court, or \nyour creditors come after you. They restructure you. They deny you \ncertain things so that you can start to pay off your credit card debt.\n  Guess who is now taking our credit card debt. The top countries \nholding our credit card debt are Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, \nGermany, Hong Kong, Switzerland, OPEC--the oil producing and exporting \ncountries have a lot of our debt--China. I do not mean to castigate \nChina. I happen to like the Chinese people. I think we ought to trade \nwith China, although in a more balanced way. But what happens when they \nbecome a big creditor and we are their debtor? What happens to trade \ndeals down the road?\n  Put yourself and your family in this position. What happens when you \nare the debtor and you have a creditor? Who tells whom what to do? Does \nthe debtor tell the creditor what to do? Your creditor tells you what \nyou have to do to get out of debt.\n  So what is going to happen a few years from now when we are having a \ntrade deal with China, when we are trying to hammer it out and the \nChinese do not like exactly how we are dealing? What happens when they \nare keeping the value of their currency artificially low? The debtor \ntends to pull their punch when dealing with the creditor. And we have \nbeen pulling our punches in this situation.\n  This is not some fancy kind of thing. I have heard some speeches on \nthe floor today about the debt limit. Look, this is family. This is the \nAmerican family we are talking about, and the Republicans are selling \nus out to creditors around the world. And now that we have bumped up \nagainst the limit on our credit card, they say we are going to raise \nthe limit one more time. We can put more debt on our credit card: $800 \nbillion more. Think of it as another $11,000 for a family of four.\n  Two things are happening. First is you have to pay interest, right? \nWhen you have debt on your credit card, you pay interest on that credit \ncard debt. You pay it every month or you start paying interest on the \ninterest. Guess what. You will have to pay it. That is what is \nhappening to our national debt. We raise the limit on our credit card, \nand every month we have to pay interest or what it build and build.\n  How much interest? Every man, woman, and child in America will, by \n2009, be paying $1,000 a year in taxes just to pay the interest on the \nnational debt; $4,000 for a family of four, every year, just to pay the \ninterest on the debt. And, Mr. President, that is not one tax that can \nbe cut. You cannot cut that tax. That has to be paid. The interest has \nto be paid on the debt--$4,000 a year for a family of four.\n  I have heard a lot of talk around here this year and in previous \nyears--and now I hear the President of the United States talking about \nit again--about the death tax, otherwise known as the estate tax, which \nis if you have a big estate, over $1.5 million dollars, before you pass \nit on, you have to pay taxes on the amount over that sum. They got to \ncalling it this fancy death tax, like you are taxed because you die. \nYou are not taxed because you die, you are taxed because you have large \nholdings that have built up, a lot of which you have not paid taxes on, \nthat you can pass on to other generations in your family. They call it \na death tax.\n\n  I think we ought to start talking about the birth tax. That is what \nis happening on the floor today. Increasing our national debt is \nputting a birth tax on every child born in America.\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\n  Think about it. For a child born in America 5 years hence, during \nthat child's first year of life, his or her share of the interest \npayment on the publicly held debt will be $1,000. No one is talking \nabout it. We ought to be talking about it because that is what it is--a \nbirth tax on every child born in America. You have to pay $1,000 a year \ninterest on the national debt to pay for the tax cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is what it is. It is a birth tax. Every child born \nhas to pay $1,000 in interest on the debt that first year.\n  Where did the money go? Lots went to the wealthiest in our society \nwho are now shopping at Neiman Marcus and buying fancy cars. Trickle-\ndown economics. All you have to do is give more to the wealthiest in \nour society, and it will trickle down. Nonsense. What is trickling down \nis the interest on the debt that our families have to pay. That is all \nthat is trickling down.\n  Here it is right here on this chart, the debt each American owes, per \ncapita, Federal debt outstanding. This year, $25,398 each American owes \non the Federal debt outstanding, and now we are asking one more time to \nraise the credit card ceiling. One more time we will raise it, putting \nAmerican families more in hock to the Chinese, the Japanese, the United \nKingdom, the Caribbean banking centers, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, \nSwitzerland, and the oil producing and exporting countries, the top 10 \ncountries holding our national debt.\n  This is not rocket science. All it is, pure and simple, is giving \nmore to those who already have a lot in our society. It is spending, as \nI said, on a needless war in Iraq to the tune of $6 billion a month, \nnot counting the tragic loss in American lives and innocent Iraqi \nlives. Yet, with all of that we do not even have enough money to fund \neducation. We are putting to bed, so to speak, our education \nappropriations bill. Guess what. In the Omnibus Appropriations bill we \nwill consider on the floor of the Senate this week, funding for Title I \nspending, for the poorest schools, is $8 billion short of the \nauthorized level. We have had to cut title I spending for the poorest \nschools, for the kids in the lowest income areas of America today.\n  So we do not have enough money for kids and education, for poor \nschools. We don't have enough money to make sure we have a decent \nhealth care plan for the poorest in our country and our children. Our \nmiddle-class kids graduate from college with debt up to their eyeballs \nbecause they can't afford to go to college. Our environment is being \nravaged, our transportation system is falling apart--drive down any \nhighway, thank you--yet we are asked to raise the national debt one \nmore time on this credit card so the most privileged in our society can \ncontinue their spending spree. It is time to get us off the credit \ncard.\n  A simple fact, simple truth: Republicans can't be trusted with your \nmoney. That is the simple fact. It happens every time. They simply \nthink all you have to do is run up that credit card, give tax cuts to \nthe wealthy, and everybody will be fine.\n  Someone said earlier today the responsible thing to do was to vote to \nincrease the debt limit. I am sorry. I am sorry. That is not the \nresponsible thing. That is one more irresponsible action.\n  I wouldn't mind voting to raise the debt limit if it were coupled \nwith a bill that was true tax reform, that made the wealthiest in our \nsociety pay their fair share, that provided for good education and \nhealth care for our people. Then you could say we had a fair deal. This \nis not a fair deal. We are raising the debt so the most privileged in \nour society can have more. We are raising the debt limit so countries \nlike China can have a noose around our neck.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for 60 more seconds and I will conclude.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield the Senator 60 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is a shame we have come to this. It is time to rip up \nthe credit card. It is time to take the credit card away from the \nRepublican majority here and from the President of the United States. \nIt is time that we have a fair deal for the people of this country and \nnot impose a new birth tax on every child born in America to pay this \ninterest on the national debt. It is unfair. We ought to turn it down \nand come back with a fair deal for the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleague from Montana and my colleague from \nIowa. I listened carefully to his comments.\n  We are here debating the proposition of increasing the debt limit by \n$800 billion. We have come through a time in the 1990s when we were \nactually running budget surpluses. We were paying down the debt. Now we \nare stacking debt on top of debt on top of debt. This is the most \nreckless fiscal policy I have ever seen. I didn't vote for it. I don't \nfeel responsible for things I didn't vote for.\n  Let me say that if this Senate passes an increase in the debt limit \nand does nothing about the underlying fiscal policy that has created \nit, then this Senate ill serves the American people.\n  The President says: You know, we have had an economic slowdown, a \nrecession, war, and terrorism. Yes. So have other Presidents. That is \nall true. But it seems to me it probably would have augured well for \nthis administration, then, to recognize that things have changed and \ntherefore fiscal policy must change. We are spending $5 billion a month \nevery month in Iraq and Afghanistan--$4 billion in Iraq, $1 billion in \nAfghanistan. We are not paying for one penny of it. It is all being \ncharged.\n  This administration says we are fighting a war. Yes, we are fighting \na war and guess what, this administration doesn't ask anyone to pay for \nit. They say we want to give big tax cuts mostly to people at the upper \nincome level. What kind of fiscal policy is that?\n  Part of this increase in the debt limit, I suppose, is to accommodate \nsomething that was done last year on the floor of the Senate. It says, \nyou know what we have to do now? We have to reconstruct the country of \nIraq. We want the American people to ante up $20 billion to reconstruct \nthe country of Iraq. I offered an amendment. I said: I don't think we \nought to do that. Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the \nworld. I had soldiers tell me they stood in indentations in the sand \nand got oil on their boots. I think the Iraqi people ought to pump oil \nand sell it at $45 a barrel. They will have more money than they know \nwhat to do with. But this administration believes the American taxpayer \nshould pay for the reconstruction of Iraq and the Senate should raise \nthe debt limit to make this happen. It is just one domino in this line, \nbut it is a hood ornament of failure.\n  The question is, When will this place and when will this \nadministration come to its senses? I am not saying one side is all \nright and the other side is all wrong. But I am saying this: This \nfiscal policy was constructed at the White House at a time when they \nsaid we have so much surplus we don't know what to do with it. Let's \nstart giving it back. Some of us stood on the floor of the Senate and \nsaid we ought to be a bit conservative. What if something happens we \ndid not anticipate and things change? A war? A terrorist attack? An \neconomic slowdown?\n  The President says, no, don't worry about that. The future is bright.\n  So we put in place tax cut after tax cut after tax cut and we are now \nchoking on red ink and the President doesn't seem to care much at all. \nHe doesn't address it, talk about it, or think about it. I think it's \ntrue to the admonition in Bob Woodward's books about the President \nsaying I don't want second guessers around me. Once we decide to do \nsomething, that is what we do, and I don't want to talk about it. It \nseems to me when you have a fiscal policy that created an avalanche of \ndebt for this country, the thing you ought to do--it is like the \nold southern saying about the law of holes. When you find yourself in a \nhole,\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\nstop digging. Maybe we ought to stop digging. Maybe this administration \nought to describe the fiscal policy that stops making this hole deeper. \nBut that is not what this is about today and I regret that.\n\n  There is so much to talk about. We are talking about the budget \ndeficits and the accumulated debt. By the way, every penny of the \nSocial Security surplus is being spent.\n  This administration makes the case that what matters is debt held by \nthe public.\n  No, no, that is not what matters. It is not just debt held by the \npublic. It is debt held by the public and debt instruments that exist \nin the Social Security accounts which we are going to have to repay. \nAll of that represents an obligation that this country must meet and it \nis growing and mushrooming in a way that is dangerous for the future of \nthis country. Everybody knows it except the President, apparently, and \nthose in this Chamber who have decided this President's fiscal plan is \nmoving us in the right direction.\n  You know the old saying in the western movies: Are you going to \nbelieve me or your lying eyes?\n  The fact is, we understand what is happening here. We see it. Only in \nthis town, where we make an industry out of creating euphemisms, can we \nhave enough sugar to sugarcoat this nonsense. This is awful. This \nfiscal policy is injuring this country in a very dramatic way. We ought \nto take a step right now on this debt ceiling limit and decide we are \ngoing to tell this administration we demand a change in fiscal policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask for two additional minutes, if the Senator \nfrom Montana has it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his great \nstatement. He is very perceptive.\n  One thing I did not mention, but as he alerted the Senate, we are now \nbeing told we will not be able to meet our obligations under Social \nSecurity if we continue down this path. Therefore, what we need to do \nis somehow privatize Social Security and put it out on the stock \nmarket, like Enron stock, for future beneficiaries.\n  I ask my friend from North Dakota to address that further. He touched \non it. Now we are going into debt further and further and we have huge \ntax breaks for the wealthy, for the most privileged among us, and we \nare being told we will not have enough money to pay our obligations \nunder Social Security.\n  Is that what is happening now, I ask my friend from North Dakota?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The response to that is this administration is spending \nevery single penny that comes into the Social Security trust fund. They \nwant to fight the war and do all these things and no one has to pay for \nit. Don't worry. Be happy. Dance down the sidewalk and be oblivious to \nwhat is happening.\n  We have the largest budget deficit in the history of this country and \none that, incidentally, all the experts say you cannot grow out of. But \nwe have our colleagues saying, we will just hang around, thumb our \nsuspenders, and grow out of this. I guarantee we will grow out of it, \nthey huff and puff.\n  Nonsense. And they know it is nonsense.\n  In addition to the biggest budget deficit in the history of this \ncountry, we have the biggest trade deficit in the history of this \ncountry, as well. I worry that one of these days the currency traders \nare going to look at this and say, as an electronic herd, we are moving \nelsewhere. When they do, the collapse of this dollar will have enormous \nconsequences.\n  I ask this President to provide some leadership in a fiscal policy \nthat moves us in a constructive direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the discussion with the Senator from Iowa \nand the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I ask unanimous consent 20 minutes be reserved for the use of Senator \nByrd when he is able to come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum, not charged to the \nminority side but charged to the majority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have under the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I will try to do my speech in less than \n20; not much, perhaps, but at least less.\n  Mr. President, as I begin my remarks today, I am reminded of the \nbrutally candid statement by David Stockman, President Reagan's Budget \nDirector in December 1981, when it became clear that the Reagan tax \ncuts would cause massive deficits in the Federal budget. In response to \na reporter's queries, Mr. Stockman quipped that ``None of us really \nunderstands what is going on with all of these numbers.''\n  I wonder how many of us today understand what is going on with all of \nthese numbers. We certainly do not act as though we do. This \nadministration has plunged the Federal Government deeply into debt, \ndeeply into debt, Mr. President, deeply into debt, which, unless \npolicies change, will mean deficits at historically high levels for the \nforeseeable future. Former congressional deficit hawks, many of the \nvery same people who for years decried deficit spending, seem perfectly \ncontent to go along for the ride.\n  This week, the Senate is poised to vote to increase the statutory \ndebt limit--it will take place within the hour--for the third time in \njust 3 years. The $800 billion increase that we consider today follows \na record $984 billion increase signed by President Bush in May 2003 and \na $450 billion increase signed by President Bush in June 2002. In less \nthan 3 years, under the Bush regime, the debt limit will have soared to \nthe alarming level of $8.2 trillion, with no end in sight to the \nspending and borrowing.\n  How long would it take to count a trillion dollars, Mr. President, at \nthe rate of $1 per second? It would take 32,000 years. If you want to \nknow what a trillion dollars sounds like and is, that is it. To count a \ntrillion dollars, at the rate of $1 per second, would take 32,000 \nyears.\n  Since January 2001, the gross Federal debt has increased $1.2 billion \nper day. It has increased $50 million every hour of every day. Today, \nevery man, woman, and child in the United States owes $25,206.29 on the \ndebt. In fiscal year 2004, U.S. taxpayers owed $322 billion in \ninterest--in interest? Yes, in interest on the publicly held debt. \nThese are interest payments that do not educate one child, that don't \nbuy one tank, that don't provide health care for one senior citizen. \nSkyrocketing budget deficits and an ever-increasing, destructive \nnational debt have become not merely facts of life in America today but \na way of life for tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, and for the years \nto come.\n  Lawmakers may faithfully tout the Bush administration's line that the \nWhite House is serious about cutting the Federal deficit, but the \nAmerican people have yet to see anything that would give them reason to \ntake such claims seriously. Irresponsible spending does not reflect the \nvalues of most Americans who must struggle with their own family budget \nand foot big Federal bills by paying taxes. Oh, how sweet the sound--\ntaxes.\n  For the last 4 years, we have been operating under Bush budgets. We \nhave been operating under Bush tax cuts. We have been operating under \nBush spending bills. The result has been a Bush deficit of $413 billion \nfor the fiscal year 2004.\n  How much is a billion dollars? We are talking about $413 billion. We \nare talking about $413 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. \nThink of that. We have the largest deficit in U.S. history and an \nestimated $2.3 trillion in accumulated deficits over the next decade.\n  The White House will try to blame deficits on the war on terror. \nThere happens to be two wars going on, I remind my colleagues, not just \none--one\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\nin Afghanistan and the Bush war in Iraq.\n  Let's look at the whole picture. President Bush reportedly will \nrequest an additional $75 billion early next year for the war in Iraq. \nThat is the Bush war. That request follows $203 billion already \nappropriated for Iraq and Afghanistan, bringing our total commitment to \n$278 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. The corporate tax bill that the \nPresident signed into law in October will cost $18 billion in the \ncoming 3 years to pay for special interest tax breaks, further \nincreasing budget deficits in the short run.\n  The White House's own budget office is leaking word that the budget \ndeficit will increase, not decrease, next year when the President \nsubmits his budget to the Congress.\n\n  The President's Social Security privatization proposal is projected \nto cost a trillion dollars in the coming decade, and the President's \ntax and spending proposals will likely add hundreds of billions of \ndollars more to our Nation's budget deficits. That is to say nothing of \nour mounting trade deficits that have cost an untold number of American \nworkers their jobs, or the multitrillion-dollar deficits in the Social \nSecurity and Medicare Programs that threaten senior citizens and their \nretirement and health benefits.\n  The Bush administration and the Congress have not had the courage to \naddress this mounting debt, and to debate policy changes which might \nhelp to bring these deficits under control.\n  It is hard to believe that only 2 weeks after an intense Presidential \nelection campaign in which both sides, Republican and Democrat, pledged \nto reduce the size of the deficit, the Senate's first order of business \nupon returning is to completely ignore those campaign promises and pass \nthis debt limit increase, without a debate, really, about the ways to \nreduce our Nation's huge deficit.\n  In his victory speech, George Bush pledged to work with Democrats to \nunite the country, didn't he? Well, I can think of no better way to \ndemonstrate the commitment behind that pledge than drawing on both \nparties' avowed aversion to these budget deficits and initiating a \nconstructive, bipartisan effort to move to eliminate them. We know how \nto do it. We have done it before. We have done it in a bipartisan \nmanner. We have done it successfully, without budget gimmicks, without \nconstitutional amendments. For Heaven's sake, let's don't start down \nthat road of constitutional amendments to balance the budget. We can do \nit without constitutional amendments, without granting imperious \nPresidential powers--just using plain common sense.\n  In 1990, President George Herbert Walker Bush and the 101st Congress \nnegotiated budget enforcement tools and demonstrated the courage to \nimplement them. Every budget guru in Washington, from Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan to Comptroller General David Walker to former \nDirectors of the Congressional Budget Office, agreed that those tools \nworked extraordinarily well in bringing our Nation's deficits under \ncontrol.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats voted this year to restore pay-as-you-\ngo rules, requiring new mandatory spending and new tax cuts to be \noffset. Hallelujah. President Bush endorsed those budget enforcement \nmechanisms in his fiscal year 2004 budget. Hallelujah. But he has now \nflip-flopped and wants to exclude tax cuts from the requirement that \nthey be paid for.\n  But here we stand in the midst of renewed pledges by both parties to \nwork together to address our Nation's challenges, and on this issue \nwhere so much common ground exists we are unable to muster the \npolitical courage to talk about the wolf at our doorstep.\n  So we will pass this statutory debt increase and then put it out of \nour minds until we are forced to raise it again. We all should know the \nfolly of this tactic, and as the chickens come home to roost in the \nyears ahead, the American people will surely remind us of it. It is \nmorally reprehensible to deceive the voter by claiming that deficits \ndon't matter.\n  These destructive debt figures represent a threat--yes, a threat--to \nthe Social Security system--and don't you forget it--a threat to \naffordable health care for working Americans, a threat to the promise \nof a college education for our Nation's youth, a threat to the \nfinancial underpinnings of our economy, what one editorial in the \nWashington Post described as ``the cold-hearted actuaries of doom.''\n  Economists across the political spectrum are growing increasingly \nconcerned about the effect of these mounting budget deficits on our \neconomy. The U.S. dollar continues to lose value against the Japanese \nyen, the European Euro, and the Canadian dollar. Investors may soon \nrather hold the currencies of other nations than our own, and this \nspells great trouble in boxcar letters, trouble for our country in \nforeign policy as well as domestic responsibility. Republicans and \nDemocrats increasingly view our Nation as becoming too dependent--too \ndependent--on foreign investment and with good reason.\n  According to the Treasury Department, foreign holdings--get that, \nforeign holdings--foreign holdings comprise half of our Nation's \nprivately held public debt, with much of that debt owed to countries \nsuch as China and Korea and entities such as OPEC and the Caribbean \nbanking centers. To these foreign holders, American taxpayers paid $322 \nbillion in interest payments last fiscal year on money borrowed to \nfinance our Government's operations.\n  Please understand, it is hard to scold China about its human rights \npolicies when we are in debt up to our eyeballs to such foreign \nentities. With a $413 billion deficit last year, the administration \nmust borrow the equivalent of the entire budget for the Department of \nDefense, from where? From foreign countries. That means that the Bush \nadministration cannot pay our soldiers in Iraq who are fighting the \nBush war, and Afghanistan where a war is going on that I support fully, \nwithout having to go hat in hand--hat in hand--to other countries for a \nloan and handing the U.S. taxpayer a hefty interest premium to boot.\n  It is great political rhetoric to claim that America does not have to \nask the permission of other nations to defend itself or do anything \nelse for that matter, but when we rely so heavily on other nations to \nhelp pay our way in the world, our haughty claims of independence are \njust so much bluff. Unfortunately, the rest of the world knows what we \nwill not admit; that is, we are beholden to foreigners to pay our way.\n  Make no mistake about it, the threat of budget deficits to our \neconomy is real, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I yield back that time. Perhaps I do not \nhave it to yield back, but I shall not use it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask that all time be yielded back on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the vote and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is on the passage of the bill. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on this vote, I have a live pair with the \nSenator from New York, Mrs. Clinton. If she were present and voting, \nshe would vote ``nay.'' If I were permitted to vote, I would vote \n``yea.'' I, therefore, withhold my vote.\n  Mr. REID.

INCREASE IN PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 3101 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking ``$7,384,000,000,000'' and \n     inserting ``$8,184,000,000,000''.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I was not able to participate in \ntoday's debate and vote on the extension of the national debt limit. I \nwas attending the funeral of a great civil rights leader in Delaware, \nJane E. Mitchell. Had I been here to vote, Mr. President, I would have \ncast a symbolic vote against an extension of the debt limit. Today's \nfiscal mess, the transformation of historic surpluses into record \ndeficits, is not an accident. It is the inevitable outcome of policies \nthat consistently ignored evidence and experience.\n  When we launched out on a course of tax cutting, with expanding \ndomestic and international obligations and responsibilities, many of us \nin Congress argued that we could not afford to do everything, that we \nneeded a fiscal policy that matched our revenues with our expenditures. \nSome tax cuts, especially for the middle class, were needed, tax cuts \nthat could have revived job growth and aided economic recovery. \nInstead, we have a policy that calls for permanent tax cuts that \noverwhelmingly favor those who are already well off. When twice the \nadministration asked us to appropriate funds for our military actions \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, I stood here on the Senate floor and said that \nwe should pay for those obligations with smaller tax cuts for our \nwealthiest taxpayers, and not just pass the bill on to all our \nchildren.\n  We are here today because that advice was ignored, those hard choices \nwere ducked, and the bill for our decisions will be sent to our \nchildren and grandchildren, in the form of the additional debt we will \nauthorize today. It did not have to be this way, Mr. President. In the \nnext Congress, the threat of massive deficits, which have made us \nincreasingly dependent of foreign lenders to stay afloat, will still be \nwith us. My symbolic vote against raising the debt limit would have \nbeen a protest of the policies that have brought us to this point, and \na demand that we change course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of \nimportance not only to South Dakota producers and ranchers, but to \nproducers and ranchers all across America.\n  The issue involves a program that would not only provide positive \nbenefits for our agricultural producers, but ensure consumer choice in \nthe grocery store aisle and on the dinner table.\n  There are efforts underway, unfortunately, to gut the mandatory \ncountry-of-origin labeling law that was incorporated into the 2002 farm \nbill, a farm bill signed into law by this President, and which should \nbe supported by this administration. I rise today to express concern \nthat the fiscal year 2005 omnibus appropriations measure may contain \nprovisions which would weaken or replace mandatory country-of-origin \nlabeling with a voluntary country-of-origin labeling program.\n  As you will recall, last year the Senate overwhelmingly supported a \nresolution that Senator Daschle introduced instructing conferees to \nstrike any language which would delay the implementation of a mandatory \nlabeling program. The omnibus conference recessed hastily, and \nconsequently no opportunity existed to debate and vote on that matter. \nIn any event, the fiscal year 2004 agriculture appropriations bill, the \nvehicle for the fiscal year 2004 omnibus, contained language delaying \ncountry-of-origin labeling by 2 years for all covered commodities with \nthe exception of farm fish and wild fish. This language was adopted by \nonly a small margin in the House. I rise today to urge my colleagues in \nthe Senate to convey their support for this measure and the importance \nof mandatory country-of-origin labeling.\n  It is no secret that this administration has voiced its support for \nresumption of trade of live Canadian cattle, and it is only a matter of \ntime before our producers feel the economic impact of this decision. \nWhen USDA opens the floodgates, and if our mandatory labeling program \nis gutted, consumers will have no way of determining where their meat \ncomes from. And I worry that the Canadian border will reopen before we \nhave resumed trade relations with some of our key export markets. That \npresents a dangerous situation for our producers, and I fail to see why \nthe administration would continue to cheer large agribusiness while the \nburden of our faltering export markets is borne by the individuals \nfeeding this great Nation.\n  Country-of-origin labeling retains support from over 80 percent of \nAmerican consumers, and recently about 95 consumer and producer groups, \nrepresenting over 50 million Americans, wrote Congress to express their \nsupport for a mandatory food labeling program. They also conveyed their \nopposition to any effort to turn this program into a voluntary program \nin the 2005 omnibus appropriations measure. Country-of-origin labeling \nhas overwhelming bipartisan support, and the majority of our trading \npartners have already implemented a country-of-origin system in their \nrespective countries. It is time to\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\nquit dragging America's feet and join the remainder of the \nindustrialized nations throughout the world that afford their consumers \nthe right to know the origin of the food they feed their families.\n  I have worked on mandatory country-of-origin labeling for nearly 12 \nyears. My first labeling bill was introduced in 1992, and as the \nprimary author of the origin labeling language incorporated in our \nexisting farm bill, I join Mr. Burns and other Senate colleagues in \nintroducing a bill on that issue today. I will persist in working to \nspeed up implementation of this program with my colleagues. It is \nimportant that this Senate continue its bipartisan support for \nimplementation of this commonsense law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11419-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RESEARCH REVIEW ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last month we lost a great American, \nChristopher Reeve. Since a riding accident left him paralyzed from the \nneck down, Christopher Reeve has been an inspiration to all Americans, \nparticularly to those living with paralysis as a result of spinal cord \ninjury.\n  In the years following his accident, Christopher Reeve made \ntremendous progress. He regained sensation and movement in some parts \nof his body and was able to breathe for periods of time without a \nventilator. Watching Christopher Reeve achieve these milestones gave \nhope to individuals with spinal cord injuries, their families, \nresearchers and just about everyone.\n  We lost Christopher Reeve, but we cannot lose sight of his dream for \na cure. We must do everything we can to ensure that Federal researchers \nhave the tools they need to further advance paralysis research, and to \nultimately find a cure.\n  I am pleased that today we are honoring the legacy of Christopher \nReeve by passing the Research Review Act. This legislation includes a \nprovision that will advance the goals of the Christopher Reeve \nParalysis Act.\n  There is no stronger voice in the Senate for individuals with \ndisabilities than Senator Tom Harkin. And for the last several years, \nSenator Harkin has worked with the Christopher Reeve Paralysis \nFoundation to pass legislation that would further advance the science \nneeded to promote spinal regeneration and build quality-of-life \nprograms for individuals with paralysis and other mobility impairments.\n  The Research Review Act supports the intent of the Christopher Reeve \nParalysis Act by directing the National Institutes of Health to draft a \nreport on ways they have encouraged the use of multi-disciplinary \nresearch teams to advance treatments, develop new therapies, and \ncollaborate on clinical trials with respect to spinal cord injury and \nparalysis research.\n  The Research Review Act is an important step in the right direction, \nbut we must do everything we can to pass and fund the Christopher Reeve \nParalysis Act during the next session of Congress.\n  The Research Review Act also includes important provisions related to \ninflammatory bowel disease. I am the proud sponsor of legislation in \nthe Senate known as the ``IBD Act'' which is designed to improve the \nquality of life for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. \nI am pleased that 36 Members of the Senate, including Senator Cochran, \nhave cosponsored this bipartisan legislation.\n  Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes both Crohn's disease and \nulcerative colitis, is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract \nwhich afflicts approximately 1 million Americans, 100,000 or 10 percent \nof whom are children under the age of 18. IBD can cause severe \nabdominal pain, fever, and intestinal bleeding. Complications related \nto the disease include: Arthritis, osteoporosis, anemia, liver disease, \nand colon cancer. Inflammatory bowel disease represents a major cause \nof morbidity from digestive illness, and although it is not fatal, IBD \ncan be devastating.\n\n  I am pleased that the Research Review Act contains three important \nprovisions related to inflammatory bowel disease. The first provision \ndirects the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to report to the \nCongress on the status of its inflammatory bowel disease epidemiology \nstudy. This much needed study is being conducted by CDC through \nfinancial support provided by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of \nAmerica (CCFA). Over the past 2 years, CCFA has provided the CDC with \n$750,000 to establish the epidemiology project. I am pleased that the \nSenate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee has provided $800,000 for Fiscal Year 2005 to continue \nthis important study.\n  The second provision of interest to the IBD community directs the \nGovernment Accountability Office to conduct a study on the coverage \nstandards of Medicare/Medicaid for the therapies that IBD patients need \nto manage their disease. If there are gaps in coverage that negatively \nimpact the health and quality of life of IBD patients on Medicare or \nMedicaid, we need to know about them, and take steps to address the \nproblem.\n  The bill provides for a GAO study on the challenges that IBD patients \nencounter when applying for Social Security Disability. This study will \ninclude recommendations for improving the application process for IBD \npatients. This is critical to our effort to ensure that every patient \nwho deserves disability coverage, receives it.\n  I am pleased to inform my colleagues that this is the first piece of \nauthorizing legislation to pass the United States Congress that \naddresses inflammatory bowel disease. I would like to extend my \nappreciation to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America for their \ntremendous advocacy in support of this bill and the ``IBD Act'' in the \n108th Congress. Over the past 2 years, tens of thousands of IBD \npatients have made their voice heard on Capitol Hill. I am pleased that \na disease that for so long has been in the shadows of our society is \nstarting to receive much needed attention and support. We would not be \nhere today if it wasn't for the commitment of these patients and their \nfamily members.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11419-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11419-S11421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    lance corporal shane e. kielion\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Shane Kielion of Omaha, NE, a lance corporal in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. Lance Corporal Kielion was killed while supporting Operation \nIraqi Freedom on November 15, 2004, in Iraq's Al Anbar Province. He was \n23 years old.\n  Lance Corporal Kielion attended Omaha South High School where he was \na leader both on the football field and in the classroom. After \ngraduating in 1999, he briefly attended Peru State College on a \nfootball scholarship before joining the U.S. Marine Corps. He was \nassigned 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I \nMarine Expeditionary Force, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA. Lance \nCorporal Kielion will be remembered as a loyal marine who had a strong \nsense of duty, honor, and love of country. Thousands of brave Americans \nlike Lance Corporal Kielion are currently serving in Iraq.\n  Lance Corporal Kielion is survived by his parents, Patricia and Roger \nKielion; his wife, April, and their newborn son. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with them at this difficult time. The United States of \nAmerica is proud of Shane Kielion's service and mourns his loss.\n  For his service, bravery and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring LCpl Shane Kielion.\n\n\n                         lcpl kyle burns, USMC\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to express our Nation's \ndeepest thanks and gratitude to a special young man and his family. \nDuring this past recess, I received word that on November 11, 2004, \nVeteran's Day, Marine LCpl Kyle Burns of Laramie, WY, died in the line \nof duty while serving his country in the war on terrorism. Lance \nCorporal Burns was killed while fighting insurgents in the battle for \nFallujah, Iraq, west of Baghdad. It was his second tour of duty in \nIraq.\n  Lance Corporal Burns was a member of 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance \nBattalion, 1st Marine Division, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. He \njoined the Marine Corps after graduating from\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nLaramie High School in 2002. He held a profound sense of duty and knew \nhe was doing the right thing. He was very proud of being a Marine. He \nloved the outdoors and enjoyed hiking, hunting, and fishing. He was a \nsports fan, and he played baseball and ran track, but he particularly \nliked hockey--a sport he played for 12 years. Kyle Burns had a love and \nlust for life and made every opportunity to live it to the best of his \nability.\n  It is because of people such as Kyle Burns that we continue to live \nsafe and free. America's men and women who answer the call of service \nand wear our Nation's uniform deserve respect and recognition for the \nenormous burden that they willingly bear. Our people put everything on \nthe line everyday, and because of these folks, our Nation remains free \nand strong in the face of danger.\n  The motto of the Marine Corps is ``Semper Fidelis.'' It means \n``Always Faithful.'' Through his selfless and courageous sacrifice, \nLCpl Kyle Burns lived up to these words with great honor.\n  Lance Corporal Burns is survived by his mother Jo, his father Bob, \nhis brother Kris, and his brothers of the United States Marine Corps. \nWe say goodbye to a son, a brother, a Marine, and an American. Our \nNation pays its deepest respect to LCpl Kyle Burns for his courage, his \nlove of country, and his sacrifice so that we may remain free. He was a \nhero in life, and he remains a hero in death. All of Wyoming and, \nindeed, the entire Nation are proud of him.\n  So, one Marine to another, Lance Corporal Burns, Semper Fi.\n\n\n                       corporal lance m. thompson\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Kokomo, \nIN. Corporal Lance M. Thompson, 21 years old, died on November 15. \nLance was killed by an improvised explosive devise while conducting \ncombat operations in the Al-Anbar Province of Iraq. With his entire \nlife before him, Lance risked everything to fight for the values \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A 2001 graduate of Eastbrook High School, Lance followed in his \nbrother Phillip's footsteps by joining the Marines. His father, \nGregory, told the Kokomo Tribune that his son had been a committed \nmember of the Armed Forces and believed in what the Marines were doing \nin Iraq. Reflecting on Lance's life, his half-brother, Matt, told the \nMarion Chronicle-Tribune that his ``motto'' had been ``gung-ho.'' This \nselfless dedication carried Lance through his first tour of duty in \nIraq and led him back again for a second tour, which began in September \nof this year.\n  Lance was the 38th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the Weapons \nCompany, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine, 2-Battalion Combat Team, 1st Marine \nDivision, Camp Pendleton, CA. This brave young soldier leaves behind \nhis wife, Dawn; his father, Gregory; his mother, Melanie; his brother, \nPhillip; and his half-brother, Matt.\n  Today, I join Lance's family, his friends and the entire Kokomo \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nLance, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  Lance was known for his dedication to family and his love of country. \nAccording to friends and loved ones, he also enjoyed spending time \noutdoors, being with children and animals, and was always making jokes. \nToday and always, Raymond will be remembered by family members, friends \nand fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the sacrifice \nhe made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Lance's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Lance's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Lance M. Thompson in the \nofficial Record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Lance's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Lance.\n\n\n                      sergeant russell l. collier\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate the life of an \nauthentic American hero who fought to defend his Nation. Tragically, \nSgt. Russell L. Collier of Harrison, AR, died October 3, 2004, in Taj, \nIraq, while trying to rescue a fellow soldier also serving in Operation \nIraqi Freedom. He was a member of 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery \nRegiment, Arkansas National Guard, from Russellville, AR.\n  Sgt. Collier exhibited tremendous courage and strength in the face of \ngreat peril. When his unit came under enemy fire while detaining \ninsurgents suspected of building improvised rocket launchers for use \nagainst U.S. forces, his friend and fellow soldier, Sgt. Chris Potts of \nTiverton, RI, was shot. Sgt. Collier, who as the unit medic was known \nas ``Doc,'' gave up his rifle to run to Sgt. Potts' aid. Both men died \ntrying to save their fellow soldiers. Indeed, Sgt. Collier risked his \nlife to save another, and, in the end, lost his own life.\n  The Crossett native was embraced by Sgt. Potts' 103rd Field Artillery \nof the Rhode Island National Guard, which has fought alongside Sgt. \nCollier's own regiment. While speaking about the fallen hero, fellow \nmedic Spc. Tommy Rich said, ``He took care of the Rhodys. He was a \nRhody. They wouldn't give him up, and he wouldn't leave them. They've \nbeen a team from the beginning. He loved his guys.'' Sgt. Collier's \nattempt to rescue a fellow soldier illustrates his strong commitment to \nhis unit and his truly selfless nature.\n  Sgt. Collier loved the military, said his sister, Carolyn Pfaus. His \nlong military career began in 1975 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army \nafter graduating from Wuerzburg High School in Germany. In 1978, he \njoined the U.S. Navy and then the Arkansas Army National Guard in 1999. \nHis wife, Rocky, said, ``The military was his whole life.''\n  Yet to Sgt. Collier, who also worked full-time at night at Tyson \nFoods in Green Forest, the most important aspect of his life was his \nfamily. He had sent his 9-year-old son, Hunter, an Army action figure \nfor his birthday last July from Iraq.\n  Sgt. Collier is survived by his wife, Rocky, and their son, Hunter, \nboth of Harrison; two adult children, Mary Virginia and Wayne, who both \nlive in North Carolina; and sister, Carolyn Pfaus, of Conway. His \nfamily and friends will remember a man dedicated to his family and the \nmilitary, and we will remember a man who died a hero. Our prayers and \ngratitude go out to his family for the great service that Sgt. Collier \nrendered to our Nation.\n\n\n                      sergeant thomas c. rosenbaum\n\n  Mr. President. I am honored to rise today in tribute to the life of \nSergeant Thomas Chad Rosenbaum. Above all, Sgt. Rosenbaum was a beloved \nson, brother, friend and father. He was also one of the brave souls \nvaliantly serving our Nation in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tragically, he \nwas killed on September 18, 2004, when his convoy came under attack \nwhile moving through Baghdad.\n  Sgt. Rosenbaum was born in the small town of Prescott, AR, and grew \nup in nearby Hope. He spent his youth, as many children do, \nparticipating in athletics and various extracurricular activities, \nplaying pranks with his friends and collecting small turtles from the \nbanks of nearby rivers with his parents and his brother. Today, he is \nremembered by his family and loved\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\nones as an outgoing, fun-loving, and fearless young man who loved God, \nhis family and his country. This love of country motivated him to \nenlist in the U.S. Army during his senior year of high school. He was \nassigned to the 1st Cavalry Division out of Fort Hood, Texas, and was \ndeployed to Iraq in March.\n  In Iraq, Sgt. Rosenbaum served as a chemical specialist who also \nhelped train Iraqi security forces in the use of firearms. Although he \nwas originally scheduled to depart Iraq in May, his duty was extended \nuntil December. Weeks before his death, Sgt. Rosenbaum had the \nopportunity to return home on leave for 15 days to spend with his \nfriends and family. Most of this time was spent with the person he \ncalled ``the love of his life,'' his 4 year-old son, Ty. Father and son \nwould return to those same Caddo River banks he had known as a child \nand together they searched for small turtles. Today, Ty still has one \nof those turtles, whom he has named ``Milkshake,'' and whom he has kept \nas a reminder of the time spent with his father.\n  The loss of Thomas Rosenbaum is a tragic and sobering reminder of the \nterrible human sacrifice that war brings, and I am eternally grateful \nfor his service to our Nation. Although he may no longer be with us, \nhis spirit and his legacy lives on in each of us through the examples \nhe set and the many lives he touched. My thoughts and prayers are with \nhis son, Ty, his parents, Jackie and Donna, and the rest of his family, \nfriends, and loved ones.\n\n\n                        sergeant ronald w. baker\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay tribute to the \nlife of Sergeant Ronald W. Baker and to honor his sacrifice on behalf \nof a grateful Nation. Sgt. Baker was a loving man who cared deeply for \nhis family and his friends. He was also a native Arkansan who cared \ndeeply for his state and his country. Today, he is remembered as a \ndevoted husband, father, brother, son, and friend. He is also \nremembered as a brave soldier who died a hero.\n  Sgt. Baker was born in the small Arkansas town of Searcy and later \nmoved with his family to nearby Cabot. Wherever he went, Sgt. Baker \nquickly made friends and those who knew him best often talked of how \nhis personality always seemed to draw others to him. His strong sense \nof family and community is what contributed to his decision to enlist \nin the Arkansas Army National Guard a month after the tragic events of \nSeptember 11, 2001. He served as a member of the Guard's 39th Support \nBattalion based out of Lonoke and was later called up to serve as a \nspecialist in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Along with many of his comrades \nin the 39th, he was stationed at Camp Taji, about 16 miles northwest of \ndowntown Baghdad.\n  On October 7, Sgt. Baker volunteered for a supply mission that would \nconvoy from Camp Taji to another camp nearby. While en route, a \nroadside bomb concealed in a parked car exploded as the convoy rode by \nwith Sgt. Baker in the gunner's turret of a humvee. As a result of the \nblast, he sustained serious injuries and was immediately flown to \nLandstuhl Army Medical Center in Germany. Sgt. Baker's wife, Joanne, \nand his father, Wayne, were quickly flown in from Arkansas so they \ncould be there to share in his last few moments. Although Sgt. Baker \nwas never baptized, he had previously told his wife that he wanted to \nleave the world as a Christian. Before he passed away on October 13, \nJoanne would watch as an Air National Guard Chaplain baptized her \nhusband and, in her words, permitted him to pass into a better place.\n  The day of his funeral was proclaimed as ``Sergeant Ronald Baker \nDay'' in his hometown. Those en route to his memorial ceremony at the \nArkansas Veterans' Cemetery in North Little Rock drove under an arch \nmade of ladders over the highway that hung a large American flag. It \nwas a touching and fitting tribute, created by the Sherwood Fire \nDepartment, to honor one of Arkansas' fallen who paid the ultimate \nsacrifice in order to make those around him safer.\n  Along with a grateful Nation, my thoughts and prayers go out to \nJoanne; their 7-year-old daughter, Alexis; Harold and his mother \nCarolyn; his brother and sister; and to the rest of his family, friends \nand loved ones. Although Ronald Baker may no longer be with us, the \nlasting relationships he formed and the principles he fought for live \non in all of us.\n\n\n                         airman jesse m. samek\n\n  Mr. President, today, I am honored to rise in tribute to the life of \nJesse M. Samek and am humbled to pay tribute to his service to our \nNation.\n  Friends and family would remember Airman Samek for living a life of \nfun and happiness. While growing up in Missouri and Arkansas, he spent \nmuch of his time, as most children do, hanging out with his friends and \nplaying sports. He also had a great love of the outdoors and enjoyed \ncamping, hiking, hunting, fishing and snow- and waterskiing with \nfriends and family. He would go on to graduate from Rogers High School \nin 2001 and attended the University of Arkansas.\n  It was clear to those who knew Airman Samek that he would succeed \nregardless of whatever path in life he chose to follow. He decided that \npath would ultimately be service to his country and he joined the \nUnited States Air Force in February of 2003. He was assigned to the \n66th Rescue Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, just outside of Las \nVegas, and was deployed to Afghanistan in September.\n  While serving in Operation Enduring Freedom, Airman Samek never lost \nhis perspective on life and was proud to do his part to bring security \nand freedom to a Nation that had seen nothing but war and instability. \nHis family later said that he worked for months to become a member of \nan elite group that qualified him for rescue duty as a flight engineer \non an HH-60 Para Rescue helicopter. Tragically, he died on October 21 \nfrom injuries he received when his helicopter crashed during a medical \nevacuation mission in northwestern Afghanistan. The aircraft was \ncarrying a wounded Afghan election worker who was being transported for \nmedical treatment and Airman Samek was treating him when the aircraft \nwent down.\n  David Dezarov would make the final trip home with his friend's body. \n``The hardest thing I've ever had to do was spend the last four days \nwith him and not saying a word.'' On that flight from Atlanta to Tulsa, \nthe pilot of the plane circled above Rogers for 10 minutes in tribute \nto that community's fallen hero. During the burial ceremony at Bella \nVista Memorial Cemetery, Airman Samek's fellow Airmen would pay their \nlast respects by flying over his casket in the same type of helicopter \nhe once flew so proudly.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his parents, Gavin and Julie; his \nbrother, Benjamin; his grandparents, David and Jenny Burkemper; and the \nrest of his family and friends. Although he is no longer with us, may \nwe find solace in the many lives he touched and the sacrifice he made \non behalf of a grateful Nation. In the words of his mother, Jesse Samek \nwas a hero; not for what he did, but for who he was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11421-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11421-S11422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE SOLDIERS OF THE 66TH INFANTRY DIVISION\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I join with my constituents in \nrecognizing the brave men of the 66th Infantry Division.\n  Sixty years ago on November 15, 1944, the soldiers left from New York \nHarbor on the USAT George Washington without knowledge of their \ndestination. It turned out the USAT George Washington brought the \nsoldiers to England, where they were stationed at Southampton Harbor \nuntil Christmas Eve 1944.\n  On Dec. 16, 1944, the Nazis launched a desperate offensive in Belgium \nintended to split the Allied Forces. The fierce struggle became known \nas ``The Battle of the Bulge.'' As part of the allied response to this \nthreat, on Christmas Eve 1944 over 2,000 American soldiers of the 66th \nInfantry Division stationed in England were rushed to Southampton, \nwhere they boarded the troopship SS Leopoldville. The troops were then \ntransported across the English Channel, but just 5\\1/2\\ miles from \ntheir destination, Cherbourg, France, the vessel was torpedoed by the \nGerman submarine U-486.\n  Some of the soldiers were killed instantly, some went down with the \nship, some safely jumped from the ship's rail to the rescue craft that \npulled alongside, while others missed the jump,\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\nplunged into the waves and were crushed as the two vessels came \ntogether. Some drowned, some froze to death in the frigid 48-degree \nwaters of the English Channel. In all, there were 763 American soldiers \nconfirmed dead, representing sons, husbands, and fathers from 47 of \nthen 48 States. There were three sets of brothers killed, including two \nsets of twins. The bodies of both sets of twins were among the 493 \nnever found. Although over 1,400 soldiers survived, more than 500 were \nhospitalized with injuries or pneumonia. Missouri had 31 brave men who \nlost their lives that night. The Leopoldville disaster was the worst \ntragedy to eve befall an American Infantry Division as a result of an \nenemy submarine attack.\n  It is my ultimate honor to recognize the heroism of the survivors and \nthe sacrifice of the dead. In the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, ``They \nare not dead who live in lives they leave behind. In those whom they \nhave blessed they have life again.'' It is my hope that future \ngenerations of Americans remember the sacrifices and costs in human \nlife made to preserve our liberties, and to instill in them an \nunderstanding of what it means to be an American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11422-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL JAMES L. MURRAY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Major General \nJames L. Murray, U.S. Air Force (Ret.), and Aerospace Executive. Major \nGeneral Murray was recently interred at Arlington National Cemetery. He \nserved his country with honor and integrity, and should also be \nrecognized for the numerous accomplishments of his half century career.\n  Although I was saddened to learn of Major General Murray's death, I \nam proud to have personally known him. This man was a great American, a \nman who loved his country, and a man who always put his country first. \nDuring his USAF career he logged over 5,500 hours as a pilot in over 60 \ndifferent types of aircraft. He then went on to participate in the \ndevelopment of the thermal de-icing system, led the design and \ndevelopment of the ejection seat escape system, and managed the \ndevelopment of the B-52. Major General Murray was very dedicated to \nserving his country, and he clearly demonstrated this dedication while \nin the Air Force. Upon retirement he was awarded the Distinguished \nService Medal, the highest honor the military conveys in peacetime.\n  Major General Murray continued to work toward strengthening our \nNation after he retired. He led the way at Douglas Aircraft to develop \nthe C-5 aircraft, which was a huge triumph of the time and it remains \ntoday a key part of our military's airlift capability. Major General \nMurray also demonstrated his extraordinary abilities while he was \nPresident and Chairman of Teledyne CAE, formerly Continental Aviation \nand Engineering. It was here that he led the work to produce the cruise \nmissile engines for the U.S. military. The value of these incredibly \ncapable precision weapons has been witnessed several times over the \nyears, specifically in the first Gulf War.\n  Major General Murray and his wife, Phyllis Jennings Murray, made \nbeautiful Point Clear, AL, on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay, their \nhome in 1985. She survives him together with their seven children, nine \ngrandchildren, and one great-grandchild. His family can know that they \nhave been beneficiaries of a remarkable legacy.\n  Major General Murray led an extraordinarily productive life. All his \npowers and gifts, in the Air Force and in business, were given to \nstrengthening the country he loved. There can be no doubt his life's \nwork has made a tremendous contribution to a stronger America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11422-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On September 2, 1998, in New York City, three men assaulted two men \nthey believed to be gay.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11422-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COPYRIGHT ROYALTY AND DISTRIBUTION REFORM ACT, H.R. 1417\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased that in the waning days of the 108th Congress \nwe can send H.R. 1417, the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform \nAct of 2004, to the White House for the President's signature. I wish \nto thank Senator Hatch, as his chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee \ncomes to a close, for the important work we have done over the years to \nstrengthen our Nation's intellectual property laws. When two Senators \nfrom different parties can collaborate as productively as we have on \nthese issues, the legislative process is working the way it should.\n  This bill has been a massive, bicameral undertaking. Many of the \nprovisions were technically complex, and extensive negotiations were \nnecessary in order to iron out some of the more difficult provisions. \nIn all of these details, recognition is owed to our colleagues in the \nHouse for ensuring that obstacles to this bill's passage did not become \nroadblocks. Chairman Sensenbrenner, in particular, played a crucial \nrole in the development of this bill and in helping to pilot it through \nthe other Chamber. Likewise, I wish to express my gratitude for the \ntime, energy, and thoughtful contributions of Congressman Conyers, \nCongressman Smith, and Congressman Berman, without whom the result we \nhave achieved today would simply not have been possible.\n  The Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act will modernize and \nimprove the process by which certain royalty rates, such as those for \nsmall webcasters, are determined.\n  As early as 2002, I noted in a Judiciary Committee hearing that there \nwas widespread dissatisfaction with the current CARP procedures. Among \nsome of the complaints, the Committee heard that many small webcasters \ncould not afford to take part in CARP proceedings, despite their \nlivelihoods hinging on the outcome. We also heard of many of the \nstructural problems that plagued the process. In addition, I have been \nconcerned that the current procedures are often hindered by \nunreasonable delays, and the outcomes subject to manipulation.\n  The Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act responds to these \nconcerns. It replaces arbitrators with full-time administrative judges, \nalleviating the massive financial burden of taking part in a CARP \nproceeding, and providing the process with continuity and stability. \nThis bill also resolves long-standing disputes over the availability of \ndiscovery. Because discovery is available where it is needed, the \nCopyright Royalty Judges will have the information necessary to render \na correct determination, but the costs of discovery will be kept to a \nminimum. Finally, this bill preserves the traditional role of the \nRegister of Copyrights.\n  Again, I wish to thank my colleagues in the Senate and in the House \nfor their hard work in guiding into law this important, complex piece \nof legislation. We work best when we work together, and I hope that in \nthe final product of the CARP bill we will see reason to develop \nlegislation across party lines, and between chambers, in the next \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11422-4", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11422-S11423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE CAREER OF JERRY KLECZKA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I would like to honor and thank \nU.S. Representative Jerry Kleczka for his outstanding service to the \npeople of Milwaukee as he retires from Congress.\n  For nearly 20 years, Jerry has served tirelessly representing \nWisconsin's 4th district. The native of Milwaukee's south side got an \nearly start in Wisconsin politics. He was elected to the State \nlegislature in 1969 when he was just 24 years old. He served in the \nState assembly for 5 years before moving to the State senate in 1975. \nDuring his\n\n[[Page S11423]]\n\ntime there, Jerry served with distinction as chairman of the powerful \nJoint Finance Committee and as assistant majority leader.\n  In 1984, Jerry was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives where \nhe would go on to serve 10 terms. During his tenure, Jerry successfully \npassed legislation banning ``drive-thru'' baby deliveries and worked \nhard to protect seniors living in public housing from physical harm. \nThanks to his hard work, Milwaukee became the first city in the Nation \nto provide elderly-only public housing. Jerry leaves the House as a \nmember of the influential Committee on Ways and Means, where he fought \nfor Social Security and affordable health care.\n  Jerry has embodied Wisconsin's progressive tradition during his 35 \nyears of public service. The son of a factory worker, Jerry always \nstayed true to the hardworking Wisconsin families who counted on him to \nfight for them in Congress. He developed a trusting and open \nrelationship with his Milwaukee constituency and is widely known for \nhis superior constituent services. Jerry's unquestionable dedication \nand hard work will be truly missed. Not only am I thankful for the time \nwe have served together in the U.S. Congress, but I am grateful for our \nfriendship that goes back to our days spent together in the Wisconsin \nLegislature. Wisconsin will forever appreciate Jerry's 35 years of \npublic service. I wish him the best of luck in all of his future \npursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11423-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           OCEAN AND COASTAL MAPPING INTEGRATION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of my bill, S. 2489, the \nOcean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act of 2004, which is being \nconsidered by the Senate. This bill which was reported unanimously from \nthe Commerce Committee, addresses the nearly 90 percent of the U.S. \nTerritorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone that remain unmapped by \nmodern technologies. I am pleased to be joined by my friends and \ncolleagues, Senators Ted Stevens, Fritz Hollings, Judd Gregg, Olympia \nSnowe, Trent Lott, John Breaux, Frank Lautenberg, and Dan Akaka, who \nare cosponsors of the bill.\n  There was a time in the history of our Nation when our best efforts \nto map the seas meant lowering weights tied to piano wire over the side \nof a vessel, and measuring how deep they went. These efforts led to the \ndevelopment of rudimentary nautical charts designed to help mariners \nnavigate safely. The rapidly increasing uses of our coastal and ocean \nwaters, however, call for development of a new generation of ecosystem-\noriented mapping and assessment products and services.\n  The technologies of today create richly layered mapping products that \nexpand far beyond just charting for safe navigation. Now, by combining \nsuch information as mineral surveys of the U.S. Geological Service, \nhabitat characterizations of the National Oceanic Atmospheric \nAdministration, and watershed assessments of the Environmental \nProtection Agency into a single product, map users are able to consider \nthe impacts of their actions on multiple facets of the marine \nenvironment.\n  The recent draft report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy has \nhighlighted the urgent need to modernize, improve, expand, and \nintegrate federal mapping efforts to improve navigation, safety and \nresource management decision making. By employing integrated mapping \napproaches, urban and residential growth can be directed away from \nareas of high risk from ocean-based threats such as tsunami and tidal \nsurge. The risks of maritime activities can be minimized by identifying \nhazards that could impact sensitive ecosystems, and devising \nappropriate mitigation plans. Managers of living marine resource can \nalso gauge where and how best to focus their efforts to restore \nessential marine habitats.\n  My bill will lay the foundation for producing the ocean maps of the \n21st century. It mandates coordination among the many federal agencies \nwith mapping missions with NOAA as the lead in developing national \nmapping priorities and strategies. The bill will also establish \nnational ocean and coastal mapping centers to manage comprehensively \nthe mapping data produced by the Federal Government, encourage \ninnovation in technologies, and authorize the funding necessary to \nimplement this comprehensive effort.\n  Perhaps the most important lesson that comprehensive, integrated \nmapping can afford is an awareness of a web of human marine communities \nas rich and varied as the ocean itself. From awareness grows \nunderstanding, respect, and cooperation.\n  I am extremely proud to be the author of this legislation, and hope \nyou will join me in supporting enactment of the Ocean and Coastal \nMapping Integration Act of 2004. This bill will provide the United \nStates with the programs and resources necessary to improve maritime \ncommerce and national security, and develop healthy coastal communities \nacross the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11423-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11423-S11424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERANS DAY 2004\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week, on November 11, the Nation \npaused to honor those brave Americans who have so selflessly served our \ncountry in the Armed forces. For more than 200 years, men and women \nhave proudly worn the uniform of the United States. In peacetime and in \nwartime, these men and women have served and sacrificed on our behalf, \noften far away from their homes and from their families. Too many of \nthem have made the ultimate sacrifice. We owe them--and their \nfamilies--our deepest, heartfelt gratitude.\n  As we marked Veterans Day here in the United States with appropriate \nceremonies and recognitions, men and women from Wisconsin and across \nour country were serving on our behalf in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere. Their dedication to this great country--like that of those \nwho served before them--should inspire us all.\n  We owe these brave men and women our gratitude, and we also owe them \nour best efforts to ensure that they know about and receive the Federal \nbenefits and services that they have earned through their service to \nour country. I have long been concerned that to many veterans and \nmilitary personnel are unaware of benefits and programs that are \navailable to them through the Departments of Veterans Affairs and \nDefense and a number of other Federal agencies. I will continue my work \nto ensure that all veterans know about the benefits for which they may \nbe eligible. I will also continue to support efforts to fully fund VA \nhealth care programs so that all veterans who wish to take advantage of \ntheir health care benefits are able to do so. No veterans should have \nto wait months to see a doctor or should be told that he or she is \nbarred from enrolling in the VA health care system because of a lack of \nfunding.\n  In addition, I am committed to ensuring that our current military \npersonnel receive adequate health care and transition services, \nincluding mental health services, as they return from deployments and \nwhen they return to civilian life. I am pleased that the recently \nenacted defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2005 includes a \nprovision that I authored which represents a first step toward \nenhancing and strengthening transition services that are provided to \nour military personnel. My provision requires the Government \nAccountability Office to undertake a comprehensive analysis of existing \ntransition services for our military personnel that are administered by \nthe Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor and to make \nrecommendations to Congress on how these programs can be improved. This \nstudy will focus on two issues: how to achieve the uniform provision of \nappropriate transition services to all military personnel, and the role \nof post-deployment and pre-discharge health assessments as part of the \nlarger transition program.\n  I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites and members of military \nand veterans service organizations that our men and women in uniform do \nnot all have access to the same transition counseling and medical \nservices as they are demobilizing from service in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand elsewhere. I have long been concerned about reports of uneven \nprovision of services from base to base and from service to service. \nAll of our men and women in uniform have pledged to serve our country, \nand all of them, at the very least, deserve to have access to the same\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nservices in return. This GAO study will help us to have a better \npicture of the services that are being provided and what needs to be \ndone to improve these important programs, and I look forward to \nreviewing it.\n  We should honor America's brave veterans and their families not only \non Veterans Day, but throughout the year. As we reflect upon the \nmeaning of this day, let us keep all of our veterans and their families \nin our thoughts. These men and women are examples of the best that our \ncountry has to offer, and they deserve our support both during times of \nconflict and after the battles have ended and our troops have come \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11424-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               JIM MARKS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto Jim Marks for his many years of dedicated public service at the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention as he prepares to take up an \neminent new position as senior vice president and director of the \nPublic Health Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n  Dr. Marks is a pediatrician and former Assistant Surgeon General who \nbegan his career more than 20 years ago at the CDC. He has worked \neffectively in the areas of birth defects prevention, reproductive \nhealth, nutrition, and health promotion and education, and rose through \nthe ranks at CDC to a position of renown as one of America's leading \nexperts on disease prevention. He was named director of the National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in 1995, and \nthis year he became the acting director of the CDC's Coordinating \nCenter for Health Information and Service.\n  Dr. Marks has significantly improved public health through his \nleadership on critical health issues facing the Nation. He was \ninstrumental in achieving the most impressive recent accomplishment in \ntobacco control and prevention: The decline in adolescent smoking after \nnearly a decade of rising rates of smoking in the 1990s. Under Dr. \nMarks' direction, CDC increased its commitment to reduce and prevent \nsmoking, and transformed a piecemeal State-by-State approach into a \ntrue national effort. CDC developed standards for best practices and \ncreated the National Tobacco Control Program, which provides funds and \ntechnical support to State health departments. Under his leadership, 4 \nSurgeon General reports were released that highlight the full scope of \ntobacco-related deaths and disease. As a result of these efforts, \ncigarette sales dropped and States achieved a reduction in tobacco-\nrelated deaths from both lung cancer and heart disease. The CDC also \nnow works closely with the World Health Organization to conduct the \nGlobal Youth Tobacco Survey, which is active in more than 160 countries \nand will be invaluable in developing the first international public \nhealth treaty.\n  On cancer, Dr. Marks has helped spearhead efforts to prevent cancer \nand promote early detection. Under his direction and with the support \nof Congress, the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control has grown \nfrom approximately $123 million to over $313 million.\n  Several specific accomplishments under Dr. Marks' leadership are \nworth mentioning. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \nDetection Program has helped uninsured and underinsured women obtain \nlifesaving screening and diagnostic testing for early detection. The \nprogram has achieved nearly 5 million screenings, and diagnosed 17,000 \nbreast cancers, 61,000 precancerous cervical lesions, and 1,100 \ncervical cancers.\n  The National Program of Cancer Registries has been expanded to cover \n96 percent of the Nation's population. The information gathered by the \nprogram is important for tracing cancer patterns and monitoring cancer \ntrends. It guided State planning and State evaluation of cancer control \nprograms and helps States to set priorities. It is also useful in \nplanning clinical research and research on health and on epidemics. The \ndata contributed as well to producing the official Federal report, \n``U.S. Cancer Statistics: 2000 Incidence.''\n\n  The National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program was developed and \nhas been expanded to 61 programs in States, territories and tribes, \nenabling local health agencies to establish broad-based cancer control \ncoalitions.\n  Last year, under Dr. Marks, the plan called ``A National Action Plan \nfor Cancer Survivorship: Advancing Public Health Strategies'' was \ndeveloped in collaboration with the Lance Armstrong Foundation and \nnational experts in cancer survivorship and public health. The Action \nPlan charts a course to enable the public health community to focus \nmore effectively on cancer survivorship and on improving the quality of \nlife for survivors.\n  In addition, Dr. Marks has emphasized science-based nutrition and \nphysical activity as part of a greater effort to deal with the current \nepidemic of obesity in our Nation. He enthusiastically embraced the \nidea of a unique CDC partnership with the world of commercial youth \nmarketing, which led to the so-called VERB Campaign, to move American \nyouth off the couch and into healthy activities. The VERB campaign is a \n``for kids/by kids'' voice to reach youth between the ages of 9 and 13 \nwith ``cool'' messages to discover the fun of being physically active--\nand do it ``anywhere, anytime, and any way.'' As a result, after 1 \nyear, 74 percent of this youth now recognize and like the VERB brand.\n  Dr. Marks has been an outstanding leader on the major public health \nissues of our time. His pioneering work has improved the health of \ncommunities across the Nation and improved the quality of life for \ncountless families and children. His strong commitment and wise counsel \nhave educated all of us in Congress. I wish him well, and I look \nforward to his continuing leadership with the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11424-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE DEATH OF JANE E. MITCHELL\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of a truly \ngreat woman, Jane E. Mitchell. She passed away on Saturday, November \n13, after 83 years of standing up for the rights of others. Her impact \non the State of Delaware is profound, and her spirit everlasting.\n  Many in Delaware know Jane Mitchell as the wife of Littleton ``Lit'' \nMitchell, Delaware's first African-American lawyer and a remarkable \nforce in the civil rights movement. With all of his astounding \naccomplishments, though, Lit never made a decision without talking it \nover with Jane. She may not have had his public profile, but she \ncertainly knew the intricacies of the issues and just how much was at \nstake.\n  Far beyond her role as the wife of an influential man, Jane Mitchell \nwas an extraordinary person in her own right. Her life is a story of \nachievement--each one greater than the last. In her nursing career, \nJane began making history by being the first African-American at \nDelaware State Hospital to treat both black and white patients. Her \ncareer led her to become the first African-American nursing director in \nthe State, and she was eventually the president of the State Board of \nNursing and vice-president of the Delaware Nurses Association before \nher retirement.\n  After retiring, Jane Mitchell devoted her life to volunteering. Her \ncauses were numerous, and she was passionately committed to each. She \ncontinued her work in medicine and civil rights, and became a powerful \nvoice in the fight to improve the treatment of the mentally ill. In \n1998, a building was erected in her name at the Delaware Psychiatric \nCenter.\n  Jane E. Mitchell has been described as a pioneer, a trailblazer and a \nheroine. She devoted her life to promoting the welfare of others. \nWhether it was in her role as nurse, advocate, volunteer or wife and \nmother, Jane never wavered in her enthusiasm for doing good and making \na difference. I am saddened by her passing, yet she continues to \ninspire me. Jane Mitchell's legacy is great, and I am honored to \nrecognize her today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11424-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11424-S11425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      JENNIFER STEENSEN FIELD OF DREAMS THERAPEUTIC RIDING PROGRAM\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in \nsaluting\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\nthe Jennifer Steensen Field of Dreams Therapeutic Riding Program of \nGranger, IO. This outstanding program provides therapeutic riding and \ndriving programs for individuals with physical and mental disabilities \nand children in at-risk situations.\n  The program has provided over 2000 hours of horseback riding lessons \nto clients aged two to 80 with disabilities that include cerebral \npalsy, intellectual disabilities, spinal bifida, blindness, ADHD, \nlearning disabilities and brain injury. On average, 80 individuals \nparticipate in this program every year.\n  I would like to pay tribute to the dedicated volunteers who make this \nprogram successful. One such individual is Lisa Quam, who volunteers \nonce a week at the stables to share her laughter and love of horses \nwith the riders. Matthew Vujnovich of Des Moines is one of the many \nclients who have benefited from the time and talents of the program's \nvolunteers. Matthew has autism and Lisa's friendship and guidance with \nthe horses has helped develop his fine motor skills, muscles and \nindependence.\n  I am dedicated to the principles of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct: equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, \nand economic self-sufficiency for millions of Americans with physical \nand mental disabilities. The Jennifer Steensen Field of Dreams \nTherapeutic Riding Program advances these principles and helps clients \ndevelop critical life-skills. I applaud their efforts and thank them \nfor all that they have accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11425-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ZACH HEBL'S ACHIEVEMENT ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as we all know, this is an election \nyear. Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, both parties \nrecognize the importance of civic engagement this year. That is why I \nwant to recognize the efforts of Zach Hebl, an Eagle Scout from Cedar \nTownship, IA. When 15-year-old Zach learned that his parents' polling \nlocation was not accessible to people with disabilities, he coordinated \nan effort to construct a sidewalk, parking lot, and wooden access ramp \nat Cedar Township Hall, a Johnson county polling location, so that \neveryone in his precinct had an equal opportunity to cast their ballot.\n  Zach's achievement is particularly important because as of September \nof 2003, there were approximately 300 precincts in Iowa that did not \nmeet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Without \nrenovation, these locations will shut down in 2006 and close their \ndoors to voters. Thanks to Zach, Cedar Township Hall was the first site \nto be removed from this list. I would like to print in the Record this \narticle from the Cedar Rapids Gazette which describes Zach's project in \ngreater detail.\n  The article follows:\n\n       Cedar Rapids Gazette, August 26, 2003:\n       Fifteen-year-old Zach Hebl didn't want to see the one-room \n     schoolhouse become just a symbol of the past.\n       The old schoolhouse, which closed in the 1950s, has served \n     as the township's polling place for at least 60 years but was \n     in danger of no longer being an allowable voting site because \n     it failed to meet Americans With Disabilities Act, or ADA, \n     requirements.\n       That's when Hebl got the idea to bring the old building up \n     to current standards by building a ramp and deck onto the \n     building.\n       ``I've always figured I could be voting here one day and \n     wanted to do something so that I could do that,'' said Hebl, \n     who lives on a farm in Cedar Township about two miles south \n     of the schoolhouse.\n       Hebl began working on the project, which he will use as an \n     Eagle Scout project, in mid-April. He developed plans for \n     multiple ramps and made a presentation to the Cedar Township \n     Board of Trustees. He researched the ADA requirements and \n     prepared cost estimates. By mid-July, both the Scouts and \n     trustees approved the project.\n       ``We were glad somebody came along to take this project \n     over,'' said Don Brannaman, a trustee who has lived in Cedar \n     Township for 55 years. ``We were going to have to find a way \n     to do this.''\n       Hebl worked with his Eagle Scout adviser, Jim Jacob, 51, a \n     structural engineer with Van Winkle-Jacob Engineering in \n     Coralville, to conduct site elevations and choose the best \n     design.\n       ``This building has got a lot of significance,'' said \n     Jacob, who lives in Cedar Township and has voted at the \n     building since 1983. ``If people couldn't vote here, nobody \n     would take care of the building, and it would fall into \n     disrepair.''\n       On Saturday, it was evident many residents didn't want that \n     to happen. A group of 25 kids, mostly fellow members of Troop \n     120, and 19 adults arrived at the job site to help build the \n     24-foot-long ramp and deck. Installation of the posts began \n     Friday, and the final touch on the project, a large concrete \n     parking slab and sidewalk to the ramp, will be installed in \n     September.\n       ``We wouldn't want to vote anyplace else,'' said Loretta \n     Basten, 58, who attended the one-room schoolhouse until third \n     grade when it closed in the 1950s. She was bringing snacks to \n     the site.\n       ``There are students who go to college and come back just \n     so they can cast a ballot here,'' Basten said.\n\n  In August, Chet Culver, Secretary of the State of Iowa, and I had the \nprivilege of attending a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new polling \nplace. There to support Zach were his parents, Boy Scout Troop 120, and \nmany members of the community. It was a proud moment for Cedar Township \nas Zach cut that ribbon. He is a wonderful example of how one person \ncan truly impact a community simply by acting upon an idea.\n  As the author of the ADA, I am always glad to see progress toward its \nfour great goals--equality of opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with \ndisabilities. Zach's work is critical to ensuring equality in voting \nand full participation in our democratic system, which formerly was not \navailable to the people in his County and still is not available for \nmany Iowans. Even though Zach is too young to vote, he serves as a role \nmodel to Eagle Scouts and young people across the country. He proves \nthat one person can make a tremendous difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11425-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING LT.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lt. \nColonel John McCance, who will complete his 3-year tour of duty with \nthe United States Air Force's Office of Legislative Affairs at the end \nof this year.\n  Most people don't know that our services have liaison offices within \nCongress. Even many servicemembers don't know these offices exist. And, \nyet, they are a vital link between the United States Senate and the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Liaison officers are chosen because of their wealth of knowledge, \nability to handle a pressure-packed environment with high-maintenance \nstaffers, and their discernment in making tough decisions. They \ngenerally have significant experience and a long track record of \noutstanding performance. Simply put, Service liaisons are the best of \nthe best.\n  The Air Force has been fortunate to have Lt. Colonel John McCance as \na vital member of its liaison team here in the Senate. He has \ndemonstrated the superior caliber and quality of Air Force officers \nwith which we are all familiar. I know I speak for many of my fellow \nMembers in expressing our profound regret at his departure. Yet I know \nthat the Air Force Reserve has many good things planned for John and \nthat our country will surely benefit from his experience in his future \nassignments.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I thank John McCance for his service to the \nNation and to the United States Air Force Reserve, and I thank his \nwife, Wendy, and his daughters, Lauren and Katie, for their steadfast \nsupport while he fulfilled this essential duty. We in the U.S Senate, \nand I personally, wish them all the best as Lt. Colonel McCance returns \nto his civilian career and tackles new challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11425-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11425-S11426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO WAYNE BERRY\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the recent \ndeath of one of Alabama's most remarkable men, Charles Woods of Dothan, \nAL. Mr. Woods, who was 83 years old, died October 17 in Dothan after an \nextended illness. Mr. Woods lived an extraordinary life. Orphaned until \nage 6, he worked hard and became a decorated World War II pilot who was \nseverely burned in a plane crash in India as he and his crew were on \ntheir way to China over the Himalayan Mountains. Mr. Woods was riding \nas check pilot in a C-109 supply aircraft when the accident occurred. \nThe plane crashed off the end of the runway, and Captain Woods was able \nto open the window on his side of the cockpit and stumble away from the \nflaming aircraft. The training pilot and two other crew members \nperished. That crash left Mr. Woods scarred but not beaten. His \npowerful drive to survive his burns was the same drive that made him a \nhighly successful businessman.\n  After the war, Mr. Woods established successful real estate and media \nbusinesses that included the launching of Dothan's first television \nstation, WTVY-TV. Still, he had a deep interest in politics and ran a \nnumber of high profile races that did not lead to victory but captured \nthe attention of the people of Alabama and certainly his opponents. I \nwell remember as a teenager watching his dramatic story produced as \npart of his first campaign for Governor. It was a powerful piece. I \nbelieve this early ``infomercial'' was a breakthrough in political \ncampaigning and now, with the advent of cable television, has become \nmore common.\n  He ran a strong race for the U.S. Senate in 1996 and his surge in the \npolls got the attention of all of us in that Republican primary. After \nI got in the runoff, I was very pleased that he chose to immediately \nendorse my candidacy. He was gracious and affirming. I valued that \nhighly because everyone knew that Charles Woods was a courageous and \nindependent minded person whose goal was to improve the lives of all \nAlabamians. His endorsement gave my campaign a real boost. Since that \ntime, I had the opportunity to talk with him on a number of occasions, \nto appreciate his insight and decisiveness, and to become friends. He \nspoke to me of his faith on more than one occasion.\n  Mr. Woods' 10 children, 17 grandchildren and one great grandchild \nhave received a tremendous legacy. Charles Woods was truly a giant of a \nman who overcame tremendous adversity to achieve extraordinary things. \nHis was an American story of almost unbelievable achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11426-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11426-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/17/senate-section/article/S11426-4", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND JAPAN ON SOCIAL \n                            SECURITY--PM 96\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended \nby the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-216, 42 U.S.C. \n433 (e)(1)), I transmit herewith the Agreement between the United \nStates of America and Japan on Social Security, which consists of two \nseparate instruments: a principal agreement and an administrative \narrangement.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide medicare beneficiaries with access to information concerning \nthe quality of care provided by skilled nursing facilities and to \nprovide incentives to skilled nursing facilities to improve the quality \nof care provided by those facilities by linking the amount of payment \nunder the medicare program to quality reporting and performance \nrequirements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a bill I am introducing \ntoday, the Long Term Care Quality and Consumer Information Act.\n  I hope that this bill will spark a serious debate about how we pay \nfor quality care. This proposal establishes a voluntary system under \nwhich nursing homes providing better quality of care would receive \nhigher payment and in turn would provide more information about the \nquality of care provided. Information would include nurse staffing \nratios and would be made public to consumers and their families.\n  Historically, Americans have been paying the same for quality health \ncare as for mediocre care. Efforts have been made by some in the \nprivate sector to better recognize and incentivize those providers who \nconsistently provide higher level of care. The Institute of Medicine \n(IOM), in its report ``Leading by Example,'' declared the government \nshould take the lead in improving health care by giving financial \nrewards to hospitals and doctors who improve care for beneficiaries in \nsix Federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid and the Veterans \nHealth Administration. The IOM report also said the government should \ncollect and make available to the public data comparing the quality of \ncare among providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nhas begun pilot programs. I think nursing homes should also be an area \nin which we explore payment policies that regard those providing a \nhigher quality of care.\n  I look forward to continuing the discussion with all stakeholders \nabout these concepts so we can assure a high level of care and find \nways to help providers improve the level of care they provide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2989. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide an \naffirmative defense for the medical use of marijuana in accordance with \nthe laws of the various States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Leahy and \nJeffords to introduce the Truth in Trials Act. This is a narrowly \ntailored bill that would allow defendants in Federal criminal trials \nregarding medicinal marijuana to introduce evidence that their \nmarijuana-related activity was performed in compliance with State law \nregarding the medical use of marijuana. It also would provide \ndefendants in such trials with an affirmative defense if they \nestablish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that their activities \ncomplied with State law.\n  Let me be clear. This legislation does not legalize marijuana. It \ndoes not even legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes. It only is \nmeant to address the conflict between State and Federal law with regard \nto medical marijuana. Under this legislation, defendants in the ten \nStates with medicinal marijuana laws could be found not guilty of \nviolating Federal law if their actions are done in compliance with \nState law.\n  Why is this legislation necessary?\n  Over the past 8 years, ten States have passed referendums or enacted \nlaws authorizing medical marijuana in those States. The first of these \nstates was California. In 1996, voters in California passed the \nCalifornia Compassionate Use Act, also known as Proposition 215, to \nallow seriously ill people who have a doctor's recommendation to \ncultivate and use marijuana as a form of treatment.\n  However, in 2001, the Drug Enforcement Administration began \naggressively targeting medical marijuana providers in California and \nthese other States--regardless of the fact that these individuals were \ncomplying with State law.\n  Consider who these so-called criminals are that the DEA is targeting \nand arresting.\n  The city of Oakland enacted a medicinal marijuana ordinance, as \npermitted by California law, and Ed Rosenthal grew marijuana to be sold \nfor medicinal uses under the auspices of this ordinance. Even though \nMr. Rosenthal was acting as an officer of the city, in February 2002, \nDEA agents raided his facility and arrested him of marijuana \ncultivation and conspiracy.\n\n[[Page S11431]]\n\n  Since Federal law does not recognize ``medical necessity'' as a \ndefense, Mr. Rosenthal was not allowed to tell the jury that he was \ngrowing the marijuana for medicinal purposes. The prosecutors took this \nopportunity to present Mr. Rosenthal as a big-time drug dealer, and the \njury had no choice but to convict Mr. Rosenthal.\n  After the trial, the jurors learned that Mr. Rosenthal was growing \nmedical marijuana and complained that they had been misled by the \ncourt. Five jurors immediately issued a public apology to him and \ndemanded a new trial. Their statement said, ``In this trial, the \nprosecution was allowed to put all of the evidence and testimony on one \nof the scales, while the defense was not allowed to put its evidence \nand testimony on the other side. Therefore we were not allowed as a \njury to properly weight the case.''\n  During the sentencing phase of the trial, nine of the twelve jurors \nasked that Mr. Rosenthal not be imprisoned because they had convicted \nhim ``without having all the evidence.'' Due to these unique \ncircumstances, the judge sentenced Mr. Rosenthal to one day in prison \nand a $1,000 fine, the most lenient sentence allowed under the law. \nYet, the prosecutor, who had asked for a six-and-a-half-year sentence, \nhas appealed this sentence.\n  Another example is the Wo/men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana, a \nnonprofit collective of patients and their caregivers, 85 percent of \nwhom are terminally ill with cancer or AIDS. One member of this \norganization is Suzanne Pfeil, who suffers from post-polio syndrome and \nexperiences extreme pain and muscle spasticity. She is allergic to \nopiates and does not tolerate many pharmaceutical drugs, so her \nphysician recommended medicinal marijuana, in accordance with \nCalifornia State law. Here, in her own words, is what happened to her \nin 2002:\n\n       At dawn on September 5th, 2002, I awoke to five federal \n     agents pointing assault rifles at my head, I did not hear \n     them come in because my respirator is rather loud. They \n     yelled at me to put my hands in the air and to stand up \n     ``NOW.'' I tried to explain to them that I needed to put my \n     hands down on the bed in order to sit up because I am \n     paralyzed. They again shouted at me to stand up. I pointed to \n     my crutches and braces beside the bed and said, ``I'm sorry, \n     I can't stand up without my crutches and braces and I \n     normally use a wheelchair.'' At that point they ripped the \n     covers off the bed and finally realized what I was trying to \n     explain amid their shouts and guns. They handcuffed me behind \n     my back and left me on the bed. The DEA then proceeded to \n     confiscate medication recommended to me by my physician under \n     California State Law Proposition 215. My crime? I am a member \n     of the WAMM, the Wo/men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana, a \n     nonprofit collective of patients and their caregivers working \n     together to provide free medication and hospice services to \n     approximately 250 seriously ill and dying members. The DEA \n     then destroyed our collective garden and arrested our \n     Director Valerie Corral, who is an epileptic, and her \n     caregiver and husband Michael Corral.\n\n  This conflict between State and Federal law is a serious one, and one \nthat will be addressed by the Supreme Court later this year in the case \nof Ashcroft v. Raich. Last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nrule in this case that is unconstitutional to prosecute medicinal \nmarijuana users under federal law in states with medicinal marijuana \nlaws, as long as the marijuana is not sold or transported across state \nlines.\n  The Truth in Trials Act is consistent with this Circuit Court ruling, \nwhich I hope the Supreme Court will uphold, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2992. A bill to liquidate and distribute duties collected on \ncertain softwood lumber from Canada; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in disappointment, but also \nwith resolve.\n  After more than 2 years of negotiations between the United States and \nCanada, there is still no agreement on how to manage softwood lumber \ntrade between our two countries. This is disappointing, particularly \ngiven the importance of the issue. Perhaps what is most disappointing, \nthough, is that the negotiations appear to have fallen off, despite the \nfact that parties last year seemed close to an agreement.\n  There might be some who think that the recent NAFTA decisions signal \nan imminent conclusion of the litigation, and that deposits collected \nby U.S. Customs will be returned soon. As one who has seen this dispute \nwax and wane for nearly 30 years, this seems to me a naive expectation. \nThe fact is that the recent NAFTA decisions had more to do with a \nbitter disagreement between the NAFTA panelists and the U.S. \nInternational Trade Commission about investigative methodologies than \nwhether or not the Canadian timber policies are consistent with NAFTA \nobligations. The bottom line--and this is the issue at the root of this \ndispute--is that the Canadian policies are deeply inconsistent with the \nnotion of a free and integrated North American market. The timber \nsubsidies provide Canadian mills with a significant, artificial \nadvantage. Until this basic issue is resolved, this dispute--including \nthis litigation and the duties imposed on importers--will continue.\n  In my judgment, the most effective, durable, and fair resolution to \nthis decades-old problem will be found only through a negotiated \nsettlement. This means both parties sitting down at the table and \nfinding a mutually acceptable solution that provides for timber \npolicies that are consistent and compatible. However, pulling away from \nthe negotiating table and relying on litigation isn't going to get us \nthere.\n  Under current U.S. law, the deposits sitting in escrow are eligible \nfor liquidation. As I have said, I would prefer a negotiated \nsettlement--one that resolves all matters of disagreement, including \nthe disposition of these deposits. but some involved in the negotiation \nappear to have decided upon litigation as their preferred method of \nresolution. If it is necessary for more and my colleagues to assert the \nlegal rights available to the U.S. industry as a way of reminding the \nparties of the stakes that are still very much on the table, then that \nis what we will do.\n  Today, my good friend, Larry Craig and I have introduced a bill that \nwould order the Commerce Department to begin the process of liquidating \nthe approximately $3 billion sitting in escrow, as a result of the \nantidumping and countervailing duties imposed upon imports of Canadian \nsoftwood lumber since March 2002. Further, these deposits are to be \ndistributed to the U.S. lumber industry, which have been seriously \ninjured by Canada's timber policies and which petitioned for these \nduties in the first place. This measure is consistent with current U.S. \nlaw and, if enacted, I expect the U.S. government to defend it to the \nhilt.\n  I hope that our action today will spark a return--by both sides--to \nthe negotiating table. However, if it does not, and if a settlement is \nnot reached, I will not hesitate to push forcefully for enactment of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart because it \nhas been more than four years since the expiration of the Canadian \nSoftwood Lumber Agreement and we have very little to show for it except \na U.S. industry that is still a victim of the situation.\n  This is an issue that I have been involved with since I came to \nCongress and in that time we have seen three separate disputes \nresulting in two negotiated agreements that have also come and gone. We \nare now in the middle of our fourth dispute with no settlement \nagreement in sight.\n  While the two countries were close to reaching an agreement last \nyear, little has happened since to reach a resolution. Meanwhile, with \neach log truck that comes across the border from Canada, another light \nat a U.S. timber company goes out permanently.\n  In order to ensure a future for U.S. timber companies, I am joining \nSenator Baucus, in introducing the Softwood Lumber Duties Liquidation \nAct.\n  Under current U.S. law, the deposits sitting in escrow are eligible \nfor liquidation. The duties were first imposed in May 2002, when the \nU.S. slapped antidumping and countervailing tariffs amounting to more \nthan 27 percent on Canada imports. The Commerce Department had \ndetermined that Canadian timber policies amounted to an unfair subsidy \nand led to the dumping of artificially cheap softwood lumber into the \nU.S. market. Meanwhile, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled \nthat the subsidies and dumped imports injured the U.S. lumber industry, \nwarranting the imposition of tariffs.\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\n  That being said, it is time that all parties come together in honest \nfaith and work towards establishing a settlement that is free and fair \nin its framework. Anything less would be unjust to producers and \nconsumers on both sides of the border.\n  I am hopeful for a resolution. However, in the meantime, I, along \nwith Senator Baucus, will continue to uphold U.S. laws and the \ndeterminations of our trade agencies to help ensure fair trade and \nprotect our industries from illegally subsidized products.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 2993. A bill to establish a National Commission on the \nInfrastructure of the United States; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the \nNational Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2004. For the past year, \nboth bodies of Congress and the Administration have been in a numbers \ndebate--disagreeing over the appropriate level of Federal expenditures \nfor surface transportation, highways and public transit, for the next \nsix years.\n  What this dispute misses are the real issues: 1. What is the state of \nour surface transportation systems and other public infrastructure? 2. \nWhat will the expenditure levels in the bills under consideration do to \naffect that state? 3. What do the American people want in terms of \nmaintenance, access, congestion, and serviceability of our highways, \nbridges, public transit, schools, water and sewer systems, and other \ninfrastructure sectors?\n  Now, we have passed an 8 month surface transportation extension \nbecause the White House and both bodies of Congress could not even \nagree on a $318 billion funding level--$57 billion lower than what was \nrecommended by the United States Department of Transportation to \nmaintain our surface transportation. These inadequate levels of funding \nthat were being discussed proves that surface transportation and \ninfrastructure is not a priority of this Congress. This is the precise \nreason we must establish an infrastructure commission to assess the \nproblems of our nation's infrastructure and recommend solutions. This \nCongress must understand that a component of America's economic \ncompetitiveness lies within our infrastructure.\n  The reality is that our Nation is in the midst of an infrastructure \ncrisis. In almost every one of these areas, America is losing ground at \nan alarming pace and inadequate funding on the part of the federal \ngovernment is the leading cause.\n  The infrastructure deficit interferes with our personal lives on a \ndaily basis. Increased congestion means longer commutes to and from \nwork. Unrepaired potholes means greater wear and tear on our vehicles. \nDeteriorating water lines means greater exposure to lead in our \ndrinking water.\n  Crumbling schools means our children do not receive the quality \neducation they deserve. We cannot expect our children to be productive \nif their schools' basic amenities do not meet the fundamental standards \nneeded for effective learning. A 2003 report by the American Society of \nCivil Engineers, who I am happy to say support this piece of \nlegislation, in addition to the Associated General Contractors of \nAmerica and the American Public Works Association, had schools rated as \na D- and estimated that 75% of school buildings are inadequate to meet \nthe needs of school children.\n  An even greater threat is over the horizon. This infrastructure \ndeficit will erode our economic productivity advantage, the principle \nhope for Americans to maintain our standard of living in the face of \nfierce global competition. U.S. productivity, and the high standard of \nliving that results, is dependent upon efficient transportation systems \nand healthy workers.\n  We are not efficient if our goods are shipped on trucks that are \nstuck in congested traffic. We are not efficient if our harbors are \nunable to accommodate the newest generation of freighters. And our \nworkers cannot be productive if our sewer and water lines are in such \ndisrepair that it affects their health.\n  In 1984, Congress established the National Council on Public Works \nImprovement to report on the state of the Nation's infrastructure. They \nfound that investment in America's infrastructure was barely keeping up \nwith yearly depreciation and that the system would not be able to \nadequately respond to increased demand. Their 1988 final report warned \nthat without increased investment, America would be faced with an \n``infrastructure crisis.''\n  Sixteen years later and after the major economic boom of the 1990's, \nwe have failed to maintain, let alone improve, America's \ninfrastructure. The consequences of our inaction are apparent. In the \n1988 report, the national infrastructure grade was a ``C.'' The ASCE \n2003 Report Card for America's Infrastructure demoted the overall grade \nto a ``D+.'' It is evident that there has been a deterioration in \nseveral aspects of our infrastructure since the 1988 report.\n  In 1988, roads received a grade of a C+. In 2003, roads were \ndowngraded to a D+.\n  In 1988, water resources and water supply was given a B and B- \nrespectively. In 2003, drinking water received a D and navigable \nwaterways received a D+.\n  This deterioration has a ripple effect throughout the entire economy. \nPublic dollars invested in infrastructure increases the productivity of \nprivate investment, which keeps the U.S. competitive in the global \neconomy.\n  What should we do? In the short run, any infrastructure bill passed \nprior to the development of a long-term plan should be for 3 years or \nless in duration. This is the only way to keep the political heat on \nthe White House and the Congress. Our recent experience with 6-year \nauthorization bills, such as the highway bill, demonstrates the Jekyll \nand Hyde approach we have taken toward infrastructure. There is a \nmoderate peak of attention when the legislation is up for \nreauthorization, then, more than a half a decade of disinterest.\n  Also in the short run, Congress must restrain itself from using the \nsurface transportation act and other infrastructure legislation as a \nfield of turkeys with the gobblers to be brought home to voters. The \nability of Congress to restrain itself would be enormously enhanced if \nthe relevant federal agencies would immediately get to the task of \ndeveloping nation-wide standards of need, so that the Congress would \nhave a standard against which to allocate resources. Like the United \nStates Department of Transportation, other agencies need to assess \ntheir needs and report back to the Congress and the White House one \nyear prior to the expiration of the current laws.\n  In the long run, we must come to grips with this burgeoning \ninfrastructure deficit. One model could be the National Highway Act of \nthe 1950s, when under the leadership of President Eisenhower, the \nstates and the federal government came together to jointly finance and \nconstruct an interstate highway system, a system which has transformed \nour nation. President Eisenhower recognized that the highway system \nwould benefit the entire nation, and called on Congress to support his \nvision. In his words, ``. . . the uniting forces of our communication \nand transportation systems are dynamic elements in the very name we \nbear--United States.'' Today, his words still resonate. Improving \ninfrastructure should be a cause around which we can all unite. If we \nact, the entire country benefits; if we fail to act, the entire country \nsuffers.\n  This new infrastructure initiative could use many of Eisenhower's \nsame principles and apply them to rebuild America and protect and \nadvance our nation's social and economic future. The establishment of \nthis national commission on infrastructure to report to the President \nand the Congress in 2\\1/2\\ years would be a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation to ensure that \nthe nation's infrastructure will one day meet current and future \ndemands and more importantly, facilitate economic growth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2993\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that funds received as universal service \ncontributions under section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 and \nthe universal service support programs established pursuant thereto are \nnot subject to certain provisions of title 31, United States Code, \ncommonly known as the Antideficiency Act, for a period of time; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with the support of many of my \ncolleagues on the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation to \nintroduce legislation to help keep Americans' telephone bills from \nrising and to prevent future disruption to the Universal Service Fund. \nThe Universal Service Fund helps keep telephone rates at a reasonable \nlevel for millions of American consumers and businesses located in \nrural parts of our country, areas where phone service would otherwise \nbe prohibitively expensive. The USF also provides discounts to schools \nand libraries on their Internet service through the E-Rate program, \nwhich I and Senator Rockefeller worked to establish in 1996. Finally \nthe USF makes basic ``life line'' phone service available to low-income \nAmericans, and gives assistance to rural health care providers.\n  The bill I introduce today is a corrective measure that addresses \nproblems recently encountered by the Universal Service Administration \nCompany, or ``USAC,'' the private, nonprofit corporation that Congress \ncreated to administer the USF. Specifically, this bill deals with a \ndecision by the FCC that ordered USAC to adhere to a special set of \naccounting rules that applies to government agencies. As a private \ncompany, USAC had utilized the same accounting rules as used by the \nprivate sector, but was told last year that it was subject to the Anti-\nDeficiency Act, a law that prevents government agencies from incurring \nfinancial obligations beyond the amount that has been appropriated to \nthem by Congress. Adherence to government accounting rules is one of \nthe Anti-Deficiency Act's requirements.\n  However, the switch to government accounting rules has caused an \nunforseen disruption in the operation of the USF. In July 2004, USAC \nwas notified that its method for accounting for funding commitments \nmade to schools and libraries under the E-Rate program was illegal \nunder the new government accounting rules, even though the method was \nperfectly proper under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. As a \nresult, USAC was forced to place an enormous amount of cash on its \nbooks by the close of the fiscal year, September 30; to freeze the \nprogram on August 3, preventing any action on applications for E-Rate \ndiscounts right before the start of the school year; and to liquidate \nall of its assets, resulting in $4.6 million in penalties and an \nestimated loss of $30 million in expected interest income.\n  While USAC believes it can resume acting upon applications for E-Rate \ndiscount later this month, it notified the FCC on November 1 that, in \norder to continue compliance with the new government accounting rules, \nthe USF contribution factor must be raised. The contribution factor is \nthe portion of each customer's phone bill that is paid into the USF. \nCurrently the charge is 8.9 percent of a customer's interstate calls \nmade, but it will likely rise to 13 percent or more. Of course, this \nincrease would be passed right on to consumers and businesses. Worse \nyet, this accounting change is likely to affect the other components of \nthe USF as well, since they by and large operate in the same manner. If \nthe USF as a whole is forced to make the same accounting changes that \nwere imposed on E-Rate, the USF contribution factor may rise to 25 \npercent or more by January 1, 2005.\n  As a result of a seemingly innocuous accounting rule change, schools \nand libraries across the country have been unable to obtain much-needed \ndiscounts on their Internet connections, leading many to shut off their \nInternet service altogether. A similar strain may be encountered by the \nUSF as a whole, jeopardizing price supports for rural- and low-income \nAmericans on their phone service. And if no immediate action is taken, \nthe telephone bills of American consumers and businesses are slated to \nrise significantly come the beginning of the new year.\n  My colleagues and I have examined this issue and worked closely with \nthe FCC and our counterparts on the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee. We have determined that, given the pending phone bill \nincreases on January 1, the only way to address this problem is to pass \na law exempting the Universal Service Fund from the Anti-Deficiency Act \nthrough December 31, 2005. During this exemption period, USAC can \ncontinue to operate its programs in an orderly manner, phone bills can \nremain stable, and both Congress and the Executive Branch can work on a \npermanent solution to this problem. There is ample precedent for an \nexemption; indeed, many government programs are permanently exempted \nfrom the Anti-Deficiency Act, such as the National Park Service and the \nConservation Trust.\n  This is a bipartisan effort among those Members who deal with \ntelecommunications issues regularly.

Doc. 108-25).\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today the Senate considered a \nprotocol to the current tax convention between the United States and \nthe Kingdom of the Netherlands. There is substantial trade and cross-\nborder investment between our two countries; the tax convention \nprovides an important basis for facilitating this economic \nrelationship. The original convention was concluded in the early 1990s, \nand there have been several developments in U.S. tax treaty policy in \nthe intervening years that the protocol seeks to address. It contains \nseveral significant provisions, including a revised provision designed \nto ensure that the treaty cannot be used for inappropriate purposes--a \nso-called antitreaty-shopping provision. I commend Chairman Lugar for \nhis diligence in bringing the protocol before the Senate.\n  During the Foreign Relations Committee's review of the protocol, I \nraised a concern about a provision in the current treaty that is not \naddressed by the protocol. Article 24(1) of the current treaty permits \nthe United States to tax former citizens for a period of 10 years after \nthey lose their citizenship, if the loss of their citizenship has as \none of its principal purposes the avoidance of income tax. With one \nexception, this provision in the treaty is consistent with U.S. law--\nspecifically, section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code--as it existed \nat the time the treaty was concluded. The exception is this: the treaty \ndoes not allow the United States to tax former citizens who become \nnationals of the Netherlands. Such an exclusion for nationals of the \ntreaty partner is unique in our tax treaty practice; it is not found in \nany other treaty, nor is it contained in our model treaty.\n  The protocol before the Senate does not close this gap. Consistent \nwith statutory amendments made by Congress in 1996, it does extend the \ntaxation authority of the United States to former long-term residents \nwho leave the United States to avoid taxation. But the exclusion for \nnationals of the Netherlands remains.\n  Maintaining this exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands is \nunwarranted, and raises two concerns. First, I wanted to be sure that \nretaining the exclusion would not serve as a precedent in future tax \ntreaty negotiations. The Treasury Department has noted that such an \nexclusion for nationals of the treaty partner has not been included in \nover two dozen tax treaties negotiated since the treaty with the \nNetherlands entered into force. More important, the Treasury has \ncommitted in writing that it does not intend the provision in the \nNetherlands treaty to serve as a precedent in the future.\n  Second, I was concerned that maintaining the exclusion might subvert \nthe purpose of section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on the \ninformation we have received from the Treasury, and after consultation \nwith the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, it seems unlikely \nthat the provision in the treaty will, in practice, undermine the \noperation of section 877. The reasons for this are set forth in detail \nin the materials that I will seek to include in the Record.\n  Finally, it is worth noting that Congress amended section 877 in \nsection 804 of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, also known as \nthe FSC/ETI bill, which was enacted last month. The primary purpose of \nthe provision remains: to continue to tax people who expatriate in \norder to avoid tax. But the test under the revised section 877 is a \nmore objective test--one based on income levels--than had been applied \nunder the prior law. A question therefore arises about the relationship \nbetween the revised language in section 877 and the provision in the \nU.S.-Netherlands treaty, which uses a more subjective test of whether a \n``principal purpose'' of the expatriating act is to avoid taxation. In \na letter that I will insert in the Record, the Treasury has set forth \ninformation about its intentions for applying the treaty provision in \nlight of the revisions to section 877.\n\n[[Page S11437]]\n\n  The committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on the protocol on \nSeptember 24, 2004. The committee did not vote on the protocol, \nhowever, and therefore there is no committee report. So that may \ncolleagues and the public will have a better understanding of the \nissues I have described, I will ask consent to include two sets of \ndocuments in the Record. The first is a series of questions for the \nrecord that I submitted after the hearing, and the responses from the \nTreasury witness at the hearing, Barbara Angus, who serves as the \ninternational tax counsel at the Department. It should be noted that \nthese questions and answers for the record were written before \nenactment of the revisions to section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code \nin the FSC/ETI bill. The second set of documents is an exchange of \nletters between myself and Ms. Angus on November 15, 2004, which \nelaborates on the issues that I have discussed, including the \nDepartment's intentions for interpreting the revisions to section 877.\n  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe materials I have described.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Treasury Department Response to Question for the Record From Senator \n Biden to Barbara Angus, With Respect to the Proposed Protocol to the \nIncome Tax Convention Between the United States and the Kingdom of the \n                      Netherlands--October 6, 2004\n\n\n                                Question\n\n       Section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code provides for \n     continued taxation of former citizens and long-term residents \n     of the United States if one of the principal purposes of the \n     loss of U.S. citizenship or change of residence status is the \n     avoidance of taxes.\n       When Congress amended Section 877 in 1996 to extend this \n     provision to former long-term residents, the conference \n     report on the legislation stated that ``it is intended that \n     the purpose of the expatriation tax provisions, as amended, \n     not be defeated by any treaty provision. The Treasury \n     Department is expected to review all outstanding treaties to \n     determine whether the expatriation tax provisions, as \n     revised, potentially conflict with treaty provisions and to \n     eliminate any such potential conflicts through renegotiation \n     of the affected treaties as necessary. Beginning on the tenth \n     anniversary of the enactment of the House bill, any \n     conflicting treaty provisions that remain in force would take \n     precedence over the expatriation tax provisions as revised.'' \n     (Conf. Rept. on the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996, H. Rept. 104-736, at 329). The \n     Internal Revenue Service subsequently issued guidance stating \n     that it ``will interpret section 877 as consistent with U.S. \n     income tax treaties. To the extent that there is a conflict, \n     however, all provisions of section 877, as amended, prevail \n     over treaty provisions in effect on August 21, 1996.'' \n     (Internal Revenue Bulletin 1997-10, Mar. 10, 1997, at 48.) \n     Presumably, however, the effect of this guidance expires in \n     2006, as set forth in the above-quoted conference report.\n       Article 6 of the protocol pending before the Committee \n     extends Article 24(1) and its authority over residents and \n     nationals to former long-term residents, but retains an \n     exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands, whether or not \n     they are former citizens or former long-term residents. Thus, \n     rather than follow the 1996 directive urging the elimination \n     of any potential conflicts between a tax treaty and Section \n     877, the protocol appears to preserve an existing conflict \n     (for former citizens who are Dutch nationals) and create a \n     new one (for former long-term residents who are Dutch \n     nationals). This exclusion of the treaty partner's nationals \n     also departs from the U.S. model tax treaty.\n       Please answer the following questions:\n       a. Is the exclusion in Article 24(1) for nationals of the \n     Netherlands found in any other U.S. tax treaty? If not, why \n     is it contained in the U.S.-Netherlands treaty?\n       b. Was the exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands in \n     Article 24(l) of the underlying treaty discussed in the \n     negotiations of the Protocol? Did the United States propose \n     amending this provision? Please elaborate.\n       c. Why was the exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands \n     in Article 24(1) extended to former long-term residents?\n       d. What is the estimated fiscal effect of (1) retaining the \n     exclusion for nationals of the Netherlands who were formerly \n     U.S. citizens; and (2) extending the exclusion to nationals \n     of the Netherlands who were formerly long-term residents?\n\n\n                                Response\n\n       Section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code, which has been \n     part of the U.S. tax law since 1966, provides for special tax \n     treatment of former U.S. citizens who gave up their \n     citizenship to avoid U.S. tax. Amendments enacted in 1996 \n     strengthened these tax rules and extended the special tax \n     treatment to apply also to certain former long-term U.S. \n     permanent residents who gave up such status to avoid U.S. \n     tax.\n       Under section 877, former U.S. citizens and certain former \n     long-term U.S. residents are subject to special rules that \n     impose U.S. tax on certain categories of income that have a \n     connection to the United States; these special tax rules are \n     applicable for the 10-year period following the individual's \n     relinquishment of U.S. citizenship or long-term resident \n     status. The special tax rules apply only to individuals who \n     relinquish U.S. citizenship or long-term resident status for \n     a principal purpose of avoiding U.S. income or estate and \n     gift taxes. For this purpose, a presumption of tax avoidance \n     motive applies in the case of certain individuals whose net \n     worth or average annual net income tax liability exceeds \n     specified thresholds; this presumption does not apply, \n     however, to individuals who meet specified criteria.\n       Section 877 provides that the presumption of tax-avoidance \n     motive (which otherwise would apply if the individual's net \n     worth or average tax liability exceeds the specified \n     thresholds) does not apply to former U.S. citizens who fall \n     into one of the following classes and who submit a ruling \n     request to the Internal Revenue Service:\n       (i) former U.S. citizens who were dual citizens at birth \n     and who have remained citizens of the other country;\n       (ii) former U.S. citizens who become citizens of their \n     country of birth, their spouse's country of birth, or one of \n     their parents' countries of birth;\n       (iii) former U.S. citizens who for the 10 years prior to \n     expatriation were present in the United States for no more \n     than 30 days in any year; and\n       (iv) former U.S. citizens who gave up their U.S. \n     citizenship before age 18\\1/2\\. Analogous exceptions apply in \n     the case of former long-term U.S. residents.\n       The special tax rules of section 877 apply only when there \n     is a tax-avoidance purpose for an individual's relinquishment \n     of U.S. citizenship or U.S. long-term resident status. These \n     exceptions to the presumption of tax-avoidance motive \n     recognize that individuals who have close personal ties to \n     another country are likely to have non-tax reasons for a \n     decision to give up U.S. citizenship or long-term resident \n     status.\n       The U.S.-Netherlands treaty sets forth specific guidance \n     regarding how each country is to tax individuals who are \n     resident in the other country. Although the treaty, like all \n     other U.S. tax treaties, generally limits each country's \n     ability to tax residents of the other country, the treaty \n     contains specific rules that permit the United States to \n     apply its domestic tax rules to U.S. citizens who are \n     resident in the Netherlands. The treaty further provides a \n     rule under which the United States may apply its domestic tax \n     rules to former U.S. citizens who are resident in the \n     Netherlands and who are not Netherlands nationals. The \n     proposed protocol would add to the treaty a rule that extends \n     this same treatment to former U.S. long-term residents who \n     are resident in the Netherlands and who are not Netherlands \n     nationals.\n       The provision in Article 24(1) of the U.S.-Netherlands \n     income tax treaty that limits the imposition of the special \n     U.S. tax rules under section 877 when applied to Netherlands \n     nationals is unique among U.S. tax treaties. However, this \n     exception for Netherlands nationals is not qualitatively \n     different from the underlying approach reflected in section \n     877 as amended in 1996. As described above, section 877 \n     provides several exceptions to the tax-avoidance presumption, \n     including exceptions for individuals who are (or become) \n     citizens of the country in which they (or certain family \n     members) were born or who have very limited links to the \n     United States. These exceptions in section 877 are in several \n     cases broader than the exception for Netherlands nationals in \n     the U.S.-Netherlands treaty.\n       The provision in the U.S.-Netherlands treaty is not \n     expected to produce significantly different results than \n     would be provided under section 877 in practice. As described \n     above, the special tax treatment provided in section 877 \n     applies only in the case of individuals whose relinquishment \n     of U.S. citizenship or long-term resident status had a \n     principal purpose of tax avoidance. Because the Netherlands \n     imposes substantial tax on individuals who are resident there \n     (and only resident individuals who are subject to Netherlands \n     tax are eligible for the benefits of the U.S.-Netherlands tax \n     treaty, including the provision that limits the imposition of \n     U.S. tax), individuals who are trying to avoid tax are \n     unlikely to become residents of the Netherlands. Indeed, \n     pursuant to section 877, the Internal Revenue Service has \n     issued rulings in cases involving Netherlands nationals who \n     relinquished U.S. citizenship or long-term resident status in \n     order to return to the Netherlands, concluding that the \n     individuals did not have a principal motive of tax avoidance \n     and therefore were not subject to the special tax rules \n     provided in section 877. Moreover, because section 877 \n     requires the United States to provide a credit against U.S. \n     tax for tax paid in the country of residence, the application \n     of section 877 to a resident of the Netherlands is unlikely \n     to result in significant U.S. tax (given the substantial tax \n     imposed by the Netherlands on the income of individuals who \n     are resident there).\n       Although the Netherlands agreed to the application of the \n     special rules of section 877 to residents of the Netherlands \n     who are former U.S. citizens or long-term residents, for a \n     period of 10 years when loss of U.S. citizenship or long-term \n     resident status had as one of its principal purposes the \n     avoidance of U.S. income tax, the exception for Netherlands \n     nationals contained in the 1993 treaty\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\n     (and continued in the proposed protocol) was important to the \n     Netherlands. This position reflects the underlying view that \n     the special tax rules applicable in the case of tax-avoidance \n     motivated changes in citizenship or residence should not be \n     applicable in cases where the move is to go home. As noted \n     above, the rules of section 877 and the exceptions contained \n     therein reflect a similar perspective.\n       In light of the limited potential impact of the exception \n     for Netherlands nationals, it was determined that \n     continuation of the exception in the proposed protocol was \n     not inappropriate, particularly given the narrow scope of the \n     proposed protocol. The focus of the proposed protocol is on \n     the withholding tax treatment of dividends and the limitation \n     on benefits provisions. Both countries were interested in the \n     prompt conclusion of a protocol to address these important \n     issues. For the United States in particular, it was a matter \n     of priority to secure improvements to the limitation on \n     benefits provisions in order to prevent the potential for \n     inappropriate use of the treaty through treaty shopping. It \n     is important that the ground-breaking changes to the \n     limitation on benefits provision reflected in the proposed \n     protocol enter into force as soon as possible. In addition, \n     there also were significant benefits to the United States in \n     having the new limitation on benefits rules contained in the \n     proposed protocol become public as soon as possible in order \n     to establish a precedent in terms of strengthened anti-\n     treaty-shopping provisions for other ongoing treaty \n     negotiations. In order to achieve these goals, at the start \n     of negotiations both countries agreed that this protocol \n     would not address other issues where there were differences \n     between the two countries that could slow the process and \n     jeopardize an important agreement.\n       While this protocol did not revisit the agreement reached \n     in 1993 regarding the treatment of Netherlands nationals \n     under the special rules applicable to former U.S. citizens, \n     the proposed protocol does include a straightforward \n     extension of these special rules regarding U.S. taxing \n     jurisdiction of Netherlands residents contained in the \n     current treaty to provide for coverage of former U.S. long-\n     term residents to the same extent as former U.S. citizens. \n     The current treaty does not contain special rules providing \n     for U.S. taxing jurisdiction over former long-term residents. \n     In addition, other significant 1996 changes strengthening \n     section 877, such as the inclusion of new categories of \n     income subject to the special tax rules, are applicable under \n     the treaty.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2004.\n     Ms. Barbara Angus,\n     International Tax Counsel, Department of the Treasury, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Angus: I write regarding the protocol to the U.S.-\n     Netherlands tax treaty now pending before the Senate.\n       As you know, I have been concerned about the continuation \n     of the exclusion from U.S. taxation authority for nationals \n     of the Netherlands set forth in Article 24(1) of the current \n     U.S.-Netherlands tax treaty. Such an exclusion is unique to \n     the Netherlands treaty, and is not contained in the U.S. \n     model treaty. I am therefore concerned that this provision \n     not serve as a precedent in future tax convention \n     negotiations, and would be grateful for any assurances you \n     can provide in this regard.\n       Since the Committee's hearing on the protocol, the Congress \n     has approved and the President has signed into law a measure \n     that modifies section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code (Sec. \n     804 of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Pub. Law 108-\n     357); that provision of law, as you know, provides for \n     special tax treatment of former U.S. citizens and long-term \n     nationals who expatriate. The revised section 877 sets forth \n     an objective test with regard to such individuals, replacing \n     the prior version, which focused on whether the expatriating \n     individual had as a principal purpose the avoidance of U.S. \n     taxation.\n       In previous exchanges between the Department and the \n     Committee, Department officials have asserted to the \n     Committee that the exclusion in Article 24 for nationals of \n     the Netherlands would not produce a significantly different \n     result in practice than would be provided under section 877. \n     I would appreciate the Department's views on whether that \n     remains the case under the revised section 877.\n       Finally, a question arises about the interaction between \n     Article 24 and revised section 877. As noted, the latter now \n     contains an objective test; the former provides for continued \n     taxation for 10 years of former U.S. nationals and long-term \n     U.S. residents--provided they are not nationals of the \n     Netherlands--in cases where the loss of such status ``has as \n     one of its principal purposes the avoidance of income tax.'' \n     I am interested in knowing the Department's views on how it \n     will interpret and apply these provisions, not only under the \n     U.S.-Netherlands treaty but also in the case of similar \n     bilateral tax treaties currently in force.\n       I appreciate your attention to this matter. I expect that \n     the Senate will consider the protocol to the U.S.-Netherlands \n     treaty during this week's session, and I would therefore be \n     grateful for a prompt response to the issues that I have \n     raised.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking Minority Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2004.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: I am writing in response to your letter \n     of November 15, 2004, regarding the pending protocol amending \n     the existing tax treaty with the Netherlands. Your letter \n     focuses on the particular provisions in the U.S.-Netherlands \n     treaty and protocol relating to the tax treatment of certain \n     former U.S. citizens and former U.S. long-term residents. You \n     also asked about the interaction of the provisions in this \n     treaty, and in other treaties, with the provisions of section \n     377 of the Internal Revenue Code as amended by the American \n     Jobs Creation Act enacted last month.\n       The U.S.-Netherlands treaty includes a provision under \n     which the United States may apply its domestic tax rules to \n     former U.S. citizens who are resident in the Netherlands and \n     who are not Netherlands nationals. The pending protocol would \n     add to the treaty a rule that extends this same treatment to \n     former U.S. long-term residents. The provision in the U.S.-\n     Netherlands treaty that limits the imposition of the special \n     U.S. tax rules under section 877 when applied to individuals \n     who are Netherlands nationals is unique among U.S. tax \n     treaties. This special rule with respect to nationals was \n     incorporated in the U.S.-Netherlands tax treaty in 1993 and \n     has not been included in any other treaties since that time. \n     None of the twenty-seven agreements that have entered into \n     force since the Netherlands treaty entered into force \n     includes such a rule for nationals. This special rule in the \n     U.S.-Netherlands treaty has not served as a precedent for \n     other treaties and we do not intend for it to serve as a \n     precedent going forward.\n       In my response to your questions for the record, I \n     explained why we believed that the continuation of the \n     special rule for Netherlands nationals in the U.S.-\n     Netherlands treaty would not produce significantly different \n     results than would be produced under U.S. domestic law in \n     practice. We continue to believe that will be the case \n     following the recent amendments to section 877. Although the \n     test in section 377 has been modified to make it more \n     objective, key considerations underlying our view regarding \n     the practical result were the fact that the Netherlands \n     imposes substantial taxes on individuals and the fact that \n     section 877 provides for a credit that reduces the U.S. tax \n     otherwise due by the tax paid in the country of residence. \n     There has been no change with respect to this factual \n     background.\n       More generally, you asked about our intentions regarding \n     the interpretation of the treaty language which preserves \n     U.S. taxing jurisdiction over former U.S. citizens and former \n     U.S. long-term residents where the individual's \n     relinquishment of citizenship or resident status has ``as one \n     of its principal purposes the avoidance of tax''. The quoted \n     language regarding principal purpose has long been included \n     in the U.S. Model Income Tax Convention and thus appears in \n     many U.S. tax treaties. This treaty language was intended to \n     be read consistently with section 877. Following the \n     modification of section 877 in 1996 to add objective tests, \n     we have taken the position that those objective tests \n     represent the administrative means by which the United States \n     determines whether a taxpayer has a tax avoidance purpose. \n     The recently-enacted changes represent a further step in this \n     direction and are intended to facilitate the administration \n     of the special tax rules of section 877 by making the rules \n     more objective; however, the underlying purpose of section \n     877 has not changed. Accordingly, we intend to continue to \n     take the position, in interpreting the ``principal purpose'' \n     language in the U.S.-Netherlands treaty and other existing \n     treaties, that the objective tests in section 877 as recently \n     amended represent the means by which the United States \n     detemines tax avoidance purpose.\n       We appreciate your interest in this issue. The pending \n     protocol to the U.S.-Netherlands tax treaty will \n     substantially improve a long-standing U.S. treaty \n     relationship and we believe it is in the interest of the \n     United States to bring this agreement into force as soon as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Barbara M.
