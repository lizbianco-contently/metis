Mr. President, this will be the beginning of the debate on \nthe legislation the Senate will be considering this week on an economic \ngrowth and jobs package. The legislation that came out of the Senate \nFinance Committee will be debated, as will other proposals and \namendments. That will all be laid down a little bit later, but actually \nwe will begin the conversation right now.\n  I will begin by noting something rather political, and that is that \nover the weekend talk shows I noticed a lot of pundits talking about \nwhat was good for the economy and what was good for the President. It \ngot me thinking a little bit about the difference between some of our \ncolleagues on the Democratic side and most of us on the Republican side \nwho support the President's proposals for economic growth and job \ncreation.\n  The point is this: Those pundits were saying if the economy is in \npretty good shape next year, the President should have a pretty good \nchance of being reelected, but if the economy is not good, then it will \nbe more difficult for the President to be reelected. That is not \nexactly rocket science, but it makes the point that many of us on this \nside have been making: The President would not propose a package for \neconomic growth and job creation he did not think was not going to \nwork. The whole point of his package is to help get the economy \ngrowing, to create jobs so people will be in the mood to reelect him \nPresident.\n  Obviously he wants to do good for the country, for the people of this \ncountry, for the senior citizens, for the economy at large, for \nAmerican families. If he can get reelected, that would be a good thing. \nMy point is that the President is not proposing something he thinks is \ngoing to be bad for the economy, because that would be the worst \npossible thing for him to do in terms of his reelection possibilities.\n  So it stands to reason that he really believes what he is proposing \nwill work, and so do I. So do the majority of us. We would not be \nproposing this if it was not obvious to us that the best way to get the \neconomy moving again, the best way for economic growth and job \ncreation, is to reduce taxes in those areas of the economy which would \nprovide the best economic growth with that tax relief.\n  We know, for example, that one of the best ways to get reinvestment \nis for people to have more of their money to invest, obviously. The \nbest way for them to have more money is not to pay so much to Uncle Sam \nin taxes. That is what tax relief is all about.\n  Two years ago, we passed the tax relief President Bush suggested, but \nwe phased it in over time. What the President is now proposing is, \nlet's accelerate those tax reductions, those marginal rate income tax \nreductions, so they take effect immediately. If, as the President said, \nit is a good idea to do it in 2 years, it is an even better idea to do \nit now when we need that money in our pockets to invest so our \nbusinesses can create jobs and help with economic growth.\n\n  The first point of the President's plan is to take those tax breaks \non the income tax marginal rates for each of the brackets we were \nreducing, and reduce them this year rather than waiting 2 years from \nnow. It makes great economic sense. It will help families, it will help \nsmall businesses, and it will enable those businesses to take that \nmoney that is being saved and invest it in new jobs and in new \nbusiness.\n  The second feature of the President's plan is to eliminate something \nvery unfair in the current Tax Code. As a matter of fact, the United \nStates is second only to Japan in having the worst possible tax policy \non corporate dividends. Only one country in the world taxes dividends \nmore than the United States: Japan. Every other country in the world \nthat has developed economies has a much lower tax rate on dividends. So \nwe have put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage with all of these \nother countries in the world. The reason we have such a disadvantage is \nbecause we do not just have one tax on corporate dividends; we repeat \nthe tax. We tax the corporation the first time around when the income \nis earned, and as soon as they pay the dividends out to the \nshareholders, we tax it again. So it is a double taxation. No wonder \nour rate is so high. It is 70 percent.\n  As I said, only one country in the world, Japan, which is having huge \neconomic difficulties at the current time, has a worse tax rate on \ndividends than we do. So the President logically says, let's get rid of \nthat double taxation. The way he chose to do it was to repeal the tax \non the dividends that are earned by American citizens, investors. The \ncorporation still pays the tax, but it is not taxed the second time \naround.\n  There are many advantages to doing it that way: First, it really \nhelps the senior citizens in this country who derive a lot of their \nincome from this dividend income. Secondly, it really helps to spur \neconomic growth because not only will the dividends then be used for \nreinvestment into business, but it also helps the stock market \ngenerally by infusing capital back into the stock market. The \neconomists we have talked to all make the point that it is not just the \ncorporations that choose to issue dividends that will benefit from \nthis, and their taxpayers, but it is all of the stocks because of the \ngeneral increase in the value of equities. I think we have seen that in \nthe way the market has responded to the President's proposal.\n  A third side benefit of this elimination of the double tax of \ndividends is the impact it will have on corporate governance. We all \nknow the problem that was revealed over the course of the last couple \nof years about certain corporations, not corporations that were paying \ndividends but corporations that were putting money into the hands of \ntheir executives, in some cases in a very bad way. Fortunately, the \nPresident cracked down hard on them, as did the Congress, with the \nSarbanes-Oxley legislation. The idea is to create transparency, to let \nthe stockholders know what is going on in corporations, and to give \nthem an incentive not to create more debt but to finance their \nexpansion through equity; that is to say, through offering stock to the \npublic, which the public then buys, the money then enabling the \ncorporation to invest in expansion of the business, hiring more people, \nfor example, rather than going to the bank to borrow the money to do \nthat.\n  Today, our Tax Code gives the incentive to go borrow because \ncorporations get to deduct the interest on the money they borrow. That \nis the way corporations treat that when they pay the income tax. We \nneed to give them at least an equal incentive and perhaps a greater \nincentive to finance their corporate expansion not through borrowing \nbut, rather, through the issuance of stock, which then Americans can \nacquire.\n  What is one way to do that? By ensuring that if they pay dividends on \nthat stock, the purchasers of the stock are not going to have to pay a \ntax on the dividends they receive. It is a way of providing an \nincentive for the corporations to finance their expansion that way.\n  For all of these reasons, the economists we have talked to are pretty \nclear that eliminating the double taxation on dividends would provide a \nreal spurt in investment in business, would enable the businesses to \nexpand, would create something like 500,000 jobs this year, 1.4 million \njobs next year. That is real job creation.\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\n  There are those on the other side who say that is impossible. There \nare not going to be that many jobs created. The economy is not going to \nget better with the President's proposal.\n  I go back to my first point. The President has a very personal reason \nin mind, as well as the good of the country, when he talks about a \nprogram that will really improve the economy. He wants to be reelected. \nHe would not be doing this if he thought it would be bad for the \neconomy.\n  There is a misperception by some that this recession we are in right \nnow is a recession that should be dealt with not by allowing businesses \nto have more money to reinvest to create jobs; that is to say, it is \nnot a capital deficit problem but, rather, it is a matter of consumer \nspending. If only we would give more money to people, they would spend \nit and that would make everything better, create more demand for \nproducts, they would buy more, and so on. That just does not happen to \nbe true.\n  Here are the statistics. Consumer spending has been going up. It went \nup 3.1 percent in the year 2002, 2.5 percent the year before that; \ndisposable personal income has increased, up 4.3 percent last year.\n  The problem is not disposable personal income; it is not consumer \nspending that has been going on. We know from personal experience, \npeople have been able to refinance their homes, they have been able to \nbuy cars at zero percent interest. There are a lot of factors we are \npersonally aware of that confirm it is not a matter of consumer \nspending but, rather, a capital asset problem. Businesses cannot get \nthe money to expand.\n  What happened? We all know what happened in the stock market in the \nlast several years. According to some people, $10 trillion in value in \nstocks has essentially disappeared, evaporated. The stocks were way up \nhere, and now they are down here. What is the difference? It is $10 \ntrillion in value, in assets, in money that corporations do not have \nanymore. They do not have that value, and therefore they cannot go to \nthe bank and borrow. They cannot sell their stock for a good price; \npeople are not buying. And the question is how do you get more capital \nassets into the business sector, which is the sector which provides the \njobs. Whether it be small business or big business, it is the same; it \nis a capital asset deficit, not a consumer spending problem.\n  I will emulate my good friend from North Dakota, the master of \ncharts. He has a chart for everything. I will produce a big chart, but \nI will now show the small version that will make the point. The upper \nline is the line increasing, and that is consumer spending. It shows \nthat from 1999, the first year up to the current time, consumer \nspending has continued to increase. It went up 3.1 percent last year. \nWe do not have a demand problem, a consumer spending problem in this \ncountry; we have a capital asset problem.\n  Here is what has happened with capital assets. Here is the big stock \nboom. With everyone investing in the stock markets, the corporations \nhad a lot of value. And here is what happened to the stock. We all know \nwhat happened. A lot of that value was taken out as the market plunged. \nThat is what this line shows. It hit the bottom and is just barely \nbeginning to move up.\n  This is what we have to make up. This is the area we need to improve. \nIt is the area of providing more capital to our businesses so they can \nexpand and create more jobs. Again, how do you do that? They basically \nhave two ways. They can try to borrow the money--not good policy, but \nbesides that, they do not have the leverage to do that these days \nbecause the Federal institutions are looking at them and asking: How \nexactly are you going to repay us? How will you do something good with \nthis money? We are not convinced yet that the value is there that they \nwant to lend the money at a reasonable rate. Or they can go to the \npublic and say: Here is some more stock; would you please buy it.\n  In the past, the public said: We are not sure we want to invest \nanymore in the stock market because you are not doing that well. So \nalong comes the President's plan. He says: We will accelerate \ndepreciation for small business, we will end the double taxation of \ndividends, and we will accelerate the marginal income tax relief we \npassed 2 years ago.\n  Just like that, we have created an opportunity for people to take the \nmoney they have saved, put it into the stock market, put it into \nbusinesses, or put it into small businesses that are not publicly \ntraded and create those jobs. That is the genius of the President's \nprogram. It is nothing new. The same concept has been used before in \ntax relief that has been provided to investors who turn around and \nreinvest that in the businesses that create the jobs.\n  The problem is this recession is not like the old recessions, and \nthat is why I understand those who are stuck in the last century in \nlooking at this as a consumer or demand recession. This is the first \n21st century recession, the first high-tech recession, and it is the \nfirst capital asset deficit recession. It is not a consumer recession. \nThat is why it does not do any good, as the Democrat leader's plan \nessentially does, to just drop money out of an airplane and say: Here \nis money, consumers; go ahead and spend it on something. That is not \nthe problem. That is not going to help. What we need is for those \nbusinesses to acquire capital so they can expand, create jobs, and \ntherefore the economy can grow and we can all benefit.\n  There are those who want to demagog the issue, and I would never \naccuse colleagues on the other side of the aisle of this, but I have \nseen folks on TV say that is giving money to the rich, to the elite. \nFirst of all, over half of the American people today are investors. \nSenior citizens, in particular, are very large investors, and a \nsignificant amount of the tax relief the President is proposing would \ngo to our seniors. As a matter of fact, under the President's jobs and \neconomic growth plan, 13 million elderly taxpayers would receive an \nannual tax cut of $1,384 this year. One of every two senior filers \nreceives dividend income, and as a group seniors receive half of all \nthe taxable dividends paid to shareholders. So elimination of the \ndouble taxation of dividends provides average relief of $991 for the \nmore than 9 million seniors who include dividend income on their tax \nreturn in the year 2003. That is a real benefit to the seniors in our \nsociety. It is a real benefit to the American taxpayer at large.\n  I will have more to say on this subject later. I appreciate my \ncolleague from Wyoming allowing me to open this debate, and I look \nforward to hearing from my colleagues on the subject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, although we are in morning business, I \nbegin by thanking the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, for the way he has approached putting this bill together. He \nhas been a very fair, very honest, and very decent man, a man who keeps \nhis word. Regrettably, he is not in the Chamber at this moment, but he \nwill be spending a lot of time in the Chamber this week. I want the \nSenate to know how much this Senator regards the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. He has done a masterful job. He has a very difficult \njob. Believe me, I know; I have been in that position. He has always \nconducted the committee's business and the Senate's duties very \nappropriately, fairly, with courtesy and civility. I deeply appreciate \nthat, and I know I speak for the rest of the members of our committee \nand the Senate Finance Committee as well as Members of this body.\n  The Finance Committee of the Senate works best when we work together. \nWe then get a better product with broader support from both sides. The \nFinance Committee has a long and deserved reputation for working \ntogether cooperatively.\n  It is with great sadness I note today the passing of the former \nchairman of the committee, Russell Long, just a couple days ago. He was \nwell known for not only his willingness but his desire to work hard \nwith both sides of the aisle.\n  I served with Senator Long a good number of years ago, and I think he \nset the model. On occasion, the committee has deviated slightly, and \nevery time it has, I think it has been a mistake. The tradition of \nbipartisanship has served the committee very well.\n  I know that is Chairman Grassley's inclination as well. I also know \nthat\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\ncircumstances have not allowed him to carry out this role on this bill \nas much as he would like. It appears some in the committee have made \nnonnegotiable demands for what they say ``must'' be in this bill. \nRather than pass a bill that would include all the terms with which we \ncan agree, or at least most of us, some insist that the bill must, for \nexample, include tax cuts for dividends. That is an insistence that \nsome members of the committee are making and do not want to negotiate. \nSome insist this bill must include an acceleration of the tax rates for \nthe 1 percent of American elite with income greater than $311,000. That \nis something they insist on or there is no bill; that is, rather than \npass a bill with overwhelming support and seek a bipartisan vote.\n  The Senate often works because of willingness to compromise. Senators \ngive up what they consider perfect in order to get in the end what will \nbe good. I know Chairman Grassley works to get things done in that way, \nand so does this Senator. Without compromise, we will get less \ndone. Without compromise, the result will command less popular support. \nIt will be more tenuous, more fragile, and without compromise the \nSenate will be a much more partisan place, a place that is not much fun \nin which to work.\n\n  But this is only Monday. It is early in the debate and there is still \ntime, even at this late date. I believe it is not too late for us in \nthe Senate to work in the Senate's best traditions; that is, work \ntogether.\n  Let me take a few moments now to discuss why we are here today. I \nwill also discuss the President's proposal and the congressional \nreactions to it.\n  Why are we here today? In the first instance, we are here because the \nbudget resolution directs us. The budget resolution expressing the will \nof the Congress tells us that this month we shall consider a \nreconciliation bill, so we are carrying out our duty under the budget \nprocess. We are also here because the times demand it. The times demand \naction.\n  On a Montana ranch, when the grass has burned dry and there is just \ndust in the air, the rancher has to take steps to feed and protect his \nherd. And when drought hits and times are tough, no Montana rancher \nwould fail to dig down deep, even deeper, rather than fail to find a \nway to make things work to get his place back on solid ground.\n  On a larger scale, we are here today because the American economy \ndemands it. There is a drought in the American economy, just as there \nhas been in many parts of America, a very severe drought facing \nagriculture.\n  The week before last, the Government reported that the unemployment \nrate surged to 6 percent. Since January 2001, just 2 years ago, the \nprivate sector has lost, not gained--I might put that in the context of \nthe 2001 tax cut--the private sector has lost more than 2.1 million \njobs. The economy has lost more than half a million jobs in the last 3 \nmonths alone. We now have the fewest number of jobs in 41 months. Since \nJanuary 2 years ago, the economy has grown by an anemic average of 1.5 \npercent, far below the post-World War II average.\n  Business owners tell me they are not investing, despite what the \nSenator from Arizona just said on the floor, because of so much \nuncertainty and too much overcapacity. Consumer confidence has dropped. \nSimply put, there is a lot of uncertainty out there.\n  The reason the investment curve has declined is very simply because \nthe bubble burst. That bill that was run up in the 1990s, whether in \nthe high-tech sector or the telecommunications sector--generally that \nbubble burst. The price-to-earnings ratio was way too high. Everyone \nknew it but said maybe they would get on the gravy train, knowing it \nwould not last forever, but trying to stay on as long as it would last. \nSure enough, the bubble did burst--no more gravy train. The economy \ndidn't collapse, but we fell into recession.\n  As a consequence, there is amazing business overcapacity. Businesses \nare not investing now because they have overcapacity. They cannot fully \nuse the capacity they now have because people are not buying as much as \nthey once did. That is why investment is down.\n  The chart the Senator from Arizona pointed out to us a few minutes \nago may be interesting. It has two lines on it, but his explanation for \nthe lines is totally inaccurate. It is totally fallacious. There are \nother reasons to explain why the investment curve is down, and I just \nexplained the main reason it is down.\n\n  There is a lot of uncertainty in the economy. There is a lot of \nuncertainty because there are fewer jobs and the unemployment is so \nhigh and there is also an increased need for unemployment benefits.\n  We have to increase investor confidence. They tell me, as I am sure \nthey are telling you--businessmen are telling me, as I am sure they are \ntelling you, over and over again, they are unwilling to invest now. \nThey don't want to take that step to invest. They are afraid. They are \na little nervous. Why? Because there is no pricing power. They cannot \nget people out to buy more of their products. The economy is stalled \nout. There is no great demand.\n  Consumer confidence has fallen off, too, actually. But the main \nreason for businesses not investing is people won't buy their products. \nThey are waiting for citizens to buy more of their products. That is \nwhat is happening today. At least that is what all businessmen are \ntelling me. I talk to Republicans and Democrats, Independents and \nliberals; I don't care who they are. I ask them, What is going on? What \ndo we need to do?\n  I always get the same answer when I talk to people where the rubber \nmeets the road; that is, business people, not theoretical economists. I \ndon't mean to disparage the economists, but we all know economic \nprognoses and economic predictions are all over the lot because people \nare people. What really counts is those financial statements and those \nbuy orders. Business people face the payrolls and the cost structures \nthat business people face. That is what really counts.\n  Business people are telling me they are not investing partly because \nthey have overcapacity already and can't use what they have; second, \nbecause there is just no great demand.\n  I also say that after looking at the economy today it is important \nfor us to look at specific goals we think any tax bill, any economic \ngrowth bill should contain. One major point about any growth package is \nthat it should take effect as soon as possible. That is what we are \ntalking about here. We are talking about an economy that is stalled \nout, so any tax bill that is presented before us should take effect as \nsoon as possible. It is an obvious point but one I make because the \nlegislation before us fails totally on that point. It does not take \neffect soon at all.\n  We should also look at our long-term fiscal situation; that is, our \ndebt. We should not add needless debts, additional burdens on our \nchildren and our grandchildren. We must avoid action today which may \nhave the effect of raising interest rates, particularly mortgage \ninterest rates, not far down the road.\n  I remind my colleagues that this is only May 2003. Things can change. \nThings can happen very quickly. Where are we going to be a year from \nnow? Where are we going to be 2 years from now? What actions are we \ntaking today that will have an effect on long-term interest rates? We \nare lucky that inflation is low, but I can remember when inflation was \nhigh and interest rates were very high and that day, unfortunately, \nwill happen again. We don't know when, but we should not take actions \nto exacerbate that or make it more likely that interest rates will rise \nmore quickly.\n  We should also address a third goal; that is, we should spread the \nbenefit of the tax reduction among all taxpayers. We are all Americans. \nWe all should benefit, not just the special elite.\n\n  Let me turn now to the President's proposal. The President proposes a \nbudget, but under the Constitution Congress legislates. We do not \nmerely rubberstamp the President's budget. We have a job to do. After \nall, we are supposedly elected to exercise our own independent judgment \nas Senators.\n  Many of the President's proposals command broad support. I support a \ngood number of them. They may not be the most efficient stimulative \nproposals possible, but they should increase some consumer demand, and \nI, for one, think that is good. Specifically I support--and I believe \nSenators broadly do--helping families meet\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\ntheir costs by increasing the child credit to $1,000 right now. I also \nsupport speeding up relief for the marriage penalty.\n  Let's eliminate that marriage penalty. I also support expanding the \n10-percent bracket immediately, to give immediate relief to most \ntaxpayers. They will spend those dollars. They will spend them right \naway to help rebuild our economy.\n  Also, I support ensuring we do not worsen the difficulties created by \nthe alternative minimum tax. I am pleased the committee-reported bill \nincludes something on each of these items.\n  But Congress has a role to temper and improve the President's \nproposals. From my perspective, several areas are key.\n  First, the amount of the tax cut package is critical. The absence of \nfiscal responsibility over the long term affects interest rates now and \nin the future. We have a duty to be responsible. We must not worsen \ninterest rates and dampen economic growth by passing an irresponsibly \nlarge package.\n  In January, 2 years ago, the Congressional Budget Office projected \nsurpluses of $5.6 trillion for the next decade. That is an important \nfigure to remember. Surpluses were projected 2 years ago of $5.6 \ntrillion for the decade. Today, CBO projects the President's budget \nwill result in deficits--not surpluses but deficits--of $2.1 trillion \nfor the same period. That is a swing of almost $8 trillion in just 2 \nyears, and recent projections make those projections look overly \noptimistic.\n  I might note other bills we are going to have to pay, whether it is \nMedicare, prescription drug benefits, more AMT--which we all know we \nwill have to pay for relief for the alternative minimum tax--Iraq. \nThings are not going well in Iraq. That is going to cost money. Who \nknows what other events are going to occur around the world?\n  Think a little bit about the burgeoning health care costs which \npeople are facing around this country and how much that is translating \ninto Medicare costs and Medicaid costs, and with the baby boomers \nstarting to retire in just a few years from now.\n  I believe we would be irresponsible by adding significantly to our \ndeficit.\n  Our national balance of payments bill, which is how much more we owe \nother countries compared to what they owe us, is getting larger and \nlarger on an absolute relative scale each year. Someday we are going to \nhave to pay that bill. We all know we are going to have to pay that \nbill. The question is, When? What day? I would rather not hasten the \nday of paying that bill, and that bill will not be hastened the more \nfiscally responsible we are.\n  The dollar is declining against the euro. The dollar is not tanking. \nBut why is it steadily declining against the euro? Could it be that the \ninvestors around the world are beginning to question America's long-\nterm economic policies? I think that is a small part of it. I can't \ndescribe all of it. I don't know. But I raise those concerns.\n  Clearly, our fiscal circumstances are much less favorable than when \nwe considered the 2001 tax bill. We are in a different situation today, \nmuch different from that of 2001.\n  Today, we must keep the size of the tax bill within narrower limits. \nToday, we must be more concerned about contributing to higher interest \nrates. In that regard, I am pleased that the committee-reported bill \nkeeps within the $350-billion limit over the coming decade that was \nagreed to during consideration of the budget resolution.\n  Second, the President's proposal on dividends is troubling for many \nof us. It must either be eliminated or even more dramatically scaled \ndown. Yes, the tax treatment of dividends might be a worthy subject--as \npart of a budget-neutral corporate tax reform debate. But the \nPresident's dividend proposal--at roughly $400 billion--is simply too \nfiscally irresponsible, too complicated, and affects too few taxpayers \nto be appropriately included in this stimulus package. It borders on \nirresponsibility.\n  Only 3 out of 10 tax filers report dividend income on their tax \nreturns. They are the only ones who would benefit from the dividend \nproposal. In other words, seven out of 10 Montanans would see no tax \nbenefit at all from a dividend tax cut as a consequence. The provisions \nin this bill should benefit taxpayers more broadly across the income \nspectrum. That way, they can most effectively get money to taxpayers \nwho would spend it and spur the economy.\n  The committee changed the President's dividend proposal. \nUnfortunately, the committee-reported bill also contains an ill-\nconceived dividend proposal. The bill would exclude from income all \ndividend income up to $500. It then includes a 10-percent exclusion for \ndividend income above $500 from 2004 to 2007. And the exclusion \nincreases to 20 percent for 2008 through 2012.\n  On one hand, the dividend exclusion provides simplification. A capped \nexclusion of $500 would make it no longer necessary for half of \ntaxpayers with dividend income to report their dividends on their tax \nreturns.\n  But this benefit is overshadowed by the worst part of the proposal--\nthe 10-percent and 20-percent exclusion for dividends above $500. This \nprovides a very large tax cut to the elite.\n  Take the example of a taxpayer who has $1 million in dividend income. \nUnder the committee-reported bill, that fortunate taxpayer gets to \nexclude a little more than $100,000 of dividend income--$100,450, to be \nexact. Applying tax rates to this excluded income, this taxpayer would \nget a tax cut of about $35,000 a year from the dividend tax cut alone.\n  A third problem with the President's proposal is the acceleration of \nthe rate cuts for that 1 percent of American elite with income greater \nthan $311,000. This proposal alone costs some $35 billion.\n  In better times, I would support a package that included benefits for \nthose making over $311,000. But these are not better times. In better \ntimes, I would support a package that included benefits for those who \nmake over $311,000. But with the budget in the shape it is in, now is \nnot the time to accelerate this rate reduction. This provision is just \ntoo costly and too narrow to effectively spur demand and rebuild the \neconomy.\n  Fourth, more needs to be done to infuse funds to cash-strapped States \nand localities. The economic downturn has cut State and local revenues \ndramatically. But State constitutions--as opposed to the U.S. \nConstitution--require States to balance their budgets.\n  So State and local governments are forced to make widespread, often \npainful spending cuts in education, in health, and in other vital \nprograms.\n  More than half the states are still struggling to balance their \nbudgets this fiscal year. And almost all of them are struggling to \nbalance their budgets for the fiscal year that begins in July.\n  These State spending cuts, layoffs, and tax increases, I believe, \nwill offset the gains from tax breaks in this bill. And the economic \ngains to tax breaks for the elite are overstated or theoretical.\n  Last year, the State of Montana cut benefits for severely mentally \nill youth, just in order to make ends meet. The State also made across-\nthe-board cuts in Medicaid provider payments and increased cost \nsharing--both of which now threaten access to care for low-income \nMontanans.\n  If those cuts were not drastic enough, this year, the State \nlegislature just cut more than a quarter of a million dollars from \nMeals on Wheels for seniors. That will mean about 67,000 meals lost \nover the next 2 years. And budget constraints have also forced my State \nto put 700 working families on a waiting list for child care.\n  Translating Montana's small population to a national level, those \ncuts are the equivalent of more than 2 million lost meals nationwide. \nIt's the equivalent of a 22,000-family waiting list for child care.\n  We can pass all the Federal tax cuts we want. But what good will they \ndo if we force States and localities to raise taxes, cut jobs, and \nreduce benefits.?\n  We can avoid these economically-damaging State and local actions by \nassisting these governments with their budgets through temporarily \nraising the Federal Medicaid match and through other, more broad-based \nmethods.\n  I am pleased that the committee-reported bill includes something in \nState aid. Unfortunately, the committee-reported bill includes $20 \nbillion--only a little more than 5 percent of its total--for this \npurpose. I would have preferred a package that included $40 billion in \nState aid; the need is that great.\n\n[[Page S6018]]\n\n  Fifth, making tax cuts refundable will help spur economic growth. \nVery simply, it works. They will quickly get funds to people who are \nlikely to spend them rapidly, spur demand, and rebuild the economy.\n  The President's proposal accelerated the $1,000 child credit. I \nsupported the increase in the child credit when it was passed in 2001, \nand I support the acceleration.\n  But the President's proposal did not accelerate the refundability of \nthe credit. Fortunately, during consideration of the bill, the Finance \nCommittee adopted Senator Lincoln's amendment to accelerate the \nrefundability of the child credit. The Lincoln amendment will allow \nmany low-income families to take full advantage of the increase in the \ncredit.\n  Under current law, the credit is partially refundable. Families can \ntake the credit if they pay payroll taxes, but do not have income tax \nliability. The amount that low-income families can get refunded is set \nto increase in 2005. Thanks to the Lincoln amendment, this improvement \nwill be accelerated to 2003 along with the increase in the credit. More \nhard-working low-income families will be able to get up to $1,000 per \nchild in this credit in 2003, thanks to the Lincoln amendment.\n  Sixth, we should increase the bonus depreciation deduction for the \nyear that a business purchases new equipment. In 2001, we saw a sharp \ndrop in direct investment by businesses. The next year, we changed the \nlaw to give a larger first-year deduction. The drop; in direct \ninvestment leveled, and even increased slightly. We need to provide \nmore in the depreciation deduction for 2003 to encourage even more \nbusiness investment.\n  And seventh, we need to extend unemployment benefits and help those \nwho have exhausted their benefits. The government has reported that \nnearly 2 million people have been without work for 27 weeks or longer. \nThe average time people have been unemployed is almost 20 weeks--the \nlongest since 1984.\n  The weak economy has hit everyone. Unfortunately, some more than \nothers. As we rebuild the economy, we should not leave these unemployed \nworkers and their families behind.\n  Any bill to help rebuild the economy must help those most affected by \nthe bad economy. As well, putting funds in these hands will be an \neffective stimulus. The recipients of unemployment benefits and their \nfamilies are likely to spend every dollar they get quickly. This spurs \ndemand which, in turn, helps rebuild the economy.\n  We cannot glibly assume that all actions we could take here would be \nequally stimulative. Not all tax cuts are created equal. Not all \nspending is equally stimulative, either.\n  A lot depends on when the provision takes effect. A provision that \ntakes effect in 2006 will likely provide less stimulus than one that \ngets money into the system this year or next.\n  Much also depends on who receives the benefit. A provision that gets \nmoney into the hands of working and lower-income families--people who \nspend more of what they have, and spend it quickly--will be more \nstimulative than a provision that transfers money to elites who would \nsave more of it.\n  Comparing various options for stimulus, a study by Economy.com \nconcluded that extension of the Temporary Emergency Unemployment \nCompensation program would provide the most effective stimulus of the \noptions they studied. They concluded that ever dollar in these \nunemployment benefits generated an estimated $1.73 in demand in the \nyear ahead.\n  In contrast, they estimated that cutting dividend rates and \naccelerating 2006 rate cuts both would generate less than a dollar's \nworth of demand in the year ahead for each dollar spent. So, in terms \nof stimulus, some policy options are better than others, and \nunemployment insurance would be among the best.\n  Finally, the Finance Committee improved the President's proposal by \nadopting a series of small but important provisions that will make \npeople's lives better.\n  For example, the committee adopted an amendment that Senators Hatch \nand Lincoln and I offered to significantly simplify tax return filing \nfor millions of taxpayers. This provision reconciles the five varying \nchild definitions into a single definition for a ``qualifying child.'' \nIt is time for us to stop talking about simplification. It is time for \nus to do something about simplification. This amendment will at least \nmake it so that we have just one definition of who is a child for \npurposes of claiming a tax benefit.\n  Another useful improvement that the committee made to the President's \nproposal was in repealing the special occupational tax relating to \nalcoholic beverages. This provision will give much-needed relief and \nfairness to hundreds of thousands of small businesses.\n  Because this tax is levied on a per-location basis, a sole \nproprietorship must pay the same amount as one of the Nation's largest \nretailers. Locally owned chains pay as much as, if not more than, the \nNation's largest single-site brewery. That is not fair, and this change \nwill help.\n  I make all of these points with the recognition that our differences \nare not as large as what we have in common. We agree broadly that we \nneed to help create jobs and get the economy moving. We in the Senate \nshould take the steps needed to address these goals.\n  The economic times that face us call us to govern. We should avoid \npolitical point scoring. We must pass legislation to improve the lives \nof the people we represent.\n  Each of us was sent here by the people of our States. They sent us \nhere not to make speeches, not to win debates; they sent us here to \nmake life better. In these difficult times, they sent us here to help \ncreate jobs, to rebuild the economy. We have a duty to respond to the \ntimes, not the politics. We have a duty to do the people's work.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am glad we have begun this debate to do \nsomething that is necessary to help solve a problem we have in this \ncountry. Clearly, there will be differences in our views as to how we \ndo this, and I guess that is no surprise. I think most all of us agree \nsomething has to be done to help our economy. We do not agree on what \nis the best way to do that, of course. There are pretty general \ndifferences in how it ought to be resolved.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle are more interested in \nsending out money on a short-term basis, sending checks to a bunch of \npeople for 1 year; whereas we on this side are trying to find ways to \ncreate jobs, ways to change the economy so there is a future of \nprosperity rather than some kind of a Band-Aid that will surely wear \nout at the end of a year. So it is difficult, of course, and I \nunderstand that. But I do believe there is a clear difference between \nhaving a plan that will do something over time or simply doing \nsomething that will have an impact next week but will not continue.\n  For example, if you are going to do something for businesses, they \nhave to have some confidence that what they are doing is going to last \nfor a while. People do not change the way they manage their business \nbecause there is going to be a 1-year kind of a change. I think that is \nso true. So you have to do something that is a little more permanent \nthan that.\n  I think we have to have a commitment to see to it that what we do, \nand what our vision is, really changes the economy--not having a Band-\nAid, not having a patch, but doing something that will cause the \neconomy, then, to have a good future for all the families in this \ncountry.\n\n  One of the differences, of course, is that our view is we need \ninvestments to create jobs, not to have a little more spending for a \nshort period of time that will not be enough to stimulate the idea of \nreinvesting, but to stimulate the economy thus creating jobs.\n  Of course, by reducing taxes you put money in people's hands over a \nperiod of time. Most people have a view as to how they plan to operate \neconomically in the future. One little burst of money does not make \nmuch of a difference in what a person does in their economic plan. We \nneed to have something that is dependable for the future. We need \nsomething that is stimulative to both the consumer sector and the \nbusiness sector. In relation to the President's proposal, I think \nparticularly in the media, benefits from dividends have been largely \ndwelt upon, which is valid, but there is a very large other sector.\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\nThe Senator from Montana talked about that. We have a consumer base and \na business base, and we need to have both of them.\n  This bill will have an impact. As a matter of fact, in the first 18 \nmonths, $144 billion is put into the economy. That is a short period of \ntime. That is a lot of dough in a short while. So that is an example of \nthe kinds of things that are in the bill. I think we need to really \nmake sure that we talk about the different items in the bill when we \ntalk about it.\n  Of course, all of us must recognize we are in an unusual situation. \nPeople go back to the late 1990s and compare that period of time to \npresent day. In the late 1990s, we had not had a turndown in the \neconomy. In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, we had not had \nSeptember 11, we had not had homeland defense, we had not had Iraq, we \nhad not had an economy that was going down for several years. Today we \nhave a different kind of situation.\n  So it is sort of interesting to me. I suppose I have tried as hard as \nanyone to be a budget balancer in this place, but I recognize you \ncannot talk about the same things under different circumstances. You \ncan talk about balanced budgets all you want--and it is something I \nsurely agree with--but when you are in a pit in terms of the economy, \nyou have to do something so the economy will grow and replace that \ndeficit. That is the whole purpose of what we are talking about.\n  We face, of course, an economic slowdown that began before the year \n2000. The events of September 11 changed our world, stopped any \nrecovery. The uncertainty of where we have been over the last several \nyears has slowed down investment. There is no question about that. Now \nwe are a little closer to the end of that, hopefully. The war and \nongoing terrorism have created a challenge.\n  We have to create an environment that spurs both short- and long-term \ngrowth. The idea that we ought to do something for just a year to help \nthe economy has been tried. It did not work. If you are a \nbusinessperson, if you are planning for your family, if you are doing \nanything long term, you have to know what you are doing is not going to \nexpire in the next 9 months. So I think that is an important idea for \nus to build on.\n  Of course, tax reductions will very quickly put money in people's \npockets--and a very broad part of the economy, as a matter of fact. \nThat will help create the confidence necessary to do some of what this \neconomy needs.\n  I disagree with those who maintain that the answer to strengthening \nour economy is to go on another Federal Government spending binge. I \nbelieve we are already spending too much. I am interested in reducing \ntaxes and changing some of the ways we do business.\n  But we are talking now about a bill that moves us in the right \ndirection, one that has innovation and inspiration for investment, \nwanting to do something that gives incentives to do that.\n  I was just in Wyoming over this past weekend talking to the Governor \nabout the economy and the vision we want for our State and our country \nand our families over time, we need to really kind of know where we are \ngoing so we can measure what we do against what we do in the interim to \nsee if we are going to get there. The governor said something about: I \nam more interested in figuring out what to do, getting on with it.\n\n  Getting on with it doesn't work unless you know where you want to go. \nThat needs to be part of the case here.\n  Today we are considering a tax relief bill that will point the \neconomy in the right direction. It is a good package. It puts money in \nthe pockets of hard-working Americans, spurs investment, builds \nconfidence in the economy, creates employment opportunities throughout \nAmerica. Employment opportunities are the key.\n  Some of the provisions include accelerating the reduction in \nindividual tax rates for everyone. As to this idea that it is just for \nthe wealthy, of course, someone who pays a great deal in taxes gets \nmore dollars out of it, but as a percentage, it is to help everyone. It \nincreases small business expensing limits. One of the real things we \ncan do is cause these small businesses to invest. It creates increased \nrelief for individuals on the minimum tax. We have these tax deductions \nall along the line. And then we say, yes, but you can't use them \nbecause we have a minimum tax. I agree with the Senator, we need to do \nsome tax changes just in the structure. Increase the child tax credit. \nWe talk about dividends.\n  There are other things that are there: provide marriage penalty \nrelief and, of course, the dividends. The dividends are not so much \nentirely just what people get out in dividends, but what it does to the \ncorporate sector in how they function, how they operate, how they will \nbe expanding, how they will create employment. These go beyond simply \nthe distribution at the moment.\n  I am particularly pleased with the provisions that benefit small \nbusinesses; namely, of course, the acceleration of the individual tax \nrates. It increases small business expensing limits. Four out of five \nbusinesses have fewer than 20 employees. Generally we are talking about \nsmall business. Small firms are responsible for 55 percent of the new \ninnovations and changes. From 1994 to 1998, nearly 11 million net jobs \nwere added to the economy. Businesses that employed fewer than 20 \nworkers created 80 percent of those jobs over that period of time.\n  It is a share of the private and nonfarm gross productive produced by \nsmall businesses which sustains stability over time. It is \napproximately 50 percent of the GDP. We need to take a long look at \nthat.\n  One of the things I think is important that we ought to talk about is \nthe taxpayers in the highest income brackets are often entrepreneurs \nand small business owners, not just high-paid executives or people \nliving off investment. Small business owners typically report their \nprofits in their individual income tax returns. So that individual \nincome tax is effectively the small business tax. When we talk about \npeople who are earning more money getting some reduction, often those \nare small businesses that will put that money back in terms of \ninvestments.\n  Small businesses frequently pay the highest marginal rate. Taxpayers \nin the highest rate currently face a marginal rate of 38.6 percent. \nAlthough they file less than 1 percent of all tax returns, these \ntaxpayers account for 16 percent of reported income, more than 31 \npercent of individual income tax payments.\n\n  Small business owners receive almost 80 percent of the tax relief \nfrom the top marginal tax rates of 35 percent. What we are seeking to \ndo is to generate those jobs in the small businesses. Particularly, I \nsuppose, in States such as Montana and Wyoming where almost all of our \nbusinesses are small, that is a crucial part of the economy. More than \n98 percent of all companies have fewer than 100 employees. This is \nwhere we ought to be really focusing.\n  We talk about the dividend exclusion, of course, the economic impact \nof it. Double taxation of corporate earnings can eat up 60 percent of \nthe profits, and the Federal tax is 35 percent at the corporate level, \nand another 38.6 percent of the remaining 65 percent at the individual \nlevel. There is something wrong with that--if you invest in a company \nand that money, before you can get it back, is taxed at that rate. That \ndoesn't, of course, include any State or local taxes. So the tax burden \non dividends could be higher than 60 percent.\n  This bill is a downpayment on ending double taxation. It is less than \nthe President asked for. It is really less than the House has in \ntheirs. But it is something that has a real impact on the future of \njobs in this country.\n  We have a real challenge before us. I know we will be involved in \nmany different views and all kinds of debate and discussion. There will \nbe a great deal of interest in sending money back to the States. There \nis quite a bit of evidence that in most States over the last few years \nspending has gone up tremendously, taxing has gone down. So there are \ngoing to have to be some changes there. In our bill we put $20 billion, \nmost of it to be designed for Medicaid. I hope, again, that we don't, \nin this effort to do something to help, increase the long-term \narrangement as to who is going to pay for these various programs. I \nhappen to be one who thinks government closer to the people is the best \nway to go and that we ought to\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\ngive the States more and more opportunity to do their own thing by \nreducing our taxes. And if they need more taxes, that is where it ought \nto be, so that it can conform to the needs of a particular State.\n  We are going to be involved. As I understand the rule, there is a 20-\nhour limit on the debate on this reconciliation bill. That is good. We \nwill need to address ourselves to a good many amendments. We talked \nabout a good many of them in our committee before we got here. They \ndeserve consideration. We should do that. All I ask is that we keep in \nmind we really ought to have a goal. That is to strengthen the economy \nin a way that extends over time; that we create opportunities rather \nthan payouts; that we have an opportunity to have a stronger economy \nfor a period of time. And that is really what it is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting Presiding Officer is pleased to \nrecognize the distinguished chart king from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I won't disappoint.\n  I would like to respond to some of the arguments my colleague from \nArizona made in his remarks because he referenced a number of matters \nwhich are mistaken. First, the Senator from Arizona said the current \nweakness in the economy is not a result of weak consumer demand. He \nthen referred to numbers last year where for a couple of quarters \nconsumer demand was good.\n  Weak consumer demand is right at the heart of the weakness of this \neconomy. Consumer demand in the first quarter of this year went up at \n1.4 percent. That is tepid. That is weak. That is right at the heart of \nthe weakness of the economy. In the last quarter of last year, consumer \ndemand went up 1.7 percent. That is right at the heart of why this \neconomy is weak. People have lost confidence, and they have lost jobs, \nand they are not buying. That is why companies aren't investing.\n  Have we missed what has occurred? Our colleague said it is a capital \nproblem, a lack of capital. That would suggest we have a lack of \ncapacity in our manufacturing. That is not what we are seeing. The \ncapacity of America is operating at 74.8 percent. That means 25 percent \nof the manufacturing capacity is idle. Why is it idle? Is it because of \na lack of investment? Absolutely not. It is idle because there is a \nlack of demand. People are not buying. If we want to give a lift to the \neconomy, we ought to strengthen consumer demand so they will buy from \nour businesses, so our businesses will have a reason to invest.\n  We know we have overcapacity in telecommunications, in computer \nchips, and in area after area. The reason we have a tremendous bubble \nin markets is because overcapacity developed.\n  That takes us to the plan before us. I believe the plan the President \nhas put before us is ineffective with respect to dealing with the \nweakness in our economy. I believe it is fiscally irresponsible, and I \nbelieve it should be defeated. I believe the President's plan will \nactually weaken the economy further because it is going to explode the \ndeficits and debt we see in this economy.\n  Finally, the proposal is unfair because it is heavily weighted to the \nwealthiest among us. One of the assertions made by my colleague from \nArizona was that our corporate taxes are very high in this country. \nThey are not. On this chart is a comparison of taxes made by the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is the \ninternational scorekeeper. This looks to the most recent year for which \nthey have full figures. For corporate income taxes as a percentage of \ngross domestic product, the average is right here, about 3\\1/4\\ \npercent. The United States is way down here on the chart. The \nsuggestion that we have the second highest taxes on corporations next \nto Japan is just not so. It is just not so.\n  The reason they come to the conclusion they do is they take our \nnominal tax rates--the tax rates that are in the law books--and forget \nto look at what actually happens when you start paying taxes: the \ndeductions, the writeoffs, the ability to reduce your tax burden from \nwhat is in the law. Certainly, we all know what the tax rates are in \nthe law. But that isn't what the corporations pay. In fact, \ncorporations pay substantially less than that because of deductions, \nexclusions, and writeoffs. So the reality is that we are a relatively \nlow cost tax jurisdiction when you compare us with other countries in \nthe world.\n  When we look at the question of stimulating the economy, I think this \ncomparison is important. On this chart is Senator Daschle's plan. Here \nis the first-year cost and the 10-year cost, compared to what is before \nus in the Senate--called the Senate Finance Committee plan--and this is \nthe House plan. You can see that in terms of stimulus, in terms of \ngiving lift to the economy now, Senator Daschle's plan is far better, \nfar stronger than the other competing plans. He has $125 billion of \nstimulus to the economy this year. The bill before us has $44 billion. \nThe bill from the House has $48 billion in the first year. So they have \nvery little lift to the economy in their plans.\n  Let's think about it logically. We have a $10.5 trillion economy, and \nthey are proposing giving a $45 billion, or $46 billion, or $48 billion \nlift--in a $10 trillion economy. Most economists say you have to at \nleast have 1 percent of gross domestic product to 1.5 percent to have \nany significant effect. They are far short of that--less than one-half \nof 1 percent. They are not going to give any meaningful lift to the \neconomy. Senator Daschle's plan is about 1\\1/4\\ percent of the gross \ndomestic product. But, in addition to that, his cost over 10 years is \nmuch less. Their cost over 10 years is much more.\n  Why is that important? Because we know we are already in record \ndeficit and we know that if we follow the President's plan, the \ndeficits are going to explode, leaving us in a totally unsustainable \nsituation.\n  Now, some have gone out and analyzed the effect on jobs of these \nvarious plans. Here is what they have found. Comparing the Democratic \nplan to the President's plan, they found that our plan gives about \ntwice as much lift to the economy in the first year as does the \nPresident's plan. In the second year, it is about twice as much lift to \nthe economy. But we do not have the negative long-term effect that the \nPresident's plan has.\n  Some people may look at this and say, What negative effect could the \nPresident's plan have long term? Well, economists have studied his \nplan--including 10 Nobel laureates in economics--and they have said the \nPresident's plan is not an economic plan, not a job growth plan; it \nwill hurt long-term economic growth; it will diminish job creation in \nthe country because it is all financed with borrowed money. The \ndeadweight of those deficits and debt is going to hurt our long-term \neconomic condition.\n  You know, it is interesting, the people hired by the White House to \nmake these determinations came to that same conclusion. This is a group \ncalled Macroeconomic Advisers, hired by the White House to do \nmacroeconomic analyses--our own budget office--and here is what they \ntold us: The President's policy will give a short-term boost before \n2004, and then it is worse than doing nothing.\n  After 2004, look at what happens to economic growth under the \nPresident's plan, according to Macroeconomic Advisers. It gives a \nshort-term boost right before the 2004 election, and then look at what \nhappens to economic growth. It plunges, and you are better off for the \nlong term having done nothing.\n  How can that be? Here is what Macroeconomic Advisers--I didn't hire \nthem, the White House did; the Congressional Budget Office hired them. \nHere is what they said, talking about the President's plan:\n\n       Initially the plan would stimulate aggregate demand by \n     raising disposable income, boosting equity values, and \n     reducing the cost of capital.\n\n  These are arguments our friends on the other side of the aisle have \nmade.\n\n       However, the tax cut also reduces national saving directly \n     while offering little new, permanent incentive for either \n     private saving or labor supply. Therefore, unless it is paid \n     for with a reduction in Federal outlays, the plan will raise \n     equilibrium real interest rates, crowd out private sector \n     investment, and eventually undermine potential gross domestic \n     product.\n\n  That is not a plan that is an economic growth plan. It is a plan that \nwill undermine long-term economic growth. It is not just economy.com \nand 10 Nobel laureates in economics, and it\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\nis not just Macroeconomic Advisers. Here is a group of 250 of the \nleading CEOs in America's Committee on Economic Development. They say \nthe current budget projections seriously understate the problem of the \ngrowing deficits. They say while slower economic growth has caused much \nof the immediate deterioration in the deficit, the deficits in later \nyears reflect our tax and spending choices. Deficits do matter. The \naging of our population compounds the problem. I think they got it \nexactly right and the President has it exactly wrong.\n  This is the chart that tells us what is happening to our budget \ndeficits. This chart shows us that the deficits are skyrocketing. In \nfact, they will be between $500 billion and $600 billion this year. We \nhave never had a budget deficit of more than $290 billion in our \ncountry's history, and we are heading for a deficit, on an operating \nbasis, of over $550 billion. That is on an operating basis.\n  To be fair, on an operating basis, I think the previous record \ndeficit was $350 billion or $360 billion. So this is by far the biggest \ndeficit, on an operating basis, we have ever had. It doesn't end \nanytime soon. The whole rest of this decade, we are running operating \ndeficits, each and every year, of over $300 billion.\n  Let's review the background of how we got here. You will recall that \n2 years ago we were told by the administration we could expect almost \n$6 trillion in surpluses--$5.6 trillion in surpluses, we were told, \nover the next 10 years. Now we see, according to the CBO, if we adopt \nthe President's tax policy and his spending policy, instead of \nsurpluses, we will have $2 trillion in deficits. That is fiscally \nirresponsible.\n  I am not talking about the short term. The Senator from Wyoming said \nyou sometimes have to run a deficit to give lift to the economy. I \nagree with that. But we are talking about never getting out of deficit, \naccording to the President's plan.\n  Take his own budget documents--and I will show them in a moment--\naccording to the President's analysis of his own plan, you never escape \nfrom deficits, and they absolutely explode as the cost of the tax cuts \nincrease at the very time the cost of the Government increases with the \nretirement of the baby boom generation.\n  Where did all that money go? Where did it go? Nearly an $8 trillion \nturn in 2 years--a turn for the worse. Where did it all go? The biggest \nchunk went to the tax cuts, those already passed and those proposed. \nThat is 36 percent of the disappearance of the surplus.\n  The second biggest reason is additional spending in response to the \nattack on this country and the war. That is 28 percent of the \ndisappearance of the surplus--increased spending for defense, increased \nspending for homeland security. Oh, no, this is not a matter of the \nDemocrats were spending money. We all supported increasing defense \nspending and increasing homeland security.\n  The third biggest reason for the disappearance of the surplus, 27 \npercent of the reason is lower revenues, not as a result of tax cuts, \nbut revenues lower than anticipated because the models predicting how \nmuch revenue we would get have simply been wrong. This is lower \nrevenue, not as a result of tax cuts. Lower revenue is the third \nbiggest part of the reason for the disappearance of the surplus. Those \ntwo together are 63 percent.\n  Only 9 percent of the disappearance of the surplus over the next 10 \nyears is because of the economic downturn.\n  Now we have record budget deficits. The surpluses are all gone, and \nwe are talking about massive deficits. What our friends on the other \nside of the aisle recommend is more tax cuts, massive tax cuts; not \njust tax cuts this year or next to give lift to the economy at a time \nof weakness, but tax cuts that go on in perpetuity.\n  They are not the tax cuts that have been advertised on television. \nThey say there is a debate between $350 billion in the Senate and $550 \nbillion in the House. That is not what the budget provides. The budget \nthat our Republican friends passed provides for $1.3 trillion of \nadditional tax cuts; $350 billion reconciled in the Senate bill, and \nanother $200 billion allowed in the conference report. Then there is \nthe part the media never talks about, another $725 billion of tax cuts \nthat are the so-called unreconciled tax cuts, which simply means they \nare not given special protection on the floor from the normal operating \nprocedures in the Senate.\n  Here we are with record deficits, and our friends propose another \n$1.3 trillion. Look, some of us are supporting tax cuts as well. I \nsupport additional tax cuts this year and next to give lift to the \neconomy now, but I do not support running massive deficits that are \nonly made deeper and more serious by tax cuts that have effect 5 years \nfrom now, 8 years from now, 10 years from now, and 15 years from now. \nIt does not make any sense.\n  When I say we are faced with $2 trillion of deficits in the next 10 \nyears according to the Congressional Budget Office, others say the \ndeficits are going to be much more serious than that. Goldman-Sachs, a \nvery distinguished private investment firm, has done an analysis. It \nsays: No, the deficits are not going to be $2 trillion over the next 10 \nyears; they are going to be $4 trillion. In fact, they are going to be \n$4.2 trillion when they do their estimates of where things are headed.\n\n  To buttress their idea, if we just look at the first 7 months of this \nyear and the revenue that is coming in, what we see is it is $100 \nbillion below the forecast. The forecast that was made just 7 months \nago is proving to be all wrong. The revenue is running $100 billion \nbelow the forecast.\n  If that trend continues this year, we are going to have the lowest \nrevenue to the Federal Government since 1959. When revenue was at a \nhigh percentage of the gross domestic product, the President said: You \nhave to cut taxes; you are getting too much revenue; people are being \novertaxed. So we did cut taxes. We cut them dramatically in 2001. Now \nwe are headed for a circumstance in which the revenues are going to be \nthe least since 1959, and the President's answer is cut taxes some \nmore.\n  Again, I would support tax cuts and additional spending to give \nstimulus to the economy now. And yes, spending stimulates just like tax \ncuts do. In fact, they are probably a little better because at least \nsome part of tax cuts get saved and do not get into the economy and do \nnot stimulate the economy.\n  I would support a balanced package. I would certainly support \nadditional tax cuts now to give lift to the economy now. Remember, very \nlittle of the President's proposal is effective now. Very little of the \nproposal before us is effective now. About 5 percent of the President's \nplan is effective this year. Ninety-five percent is off in the future. \nIt makes no earthly sense. He is giving tax cuts when he is forecasting \nthe economy to be strong. He is giving tax cuts when he is forecasting \nmassive deficits. He is giving tax cuts right on the eve of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation when the cost of the Federal \nGovernment is going to explode.\n  Two years ago, the President told us: Adopt my plan and we will pay \noff virtually all the debt. That turned out to be wrong, too. This \nyear, we have had $6.7 trillion of gross Federal debt. Now the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us if we adopt the President's plan, \n10 years from now we will have $12 trillion of debt. The debt is going \nto almost double and at the worst possible time because the baby boom \ngeneration is going to start to retire.\n  I think the juxtaposition of all this is really odd. Maybe that is \nthe best word to put to it. The President is asking for a massive tax \ncut when we already have record budget deficits, and at the very time \nour Republican colleagues are asking for the biggest increase in our \ndebt in the history of the country. They are asking for a $984 billion \nincrease in the debt. The largest increase we have ever had was in the \nPresident's father's administration when the debt was increased at one \nfell swoop by $915 billion.\n  The President today said to the American people: This money is not \nthe Government's money, it is your money, and you ought to get it back. \nI agree with the President absolutely. The money that comes to the \nFederal Government is the people's money. He is absolutely right. But \nthis debt is the people's debt. Social Security is the people's Social \nSecurity. Medicare is the people's Medicare.\n  Make no mistake about it, we the people are on the hook for this \ndebt.\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\nWhen the President says, when we are already running record deficits, \ncut the revenue some more and increase spending--remember, the \nPresident's budget plan was not cut taxes and cut spending. The \nPresident's budget plan was to increase spending and to cut taxes, even \nwhen we have record deficits. The result is a massive explosion of \ndebt, and it is the people's debt, make no mistake about that. In the \nfuture, when they come around to start to retire this debt, it is all \nof us who are going to be on the hook.\n  Maybe it is not going to be us. Maybe it is going to be our kids. \nMaybe that is the idea. Let us give ourselves big tax cuts. I would be \na big beneficiary of those tax cuts.\n  I would get thousands of dollars of tax relief under this plan. I do \nnot think it is right to give me a big tax cut now and shuffle it off \nto my kids and everybody else's kids. That is what is happening. That \nis, again, not my estimate of what is happening. This is from the \nPresident's own budget document. This is his long-term outlook of what \nhappens if we adopt his plan. This is on page 43 of his analytical \nperspectives, and it shows the deficits now which, remember, these are \nrecord deficits. They look small on this chart because that is in \ncomparison to what is to come. This is in percentage of GDP terms. This \nis not in dollar terms. So this is an apples-to-apples comparison.\n  Look what is going to happen if we adopt the President's spending and \ntax cut plan. The deficits explode, according to his own analysis of \nhis own plan. It is not surprising why that is the case. This is the \nchart that tells it all. The blue bars are the Medicare trust fund. The \ngreen bars are the Social Security trust fund. The red bars are the tax \ncuts. What it shows is right now the trust funds are running big \nsurpluses in anticipation of the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. But instead of using that money to pay down debt or prepay \nthe liability, we are taking it and using it to pay for tax cuts.\n  What happens when those trust funds go cash negative when the baby \nboomers retire? Under the President's plan, at the very time the trust \nfunds go cash negative, the cost of the tax cuts explode. Does this \nmake sense? Is this really an economic growth plan? We are not talking \nabout tax cuts now to give a lift to the economy when it is weak. We \nare talking about tax cuts that explode 10 and 15 years from now at the \nvery time the expenses of the Federal Government explode because of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation.\n  Some are saying, well, deficits really do not matter. We do not need \nto worry about deficits anymore. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard thinks deficits matter. This is what he said to the Senate \nBanking Committee:\n\n       There is no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy, unless \n     attended.\n\n  He is exactly right. Deficits do matter. They always have. When \nChairman Greenspan looks at this tax cut, here is what he says: Without \nspending reductions, they could be damaging to the economy.\n  With a large deficit, Mr. Greenspan said, you will be significantly \nundercutting the benefits that would be achieved from the tax cuts.\n  Not only is this time--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. One additional minute on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I conclude by saying not only is this plan \nineffective in terms of giving lift to the economy and irresponsible in \nterms of the exploding deficits and debt, but it is also unfair. It is \nunfair because it overwhelmingly gives the greatest benefit to the \nwealthiest among us.\n\n  The effect of this plan on people earning over $1 million in 2003 is \nthis: They will get a $64,000 tax cut on average. That is for those \nearning incomes of over $1 million. Those who are in the middle of the \nwage distribution in our country will get a tax cut of $233.\n  We heard earlier that this thing has tremendous benefits to the \nelderly. Well, it certainly does. It has tremendous benefits to those \nwho are wealthy who are elderly. Elderly earning more than $500,000 a \nyear would get a $24,000 tax break.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional minute requested by the Senator \nhas expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. The same on the other side, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I conclude by saying that if one is elderly and earns \nless than $50,000 a year, they will get a $90 tax reduction. If they \nare elderly and earn more than $500,000, they get a $24,000 tax \nreduction. That is not my idea of fair. That is not my idea of being \neffective for economic growth, and it is ultimately self-defeating \nbecause the plan is all financed by borrowed money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional 30 seconds requested by the \ndistinguished Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. REID. When and if we complete the morning business--which I \nunderstand there is a minute and a half remaining; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID.

What would be the order following the majority using its 11 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to comment on the \nunfortunate and untimely passing this Friday evening of a great \nAmerican, a former colleague of many of us in this body, the former \ndistinguished Senator from my State of Louisiana, Senator Russell Long.\n  Someone once observed that ``the greatest truths are the simplest, \nand so are the greatest men.'' This, indeed, was Russell Long, a simple \nman who loved his family, his God, his country, and our State of \nLouisiana. He was a man who always answered the call of duty and who, \nto quote Russell, always ``did the best he could as God gave him the \nlight to see.''\n  Russell Long was my colleague. He was my partner in the Congress, he \nwas my teacher, and he was also my friend.\n  Russell Long was a Senator in the last century, but his vision, his \nideas, and his views on how a government should work will last as long \nas history is recorded.\n  I do not think it is an insult to say that Russell Long was a simple \nman who achieved greatness by answering the call of duty. Knowing him \nas I did--and many of us did--I believe he would proudly accept that \ndescription.\n  As a boy of only 16, Russell watched as his father died from an \nassassin's bullet and then dutifully accepted the call to fulfill and \ncomplete his father's unfinished work. Anyone who knew Russell \nunderstood how much he loved his dad and how much his father's legacy \nmeant to him.\n  Some might have regarded that legacy as an awesome and unwelcome \nburden. Russell, himself, sometimes strained under the weight of high \nexpectations and the harsh reviews that historians and journalists \nwrote about his father. But he never forgot that he was Huey Long's \nson. And, so, he dutifully dedicated his life to the work his father \nhad started. The result, as we all know, was the body of law that \ncreated employee stock ownership plans. Those of us who knew him \nunderstood that this was Russell's most passionate work and, to him, a \nmodern version of Huey's ``Share Our Wealth'' program. Just as his \nfather was a champion for the poor and dispossessed, so did Russell \nbecome one of the most effective advocates of the notion that every \nAmerican has a right to share in the great wealth and opportunity of \nthe United States.\n  Just as he answered the call of duty when it came to his family \nlegacy, Russell also answered the call of duty when it came to serving \nhis country. In 1942, during the darkest hours of the Second World War, \nRussell volunteered to serve his Nation in the Navy. During the war, he \ndistinguished himself in battle as the commander of a landing craft in \nthe Mediterranean Sea during the Allied invasions of North Africa, \nSicily, Italy and Southern France. Russell Long was truly among our \ngreatest generation--a man of courage valor, faith and compassion--a \npatriot and a true American hero.\n  Russell answered the call of duty to his country in other ways. In \n1948, when Senator John Overton died, Russell followed his father and \nmother into the U.S. Senate. He was sworn into office alongside other \nmen elected that year--giants such as Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, \nRobert Kerr, and Paul Douglas. In a body that had disdained his father, \nRussell--he was only 30 years old at the time--began a remarkable 38-\nyear career during which he worked tirelessly and effectively on behalf \nof the poor, the elderly, and average Americans who wanted a chance to \nachieve the American dream.\n  As there are 100 Senators, there are 100 Russell Long stories, from \nUncle Earl to his father Huey, to Russell's theory of fair taxation \nsummarized in his immortal words, ``Don't tax you, don't tax me, tax \nthat fellow behind the tree.''\n  Were I to list Russell's legislative achievements, we would be here \nall afternoon. But I don't think it is an overstatement to say that few \npeople in our Nation's history have had more of an impact on our \nNation's laws than Russell Long. Tens of millions of elderly people \nhave literally been saved by Medicare--the health care system that \nRussell and Lyndon Johnson crafted and enacted in the Senate in 1965. \nMillions more handicapped people today have a better quality of life \nbecause Russell Long thought it important to expand the Social Security \nsystem to include the disabled. That happened in 1956 and it was the \nfirst major expansion of the Social Security system--and it would not \nhave happened if not for Russell's tenacity in seeing it through to \npassage.\n  Millions of poor working Americans today have Russell Long to thank \nfor the Earned Income Tax Credit, an idea he developed and passed into \nlaw in the early 1970s. Then and now, the EITC remains the cornerstone \nof our Nation's effort to give the working poor a better chance at a \ndecent standard of living.\n  Russell also cared deeply about our American system of government \nand, in the wake of the Watergate scandals, worried that Americans \nmight lose faith in the system he had fought--literally fought--to \nprotect. For that reason, he pushed through legislation to change the \nway that we finance Presidential campaigns and established the tax form \ncheck-off that has guaranteed the integrity of our Presidential \nelections for more than a quarter century.\n  During my 14 years in the House, I had watched Russell closely. I \nadmired him, learned from him, and felt privileged to say that I had \nserved with him in the Congress. And I remember how excited I was when \nRussell finally realized that I was a congressman and not a young staff \nmember.\n  But it has been my service on the Senate Finance Committee--the \ncommittee he chaired for 14 years--that has taught me so much about the \ngenius and skill of the man who dominated the Senate for so many years. \nIt was because of men such as Russell that the Senate worked so well \nduring the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\n  With Russell, his colleagues were neither Republican nor Democrat. \nThey were just Americans who he considered his friends and colleagues \nin the Senate who were elected--as he looked at his life--to make \nGovernment work for the people we represent.\n  On a personal level, Lois and I will always remember Russell Long as \na kind, decent, generous man who welcomed us into his life and invited \nus to share in a cause greater than ourselves. Carolyn was the love of \nhis life, a gracious and charming lady, who became his partner in every \nway and is still known in Washington and Louisiana as one of the best \nand talented partners a public official could ever have. To Carolyn, \nKay and Pam, I know I speak for Russell's colleagues in the Senate and \nfor the people of this State when I say how grateful we are for the \nlife of this simple man who dutifully answered the call to greatness.\n  So today we gather in sorrow because we have lost a friend, but let \nus all be thankful for having been here when Russell Long was here. May \nthe Good Lord take him into his hands and welcome him into the Kingdom \nof Heaven.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6023-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6023-S6024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRATULATIONS TO KELO-TV ON 50 YEARS OF SUCCESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in 1953, Joe L. Floyd opened the doors of \nSouth Dakota's first television station, and began his mission to \nprovide television programming to even the most remote areas of our \nState. Since then, South Dakotans have had the comfort of knowing there \nwas somewhere they could turn to obtain critical local information and \nprogramming. Through tornados and blizzards, KELO-TV has been there. \nToday, I come to the floor of the Senate to congratulate KELO on its \n50th anniversary.\n  Providing television coverage to a rural State like South Dakota is \nno small challenge. The severe weather and vast distances make it \ndifficult to get the airwaves into the homes of viewers, let alone to \nprovide them with\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\nhigh-quality broadcasting and information in the manner KELO has over \nthe years. In fact, after several towers were lost, many dubbed \nKELOLAND to be the Bermuda triangle of television towers. To KELO's \ncredit, these setbacks never kept the station off the air for long, as \ntheir engineers scrambled around the clock to get the station up and \nrunning again quickly.\n  Despite the fact that KELO does not service any major metropolitan \nareas, it has always tried to take advantage of the most cutting-edge \ntechnologies that would allow them to offer the best local broadcasting \nto its viewers. Some of the station's technological highlights include: \nIn 1955, KELO broadcast the first live local news broadcasts from the \nsecond floor of the Hollywood Theater Building. In 1957, KELO aired a \ngame between Sioux Falls Cathedral and Marty Mission--the first live \nbroadcast of a sports competition in South Dakota. In 1968, KELOLAND TV \nwas the first station in the area to air the local news and programming \nin color. In 1991, KELOLAND TV was the first local station to bring \nclosed-captioning of newscasts and many other programs to the deaf and \nhearing-impaired community. In 1997, KELO installed the first local \nDoppler weather radar report that allowed residents to have the most \nup-to-date information on the rapidly developing storms and severe \nweather conditions for which South Dakota is famous. Finally, this \nyear, KELOLAND brought digital programming to the area.\n  KELO's commitment to its viewers has also been recognized nationally. \nIn 2000, KELO's commitment to public service was rewarded with an Emmy \nin the Public Service Announcement--Campaign category. In 1999, KELO \nearned the ``Friend in Need'' Service to America Award from The \nNational Association of Broadcasters (NAB) for its outstanding coverage \nof the devastating tornado that struck the town of Spencer, South \nDakota. Not only did KELO provide award-winning coverage of this \ndevastating tornado, the station also helped raise more than $1 million \nfor the Spencer Tornado Relief Fund.\n  Most importantly, KELO has shown a sustained commitment to providing \nSouth Dakotans with the critical information they need about their \ncommunities. Whether it is news, weather or sports, local viewers have \nalways been able to turn to KELO for accurate information.\n  I am proud to say that my staff and I currently enjoy a great working \nrelationship with those who work at KELO. We know that we can always \ncome to expect a fair and balanced approach to coverage of the issues \nand stories in which we are involved. Given KELO's history of honest \nand intelligent reporting, its viewers expect nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6024-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CBO REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

GUKEISEN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to CWO Hans \nN. Gukeisen, a South Dakotan who was killed on May 9 while serving in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Gukeisen was a member of the 571st Medical \nCompany and was stationed at Fort Carson, CO. He was killed when the \nBlack Hawk helicopter he was copiloting crashed near Tikrit. Hans was \non a mission to evacuate an Iraqi child who had suffered serious \ninjuries in an explosion.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Gukeisen had joined the military in 1989 after \ngraduating from Lead High School in Lead, SD. Although he left the \nmilitary for a short time, he had continued his service by joining the \nSouth Dakota National Guard. To pursue his dream of becoming a \nhelicopter pilot, Hans had re-enlisted in the Army and was assigned to \nthe air ambulance of the 571st Medical Company.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Gukeisen's mother Margaret lives in Hill City, \nSD, and his father Terry in Lead. Hans' older brother Ray is also \nserving in the military as a Special Forces instructor at Fort Bragg. I \nknow they, and everyone who knew Hans, will miss him deeply. Hans gave \nhis life while helping defend America's liberty, freeing the Iraqi \npeople, and, specifically in this mission, trying to save the life of a \nbadly injured child.\n  Margaret has said she will remember her son as someone who loved \nhunting and fishing. These are common pastimes for a boy growing up in \nSouth Dakota. But I know the Gukeisen family, and the entire State of \nSouth Dakota, will also remember Hans as a hero who died while proudly \nserving his country.\n  Mr. President, I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my \nsympathies to the family of Chief Warrant Officer Gukeisen. I know that \nhe will always be missed, but his service to our Nation will never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6024-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6024-S6025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORT FOR NATO ENLARGEMENT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, when NATO formed in 1949, the world had \nbeen liberated from the grips of Hitler and the Japanese. But, the rise \nof communism and the Soviet Union brought new threats and the fear of \nnuclear war. NATO was created with vision and vigor to combat, through \npolitical and military means, the spread of communism. NATO has \nsucceeded.\n  Today, the Soviets are gone, and a partnership between Russia and \nNATO is growing. Still, freedom-loving societies have been threatened \nanew by state and non-state supported terrorists looking to achieve \ntheir destructive aims through the spread of WMD.\n  The question looms whether NATO will address these new threats or be \npushed to the side because it was unable to transform when the cold war \nended. Some have said NATO's mission ended when the Berlin Wall fell. \nSome have even said NATO is dead. Well, I do not think NATO is dead. \nNow is the time to recommit ourselves to NATO to ensure that the \nworld's greatest alliance for peace perseveres and is improved to \nremain strong for another 50 years. To do so, NATO must adapt its \nmission to deal with today's threats. NATO members must commit to a \ncommon defense with both policy and budgetary commitments that improve \ninteroperability and reduce the capabilities gap between the U.S. and \nother members. As NATO's largest and most powerful member, the United \nStates and her leaders in the Senate stand ready to strengthen NATO and \nrepair recently strained relationships amongst NATO members. We must do \nso, and we must take the first step by supporting NATO enlargement and \nthe admission of seven new members: Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, \nSlovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n  NATO expansion makes strategic sense because expansion creates a \nunited Europe. The addition of the seven aspirants creates a land \nbridge forming a contiguous alliance on the European Continent. Now, \nWestern Europe from the Atlantic will be connected with its allies in \nGreece and Turkey on the Mediterranean and Black Sea. With the \nPartnership for Peace, NATO spreads across three continents. Bitter \nenemies just 13 years ago are now reliable allies.\n  NATO membership is a carrot to political and economic reform to all \nnations wishing to join the alliance. Again, just 13 years ago, the \nseven proposed new members of NATO were under the darkness and weight \nof the Iron Curtain. Today, they are burgeoning democracies committed \nto market economics. To be in NATO, a democratic form of governance is \nneeded. Spain, Greece, and Portugal undertook political reforms to gain \nNATO approval, and the same is true today for the seven countries \ncurrently seeking NATO admission.\n  The seven new members are ready to actively participate and \ncontribute to a robust NATO. In fact they are already doing so. I would \nlike to cite Romania as one example. Romania has undertaken major \npolitical and economic reforms. Romania overthrew Nicolae Ceausescu--a \nruthless and oppressive totalitarian leader. Since being unshackled, \nRomania has celebrated its freedom. Romania has held four nationwide \nelections, and democracy is blossoming.\n  Romania is also committed to the defense of the members of the NATO \nalliance, both in Europe and the U.S. Some have questioned what the \nseven new members can bring to the table to\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\nbenefit NATO. We need not question whether Romania will be a positive \nforce within NATO. Romania has risked the lives of its soldiers for the \nbenefit of the United States.\n  Participation in Operation Desert Storm--Romania contributed a \nmilitary hospital company to the Allied Forces.\n  Participation in Afghanistan--Romania used its own airlift, a C-130, \nto transport a battalion of soldiers to Afghanistan. These forces have \nmade two rotations. Romania is currently involved in the peacekeeping \nmission in Afghanistan.\n  Operation Iraqi Freedom--Romania mobilized its military police and a \nnuclear, biological, chemical detection team to work alongside U.S. \nforces in Iraq.\n  Currently 5,000 U.S. marines are based at Constanza, Romania. Our \nstrategic threats are different today than they were 50 years ago. We \nare no longer endangered by Russia. Today, the greatest threat to NATO \nand its members is the threat of terrorism and the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction. As a result, the U.S. should consider whether it \nwould be wise to reconfigure our forces overseas.\n  Our new threats are coming from the Middle East and southwest Asia. \nRomania and Bulgaria are halfway between Germany and the Middle East. \nMoving bases closer to the threat will allow the U.S. to mobilize \nfaster and get to the fight sooner. We would also be welcome in Romania \nand Bulgaria. There is some question whether we are still welcome in \nWestern Europe.\n  There are those who say NATO is dead or has no modern mission. That \nis simply not the case. The Soviet Union may no longer be a threat, but \nthreats still exist. The end of the cold war may have erased the notion \nof warfighting where million-man armies face million-man armies on the \nEuropean Continent. But, the end of the cold war unleashed despots \nwilling to use the asymmetrical means of terrorism and WMD \nproliferation as methods of aggression and diplomatic blackmail.\n  NATO must adopt a new mission--combating terrorism and WMD \nproliferation both in Europe and globally. The threats that emerged \nfrom September 11 do not only affect the United States, these threats \nshould be a concern to the entire NATO community. As we have seen, al-\nQaeda cells were active in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy.\n  International terrorism on our shores was unknown to Americans prior \nto September 11. However, it was not uncommon in Europe. The other NATO \nmembers should unite behind America's interests to root out terrorism \nand stop WMD proliferation because the European members have been \ntargets before and could be targets, again. This will require NATO to \nlook not only within its borders, but NATO must also look beyond its \nborders. NATO members and Partnership for Peace participants stretch \nfrom the Pacific Ocean in the U.S. to bordering on China in Kazakhstan. \nThere are several countries just on the edges of NATO's borders who \nwish to terrorize those countries within NATO.\n  NATO has made a pledge to combat terrorism and WMD proliferation. The \npromise made by the NATO heads of state at the Prague summit to focus \non terrorism and WMD proliferation is encouraging. Now, we need action. \nWe should not let recent spats with France and Germany obstruct the \nimplementation of this new mission. Moreover, France and Germany should \nnot let their disagreements with the U.S. obstruct this new mission. \nSuch actions benefit none.\n  For NATO to remain relevant, the European members must close the \ncapabilities gap between U.S. and European forces. Many NATO members, \nincluding France and Germany, have reduced defense spending over the \nlast decade. Such reductions leave the alliance vulnerable and make it \ndifficult for NATO members to participate in operations with the U.S.\n  U.S. defense spending is dwarfing European defense spending. \nAmerica's defense budget is greater than all other 18 NATO members \ncombined. The $48 billion dollar increase in U.S. defense spending from \nfiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003 is greater than what 12 of the \nother 18 members spend on defense.\n  Europe's leaders are world leaders. NATO members must make a greater \ninvestment in national security, NATO's longevity, and world security. \nWe do not need them to spend as much as the U.S.; we need them to \ncomplement the U.S. and add value to NATO operations.\n  NATO should focus its spending on interoperability and communications \nimprovements. The U.S. has committed billions to making it so all four \nbranches of the military can be linked using the same communications \ndevices. We are dedicated to interoperability within our own forces. It \nhas not been easy and the job is not finished, but we have seen the \nfruits of this effort in Iraq and Afghanistan. Who would have imagined \nyears ago that a B-52 pilot could talk with a Special Operations team \non the ground to deliver close air support? This was possible because \nof interoperability.\n  NATO must focus on such interoperability. Not only must we ensure \nthat a European tanker plane can refuel a U.S. fighter. We must ensure \nthat 26 members, who speak many different languages, can share a common \ncommunications network and operate as one cohesive force, not 26 \nindependent militaries. If this gap is not closed, no value will be \nadded and we will have to question NATO's worth.\n  NATO must not be just an alliance based on military strength. NATO \nmust be a diplomatic alliance. Military might alone is not the \nsolution. First, we must use all diplomatic means to achieve peace. The \nunited strength of NATO as a diplomatic force will also increase the \nsecurity of NATO's members.\n  In the near future, NATO must make decisions to determine whether it \nwill be a vibrant alliance capable of protecting its members in the \n21st century or whether it is a relic of the past. I know it can have a \nmeaningful mission in the future--a mission focused on rooting out \nterrorism and stopping the spread of WMD. To do so, NATO members must \nincrease defense spending and focus on modernization and \ninteroperability. I am confident NATO's members want NATO to have a \ngreat role in shaping the 21st century. As a member of NATO, the U.S. \nshould push for a strong alliance. By expanding NATO to include seven \nnew members, we will take a key step in making NATO strong and viable \nfor the 21st century. The Senate sent a strong message of support by \napproving the admission of Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, \nEstonia, Slovenia, and Slovakia to NATO. The vote is good for the \nsafety of the U.S., Europe, and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6025-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 12, \n2001, in Bridgeport, CT. A Brazilian waiter was attacked on the street \nby eight men who verbally accosted him because they believed him to be \nof Arab descent. The man was also physically attacked by the group and \nsuffered a broken arm and several facial bruises.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6025-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6025-S6026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ROSALIE ASLESEN RETIRES FROM SPEARFISH HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor Rosalie Aslesen on the occasion of her retirement as school \nlibrarian for Spearfish High School in Spearfish, SD.\n  A native of Spearfish, Rosalie graduated from Spearfish High School \nand received her bachelor of arts degree in theatre arts from Black \nHills State University in Spearfish. After graduation, she served as a \nRed Cross volunteer, assisting troops in Korea in the 1960s, spending \ntime living in Hawaii, Virginia, and Maryland before returning for a \nbrief time to Spearfish. She\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\nreturned to Hawaii and obtained a master's degree in library science, \nbefore moving back to Spearfish with her husband Herb to take a job at \nSpearfish High School, where she has served as librarian since 1979.\n  Rosalie has earned the respect and admiration of all those who had \nthe opportunity to work with her. Her friendly demeanor and wealth of \nknowledge helped her develop close friendships with various colleagues \nand students. In Rosalie's honor, her brother, William Vance, has \ndonated an extensive collection of Library of America books to \nSpearfish High School. As a symbol of Rosalie's dedication to young \npeople, these books will help educate future generations of young \nAmericans.\n  Over the years, Rosalie has committed herself to helping Spearfish \nstudents learn more about their heritage and culture, about themselves \nand the world around them. She has worked hard to help students find \nthe best in themselves. Thousands of students over the years have \nbenefited from Rosalie's commitment to education and to the library \nsciences. From assisting students with research options for papers, to \nfinding intricate details about the history of our world, Rosalie has \nserved as a ``human bookmark'' in the book of life for countless young \nadults.\n  On the occasion of her retirement, I want to congratulate Rosalie \nAslesen for her tireless dedication to Spearfish High School and her \ncommitment to quality education. I also want to commend her for her \nvaluable service to the community over the years. She has been very \nactive in the United Church of Christ, has served on the board of the \nSouth Dakota Education Association, and has spent many years in the \nSpearfish Education Association, including the past 2 years as \npresident. The lives of countless people have been enormously enhanced \nby Rosalie's service to South Dakota and her profession.

COBB, JR., U.S. NAVY\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize one of the \nfinest officers in the United States Navy, RADM William ``Bill'' Cobb, \non the occasion of his retirement on May 15, 2003. Admiral Cobb will \nleave his current job as Program Executive Officers Ships after over 37 \nyears of faithful and dedicated service to the Navy and our great \nNation. During his time in Washington, he engaged the Congress on \nnumerous issues vital to our national security. Today, it is my \npleasure to recognize some of Bill's many accomplishments and commend \nhim and his family for their service to the Navy and our Nation.\n  Admiral Cobb entered military service in 1968 after receiving a \nBachelor of Science degree in Engineering from the United States Naval \nAcademy. He continued his education at the Naval Post Graduate School \nwhere he earned a Master's Degree in Operations Research in 1975. \nAdmiral Cobb also attended the National Defense University's Industrial \nCollege of the Armed Forces, ICAF, in 1990; the Defense Systems \nManagement College in 1992; the Executive Program, University of \nMichigan, Graduate Business School in 1994; and the Senior Executive \nProgram in National and International Security at Harvard University in \n2001.\n  As Executive Officer aboard USS Jouett, CG 29, Admiral Cobb shined as \na leader. Even though Jouett started out last in every competitive \ncategory, Admiral Cobb's ability to motivate all levels of the chain-\nof-command catapulted the ship to the fleet's number one combatant in \nbattle readiness. He later assumed duties as Commanding Office of USS \nCoontz, DDG 37, where his ship provided the initial response to a \ndistress call after USS Stark was struck by an errant Iraqi cruise \nmissile. During his tour as Commander of Naval Surface Warfare Center, \nIndian Head, Naval Ordnance Command, and Commander Naval Surface \nWarfare Center, NSWC, he was responsible for all of the Navy's In-\nService Engineering Agents, ISEA.\n  Admiral Cobb also excelled in a variety of key staff assignments \nincluding Chief of Staff and Head, Fleet Introduction and Lifetime \nSupport Division, AEGIS Program Office; a tour in the Office of the \nChief of Naval Operations as Head Readiness Sustainability Team, OP \n09O; and Chief, Cruise Missile Division, Plans and Policy Directorate, \nCommander Atlantic Fleet, where he planned all of the Tomahawk strikes \nfor Desert Storm. As Program Executive Officer for Theater Surface \nCombatants, PEO TSC, he was responsible for the AEGIS shipbuilding \nprogram, the Navy's Theater Ballistic Missile Defense, TBMD, program, \nand introduction of the Cooperative Engagement Capability, CEC. On the \ninternational front, he headed shipbuilding programs with Spain and \nJapan, and worked with thirteen of our closest allies on the Standard \nMissile program. His tremendous effort significantly enhanced our \nallied forces' defenses against the growing tactical ballistic missile \nthreat. Admiral Cobb was also responsible for the life-cycle support of \nseveral ship classes including Ticonderoga Cruisers, Arleigh Burke \nGuided Missile Destroyers, Spruance Destroyers and Oliver Hazard Perry \nFrigates.\n  In conjunction with the Secretary of the Navy's reorganization \nefforts, Admiral Cobb took on the significant task of reorganizing \nthree major Program Offices into one. Program Executive Officer, PEO, \nShips now has sole responsibility for life-cycle support for all 13 \nsurface ship classes, the heart of our entire Navy. This new Program \nOffice is responsible for the execution of current and future \nshipbuilding programs that will carry the Navy well into the 21st \ncentury including the DDG 51 Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers, the LPD 17 \nSan Antonio Class Amphibious Ships, the Navy's future destroyer DD(X), \nX, and the Littoral Combat Ship, LCS. The DD(X), and LCS programs, due \nin large part to Admiral Cobb's leadership, will revolutionize our Navy \nwith the availability of more lethal and agile firepower than ever \nbefore seen in history.\n  Always an inspiration to those who served him, Admiral Cobb made it a \npoint to recognize those Officers and Sailors who transformed his \nvision of the Navy into reality. His contribution to the success of our \nNavy goes well beyond the material changes he made in the programmatic \nworld. Admiral Cobb made each sailor keenly aware of their importance \nto the Navy and the true appreciation that he held for their efforts. \nHis unique ability to recognize talent and to foster camaraderie among \nthose who served him had an enormous influence on countless junior \nsailors, and will continue to steer the course of our Navy well into \nthe future.\n  On behalf of my esteemed colleagues, I offer the sincere \ncongratulations of the United States Senate to Admiral Cobb, his wife \nKaren, son Bill II, Buddy, daughter Jeanne, and granddaughter Isabelle \non a truly magnificent career.

Mr. President, I would like to express my \nappreciation and congratulations to Captain Nicholas Perugini of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, Commissioned \nCorps on the occasion of his retirement. For more than 26 years, \nCaptain Perugini has dedicated himself to the protection of our \nNation's oceans and maritime commerce through his exemplary work in \nNOAA's charting program. He has served aboard three hydrographic survey \nvessels and a shore-based field party. As commanding officer of the \nNOAA ship Rude, Nick was in charge of the survey investigation into the \ngrounding of the Queen Elizabeth 2. He was also a member of NOAA teams \nthat assisted in the recovery of the TWA flight 800 and John F. Kennedy \nJr. crash sites which occurred off the East Coast of the United States. \nCaptain Perugini's commitment and leadership during these sensitive \nprojects are an example of public service at its best. Nick \nconsistently put aside ego and personal glory to do what is best for \nthe Nation.\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\n  Captain Perugini now concludes his career as chief of NOAA's Marine \nChart Division. A direct result of his tenure as chief was a \nsignificant advancement in the longstanding partnership between NOAA \nand the Coast Guard concerning safety of navigation issues. His vision \nand leadership led to the advances of new technologies, moving paper \ncharting to the electronic world. Today, mariners know their location, \nin real time, on an electronic navigation system. This advance was not \npossible in the paper chart world.\n  With his guidance, NOAA and the Coast Guard entered into a Memorandum \nof Agreement, which pooled agency resources and greatly accelerated the \nproduction of Electronic Navigational Charts, ENC. He made the ENC data \navailable to the public free, via the internet. This relationship not \nonly saved tax dollars, but the improved navigational tools have \ngreatly increased the safety of navigation. Captain Perugini's work has \nresulted in a significant reduction in marine accidents, which has \nsaved lives, property, and our environment from degradation.\n  From July 1998 to August 1999, I was pleased to have Nick as a member \nof my congressional staff as a legislative fellow. His amazing work \nethic, interpersonal skills, commitment to the job, knowledge of \nmaritime issues, and gracious humility made him an integral part of my \noffice. I want to thank him for his work and commitment to our Nation.\n  I congratulate Captain Nicholas Perugini on his exemplary career and \nwish him, his wife Lisa, their daughter Katie, and their son Nicholas \nmy best. Through his tireless efforts, he has made a difference and has \nhelped to protect the marine environment and promote safe maritime \ncommerce that is vital to our Nation's prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6027-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO AMERICAN LEGION AUXILARY UNIT NO. 70\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \ndedication and service that the American Legion Auxiliary Unit No. 70 \nhas provided to Montana's veterans and their communities. The American \nLegion Auxiliary was formally founded in 1919 by a group of concerned \nwomen who stepped in to fill the role of the men who left home for the \nbattlefields of World War I. These women were driven to service by \ntheir compassion, by their sense of civic duty, but, most of all, they \nwere driven by their love of country.\n  In the more than eight decades since its founding, the American \nLegion Auxiliary has expanded to include hundreds of chapters in every \nstate and territory. Likewise, their original mission expanded as well \nto include helping many others in need.\n  The women of American Legion Auxiliary Unit No. 70 have been \nparticularly active in their community. They have donated funds to \nveteran's facilities and programs in Fort Harrison, Miles City, \nGlendive and Columbia Falls, MT. They are distributing more than 900 \npoppies in recognition of the service and sacrifice our veterans have \ngiven their country. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, they tied hundreds \nof yellow ribbons across Judith Gap to show their support for our \ntroops and their family members.\n  Mr. President, I thank the women of American Legion Auxiliary Unit \nNo. 70 and all the American Legion Auxiliaries for their service to our \nNation's veterans and communities. These women have not only given \ntheir time and money in service to our Nation, they have given their \nhearts as well, and that is the best thing anyone can give.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6027-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO GENERAL ELECTRIC'S APPLIANCE PARK\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to honor the workers of \nGeneral Electric's Appliance Park in Louisville, KY, for 50 years of \nhard work and quality manufacturing of appliances for the world. From \nproducing the first box car in 1953 to the wide array of products GE \nmanufactures today, generations of Kentucky workers have contributed to \nthe success of the economy at GE's Appliance Park.\n  The original idea of merging nine plants into one major facility to \nmass produce GE's consumer products was initially scrutinized and met \nwith skepticism by nay sayers. Doubters didn't think and agree that \nconsumers demanded across America and the world such a vast array and \nselection of quality products. However, the ingenuity and vision of \nGE's leadership, behind its strong and committed workforce, considered \nAmerica's growing population, rise of per capita income and social \nchanges that occurred during the 1950s as evidence that such mass \nproduction was needed and wanted by the consumer. History shows they \nwere right, and today General Electric is able to please consumers \nthrough offering an array of high quality products at an affordable \nprice.\n  I am proud to have most of the workers at General Electric's \nAppliance Park living in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. They possess \nthose core American values which have helped to made GE and this \ncountry a great success. I give great pride in calling attention to \ntheir excellence and work ethic. I know all will agree that for \ngenerations these GE Appliance Park workers ``bring good things to \nlife.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6027-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2.

A bill to promote freedom, fairness, and economic \nopportunity for families by reducing the power and reach of the Federal \nestablishment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce my \nflat tax bill, S. 1040. Although I fully support the President's plan \nfor economic growth, I believe that we can do even better. Like the \nPresident's plan, my bill eliminates the double taxation of dividends. \nHowever, instead of retaining the current progressive tax rates that \nimpede economic growth, S. 1040 creates a single rate for all \ntaxpayers--seventeen percent when the tax is fully implemented--and \ngives tax-free treatment to all savings and investment, not just \ndividends.\n  A major reason why I support the flat tax is because it will place \nmore money into the hands of hardworking Americans and will allow \nindividuals--not the government--to decide how to best spend their \nmoney. Lowering taxes gives Americans more money for a large number of \nthings such as monthly bills, insurance coverage, educational costs, \nprescription drugs, and family getaways. Lowering taxes also makes it \neasier for Americans to plan for their future through private savings. \nAlthough I strongly believe in the importance of private savings, my \nbill leaves the Social Security system intact and, in fact, provides \nseniors with more money by repealing the current tax on Social Security \nbenefits.\n  I have said many times before that our current progressive tax system \nis unfair in that it punishes success. The only way to ensure true \nfairness is to adopt a single tax rate for all taxpayers. Transitioning \nto such a tax will not only increase the fairness of the tax code, but \nit will also increase the incentives to work and thus boost economic \ngrowth.\n  The flat tax is not only fairer than the current income tax, but it's \nalso undeniably less complex. Under a flat tax, taxpayers would be able \nto fit their return on a form the size of a post card. Rather than \nspending hours pouring over convoluted IRS forms, or resorting to \nprofessional tax assistance, the flat tax allows taxpayers to determine \ntheir taxes quickly and easily. Paying taxes may never be a pleasant \nexperience, but at least under a flat tax it wouldn't be mind-boggling.\n  I fully realize that the bill I am introducing today is a monumental \nshift from the current tax code. However, we must not allow the \nenormity of the task to deter us from enacting better, more efficient \ntax laws. I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 1042. A bill for the relief of Tchisou Tho; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill for \nthe relief of Tchisou Tho be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1042\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REAFFIRMATION OF SUPPORT FOR CONVENTION ON THE \n                   PREVENTION AND PUNISHMENT OF THE CRIME OF \n                   GENOCIDE; COMMEMORATION OF ANNIVERSARY OF \n                   ENACTMENT OF GENOCIDE CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION \n                   ACT OF 1987.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1948, in the shadow of the Holocaust, the \n     international community responded to Nazi Germany's \n     methodically orchestrated acts of genocide by approving the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide, done at Paris on December 9, 1948.\n       (2) The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \n     Crime of Genocide confirms that genocide is a crime under \n     international law, defines genocide as certain acts committed \n     with intent to destroy a national, ethnical, racial, or \n     religious group, and provides that parties to the Convention \n     undertake to enact domestic legislation providing effective \n     penalties for persons who are guilty of genocide.\n       (3) The United States, under President Harry Truman, was \n     the first nation to sign the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n       (4) The United States Senate ratified the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on \n     February 19, 1986.\n       (5) The Genocide Convention Implementation Act of 1987 (the \n     Proxmire Act) (Public Law 100-606), signed into law by \n     President Ronald Reagan on November 4, 1988, enacted chapter \n     50A of title 18, United States Code, to criminalize genocide.\n       (6) The enactment of the Genocide Convention Implementation \n     Act marked a principled stand by the United States against \n     the crime of genocide and an important step toward ensuring \n     that the lessons of the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, and \n     genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda and elsewhere will be used to \n     help prevent future genocides.\n       (7) A clear consensus exists within the international \n     community against genocide, as evidenced by the fact that 133 \n     nations are party to the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n       (8) Despite this consensus, many thousands of innocent \n     people continue to fall victim to genocide, and the denials \n     of past instances of genocide continue.\n       (9) November 4, 2003, is the 15th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of \n     1987 (Proxmire Act).\n       (b) Reaffirmation of Support for Genocide Convention.--\n     Congress reaffirms its support for the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n       (c) Commemoration of Anniversary of Enactment of Genocide \n     Convention Implementation Act of 1987.--Congress acknowledges \n     and anticipates the commemorization of the 15th anniversary \n     of the enactment of the Genocide Convention Implementation \n     Act of 1987 (the Proxmire Act) on November 4, 2003.\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\n       (d) Dedication to End Genocide.--Congress encourages the \n     people and the Government of the United States to rededicate \n     themselves to the cause of ending the crime of genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6033-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICE OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

In order for the Senate to \ncomplete action on these measures, late nights and rollcall votes \nshould be expected throughout the entire week. I therefore advise my \ncolleagues to make the necessary scheduling arrangements.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield, as \nI have spoken to the distinguished assistant majority leader, we have \non our side eight Senators who are scheduled tomorrow to go to the \nfuneral of the late Senator Long.

I know the majority is aware of \nthat.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say we are aware that there are \na number of Senators going to Senator Long's funeral, and we have tried \nto craft this schedule in such a way as to accommodate those interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/12/senate-section/article/S6033-6", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
