Mr. President, I would like to again say farewell this \nmorning to a wonderful group of young men and women who have served as \nSenate pages over the last 5 months and thank them for their \ncontributions to the day-to-day operations of the Senate. This \nparticular group of pages has served with distinction, and they have \ndone a marvelous job of balancing their responsibilities to their \nstudies and to this body. Today is their final day as Senate pages.\n  I want to say thank you to Andrew Blais of Rhode Island; Katherine \nBuck of New Hampshire; Sam Cannon of Utah; Erin Chase of South Dakota; \nEric Coykendall of Arizona; Julie Cyr of Vermont; Joe Galli of Maine; \nWatson Hemrick of Tennessee; Jennifer Hirsch of Arkansas; Garrett \nJackson of Mississippi; Kara Johnson of Illinois; Ben Kappelman of \nMontana; Andrew Knox of Vermont; Adam Lathan of Alabama; Betsy Lefholz \nof South Dakota; Brittney Moraski of Michigan; Alex Ogden of North \nCarolina; Jaclyn Pfaehler of Montana; Aaron Porter of Tennessee; Ingrid \nPrice of Utah; Laura Pritchard of Virginia; Laura Refsland\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nof Wisconsin; Ryan Smith of Kentucky; Kyra Waitley of Idaho; Nathanael \nWhipple of California; and Elizabeth Wright of Montana.\n  I suspect few people understand how hard Senate pages work. On a \ntypical day, pages are in school by 6:15 a.m. After several hours of \nclasses each morning, pages then report to the Capitol to prepare the \nSenate Chamber for the day's session.\n  Throughout the day, and sometimes into the night, pages are called \nupon to perform a wide array of tasks, from obtaining copies of \ndocuments and reports for Senators to use during debate, to running \nerrands between the Capitol and the Senate office buildings, to lending \na hand at our weekly conference luncheons. Once we finish our business \nhere for the day, no matter what time, the pages return to the dorm and \nprepare for the next day's classes and Senate session and, we hope, get \nsome much-needed sleep.\n  Despite this rigorous schedule, these young people continually \ndischarge their tasks efficiently and cheerfully. In fact, as one page \nsaid, ``We like working hard. When things get hectic, that's when we \nlike it best.''\n  This page class had the good fortune to witness some historic \nmoments. They saw President Bush present the Congressional Gold Medal \nto Dorothy Height, one of the giants of the modern civil rights \nmovement in America. They were present for important debates in this \nchamber over such critical issues as the budget and the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. They have seen, and had their photos taken with, \ncelebrities, including Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Two days ago, \nthey saw another famous visitor, the actor Mike Myers, better known to \nsome as ``Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery.''\n  I hope the close-up view that these exceptional young people have had \nof the Senate at work these last few months has made this institution a \nlittle bit less of a mystery. Our Government ``of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people'' requires the active involvement of \ninformed citizens to work.\n  I understand that many, if not most, of this semester's pages have \ndecided to volunteer on political campaigns, both Republican and \nDemocratic, when they return home. I am told the campaigns run the \ngamut from local school board candidates to Senate candidates.\n  I am sure I speak for all Senators when I say, we applaud your \ncontinued involvement in the democratic process. And we wish you well \nin all that you choose to do in your future. We hope we will see some \nof you back here some day, as staffers, or as Senators. We are grateful \nfor the excellent work you have already given the Senate these past 5 \nmonths.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his \nexcellent remarks. They are timely, and I would join in them. The pages \nhave added so much to the Senate's ability to function. We appreciate \nthem. I know Adam Lathan from Alabama has been a big help to me, and \neach Senator has had pages who have helped tremendously. I think it \nappropriate we express our appreciation at this time for their superb \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/04/senate-section/article/S6470-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6470-S6479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is now quarter to 7 in Nevada. Children \nare walking on their way to school. Here in the East, children are \nalready at school. In Nevada we have a wide range of school districts. \nWe have 17 school districts, one for each county. The school district \nin Las Vegas, the Clark County School District, is approaching 300,000 \nstudents. It is one of the largest school districts in America. \nEsmeralda County, Goldfield, has 84 students. Because of the feeling I \nhave and the complaints I received about the Leave No Child Behind Act, \nI thought it appropriate that I meet with those 17 school \nsuperintendents. I did that last week when I was home during the \nMemorial Day break. Jim Hager, the superintendent from Washoe County--\nthat is Reno, which is the second largest school district--is the \npresident of the Superintendents Association. At my request he convened \nthis meeting.\n  I have had many meetings over the years, as we all have, dealing with \na broad range of subjects, but I have never had a meeting that was more \nmeaningful, more informative, more educational to me than the meeting I \nhad with the school superintendents. My only regret is I didn't spend \nmore time with them. We spent an hour and 15 minutes. That is what we \nhad scheduled. It was a tremendously good meeting.\n  I had no agenda with the superintendents other than to listen to \nthem. I didn't bring them into the room and proceed to give a Senate \nfilibuster to them. I wanted to make sure that every one of the 17, \nfrom the smallest school district to the largest, had an opportunity to \nspeak--and that is what we did.\n  Every one of the 17 has tried so hard to comply with the intent and \nthe actual substance of the Leave No Child Behind Act. They simply \nsaid, though, that in an effort to comply with this new law, they have \nrobbed Peter to pay Paul with their budgets. They have compromised on \nall kinds of very important programs within the school districts. They \nhave tampered with and eliminated art programs, programs for the \nacademically talented, athletic programs, music programs, and history \nclasses in an effort to meet the requirements of Leave No Child Behind.\n  There is no question, when I went to high school, that the courses I \ntook--English, math, and sciences--were important. I was taught those \nsubjects, of course. But also it was important that I have a full \neducation, that I have the opportunity to participate in athletics, \nthat teachers be given the opportunity to teach other subjects than \nmath, science, and English. A superintendent said they had even had to \nshorten the time allotted for recess. Some say, Good, the kids are out \ntoo much. You know, recess time is time just like the time people take \nfor coffee breaks. People take a break to get away from the drudgery, \nor even if somebody loves their job, a break is important. Children \nneed a break just like adults. They have even shortened the time \nallotted for recesses.\n  Instead of just ignoring the law, they have tried to comply with it, \nall 17 superintendents. I commend them for their unified efforts in \nthat regard. But there is only so much they can do with a law that is \nbasically flawed, a law that is flawed because there are no resources \nto fulfill the requirements of that law. One after the other, these \neducators gave examples of how the No Child Left Behind Act is leaving \nthese children behind. It is simply not reaching its goal.\n  One superintendent said: What if you, in Washington, passed a law \nthat every child, to graduate from high school, had to dunk a \nbasketball?\n  It didn't matter how hard I tried. I could never dunk a basketball. I \ncouldn't dunk the basketball when I graduated high school at age 17.\n  If they passed a law saying every child who graduated from high \nschool had to high jump 6 feet, they could not do it; if every child \nhad to run a mile in 6 minutes, they could not do it. Physically and \nemotionally, it is impossible for children to do those things.\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\nA select few can do it but not very many. But that is what we have \nrequired.\n  The Leave No Child Behind Act is based on the premise that we can \ntrack the progress of every school by using a one-size-fits-all \napproach, including standardized tests.\n  What I heard from these superintendents was their problems aren't \nstandardized. The one-size-fits-all approach doesn't always work.\n  The Clark County School District is the fastest growing school \ndistrict in the country. The New York Times published this week an \narticle on education in Las Vegas, painting a very realistic picture of \nwhat we are facing. We are in the midst of a massive program to build \n88 new schools to accommodate about 12,000 new elementary and secondary \naged students who move into the county every year. This number is going \nto increase.\n  Clark County's teacher recruitment effort spans nationwide and costs \nmore than $1 million a year--just to recruit the teachers. According to \nSuperintendent Carlos Garcia, about 2,000 were hired last year. They \nneed 1,600 more teachers, as we speak.\n  To cite one pervasive challenge that Nevada as a whole and Clark \nCounty in particular faces, the Clark County School District has 81 \ndocumented foreign language barriers--not 18. I didn't make a mistake; \n81 different languages are spoken in the Clark County School District.\n  There are so many children entering our public schools who do not \nspeak English that, under the Leave No Child Behind, most of our public \nschools will eventually be on the ``watch list'' or considered a \n``failing school.'' Like many parts of this country, we know it costs \nmore to educate these children.\n  The Leave No Child Behind Act promises that resources will be \nprovided, but we haven't kept that promise to the 17 superintendents in \nNevada--and the rest of this country. We have underfunded the Leave No \nChild Behind--not by a little but by billions and billions of dollars \nevery year. We have not kept our promise, but we still expect fourth \ngrade children who are struggling to learn English to perform well on a \ntest they can't understand.\n  I don't say this to be boastful, but I did OK in school. But if I did \nnot speak English, it would not have mattered what my mental capacity \nwas. In the fourth grade, I would have had problems with a fourth grade \ntest.\n  We haven't kept our promise. I don't think for one minute that these \nchildren are not aware they are part of a cell group causing their \nschools to fail--simply because they do not comprehend the language.\n  Superintendent Garcia told me something that certainly got my \nattention. He said: I am so tired of walking into a classroom of fourth \ngraders and seeing kids with their heads down on their desks crying \nbecause they can't read the test.\n  He said: I see children with their heads on their desks crying--not \nbecause they are stupid, not because they are dumb, but because they \ncannot understand what they are being asked to do.\n\n  As a result, not only is that child failing but the whole school \ndistrict is failing. The school that the child is in could be failing \nas a result.\n  These children are being left behind because they are forced to take \ntests in a language they can't speak, and it hasn't changed a thing. \nThey still can't dunk a basketball. Testing a child doesn't make him \nany smarter any more than weighing a steer makes that steer heavier.\n  Superintendent Garcia said the obsession with testing is actually \ncausing some children to learn because they are taking fewer lessens. \nMany high school kids are so worried about standardized tests that they \nonly want to take math. They are afraid of failing the standardized \ntests, leaving no time for other classes--sometimes even history \ncourses.\n  The distinguished junior Senator from Tennessee and I have sponsored \nlegislation talking about having American government taught in school. \nWe are not going to be able to do that.\n  Does this program we have make a child better prepared to succeed in \ncollege or in life? No.\n  I personally would have been a failing student in a failing school if \nthis law had been enacted when I was growing up.\n  I decided to go to law school because I had a part-time counselor and \nteacher by the name of Mrs. Dorothy Robinson who pulled me out of the \njunior class in high school and said: I have looked over all of your \ntests and I think you should be a lawyer. I don't know what tests I \ntook. I think she was trying to be nice to me. But I followed what she \nsuggested. From that minute forward, I said: I am going to be a lawyer. \nI had never met a lawyer, I had never been to a courthouse, and I had \nnever been involved in a court case, but because of Mrs. Robinson \nhaving confidence in me--not because of some standardized tests--I \ndecided that was what I wanted to do, even though my grammar was \natrocious. My parents were uneducated. She was able to do that, and it \nwouldn't have happened if she had been more concerned about punitive \nmeasures in our school if I had failed a standardized test.\n  It is easy to look at Clark County's woes under this law because it \neducates more than half of our State's elementary and secondary \nstudents. However, there are other counties in Nevada facing challenges \nthat are much different but no less significant.\n  A school system right next door to Clark County is Nye County, which \nhas seen much slower growth than Clark County but still growth. It is \nthe largest school district in the continental United States. It is \nhuge. Superintendent Rob Roberts is a West Point graduate who worries \nabout problems such as children riding schoolbuses in the desert with \nno air-conditioning. Nye County can only buy used buses because they \nare spending so much money on the Leave No Child Behind Act. They \nliterally drive a million miles a year to get kids to school and back. \nAnd they are going to eliminate an extra bus which allows students from \nsome of these outlying districts to participate in athletics and music \nprograms and other enrichment programs. They are going to eliminate \nthat. They can't afford it. Gas prices are going to speed up that \ndemise.\n  Other counties have seen enrollment decline as industries such as \nmining went through cycles. Lincoln County is one of them, and it is \nstruggling to keep its head above water to provide transportation for \nits increasingly scattered student population.\n  Elko County has been gradually slowing the decline in its enrollment. \nBut they have increased expenses because of the Leave No Child Behind \nAct. They did what 14 or 15 other school districts wanted to do; that \nis, hire a grant writer. They had to pay a lot of money to do this. \nMost school districts can't afford a grant writer. They have people who \ntry to write for grants but don't know how. One of the superintendents \nsaid: I tried to write for a grant. I do not know how.\n  Mineral, Lander, and Carson City Counties are also in the position of \nneeding to hire grant writers--just to find new ways to supplement \ntheir financially strapped school districts, because the Leave No Child \nBehind Act is bankrupting the school districts.\n  In Esmeralda County, some of the children travel up to 160 miles \nevery day to school. Transportation expenses are 70 percent of their \nbudget. They are cutting special events because of rising \ntransportation costs.\n  The Humboldt County superintendent concurred--that there are all \nkinds of problems with this Leave No Child Behind Act. They are \nconcerned about the costs associated with the transfer of students to \nnew schools, if one of the schools fails its annual yearly progress.\n  Under the Leave No Child Behind Act, if you do not like a school and \nit is failing, you can demand that your child go to a school someplace \nelse.\n  These counties can't afford to haul these kids around. These are not \nschools located two or three blocks away, or 2 miles away--it could be \n180 or 190 miles away.\n  White Pine County has two local schools that perform well. Parents \nknow that they do a good job. But because of a situation with one or \ntwo special education students struggling in math--these are children \nwho are emotionally or physically or mentally handicapped--these two \nfine schools will be classed as ``failing'' schools.\n  Douglas County's superintendent knows about the stigma of a failing \nschool. Superintendent John Soderman\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\nsaid he appreciates the accountability principles in the law but the \npunitive implications are brutal. It is the ``label of blame'' law.\n  Pershing County is fretful over the way its 23-percent special \neducation students are being left behind.\n  Pershing County: The largest city in Pershing County is Lovelock, \nwith 23 percent of the students in special education in that school \ndistrict. They will be left behind.\n  Churchill County asked me when the Federal Government planned to \nfully fund this law. I said I did not know. Storey County is the \nhistoric county seat of Virginia City. The superintendent said the law \nwas too inflexible.\n  Again, you cannot legislate a child to be able to dunk a basketball.\n  Every one of these counties agreed that providing teachers with \nprofessional development, ensuring that they are highly qualified in \ntheir subject--or, as in the case of Lyon County, multiple subjects--is \nproving to be expensive and frustrating.\n  The meeting with these superintendents took place in Nate Mack \nElementary School in Henderson, NV. We were greeted by a student band \nfeaturing drums and xylophones. Another class presented a wax museum of \nfamous Nevadans in history. They were dressed as historical characters. \nThe first child, a little girl, was a special education student. She \nwas physically handicapped, but she played her part very well.\n  Now, is this little girl going to make that school a failing school? \nIf we had a law that was meaningful and fair and educated students, \nthat little girl would not make it a failing school. She would make it \na successful school. This law is going to make it a failing school \nbecause of this little girl.\n  I was so impressed with this wax museum of famous Nevadans. They were \ntrained not to smile. They did not frown. They were mimes, there to be \nwax. They were not to move. They did a wonderful job dressed as the \nhistorical characters they studied.\n  These are examples of how experienced, creative teachers can find \nexciting ways to help children learn. Music and history are integral to \neducation, but the Leave No Child Behind law focuses on standardized \ntests.\n  I hope these children and their instructors will continue their \nlessons in music and in history, their athletics and art classes, even \nthough there will not be standardized tests on these subjects.\n  This was one of the best meetings, if not the best, I have ever had. \nIt opened my eyes. But I am not alone. I am sure many Senators have \nheard similar stories from educators in their States. I hope we can \nwork together to fix this law, mainly by either changing it or funding \nit, and do the other things needed that we have to do to achieve the \nlaudable goal of ensuring that no child is ever left behind.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. He is a \nthoughtful and excellent speaker on issues important to the country.\n  I do not agree with him that the big problem we have in education \ntoday is the No Child Left Behind Act. My home county of Mobile is a \nlarge school system. What the Federal goal of No Child Left Behind set \nto accomplish was to encourage systems to confront schools that are \nfailing; that we, in fact, have schools in America today that are not \nfunctioning well. As a matter of fact, they are failing. Some are \nfailing utterly.\n  Who is the person who loses? Is it the wealthy American who, if their \nchildren are sent to a failing public school, do they leave them there? \nNo, they do not leave them there. They move to another part of town, or \nperhaps they put them in a private school they believe is better. That \nhappens all over America.\n  What about our low-income people who are sent by law to a school in \nNevada or any other State and that school is failing by objective \nstandards and those children are not learning and they are not gaining \nthe kind of education critical to their success later in life?\n  In most aspects of the No Child Left Behind bill that passed--and I \nwas on the Education Committee when we marked it up. Senator Kennedy \nwas there with other Democrats, and I believe it passed unanimously out \nof committee and moved forward in a bipartisan way to the Senate. If \nthere is something wrong with it, I am willing to look at it and fix \nit.\n  Frankly, I would like to have accountability and virtually no \ncontrols, objective evaluation of how children are doing, and allow the \nschool system to function as it will.\n  If we love these children, if we care about children deeply, and they \nare in a school that is failing, don't we want to help them?\n  What happened to the superintendent in my hometown? He realized they \nhad schools that were not functioning well. They created a bonus to \nencourage outstanding teachers to go to those poor school systems to \nraise that level up because he cared about them. He did not want to \nignore it and did not want to go along with some idea that self-esteem \nis the only thing that counts. If a child cannot read, how can they \nhave self-esteem as they move forward? We have to confront that early \nand move in that direction.\n  No Child Left Behind basically requires the school system to have \ntests to make sure children are progressing. If they are not \nprogressing, we want to act to help them. If the whole school is not \nprogressing, students in the whole school are not progressing in a \nrational way. They ought to be held to account and improvement ought to \nbe made.\n  We simply cannot and will not continue to shuffle children through a \nsystem when they are not learning. That is what it is all about. If we \ncare about children, we want them to have the best. If we care about \nchildren, we want to inquire as to whether or not their school is \nfunctioning and whether or not they are learning.\n  I feel strongly about this. I have talked to superintendents and \nteachers throughout my State. My wife taught a number of years. I \ntaught 1 year. I don't think teachers are sufficiently appreciated. A \nlot of the problems are Federal regulations. One of them is IDEA, the \nDisabilities Act Program. We can do better with those. We are working, \nand I have been working, as a lead sponsor to give more flexibility and \nrespect to the teachers and principals--many of them with master's \ndegrees in special education--to help those children in the best way \nand remove them from Federal court and State court and lawsuits.\n\n  I note under President Bush's leadership, we have had greater \nincreases in education since he has been President in funding from the \nFederal Government than we have throughout the entire time that \nPresident Clinton was President. There has been increased funding on \nthe Federal side, but we do not want the Federal Government to be the \nprime sponsors of education in America. It is a local school deal that \nwe care about.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  I want to share a few thoughts about the war in Iraq. It is an \nimportant matter for the entire world. It is a defining moment for us \nas we confront terrorism and instability and violence in the world. How \ncan we make this world better?\n  I had the honor Wednesday of hosting seven Iraqi citizens at the \nmeeting of the Senate Steering Committee which I chair. These were \ncourageous men who wanted to personally thank the Senate and the \nAmerican people for liberating their nation. They urged us to stay the \ncourse in Iraq. I ask unanimous consent that the article in the \nWashington Post about these seven men be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. These Iraqis have a special perspective on the Abu \nGhraib prison. It was there that they each had their right hand \namputated by the Saddam Hussein regime. Their crime? Doing business \nwith American dollars. Those were atrocities. That was life in Abu \nGhraib before the liberation in Iraq, substantially different than \nunder the American Army, even allowing for\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\nthe physical abuse and psychological abuse we have seen in the \nphotographs recently.\n  There were several hours of videotapes that were discovered and found \nof other atrocities that came to my attention. This was discovered in \nthe seizure of records and documents in Iraq by the American soldiers. \nPeople's hands, fingers, tongues, heads being cut off, as well as \npeople being pushed off buildings--all on videotape.\n  These were not low-level rogues. These were not isolated instances. \nIt was systematic torture by a regime that used torture, mutilation, \nand murder as a means to a political end. The videotapes were made, in \nfact, at Saddam Hussein's request and direction so he could be certain \nhis brutal orders were carried out. In fact, that is what dictators \nsuch as Saddam Hussein do. If you have seen some of the films of the \nhistory of Saddam Hussein's regime, you know he used random terror, \nrandom violence, death and destruction and mutilation as a tool to \ninstill fear throughout the populace and help strengthen his hold on \nthat country and to make sure nobody would cross him.\n  America can never make these Iraqi men whole, but the sacrifice of \nour troops has made them free and has given each one of them a new life \nand a new hope. Thanks to the good will of doctors and businesses that \ndonated money and services, they have been fitted with prosthetic \nhands. As I greeted each one of them in the Mansfield Room Wednesday, \nthey proudly extended their newly restored right hands. I have shaken \nmany important hands during my political life, but never was I more \nhonored to shake a hand of one than these men.\n  Sunday is June 6, the 60th anniversary of D-Day. I would like to read \na prayer that President Roosevelt delivered after the invasion. As I \nread it, I ask my colleagues to reflect on our mission and our troops \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  President Roosevelt said:\n\n       Almighty God, our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have \n     set upon a mighty endeavor; a struggle to preserve our \n     republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free \n     a suffering humanity . . . They fight to end conquest . . . \n     They fight to liberate . . . They yearn but for the end of \n     battle, for their return to the haven of home.\n       Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall \n     return again and again; and we know by Thy grace and the \n     righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.\n\n  Just as we did 60 years ago, our President and our people today pray \nfor our brave soldiers in Iraq. They are serving superbly. They are \nserving with professionalism. They are serving with restraint and poise \nand discipline under very difficult circumstances. They are out in \ncrowds every day. Most people are friendly. You never know when someone \nout there may not be. Sometimes there are protests and people are \nshouting and raising guns in the air and chanting or even throwing \nrocks. We have seen them on television show discipline and poise and \nrestraint and allow this spasm of anger to vent itself because, in the \nlong run, that is probably going to be healthy as the Iraqis go through \nthis painful transition from oppression to a decent government.\n  So we pray for their return home. We celebrate the magnificence of \ntheir service and the triumphs of their cause. Our cause is just. Our \nresolve must be firm. Our troops are brave and courageous. Some things \nhave changed in 60 years. We have the ability to win a war much faster \nwith less risk to our troops but still at great risk, and much less \nrisk to innocent civilians.\n  Medical technology allows us to heal wounded soldiers faster and \nprovide help to amputees. The Internet allows photographs of misconduct \nto reach the public with lightning speed. But some things remain the \nsame. Mothers and wives of soldiers worry just as much. The pain felt \nby the families of a lost soldier hurts just as much. Those who live \nunder tyranny, fear, with a thirst for liberty and a desire for peace, \nare just as grateful to those who bring them peace, liberty, and \nfreedom. We pray for the Iraqi people that their suffering be ended, \nthat they be liberated from tyranny.\n  Shortly before I met with the seven Iraqis who had their hands cut \noff as punishment by Saddam Hussein, I was meeting a group of \nschoolchildren from Alabama. I told them I was going to be meeting with \nthese Iraqis, and the schoolteacher called me aside, a young teacher \nwho was with the group. He said: Just tell them--this was so sincere--\njust tell these people we care about them. We want nothing but them to \nhave a good government, and we wish them the best in the future. He \nsaid: Tell them that is not Washington talking. That is the people of \nAmerica. That is what we want.\n\n  I shared that with them because I thought it was a meaningful \nexpression of American love and affection for the good and decent \npeople of Iraq who suffered so long.\n  So we pray for the Iraqi people. We pray that their suffering will be \nended, that their liberation will continue, that tyranny will not \nreturn, and that economic progress and scientific advancement and \neducation will flourish in their country.\n  D-Day brought about the last days of Nazi tyranny. As we liberated \nthe country and the world was horrified to see the images of brutality, \ntorture and murder that were brought to light in the prison camps, the \nworld will forever remember what occurred there. We have a permanent \nrecord of those horrible events at the Holocaust Museum. They remind us \nto be vigilant forever against tyrants, wherever they be.\n  I urge my colleagues to meet with these seven Iraqis, to view the \nvideotapes that showed what happened in those days under Saddam \nHussein. This was Abu Ghraib prison not long ago. As we look at the \nunfortunate actions at Abu Ghraib, as our military proceeds to \ninvestigate and take actions about our failures there, I urge my \ncolleagues to reflect on the liberation of Abu Ghraib and to gather \nsome perspective. Nothing we can say makes what happened in Abu Ghraib \nby our soldiers right. It was wrong. It cannot be justified. Our Nation \nwas humiliated, and it occurred under our watch.\n  But to put it in perspective, we must reflect on who we are as a \npeople, what is our purpose. Our Government investigated the images of \nabuse with the intent to prosecute those who committed criminal acts. \nSaddam Hussein investigated the images of mutilation to ensure that his \ntorture was carried out.\n  American soldiers have shed their own blood to bring freedom to the \nIraqi people and security to America and the world. Saddam Hussein \nspilled the blood of others to maintain his rein of terror and to \nexpand his dictatorship. America wants peace, democracy, and freedom \nfor the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. The terrorists want to destroy \nAmerica and the values we hold dear.\n  President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, Secretary \nPowell, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, our troops, this very day are \nworking to secure our Nation, to secure Iraq, and to establish a \nframework for an Iraqi government where state-sponsored torture, \nmutilation, murder, and terrorism can be a painful memory of the past. \nAnd the American people understand it. They understand what we are \ntrying to do, that we only want the best for Iraq. They want our \nGovernment to succeed. But this is an election year and we have had \nsome comments that, frankly, are wrong and need to be talked about.\n  I have waited. I have not responded aggressively. But the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, summarizing his take on the Abu Ghraib \nabuses and photographs that came out, said:\n\n       Shamefully, we now learn that Saddam's torture chambers \n     reopened under new management: U.S. management.\n\n  That is not correct, Mr. President. That is absolutely wrong. It has \nundermined and is an attack on our soldiers who serve in Iraq. It makes \ntheir job more difficult, it puts them at greater risk, and it provides \nammunition for those in Iraq who are frustrated and want to oppose \nAmerican efforts there. It was not good and it was wrong and should not \nhave been said. You watch Saddam's torture videos and try to explain to \nthe American people how the actions of President Bush or Secretary \nRumsfeld or General Myers or General Abizaid or General Sanchez equate \nwith this kind of activity. No, sir, that is not correct. It is wrong.\n  Saddam persecuted the people in prison. We are prosecuting people who \nviolated the law of the United States concerning how to handle \nprisoners. Within days of the report being made\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\npublic, a single young soldier brought forth this information. Within a \nday, a criminal investigation was ongoing. Within a week, a public \nstatement was made that abuses had occurred and an investigation was \nongoing. A formal investigation by a two-star general was commenced. \nAnd we are making every effort to find out what happened, who did it, \nand punish those who did it. Some have already been court-martialed and \nsentenced to prison, and others will be. That is what the American \npeople do.\n  When I was with the seven Iraqis who had their hands cut off by \nSaddam Hussein in his prison, one of the reporters asked one of them \nabout these abuses. He said, well, President Bush--that is not his \npolicy; it was Saddam Hussein's policy. The American people are \npunishing those who did wrong. They were not punished under Saddam \nHussein. They were encouraged.\n  I think we need to talk about this. Former Vice President Gore, in a \nrecent speech at New York University, said:\n\n       How dare they subject us to such dishonor and disgrace. How \n     dare they drag the good name of the United States of America \n     through the mud of Saddam Hussein's torture prison.\n\n  That is the kind of broad-based condemnation of the American soldiers \nwho, at this moment--because three-fourths plus of this body sent them \nto Iraq to carry out an American policy to strike down terrorism and \ncreate a new government there--are putting their lives at risk for us \nbecause we sent them there. They ought not to be condemned in this \nfashion by the former Vice President of the United States of America. I \ndon't know what has gotten into his head. It is wrong.\n  Last night, I was at Walter Reed and I met great soldiers. Time and \nagain, they told me they want to go back. Some of them have lost limbs. \nSome are in serious condition. Some are coming along nicely and, in \nfact, are going back to Iraq. These are the best of America. They love \nthis country, and they love the rule of law. They care about doing the \nright thing, and they want to see our policies succeed--the policies we \nsent them to carry out. We sent them. We owe them support and help and \naffirmation. We don't need political second-guessing by armchair \nquarterbacks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 24, 2004]\n\n           For Seven Iraqis, A Vital Part of Life Is Restored\n\n                            (By Vince Bzdek)\n\n       Houston.--Nine years ago in Abu Ghraib prison, on the night \n     before doctors were to cut off his right hand, Nazaar Joudi \n     wrote a letter to his wife. It was the final act he was to \n     perform with the hand, which was to be methodically removed \n     on Saddam Hussein's orders as punishment for the crime of \n     doing business in American dollars.\n       ``Do not be sad,'' Joudi wrote to Um Fuqaan that night. \n     ``Hopefully Allah will replace my hand with an even better \n     one. . . . God will reward you for standing next to your \n     husband and being my right hand.''\n       Thanks to a Fairfax-based film producer, a half-dozen \n     health care providers and businesses in Houston, and a \n     legendary ``white knight in blue spectacles,'' Joudi's \n     promise to his wife came true last Monday.\n       Doctors and prosthetists moved by the plight of Joudi and \n     six other Iraqi merchants whose right hands were amputated at \n     Abu Ghraib finished fitting each of the men with $50,000 \n     ``bionic'' hands. Black tattoos of crosses that had been \n     carved into the men's foreheads to label them criminals were \n     removed by a Houston plastic surgeon a few weeks earlier. All \n     the services and products were donated.\n       As resentment of Americans in Iraq seems to swell each day, \n     these seven Iraqis are unabashed in their gratitude, not just \n     for their new hands, but for the U.S. role in ending what \n     they call the ``reign of horror'' that claimed the lives of \n     as many as 2.5 million of their countrymen.\n       ``Tell the American people what all Iraqis want to tell to \n     them,'' Salah Zinad said. ``Tell them: Thank you. Thank you. \n     Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.''\n       The other six Iraqis were equally effusive, their \n     appreciation undimmed by the current prisoner abuse scandal \n     at Abu Ghraib, outside Baghdad, and other occupation worries \n     back home.\n       ``We have freedom in Iraq. Now we say anything we want,'' \n     Zinad said. ``Under Saddam we whispered.''\n       In recent interviews, the seven Iraqis were unflagging in \n     their confidence about Iraq's future and the U.S. role in it.\n       Zinad on the prisoner abuse: ``Some American soldiers are a \n     problem. Not all Americans. These Americans who did this will \n     be punished. Under Saddam, such abuses were rewarded and \n     praised. Iraqis understand the difference.''\n       Qasim Kadhim on Americans who think the invasion of Iraq \n     was a mistake: ``I think those people have made a mistake, \n     because under Allah, all people are brothers. We must help \n     each other if we have a problem. . . . How do we do it if \n     nobody helps us?''\n       Basim Al Fadhly on why many Iraqis are angry: ``They have \n     good reasons to be angry. There have been many mistakes \n     because of cultural differences. Iraq is not a country \n     like America yet. We were 35 years under Saddam. But that \n     does not mean Iraqis don't want democracy. People like \n     freedom, but with freedom you need life.''\n       The seven have become celebrities in Houston as they learn \n     how to use their artificial limbs and soak up a bit of Texas \n     hospitality when not at the hospital. They've watched an \n     Astros game in the owner's box, donned cowboy duds for a \n     barbecue at the historic Y.O. Ranch, even spent a night at \n     the dog track.\n       This week, they make a pilgrimage to Washington to employ \n     their new limbs shaking the hands of more Americans they want \n     to thank, including soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical \n     Center who have undergone amputations. They also plan to lay \n     a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n       ``Saddam is the past,'' Kadhim said. ``Now we must make \n     business contacts in America.''\n\n\n                            amputation city\n\n       Their odyssey began almost exactly a year ago, with an \n     overheard conversation in a Baghdad cafe.\n       Don North, a former correspondent for both ABC and NBC who \n     is currently a freelance producer, was in Baghdad last June \n     helping set up the U.S.-sponsored Iraq Media Network when he \n     received a videotape from one of the Iraqi journalists \n     working for him. It showed doctors amputating the hands of \n     nine Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib in 1995.\n       ``I'd seen a lot of videotape, but this was truly gruesome \n     and shocking,'' North said. In Baghdad, the owner of a small \n     video production shop had been asked to make 10 copies of the \n     tape by secret police in 1995. He clandestinely made an extra \n     to keep as evidence of the atrocities. That was the copy that \n     found its way to North.\n       Al Fadhly said that, after a year in hellish prisons and \n     five months in Abu Ghraib, he was almost relieved when he \n     heard he and the eight other merchants were going to be freed \n     after having their hands amputated.\n       ``We were the lucky ones,'' Al Fadhly said. ``Others stayed \n     in prison much longer. Thirty thousand in Abu Ghraib went to \n     the hangman's noose.''\n       Their trial lasted 30 minutes. Al Fadhly said all nine men \n     believe they were scapegoated by Hussein because his economy \n     was collapsing after the Persian Gulf War, and U.S. currency \n     was anathema to him. Two weeks after the men lost their \n     hands, they said, the law banning trade in foreign currency \n     was thrown out.\n       Hussein had the nine hands brought to him, to be sure the \n     sentence was carried out, said Farhad Taha, an attending \n     physician at the amputations who was later interviewed by Al \n     Fadhly, who now works for the media network.\n       Amnesty International estimates that hundreds, perhaps \n     thousands, of Iraqis had their hands amputated for similar \n     crimes. ``Baghdad is Amputation City,'' North said. ``Within \n     a block you run into two to three people without a leg, or an \n     arm, or an ear.'' Hussein's secret police, like Hitler's, \n     kept meticulous records of who was killed or maimed, and \n     why. A committee of former prisoners is sorting through 2 \n     million to 4 million files in hopes of accurately \n     quantifying the scope of the depravity.\n       One of the nine maimed men escaped to Europe after his \n     release, and another has died. Over the next nine years, the \n     seven who remained in Baghdad kept a low profile, living the \n     life of scarred outcasts. They also became their own support \n     system, forever bonded by their time in prison.\n       ``They were their own best friends,'' North said.\n\n\n                       Houston's ``White Knight''\n\n       After viewing the tape. North was determined to make a \n     documentary about the men. ``It was already a famous story in \n     Baghdad.'' When he met the seven, North decided he would shed \n     his role of detached observer. ``I decided I wasn't going to \n     leave it up to chance that some doctor who saw my documentary \n     would offer to help,'' he said.\n       An oil engineer from Houston, Roger Brown, overheard North \n     talking about the men in a Baghdad cafe. He suggested North \n     contact Houston's ``white knight in blue spectacles,'' famed \n     TV newsman Marvin Zindler.\n       Zindler is the kind of institution only Texas could spawn: \n     a woofer-voiced champion of underdogs and the underprivileged \n     who sports white pants, a silver hairpiece and blue-tinted \n     eyeglasses.\n       Although Zindler made his name with muckraking, populist \n     journalism--he uncovered the scandal memorialized in ``The \n     Best Little Whorehouse in Texas''--these days he uses his \n     airtime on the ABC affiliate's ``Eyewitness News'' more to \n     comfort the afflicted than to afflict the comfortable. \n     ``Why'd we\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\n     do this?'' Zindler replies to a question. ``Because the guys \n     had their hands cut off.''\n       Zindler is 82 but looks much younger thanks to 30 \n     reconstructive surgeries. (``I was fired from my first TV job \n     for being too ugly,'' he explains.) Those surgeries yielded a \n     good friend in Joe Agris, Zindler's plastic surgeon. After \n     talking to North, Zindler called Agris to get the good deeds \n     rolling.\n       Agris, who has volunteered time in Vietnam and Nicaragua \n     doing reconstructive surgery on children, rounded up the \n     doctors, nurses, hospitals and clinics to give the men new \n     hands. North spent his days off making the logistical \n     arrangements. It took months to line up all the benefactors \n     and cut through the red tape, but by early April the amputees \n     were bound for Houston.\n       The Methodist Hospital, the Institute for Rehabilitation \n     and Research, and Dynamic Orthotics and Prosthetics in \n     Houston donated the operating rooms, rehab and training; \n     Houston-based Continental Airlines paid for the seven Iraqis' \n     flight; the Marriott and Warwick hotel chains housed them; \n     and the  Minneapolis branch of a German prosthetics company, \n     Otto Bock, provided the artificial hands.\n        The Iraqis were met with a surprise in their first days in \n     Texas: the prospect of another round of surgeries to further \n     shorten their arms. Agris and another surgeon he'd enlisted, \n     Fred Kestler, determined that the Abu Ghraib surgeries had \n     left the men with far too much real pain and ``phantom \n     pain''--painful sensations where the limb used to be. \n     Operations were needed to repair the nerves and create a new, \n     smooth surface for the artificial hands.\n        Last week, the men had recovered enough for the final \n     fitting of their bionic hands, microprocessor-assisted \n     marvels that receive instructions from the brain via \n     electrodes attached to muscles in the arm. The Iraqis are \n     training themselves to fire the right muscles to control hand \n     functions, a process that will take months. Already, they can \n     throw balls, shake hands, raise a glass.\n        Agris and North will go back to Baghdad with the seven in \n     early June to make sure they have the proper medical support. \n     Agris has arranged to visit other amputees, and he will help \n     Baghdad hospitals upgrade their knowledge about amputations \n     and prosthetics.\n        ``The thing that'll win hearts and minds in the \n     humanitarian effort, not guns,'' Agris said. ``You take care \n     of someone's child, not only do you help the child but you \n     win over the family. And the family talks to the neighbors \n     and you win over the neighbors. It just escalates.''\n        He thinks Al Fadhly, Joudi, Kadhim, Salah and the other \n     three men--Laith Aggar, Hassan Al Gereawy and Al'aa Hassan--\n     will change some minds, too.\n        ``I think we're going to see a ripple effect, especially \n     with a guy like Al Fadhly who's got a job working for the \n     coalition's new TV station. They're bringing back a different \n     attitude, a different look.''\n\n\n                          Ready for Homecoming\n\n       No one turned down North, Zindler or Agris when they asked \n     for help. L. Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator of Iraq, \n     wrote an executive memo authorizing the trip. The Homeland \n     Security Department issued seven ``medical emergency'' visa \n     waivers, and the Air Force transported the group to Germany \n     to catch the Continental flight to Houston.\n       ``This is really who we are as a country,'' Agris said.\n       After nearly two months in Houston, the Iraqis admit they \n     are getting homesick. Kadhim has developed what he says is \n     too much of a fondness for Budweiser, Aggar is eager to get \n     back to his jewelry shop, and the seven men have run up a \n     $6,000 phone and laundry bill at the hotels.\n       North is shopping his documentary about the men to major \n     television networks. He worries, however, that the publicity \n     the Iraqis have received and their new, expensive hands might \n     make them targets back home. ``Anybody in Iraq who is a \n     decent, productive member of society has become a target,'' \n     he said.\n       But the Iraqis themselves aren't that worried. ``Saddam's \n     friends don't have much power any more,'' Aggar said. ``Iraq \n     is many millions of people. They are only hundreds. They are \n     the ones who live in fear now''\n       ``Allah will watch over us,'' Kadhim added. ``Once Saddam \n     has his trial, it will be over. Hopefully, it will be \n     quickly.''\n       When Al Fadhly gets home, the first thing he plans to do \n     with his new hand is wave vigorously to his friends and \n     neighbors. Kadhim plans to embrace his seven boys and \n     daughter all at once. Aggard said he will, for the first \n     time, properly shake the hand of the friend who watched over \n     his house and family while he was in prison.\n       Last week at Dynamic Orthotics, Joudi didn't answer when \n     asked what he would do first. He was already busy using his \n     prosthetic to try something he hadn't done since the night \n     before he lost his hand. He was writing a letter to his wife.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was moved last night to be with those \nsupersoldiers and have dinner with them and talk with them and their \nfamilies. They are so fine and so indicative of the strengths and \nvalues of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as the Senate continues its consideration \nof the National Defense Authorization Act, I wish to commend our \nmilitary forces for the exemplary and successful performance of their \nmissions in the war on terrorism.\n  This bill provides the authorization for appropriations of funds \nneeded to enable them to continue to protect our national security \ninterests in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and elsewhere in the world. In \nAfghanistan, the Taliban leadership has been removed and is no longer \nable to provide a safe haven for al-Qaida operatives or to train \nterrorists or to plan attacks against people around the world. In Iraq, \nSaddam Hussein is in prison, and 46 of the most wanted operatives in \nhis regime are no longer a threat to others.\n  Our military forces have helped provide an opportunity for Iraq to \nstart a transition to democracy. The President's envoy to Iraq, \nAmbassador Paul Bremer, has led this impressive transition to peace and \nsovereignty. Under Ambassador Bremer's leadership, and with the \nassistance of many courageous Iraqi citizens, unemployment has fallen \nby nearly one-half. And for the first time in decades, Iraq's \nmarketplaces are filled with consumer goods. More than 395,000 jobs \nhave been created for the Iraqi people. All 22 universities and 43 \ntechnical institutes and colleges are open. Almost 2,500 schools have \nbeen rehabilitated, and 240 hospitals and more than 1,200 health \nclinics are now open for the Iraqi people. Five million children have \nbeen immunized for measles, mumps, and rubella. Electricity generation \nhas surpassed prewar levels and is more evenly distributed now than it \nwas before. The number of telephone subscribers, including cell phone \nusers, is nearly one-third above the level it was before the liberation \nbegan. More than 90 percent of Iraqi towns and provinces have local \ngovernment councils. These are individuals who have voluntarily assumed \nresponsibilities for moving their communities into this new era of \nself-government.\n  Iraq has a functioning judiciary now and is on its way to providing \ntrue and equal justice for all. More than 200,000 Iraqis are now \nserving in their own security forces, and 25,000 troops from other \ncountries are present in Iraq as well, contributing to the peacekeeping \noperations.\n  This authorization bill also provides support for other defense \nactivities in the central command area of responsibility and elsewhere \naround the world where our interests are threatened. It is important \nthat we pass this bill.\n  Chairman Warner and Senator Levin and their committee staff members \nhave worked hard to put together a comprehensive authorization bill for \nthe day-to-day operation and activities of our military forces. The \nbill provides essential authority for the funding that is necessary to \nkeep our troops safe in the field, enabling them to protect themselves \nwith the latest technologies and innovations that are available.\n  The amendment that has been offered by the chairman and ranking \nminority member authorizes an additional $25 billion in supplemental \nappropriations for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  The other day, our Appropriations Committee, the Subcommittee on \nDefense, conducted a hearing with General Pace, the Vice Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of staff, and representatives from the Office of \nManagement and Budget and the Department of Defense, the civilian \nleadership. We were able to question them about the use of these funds \nand what it was for.\n  It is specifically allocated to services. It is not just a lump sum \nof money available to spend in any way the Department or the military \nchooses, but it is described in this supplemental appropriations bill \nthat will be before the Senate as well.\n  This contingent emergency reserve fund is important to ensure that \nthe Department of Defense has the ability to respond to the rapidly \nchanging environment in which our troops are currently operating. The \nauthorization for this additional funding helps ensure that the core \nfunding authorized in the bill for routine operations of the \nDepartment, such as the training of troops, base operations, \nmaintenance, and the planned procurement of equipment continue \nuninterrupted in the\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\nnext fiscal year, while still ensuring that our troops in Afghanistan \nand Iraq have the resources needed to perform their important missions.\n  This funding will likely be used to provide ammunition and supplies, \nfuel for aircraft and vehicles, and maintenance for the equipment, and \nto provide force protection needs, such as body armor and other armor \nfor vehicles that are used by our troops.\n  In my State of Mississippi, more than 3,000 National Guard and Air \nNational Guard troops have been deployed since Operation Iraqi Freedom \nbegan. A few weeks ago, we welcomed home to our State a battalion of \ncombat engineers who had been sent to Iraq right after the airport at \nTikrit had been overtaken. They built a perimeter around that airfield \nto protect it and to protect this operation from those who would do \nharm to our troops. They built structures for the defense of other \nmilitary forces and activities throughout northern Iraq. Then they came \nhome. They came home to the welcome that was earned--well earned--\nbecause of their brave service. They suffered not one casualty in the \nperformance of their duties. They were under fire, but they protected \nthemselves successfully. Thirty-two members of that battalion received \nBronze Medals for their heroism and their courage under fire.\n  It makes me very proud that these soldiers from my State carried out \ntheir mission so successfully and with such distinction. I am proud of \nthem and other troops from our State and throughout the country who \nhave been called on to serve in this war on terrorism, many without \ncomplaints, many volunteering for that service in particular.\n  It has been a very impressive performance in behalf of the security \ninterests of our great country. We appreciate their service, we \nappreciate their skill, and we want to be sure this legislation \ncontains the resources that will be necessary for them to continue to \nsafely carry out their duties in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my good friend from \nAlabama. Who says that words do not have weight and they are not \nremembered a long time. I was glad he recited the prayer from President \nRoosevelt on the eve of D-Day some 60 years ago this weekend. Words do \nhave weight, and they are remembered a long time.\n  When we hear that prayer, maybe we ought to start thinking as a body \nand as representatives of our constituencies that maybe this might be \nthe better approach to completing the mission in Iraq. Last night, the \nSenator from Alabama and 32 other Senators visited Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center. It is a moving experience whenever one sees warriors \ncome home with limbs gone, but it is also moving to see the miracles of \nhealing, of what modern-day medicine and technology has done to \nrehabilitate these young people to put them back into the mainstream of \nAmerican life.\n  It is remarkable to see their spirit because everything around them \nis negative. Yet they find a way to say this is my country, this one I \nwill die for because I also understand there are generations behind us \nto which we must pass this great country.\n  Some of us inherited these freedoms. We have not paid for them. They \nwere given to us. Sometimes we use them a little loosely because we did \nnot earn them. That makes a lot of difference.\n  Last night was a remarkable night. I visited a young man from Montana \nwho just within the last week returned. He lost one leg, the whole leg. \nWith a series of surgeries and skin grafts and probably 6 or 8 months \nof hard rehabilitation, he will be back home again in the central part \nof Montana.\n  Earlier this week, we also got the word that a soldier, Owen Witt, \nfrom Sand Springs, MT--Sand Springs has one grocery store and one post \noffice; that is all that is there--was killed in the line of duty in \nIraq. David and Karen, his folks, ranch in that part of the world. Of \ncourse, we send them our prayers and our thoughts at this time.\n  When I talked with his mother, she said two of them in that community \nwent into the Army as soulmates. Both of them wanted to go to the same \noutfit. His good friend, Kevin Rogge, is still over there, and we will \nbe in touch with him, we hope, before the next couple of weeks are out.\n  Again, I go back to that prayer. Maybe it would be a good approach \nfor every representative to go back and read that prayer because we all \nunderstand what the mission is. The people on the ground understand \nwhat the mission is. They are willing to take the risk. They are \nwilling to see it through to victory: to liberate and do away with a \ntyrant, to give freedom to people who have never known it in their \nlifetime. That is a high calling and a calling worth our attention.\n  I was struck also a while ago when the distinguished minority leader \nwas talking about No Child Left Behind. I remind this body that No \nChild Left Behind, when it went to the States, had enough flexibility \nin that law that the States could set their rules and regulations on \nhow they wanted this to apply. If there is a little bit of tension or \nnervousness from our teachers or a little bit of pressure and they are \na little uncomfortable because of testing, they are supposed to be a \nlittle uncomfortable because, for the first time, we are looking at not \nonly the job they are doing but the job the administration of the \nschool is doing and how we are doing as supporters of public education.\n  We all better be a little bit nervous, and if there is something \nwrong in my State and I can help it, I will go after it now. Do not \ncome to the floor and make excuses why it isn't working if you have not \nbeen involved.\n  There was some nervousness among my teachers. We are slowly getting \nthose worked out. We are finding there is a comfort level whenever we \nsee the progress of young people who are now being taught the basics, \nand the basics are the Three R's: reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n  That is what it is all about. The funds from the Federal Government \nare flowing at a level never seen before in the history of this \ncountry. Now, is it a perfect law? No. Is it a step in the right \ndirection? It is.\n  I congratulate my friend from Mississippi, who talked about the \ncontingency report. It is very important.\n  My good friend from New Mexico was with us last night, and it was \ntruly a moving event when talking to those young people.\n  Let us comment a little bit about the budget. We are having a tough \ntime. I do not think we as individuals have seen the urgency of having \na budget. Having a budget is bigger than any one of us in this Senate. \nI urge my colleagues this coming week, as we go into the appropriations \nseason, to work doubly hard to come up with a budget.\n  Also, my good friend from New Mexico has worked on an energy bill. \nThat needs passing, too, this next week. Look around us and see what is \nhappening in energy in this country and how it can slow down this \neconomy.\n  This economy is booming. More people own homes now than at any time \nin the history of the country. More people are working in my State of \nMontana than ever before. We did not have huge unemployment. Even \nthough our economy nationwide was stagnant, we continued to grow.\n  A lot of things in this country are working to the positive side, and \nwe are not talking about them. More people are working today than at \nany time in the history of this country. More homes are being bought. \nThere are more first-time home buyers. That is an accomplishment. We \nare putting more people back to work. That is an accomplishment.\n  I thank my good friend from Alabama this morning for allowing me this \n5 or 10 minutes. I wanted to remind people that it is not all doom and \ngloom. If my colleagues think it is doom and gloom, then it is going to \nbe doom and gloom. If my colleagues think we cannot win in Iraq, we \nwill not win in Iraq.\n  Last night, I heard a young man comment--and my colleagues think \nwords do not have weight? He said: Senator, you can pull us out of Iraq \nand bring us home, but the people who want to bring us down will follow \nus. They will be here. I do not think we want that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                          Recent Economic News\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to talk this morning about good \nnews.\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\nThis morning we just received a current report on how many new jobs \nwere created in America in the past quarter. There were 248,000 jobs \ncreated in May.\n  There is so much talk about unemployment. People say this \nPresidential race is going to depend on jobs and the performance of our \nPresident with reference to jobs and the American economy during his \nterm. We all know that about the time he was elected, this country was \ngoing into recession. That means the big growth that occurred for about \n4 years prior to that had reached its peak and was on the way down. \nThat means if something was not done, we would have to wait for the \nnatural give and take of the American economy to right itself. Who \nknows how long that would have taken. Perhaps it would have taken 2, 3 \nor 4 years to right itself because the lessons of economics take that \nlong. Once the economy starts down, one has to wait for the economy to \nright itself, and who knows how long that will take. That recession was \ncoupled with the bust of the stock market. Who knows when it would have \nfilled that gap.\n  The recession did not last very long because somebody did something \nright. I surmise that Congress did not do anything right because I can \nlook around and see what happened. They did not do anything. The \nPresident did something that was right. He suggested that we ought to \ninterrupt that recession and startup the American economy again by \ncutting taxes.\n  I have been here when numerous tax bills were passed. They were \npassed in the name of new jobs, in the name of putting people to work, \nin the name of making sure there was some kind of fairness--whatever \nreason they were passed. Essentially one has to look at them and see \nhow they worked and how good were they in comparison to the tax cuts \nthat were done at the request of President Bush.\n  Frankly, I looked down the other day and saw this list of tax cuts \nthat have occurred during this President's time. They were pushed and \nshoved through Congress, Democrats voting almost to a man against them. \nBut if one looks at the list, it is the most astounding list of \nappropriate tax cuts for growth I have ever seen in my 31 years.\n  Normally, we pass all kinds of irrelevant tax cuts when we pass a tax \ncut bill. I think the Senator from Alabama knows that. This tax \npackage, with Congress usually working its way to change the \nPresident's approach and do the wrong thing, adopted all of the \nessential features of the President's tax bill. They were directed at \nsmall business in America.\n  Guess what. It worked. Small business in America is booming. The job \ncreator in America, small business, is absolutely moving ahead. Jobs \nare being added. Families that own businesses are buying trucks, adding \non to their buildings because we were smart enough to adopt a tax bill \nthat invited investment, invited growth type items for them.\n  My colleagues can look at the list. Even Congress went along with the \nPresident and adopted the right ones. I will admit there were two that \nwere socially minded. That was the child credit and trying to get the \nmarriage tax penalty closer to reality, closer to fairness, but all the \nrest had to do with growth.\n  What happened to all the clamor about jobs? In the last 10 months, \nthis economy in America has created 1.4 million new jobs. Now, there \nwas a lot of talk about the President and 2 million jobs that he lost. \nWhat a joke. First, he did not lose them. We had a recession going and \nhe did not create that, but he did cause a shallow recession. Now we \nare kind of up, up and away on job creation.\n  I surmise this will continue right up and through the election. If it \ndoes, that 2 million jobs argument going on across America can be wiped \nout, and we will be back to the best way to create jobs is to create a \ntax system and tax cuts that are directed at corporate and small \nbusiness in America so they can add jobs and still grow and prosper or \nindeed do better than they were doing. That is what the President did.\n  Unemployment had reached 7.8 percent during that shallow recession. \nIt is now down to 5.6 percent. That is not too shabby. As a matter of \nfact, I predict it will continue to go down. I say to my friend that it \nhas gone from 7.8 to 5.6 and holding steady or coming down.\n  The second argument being made is that these tax cuts caused this big \ndeficit.\n  Let me suggest there are at least three things that can cause a \ndeficit to grow. One is if you spend more, and one is if you have a \nrecession or a downturn in the economy, and then the third one is if \nyou cut taxes. Of course, if you cut taxes and assume it will not do \nanything in the economy, then you will do a straight line and say the \ntax cuts created part of the deficit.\n  Let me tell you, the numbers are absolutely startling. If they are \ncorrect, for those who think we will fix this by increasing taxes, they \nhave to be in some way reading tea leaves that have already lost all \ntheir flavor and are not good for anything. That is because the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is a neutral body, has said the weak \neconomy caused 40 percent of the deficit we have accumulated. Let me \nrepeat. When a recession occurs, you don't collect taxes--you collect \nless, I should say, because there are fewer workers and businesses are \nmaking less money, and in a sense the weak economy causes losses in the \ntax take by the American Government and other things that create \ngrowth. So 40 percent came from that, from that one thing, the \nrecession.\n  Increased spending? We know what we increased the spending for. Some \nwas of our own doing, just because we spent it, but most of it was \nbecause of homeland security, increased defense costs, and the like. \nWho would not have done that? That had to be done. That was increased \nspending by 36 percent. So we have 40 and 36 that had nothing to do \nwith taxes. You would think, from those who are talking about it, that \nthe tax cut created it all. It created the total of 40 plus 36, which \nis 76 percent. That leaves something like 24 percent that came from tax \ncuts.\n  If the tax cuts stimulated the economy and pulled us out of the \nrecession, then you can almost say if we wait around that one will \ndisappear because, with significant economic growth, the tax revenues \nof the country will go up almost automatically.\n  I can remember at one point when I was chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, we were getting estimates of the tax take of the United \nStates. We were so inept at measuring the result of the tax cuts and \neconomic growth that every quarter we underestimated by a substantial \namount how much revenue was coming into the Government. We had three \nsuccessive quarters when the revenues came in at $50 billion more than \nwe expected. As a matter of fact, I assume that within the next 4 or 5 \nmonths with this growth, if it remains and is sustained, we will start \nseeing the revenue numbers of America change.\n  They are not going to change for the worse; they are going to change \nfor the better. There is already a slight change, but I am not willing \nto brag about it yet because it has not passed $20 billion. It is under \n$20 billion. You know, we have to be careful assuming that estimates \nare going to remain right because they change from being right to being \nwrong, in terms of their validity.\n  We will get there, though. Soon this prosperous economy will start \nproducing more revenue. The deficits will have to be affected \npositively. If we continue to restrain our budget growth, the country \nwill have everything right. It will have the tax cuts that we have done \nstill in place--there are a couple of more that we need to do. They \nwill be in place and America will be able to say under the leadership \nof George Bush, the country came out of recession and started growing. \nEven with a war we did it right, and the Americans at home are \ninvesting in small businesses. And it is growing. American corporations \nare incurring more and more surplus and are looking around for \ninvestments, and that is good.\n  I repeat, I am very proud of what this President did. As with Iraq, \nthis President has courage. On the economy, he exercised courage. There \nwere more people around, including some Republicans--maybe more than a \nfew--who were beating down his door, saying: Don't cut taxes. We are in \na recession and the deficit is growing. Don't cut taxes.\n  He was steadfast. He said the only way to fix it is to cut taxes and \ncut\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nthem in a way that investment will occur, that savings will occur. That \nis what we did, at his behest and under his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I thank him \nfor his excellent comments. He served so ably as chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee. He has been a Member of this Senate 31 years and has \nseen a lot of things occur.\n  I guess my question to the Senator is this: For some reason, the \nmedia or whatever, created an image--and some of the speeches on this \nfloor nurtured that image--that President Bush created this economic \nslowdown that occurred. But as I remember, and I ask the Senator is it \nnot correct, the third quarter of President Clinton's last year in \noffice was negative growth, and the first quarter--and the President \ndidn't take office until mid-January when he got sworn in--the first \nquarter of the year he inherited was negative growth. Then we had the \nSeptember 11 attack. So a number of things that came together were not \nhis fault. Is that fair to say?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is absolutely correct. Incidentally, in my list of \nthings that have hurt the economy, that we had to eliminate, I failed \nto mention that we, the United States, had imposed upon us the 9/11 \nincident. It caused a lot of turmoil in this economy. I am not saying \nthat trying to ignore the terrible deaths that occurred and the wrath \nthat Americans have for the terrorists. But that should be in the list, \nalso, of things that would add to the economic downturn.\n  But the Senator is correct. The President not only inherited a \nrecession, but it continued afterwards, and it could not have been \ncaused by President Bush because it occurred too quickly. With an \neconomy this size you can't do anything in 2 months. If you wanted to \nhurt it, you couldn't hurt it. It is too big, too powerful. As a matter \nof fact, if you want to cut taxes, you have to be patient because they \ndo not bring the economy back tomorrow or next week. It takes a while.\n  It took a while. While the doubters ran around the country talking \nabout no jobs, the economy was percolating underneath and created the \njobs. That is what happened today.\n  I forgot to mention one thing we did not do that is currently a \npolitical issue and is in this campaign. That is, what do we do about \nthe fact that most of these tax cuts--I just told you what my view is \nabout them, which is that they help--are temporary? They should not \nhave been temporary; Congress would have made them permanent. But the \nproblem is, the Budget Act of the United States, which governs budgets \nand governs the mandatory change in taxes, has provisions in it that \nmean you cannot cut taxes permanently. You can only do it over a number \nof years and your authority runs out. So many of these tax cuts are \ngoing to run out.\n  I am grateful they are not going to run out before this growth, but \nthey are going to stop growth because those people involved in \ninvesting are expecting to have the same tax cut for a while. They \ndon't expect to be turned off and on like a spigot. If you want them to \nrespond, you have to tell them when you act on them you don't have to \nworry about next month that you are going to be in a business that you \nlost a hundred-thousand-dollar tax credit, or you lost whatever it was. \nYou have to leave them in. I think we ought to have a full-blown debate \non that. I hope we can. I don't know if we can because we don't have \nthat budget and I am not sure we can do a tax bill without a budget.\n  Senator Nickles is trying hard. There are some on our side who will \nnot let us do it. I regret it because I believe for those who talk \nabout ``no more tax cuts because of the deficit,'' they actually have \nit backwards. Because of the deficit, you should be making sure the tax \ncuts remain because you can put more people to work. You can cause more \nrevenues to come into the country. You can stabilize for long periods \nof time the status of the American economy, which is good at this \npoint, not bad. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico. His \nwisdom should not be lost on this body. It is very valuable, and we \nthank him for that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to follow up on Senator \nDomenici's comments and those of Senator Burns about the growth we have \nin the economy.\n  This was a great announcement today about the 248,000 new jobs \ncreated last month. The month before that, we created 288,000 jobs, and \nthe month before that, 315,000 new jobs. This is some of greatest \ngrowth we have had in many years. The third quarter of last year was \nover 8-percent growth.\n  People started to dismiss the economic growth. Where are jobs? All \nthe experts told us that jobs follow growth. They don't come in the \nsame week in which there is growth. We have had tremendous growth over \nthe last four quarters. Actually, certainly the last three quarters \nrepresent the highest growth in 20 years. That 8-percent growth was the \nhighest growth in 20 years, and this job expansion today is something \nwe have to celebrate. It is the kind of thing that gives us confidence \nin America. We did it not by not raising taxes, creating bureaucracies, \nmake-work programs and governmental deals; we did it by allowing the \nAmerican people to have more of their own money so they could invest in \ntheir communities.\n  I know the Senator from North Carolina traveled her State as I \ntraveled my State the last recess, and every city mayor I talked to \nsaid his sales taxes were up. Those are real numbers, aren't they? When \na town's sale taxes are up--little and big towns--that means something \ngood is happening out there. People are able to have more money to buy \nand spend and create growth in the economy.\n  Manufacturing jobs are up--something I know the Senator from North \nCarolina worries about as I do in Alabama. We see growth in \nmanufacturing jobs for the first time in a long time.\n  Those are good things that are happening. If we stay the course, if \nwe invest in the American people to allow freedom, productivity, \ninnovation, and the dream of profit and progress to occur and continue \nto occur, I believe we will continue to have good growth in America.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 3281, 3282, 3283, and 3244, as modified, en bloc\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, on behalf of the managers, I have a \nset of amendments to the Defense bill that have been cleared by both \nmanagers.

Madam President, we often recognize military veterans \nfor their many contributions to our country. Where would this country \nbe were it not for their sacrifices made in times of wars? Today, I \nwould like to recognize other Americans who also give freely of their \ntime and energy to the public good. These unsung heroes are the women \nof veterans' auxiliaries who conduct youth activities, community \nservice and promote the ideals of America without compensation and \nwithout sufficient recognition.\n  One such woman is Lynn Musselman, the Pennsylvania department \npresident for the VFW's Ladies Auxiliary. Lynn's late father Otto \nMusselman was a combat engineer in the European Theatre during World \nWar II. As a result of her father's service, Lynn decided to join the \nVFW Ladies Auxiliary in Sellersville, PA, in 1973. The rest is a \nlifetime of very active public service. While serving as auxiliary \npresident, she has held a number of chairmanships and has served as a \ntrustee. On the department level, Lynn has chaired the Youth \nActivities, Voice of Democracy, Community Service, Scotland School, \nAmericanism and Loyalty Day and Membership Committees. For her ability \nin gaining high participation by Auxiliaries in each program under her \ndirection, the National Office of the Veterans of Foreign Wars has \ncited her accomplishments. It is no wonder that in June 2003 she was \nelected as department president.\n  In addition to her full time job as the controller for a commercial \nroofing company, she is also a member of the Quakertown American Legion \nAuxiliary No. 242 and a life member of Freedom Valley Girl Scout \nCouncil for 39 years.\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\n  In June 2004, President Musselman completes her tour of duty as \nDepartment President; and I officially recognize her for her \noutstanding service to veterans and her country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/04/senate-section/article/S6480-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMVETS DEPARTMENT COMMANDER REGIS W.

Madam President, today, I would like to recognize an \nAmerican patriot, one who has served his country faithfully and \ndutifully for over 30 years both in military service and as a leader of \none of Pennsylvania's most active veteran service organizations--the \nAmerican Veterans or, AMVETS as it is called. In June 2004, Regis W. \nRiley will complete his elected tour of duty as AMVETS Department \nCommander. As he departs this position of responsibility, it is \nappropriate that he be recognized not only for his successful year as \nDepartment Commander, but also for his many contributions and his many \nyears of leadership in AMVETS.\n  Following his honorable discharge from active duty in the U.S. Army \nin 1974, Rege, as he is known to all, worked his way through the ranks \nof AMVETS in a number of leadership positions including Post Commander \nfor 9 years, Commander of the Western Region, and President of the \nPennsylvania State War Veterans Council. Rege is also a voting member \nof the Pennsylvania State Veterans Commission.\n  His dedication to the cause of veterans has been his hallmark \nincluding coordination of the Memorial Day, Pearl Harbor Day, and \nVeterans Day Ceremonies in the Mon Valley and surrounding areas and \nservice in the cause of homeless veterans as Chairman of the National \nHomeless Veterans Committee. He is a recipient of the Leadership of \nExcellence Pin, the National AMVETS' Recruiter of the Year Award and in \n2001, he was honored as the Department of Pennsylvania AMVET Member of \nthe Year.\n  As Rege departs the position as Department Commander, it is \nappropriate that Pennsylvanians, particularly Pennsylvania's veterans \nsay thank you for dedication and leadership and a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/04/senate-section/article/S6480-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            VFW PENNSYLVANIA STATE COMMANDER CHARLES PRINCE\n\n   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, today, I would like to recognize an \nAmerican patriot, one who has served his country faithfully and \ndutifully for over 50 years. During this period when recognition was \nrecently given to America's greatest generation through the World War \nII Memorial in Washington, DC, it is my honor and pleasure to recognize \nan American patriot, one who has served his country faithfully and \nhonorably not only in World War II, but also in the Korean War. Charles \nPrince served in the United States Navy aboard four Navy men-of-war, \nthe USS Missouri, the USS South Dakota, and USS Quincy and the USS \nDonaldson. For his service, he received the Victory Medal, American \nCampaign Ribbon, Asiatic Pacific Ribbon with seven stars, the \nPhilippine Liberation Ribbon with two stars and the Good Conduct Medal.\n   Following his military service, Charles Prince did what many \nveterans returning to Pennsylvania did; he joined the Veterans of \nForeign Wars and the American Legion. He rose through the ranks of the \nVFW and became the Post Commander in Confluence, PA and All American \nDistrict Commander for the 23rd District in 1996. On June 28, 2003, \nCharles Prince was elected State Commander, Veterans of Foreign Wars \nand in June 2004, he will complete this tour of duty. In addition, \nCharles has been an advocate for national security and veterans \nemployment and has served on VFW committees in support of these \nendeavors.\n   His government service did not end with the military. After 17 years \nof service in the Somerset county Assessment Office, he retired as \nSomerset County Appraiser.\n   While Commander Prince is rightfully proud of his service to his \ncountry, I suspect that he ranks as the greatest event in his life his \n55 years of marriage to his wife Jean. I wish them continued health and \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/04/senate-section/article/S6480-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AMVETS LADIES AUXILIARY DEPARTMENT PRESIDENT DELIA ANN KREILING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

During the past year, Dee has focused her energies \non ``Sharing and Caring,'' a program of service to hospitalized \nveterans. In 2001, she was the recipient of the Pennsylvania AMVETS \nLadies Auxiliary Member of the Year Award.\n  In addition to her enthusiasm in addressing veterans' issues, Dee has \nalso been active for several years in ``Shoes for the Needy'' and the \nSt. Jude's Ranch for Children.\n  On behalf of Pennsylvanians and Pennsylvania veterans, I salute her \nfor her many contributions and for her leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/04/senate-section/article/S6480-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VEST BUSTER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I have long been concerned about a new \n.50 caliber handgun manufactured by Smith and Wesson Corporation \ndeclared the ``most powerful production revolver in the world today.'' \nNow, the Violence Policy Center reports that these handguns can blast \nthrough the body armor of our nation's law enforcement officers. This \nshould disturb all Americans and all who care about the safety of our \nlaw enforcement personnel.\n  This new weapon fires a .500 Smith and Wesson Magnum bullet packing a \nmuzzle force of 2,600 foot-pounds. The bullet is half an inch wide and \nis more powerful than comparable ammunition because it is much longer \nand contains more gunpowder. According to the Violence Policy Center's \nanalysis, the .500 Smith & Wesson Magnum round far exceeds the \nprotection level of the highest grade of concealable body armor \nnormally used by law enforcement officers.\n  Body armor has saved the lives of countless numbers of law \nenforcement officers because of its ability to stop handgun rounds. The \n.500 Smith & Wesson Magnum round is more powerful than some rifle \nrounds. According to data compiled by the Violence Policy Center, \nduring the 1990 to 1999 period, 20 officers were killed by gunshot \nwounds as a result of rounds penetrating their body armor. A rifle \nfired each one of these rounds. However, the .500 Smith & Wesson Magnum \ntakes pistol power to rifle-power level and presents a deadly challenge \nto the life-saving record of law enforcement's body armor.\n  The decision to produce the .50 caliber handgun represents a great \nstep backward in efforts to improve gun safety. Instead of sensible \nsteps to make guns safer and keep guns from getting into the wrong \nhands, this moves in the opposite direction, creating a handgun that is \nreported to have double the power of most assault rifles.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Military Sniper Weapon Regulation Act, a bill \nwhich would change the way .50 caliber sniper rifles are regulated by \nplacing them under the requirements of the National Firearms Act. This \nbill would subject the sniper rifles to the same regimen of \nregistration and background checks as other weapons of war, such as \nmachine guns. The new Smith and Wesson .50 caliber handgun should be \nincluded in this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/04/senate-section/article/S6480-5", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6480-S6481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH.

A bill to implement the recommendations of the Federal \nCommunications Commission report to the Congress regarding low power FM \nservice; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Low Power \nRadio Act of 2004. This bill would allow the Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC) to license Low Power FM stations on third adjacent \nchannels to full power stations without limitations and eliminate the \nrequirement that the FCC perform further testing on the economic impact \nof Low Power FM radio. Additionally, the bill seeks to protect stations \nthat provide radio reading services, which some have suggested are more \nsusceptible to interference than other stations because they are \ncarried on a subcarrier frequency. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by Senator Leahy who is a co-sponsor of the bill. I thank him \nfor his support.\n  This bill would also right a serious wrong. Four years ago, Congress \nwrongly delayed the full implementation of a new community based radio \nservice called ``Low Power FM'' due to broadcasters' grossly \nexaggerated claims of interference. The FCC recently found, based on \ndata from an independent engineering study, that the broadcasters' \nclaims of interference are groundless. As required, the FCC sent a \nreport to Congress in February describing the study's results and \nsuggesting legislative actions to further the growth of Low Power FM. \nThis bill would implement these recommendations.\n  In January 2000, the FCC launched Low Power FM radio service to \n``enhance locally focused community-oriented radio broadcasting.'' Low \nPower FM stations are just that--low power radio stations on the FM \nband that generally reach an audience within a 3.5 mile radius of the \nstation's transmitter. In rural areas, this signal may not reach many \npeople, but it provides rural citizens with another media outlet--\nanother voice in the market. In urban areas, this signal may reach \nhundreds of thousands of people and provide not just local content, but \nvery specific neighborhood news and information.\n  Localism is increasingly important in today's changing media \nlandscape. Rampant ownership consolidation has taken place in the radio \nindustry since passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Since \nthat time, many Americans have complained that the large media \nconglomerates fail to serve local communities' interests and seem to \nuse their local station license as a conduit to air national \nprogramming. Low Power FM was introduced, in part, to respond to such \ncomplaints.\n  Low Power FM is an affordable broadcasting option for many community \norganizations because a full power radio station license is extremely \nexpensive and broadcast spectrum is very scarce. In 2003, the average \ncost to acquire a commercial radio station was more than $2.5 million \ndollars.\n  Between May 1999 and May 2000, the Commission received over 3,400 \napplications for Low Power FM stations from non-commercial educational \nentities and community organizations. However, before the Commission \ncould act on many of the applications for this new community service, \nbroadcasters frightened legislators into halting the full \nimplementation of Low Power FM. Broadcasters masqueraded their true \nconcerns about competition from a real local radio broadcaster in \nthinly veiled claims of interference.\n  Due to the broadcasters' subterfuge, Congress added language to a \n2000 appropriations bill requiring the FCC to hire an independent \nengineering firm to further study broadcasters' claims of interference. \nWell, the results are in! I am not happy to report that after spending \nalmost two years and over two million dollars, the independent study \nrevealed what the FCC and community groups had said all along: LPFM \nwill do no harm to other broadcasters. The study has stripped the \nbroadcasters of their veiled claims by concluding that Low Power FM \nstations on third adjacent channels would cause virtually no \ninterference to other broadcast stations.\n  The broadcasters masquerade has now cost American taxpayers over two \nmillion dollars. This was two million dollars taken from the FCC's \nbudget that could have been used to further study efficient spectrum \nuse to promote public safety needs, process license applications \nfaster, hire more high quality engineers for the FCC and much more. \nPerhaps, we should send a bill to the National Association of \nBroadcasters. Nevertheless, that is the past, and it is time to focus \non the future.\n  That brings us to the future of Low Power FM. The FCC, as required by \nthe appropriations language, has reported the study's findings to \nCongress and recommends full implementation of Low Power FM. This bill \nsimply follows the FCC's recommendation: begin licensing Low Power FM \nstations on third adjacent channels to full power stations without \nlimitations. Additionally, the bill seeks to protect full power \nstations that provide radio reading services. It is estimated that \nabout 1.1 million people in the U.S. are blind, and it is important to \nensure this helpful radio reading service remains interference free.\n  The enactment of this bill will immediately make available a number \nof Low Power FM frequencies. By some estimates, Congress' legislation \ndelaying the full implementation, which mostly affected metropolitan \nareas, led to the elimination of half the Low Power FM applications \nfiled during 2000.\n  For example, Congress' action eliminated the LPFM slot in Fresno \napplied for by El Comite de los Pobres. The group had hoped to address \nthe dearth of local programming for the Latino community by airing \nbilingual coverage of local issues. New Orleans' Music Business \nInstitute's application\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\nwas eliminated as well. The Music Business Institute teaches young \npeople how to get into the music business. The Institute had planned to \nuse the station to help start the musical careers of local artists, and \nto educate listeners about the city's jazz and blues musical heritage. \nLet's get these valuable stations on air.\n  There are some wonderful LPFM stations that are up and running. A \nrecent article published in The Nation called these stations, ``beacons \nof grassroots democracy.'' The article discussed WRFR in Rockland, \nMaine: ``Shunning the canned programming approach of Rockland's two \nClear Channel stations, WRFR offers an array of local talent, tastes \nand interests, and was recently named Maine station of the year by a \nstate music association. Although country music, a Maine favorite, is \nheavily represented, hardly any WRFR deejay restricts himself to a \nsingle era, genre or Top-40 play list.'' Started by a local city \ncouncil member who was concerned about the lack of local media outlets \nin his town, today, WFRF has over half the city listening. This is what \nscares broadcasters about LPFM: competition.\n  In 2000, the Southern Development Foundation established a Low Power \nFM station in Opelousas, Louisiana, which sponsors agriculture \nprograms, leases land to farmers, raises money for scholarships for \nneedy kids and helps citizens learn to read. The station director told \na local community newsletter: ``You've got local radio stations that \nare owned by larger companies. There should be some programming \nconcerning the music that is from here, and the people from here. But \nthere's not.''\n  I ask the public and commercial broadcasters to come clean and join \nus in promoting LPFM. More good radio brings about more radio listening \nand that's good for all broadcasters. Therefore, in the interests of \nwould-be new broadcasters, existing broadcasters, but most of all, the \nlistening public, I urge the enactment of the Low Power Radio Act of \n2004.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2505\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 led \n     to increased ownership consolidation in the radio industry.\n       (2) At a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation, on June 4, 2003, all 5 members \n     of the Federal Communications Commission testified that there \n     has been, in at least some local radio markets, too much \n     consolidation.\n       (3) A commitment to localism--local operations, local \n     research, local management, locally originated programming, \n     local artists, and local news and events--would bolster radio \n     listening.\n       (4) Local communities have sought to launch radio stations \n     to meet their local needs. However, due to the scarce amount \n     of spectrum available and the high cost of buying and running \n     a large station, many local communities are unable to \n     establish a radio station.\n       (5) In 2003, the average cost to acquire a commercial radio \n     station was more than $2.5 million dollars.\n       (6) In January, 2000, the Federal Communications Commission \n     authorized a new, affordable community radio service called \n     ``low power FM'' or ``LPFM'' to ``enhance locally focused \n     community-oriented radio broadcasting''.\n       (7) Through the creation of LPFM, the Commission sought to \n     ``create opportunities for new voices on the air waves and to \n     allow local groups, including schools, churches and other \n     community-based organizations, to provide programming \n     responsive to local community needs and interests''.\n       (8) The Commission made clear that the creation of LPFM \n     would not compromise the integrity of the FM radio band by \n     stating, ``We are committed to creating a low power FM radio \n     service only if it does not cause unacceptable interference \n     to existing radio service.''.\n       (9) Small rural broadcasters were particularly concerned \n     about a lengthy and costly interference complaint process. \n     Therefore, in September, 2000, the Commission created a \n     simple process to address interference complaints regarding \n     LPFM stations on an expedited basis.\n       (10) In December, 2000, Congress delayed the full \n     implementation of LPFM until an independent engineering study \n     was completed and reviewed. This delay was due to some \n     broadcasters' concerns that LPFM sen-ice would cause \n     interference in the FM band.\n       (11) The delay prevented millions of Americans from having \n     a locally operated, community based radio station in their \n     neighborhood.\n       (12) Approximately 300 LPFM stations were allowed to \n     proceed despite the congressional action. These stations are \n     currently on the air and are run by local government \n     agencies, groups promoting arts and education to immigrant \n     and indigenous peoples, artists, schools, religious \n     organizations, environmental groups, organizations promoting \n     literacy, and many other civically-oriented organizations.\n       (13) After 2 years and the expenditure of $2,193,343 in \n     taxpayer dollars to conduct this study, the broadcasters' \n     concerns were demonstrated to be unsubstantiated.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF PRIOR LAW.\n\n       Section 632 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and \n     State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act, 2001, (Pub. Law 106-553; 114 Stat. 2762A-111) is \n     repealed.\n\n     SEC. 3. MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its \n     rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation \n     requirements between\n       (1) low-power FM stations; and\n       (2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and \n     FM booster stations.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF RADIO READING SERVICES.\n\n       The Federal Communications Commission shall retain its \n     rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for \n     full-power non-commercial FM stations that broadcast radio \n     reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential \n     low-power FM station interference.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased today to join \nSenator McCain in introducing important legislation to increase the \nnumber of frequencies available for low power radio stations in \nAmerica. Low power stations serve their communities with broadcasting \nthat reflects local needs and local preferences. In this way, low power \nFM offers a valuable counterpoint to nationwide media consolidation. \nFor this reason, I have been a strong supporter of low power FM for \nmany years now. In fact, I recently urged FCC Chairman Powell to \nexpedite licensing for new low power stations.\n  Unfortunately, for many years now, the number of low power FM \nstations the FCC could license has been limited by unrealistic and \nunnecessary rules requiring these small stations to find available \nfrequencies far from any full power broadcaster. Interference must be \navoided if we are to make use of the airwaves. The current rules, \nhowever, go beyond what is necessary to protect full power stations \nfrom interference, and instead protect them from competition. The focus \nof today's legislation is the so-called ``third-adjacent rule,'' which \nrequires that a low power station not broadcast within three frequency \nintervals of a full power station.\n  For example, if a full power station were broadcasting at 101.1, the \nfirst-adjacent frequencies would be 99.9 and 101.3 and those would be \nunavailable for broadcasting. The second-adjacent frequencies would be \n99.7 and 101.5 and they too would be off-limits. Finally, the third-\nadjacent frequencies would be 99.5 and 101.7, and under the current \nrule, those frequencies would also be unavailable. Thus, the existence \nof just one full power station effectively keeps low power radio from \nbroadcasting anywhere between 99.5 and 101.7. It is easy to see how a \nradio dial can quickly become off-limits for any low power broadcaster.\n  A recent study by the FCC concludes that this third-adjacent rule is \nnot necessary to protect full power broadcasters from unreasonable \ninterference. Our new bill simply implements those findings and \nconclusions. It eliminates the third-adjacent rule, and allows the FCC \nto license low power stations in accordance with its own studies and \nfindings about potential interference from these stations.\n  Of course, the need for low power FM radio must be balanced against \nother important uses of nearby frequencies. I have worked hard to \nprotect reading services for the blind, and this bill protects those \nservices by retaining the third-adjacent rule where such services would \nbe affected. In addition, this bill protects commercial broadcasters of \nall sizes from actual interference by leaving intact the FCC's \nexpedited interference claim review procedures.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this important \nbill forward, to strengthen local broadcasting.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/04/senate-section/article/S6483-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3281.
