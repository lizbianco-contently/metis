Oh God, who said, ``Let there be light,'' we pray our \nfaiths--in different ways, with different prayers and customs, but with \nshared hopes and dreams of better times--can help us see that light, \ndespite the darkness that sometimes obscures our view.\n  Almighty God, I remember twenty years ago, in a foxhole in Beirut: I \nlooked around at the others in the bunker, and had a simple thought. \n``We Americans,'' I said, ``must have the only `interfaith foxholes' in \nthe whole Mid-East.'' And then I thought, that if more foxholes had \nroom for those of different faiths, perhaps we would need less room for \nfoxholes--and have more room for faith.\n  And so, we pray that we be touched and inspired by the dreams of \nfaiths that make our Nation rich; and that we work with all who share \nthe dream of freedom--and freedom's holy light. Let us see the danger \nis not that sometimes faiths see God--see You--in different ways, but \nthat there are those in every faith who see themselves as gods. Let us \nkeep faith, but let faith keep us humble, so that we know our limits, \neven as we learn our strength. Then the time will come when even \ninterfaith foxholes will no longer be required and we learn war no \nmore.\n  And may we say, Amen.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Reid, will you lead us in the \nPledge of Allegiance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5401-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Harry Reid led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5401-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Mr. President, shortly before Congress adjourned for the \nEaster recess, I came here to the Senate floor and had a chance to \nspeak briefly about the magnificent service that our Armed Forces are \nperforming in Iraq. The hard-working men and\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\nwomen in all branches of our military--those who are serving in Iraq \nand those who are helping to support them--they are all doing an \nabsolutely tremendous job. We are so proud of our service men and women \nand so grateful for their service and dedication to our country.\n  Since Operation Iraqi Freedom began, we have watched on television \nand read in the newspapers about our troops' countless acts of bravery, \nstrength, and leadership. We have seen our service men and women take \ncontrol of Baghdad, driving out Saddam Hussein and freeing the Iraqi \npeople from his oppressive regime. And, Mr. President, we have rejoiced \nas the many statues of Saddam--and all that they represent--have \ntoppled. But, at the same time, Mr. President, while there certainly \nare many reasons to rejoice and there is clearly much to be thankful \nfor, I also am reminded of something Dwight D. Eisenhower said nearly \n60 years ago in a speech following the defeat of Nazi Germany in June \n1945. General Eisenhower said that there are certain things that \nmilitary honors and battlefield victories cannot hide. As he so \neloquently said, Mr. President--and I quote:\n\n       [Military] honors cannot hide . . . the crosses marking the \n     resting places of the dead. They cannot soothe the anguish of \n     the widow, or the orphan, whose husband or father will not \n     return.\n\n  Sadly, Mr. President, there are sons, husbands, and fathers who will \nnot be returning home from Iraq. Our hearts go out to the families of \nthose who have lost their lives. We pray for them. We pray for those \nwho have been injured. We pray for those who are recovering. And, we \nthink about them--we thing about them every day.\n  President John F. Kennedy once said that ``a nation reveals itself \nnot only by the men it produces, but also by the men it honors [and] \nremembers.'' And so today, Mr. President, I would like to honor and \nremember three valiant men from my home State of Ohio--three brave men \nwho gave the ultimate sacrifice to protect us and to protect our \nchildren and our grandchildren and the Iraqi people--three brave men \nwho serve as true examples of what defines patriotism and love of \ncountry.\n  Today, Mr. President, I would like to honor and remember the lives \nand sacrifices of Army Private Brandon Sloan, Army First Sergeant \nRobert Dowdy, and Marine Private First Class Christian Gurtner--all of \nwhom upheld with strength and conviction what General Douglas MacArthur \ncalled the soldier's code, a code of ``Duty, Honor, Country.''\n  I did not have the privilege of knowing these men. I did, however, \nhave the honor of attending their funerals and meeting their families \nand friends and hearing from them about the lives of these men and \nabout their dreams and their hopes and their aspirations. I am \ngrateful. I am grateful to have had that opportunity, and I thank their \nfamilies for allowing me to attend those services. I learned a great \ndeal about these three Ohioans.\n  And though I am here on the Senate floor today to pay tribute to \nthese men, I know that my words will fall short. My words will fall \nshort because really, it is their families and friends and the men and \nwomen with whom they served--many still in Iraq right now--who knew \nthem best. They are the people who could give the most adequate \ntribute.\n  But, at the same time, I do feel it is very important for my \ncolleagues here in the United States Senate and for the American people \nto know what I have learned about these three fine men, because each \none of them, in his own way, has revealed the strength and the \ngreatness of our Nation.\n\n  PVT Brandon Sloan was born in Cleveland, OH, on October 7, 1983, to \nthe Rev. Tandy Sloan and Kimberly Sloan. Brandon was special. Rev. \nWalter Thornhill, the pastor at Brandon's church in Cleveland, \nremembered him as ``a gentle person with a goodness of spirit.''\n  Brandon was a loving and caring person, with a strong faith in God. \nHe radiated joy because of that faith, and his joy spread to everyone \naround him, especially to his younger sister Brittney, and to his \nfriends and to his community.\n  His friends described Brandon as ``a big guy--happy-go-lucky and \nloyal to a fault.'' His friend Tony Tucker said Brandon was a ``kind, \nsweet person . . . a cool person to be around.'' That was his faith \nshining through.\n  It was not surprising that Brandon was a popular and friendly student \nat Bedford High School in Bedford Heights, OH. He was a gifted athlete, \nwho proved to be a talented football player, working hard on the field \nto earn a position as defensive lineman for the Bedford High Bearcats.\n  Store owners recalled how pleasant and personable Brandon was when he \nwould stop by their stores after high school football practice. He was \na nice young man who was respectful and considerate of others, they \nrecalled. Again, that was Brandon's faith shining through.\n  Brandon's faith in God, and the warmth that radiated from him because \nof it, extended to his love of his country. When he turned 18 years \nold, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. His service in the Army began with \ngreat promise. He became a logistics specialist and was assigned to \nFort Bliss, TX.\n  In January 2003, he was sent to Kuwait with the 507th Maintenance \nCompany. But, after just 1 year of service, at the age of 19, Brandon \nwas killed in action when the 507th was ambushed by Iraqi troops near \nAl Nasiriyah. He was killed while defending the Nation he was so proud \nto serve and protect.\n  Brandon Sloan wanted to be a soldier. He was proud to be a soldier. \nHis father, Rev. Sloan, recalled how Brandon just exuded pride at his \nboot camp graduation. He wanted to protect his country. He wanted to \nprotect us and our children and our grandchildren. His faith in God and \nhis commitment to serving America is what made Brandon Sloan a very \nspecial person. He is a role model for all of us.\n  I know he will be greatly missed by his friends and by his family. He \nleaves behind to cherish his memory his father, his mother, his sister, \nand his grandmothers Dr. Rementa Pippen and Luberta Sloan. My prayers \nare with all of them.\n  1SG Robert Dowdy was also from Cleveland and also served and died \nwith the 507th Maintenance Company where he was the highest ranking \nenlisted soldier.\n  Robert was born on August 21, 1964, and attended Cleveland South High \nSchool, and before graduating in 1982, he lettered in five sports. \nAfter high school, Robert followed his older brother Jack, a former \nmarine, into the military, and his service carried him to bases in \nSouth Korea and across the United States.\n  Even when far away from home, however, he always kept close to \nCleveland and followed his beloved Cleveland Indians whenever and \nwherever he could--and, I might add, when they were having good seasons \nor bad seasons.\n  One of Robert's other passions was distance running. He was an avid \nrunner with a level of perseverance and commitment that permeated \neverything else that he did in life. His friends said in a race he \nalways would cross the finish line in high spirits.\n\n  Robert also liked to take time to enjoy all things in life, including \nthe little things. He was a devoted son, devoted husband, devoted \nfather. And, he loved doing small things for his family, things such as \nteaching his mother how to drive. His family was everything to him. His \nfamily was his life, his passion, his whole world.\n  Robert married his high school sweetheart, Kathy, and they were \nblessed by the birth of their daughter Kristy. Their marriage was one \nof balance. Robert never made a decision without consulting Kathy. They \nwere equals. They were partners. They were best friends. Robert had \ngreat respect for his wife and loved her and loved Kristy with all of \nhis heart.\n  Robert's bravery as a soldier was something he passed on to his \ndaughter Kristy. At the age of 14, she had the courage and the strength \nto design the program cover for her dad's funeral.\n  Kristy created an enduring and heartfelt tribute not only for her \nfather, but also for other Americans who have dedicated their lives to \nprotecting us. For the program cover, she took a picture of her father \nand placed in the background additional pictures of policemen and \nfirefighters saving lives on September 11, 2001. I think we can be sure \nthat Robert would have been so proud of his daughter Kristy, as we know \nhe always was.\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\n  Mr. President, 1SG Robert Dowdy was an inspiration, not only to his \nfamily, but also to his fellow troops. He led by example. He led by his \nactions, not just by his words. As a first sergeant, he was a leader. \nHe was strong, yet compassionate. He truly loved those under his \ncommand, and they knew it. He touched their hearts. He loved them, and \nthey loved him back.\n  MSG John Hite, who eulogized Robert at his funeral, relayed a story \nof a young soldier who was clearly touched by Robert's life and \nleadership. Master Sergeant Hite spoke of a big, strapping 6-foot-4-\ninch, 250-pound soldier who came up to him the day before First \nSergeant Dowdy's burial and told him about the love and admiration he \nhad for Robert. As they talked, they were standing by a bouquet of \nflowers adorned with a tiny replica of Robert's machine gun, his \nhelmet, and his combat boots. Before long, as this big, strong, tough \nArmy soldier spoke of First Sergeant Dowdy, his eyes swelled with \ntears. He looked at those combat boots and simply said: ``No one will \never fill them. . . .''\n  Robert Dowdy loyally served his country for 18 years. He was only 18 \nmonths from retirement when he deployed for Iraq--a deployment he \nvolunteered for so that another soldier could stay home with his \nfamily.\n  This act defines who Robert Dowdy was, and no one who knew him was \nsurprised that he would offer to help a fellow soldier in this selfless \nway.\n  As his brother, Jack, said: ``[Robert] was a very patriotic and very \nloyal man who loved his country. . . . He just wanted to serve his \ncountry to the best of his ability before he retired.'' First Sergeant \nRobert Dowdy did serve his country and he served it loyally, \nheroically, and honorably.\n  In the end, Robert Dowdy ran a good race. And as St. Paul wrote in \nhis second Epistle to Timothy: He finished the course; he kept the \nfaith.\n  Robert Dowdy is survived by his wife Kathy, his daughter Kristy, his \nbrothers Jack Jr. and Jim, his sisters Roxanne and Anita, and his \nparents Jack and Irene Dowdy. My heart goes out to them all.\n  PFC Christian Daniel Gurtner was born on June 23, 1983. He grew up in \nOhio City, OH, and graduated from Van Wert High School in Van Wert, OH. \nHe joined the Marines last year after graduating from high school and \nwas assigned to the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, based \nout of Twentynine Palms, California. He was deployed to Kuwait in \nFebruary 2003.\n  Christian's friends described him as respectful, motivated, and hard-\ncharging. He was proud of what he was doing and was committed to the \nMarines. As his friends described, he was so excited about being in the \nMarines and was so honored to serve.\n  He frequently signed letters back home with the Marine Corps motto \n``Semper Fidelis.'' In February, one of the last times Christian spoke \nto his family, he told his mother that he was ready to do whatever was \nneeded to protect our Nation. He told her that he was ``good to go.''\n  And, in a letter he wrote home--a letter that his mother received \njust days ago and portions of which were printed in yesterday's \nWashington Post--Christian wrote of how he missed and loved his family, \nbut that he was fighting so we all ``can sleep better at night because \nthere is less terrorism in the world.'' In typical fashion, he closed \nthis letter with ``Semper Fi.''\n  Christian was a faithful, hard-working, and well-loved member of the \nOhio City community. He loved to laugh, and, as his friend Alicia \nSterling said, ``He had this smile, and you knew when you saw that \nsmile [that] you were going to get into trouble!''\n  Christian loved to have fun, and he loved to watch sports. He \nfollowed both the Atlanta Braves and the Ohio State University football \nteam. He also enjoyed bowling and spent many evenings at the bowling \nalley with friends.\n  To celebrate this, his friends brought to his funeral a bowling pin \nsigned by his teammates. It was a touching gesture--one of love and \nadmiration for their friend and fellow teammate.\n  When he joined the Marines, Christian found a cause in which he \nbelieved deeply and a vehicle through which he could pursue his \nbeliefs. He served our country well and fought valiantly to preserve \nthe security of this Nation and fight for the freedom of the Iraqi \npeople. Christian Gurtner passed away on April 2, 2003. As Chief \nWarrant Officer Suzanne Handshoe so fittingly said upon his death, ``We \nlost a brother. As Marines, we honor our own.''\n  Christian Gurtner was good-natured. He was loyal. He was true to his \nfamily and friends. And, he was just a decent, loving, kind-hearted \nyoung man who died fighting for a cause he strongly believed in.\n  At his funeral, Christian's mother picked a very special song to be \nplayed in her much-loved son's honor, a song called ``Forever Young.'' \nWhen I heard that song, I was reminded of a poem that was sent to me \nshortly after my wife and I lost our daughter 10 years ago. Our \ndaughter was about Christian's age. It was sent to me by a dear friend \nof mine, Jack McKernan, who had lost his own son--a young man who was \nalso about Christian's age. It was a poem that was written during World \nWar I, by a man named Laurence Binyon. Here is a stanza from that poem:\n\n       They shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old; Age \n     shall not worry them, nor the years condemn. At the going \n     down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.\n\n  And we, too, will remember you, Christian.\n  PFC Christian Gurtner is survived by an infant daughter, his mother \nEldonna, and his stepfather Gary Wagonrod, and his grandmothers Sally \nMae Gurtner and Dorothy Wagonrod. They have been and will remain in my \nthoughts and prayers.\n  Brandon Sloan, Robert Dowdy, and Christian Gurtner demonstrated great \nnobility both in their lives and in their deaths. They revealed all \nthat is good and strong about our Nation--a Nation they gave their \nlives for to defend and protect. Each of these men was an amazing \nindividual, whose families and friends loved them dearly. My heart \naches at their loss, but after learning more about these three \nremarkable men, I am even more proud to say that I am an American, and \nthat I come from a country and a state that could produce such \nadmirable individuals--men who, indeed, upheld the code of Duty, Honor, \nCountry.\n  Though, they were but three of the several hundred thousand women and \nmen who serve this country in the military, they represented the \ncourage and the selflessness of them all.\n  My wife, Fran, and I extend our most heartfelt sympathy and prayers \nto the families of Brandon Sloan, Robert Dowdy, and Christian Gurtner. \nTo their parents, I must say that you raised incredible sons. We will \nnever forget them. As President Ronald Reagan said of the troops who \nperished at Normandy in World War II: We will always remember. We will \nalways be proud.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Army PFC Lori \nPiestewa from Tuba City, AZ. Private Piestewa was killed in action \nduring Operation Iraqi Freedom on March 23. As the first Native \nAmerican female member of the U.S. Armed Forces to lose her life in \ncombat, Lori's sacrifice is historic. It is also a source of tremendous \ninspiration for our country's Native American population, many of whom \nreside in New Mexico.\n  I think most are now familiar with the story of the 507th Maintenance \nCompany that was ambushed near An Nasiriyah. It was during this attack \nthat Private Piestewa lost her life in defense of our country. The \ndaughter of a Vietnam veteran, and the granddaughter of a World War II \nveteran, it is no wonder that she would volunteer to confront the \nthreats facing our country. Obviously, patriotism runs deep in the \nPiestewa family, and it was surely this proud family history that \ninspired Lori to heed the call of duty.\n  As I read some of the reports about Lori Piestewa's life, I noticed \nthat as a youngster, she participated in a program called Futures for \nChildren. This program, which I have been privileged to support over \nthe years, is focused on empowering Native American high school \nstudents to be leaders and role models in their community. Clearly, \nPrivate Piestewa was the embodiment of what this program stands for--\nboth as a leader and as someone young people can pattern their lives \nafter. I\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\nwould encourage students in places like Tuba City, AZ, or Shiprock, NM, \nwho want to make important contributions to their community, to look at \nthe example set by this courageous young woman and consider \nparticipating in Futures for Children.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that at 22, Private Lori Piestewa was, \nherself, still a young person. But her belief in service and her sense \nof duty went well beyond her years. Hers is a life of which her family \nand, indeed, all Native Americans can be extremely proud. The prayers \nof a grateful nation go out to her family and friends at this very \ndifficult time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5404-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sutton, of \nOhio, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased that today we are considering \nthe nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. The Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to listen to Mr. \nSutton answer questions a few months ago in what turned out to be a \nvery lengthy hearing. Probably 60 to 70 percent of the questions asked \nduring the 9\\1/2\\-hour hearing were directed at Mr. Sutton. Those of \nyou who heard this testimony, my colleagues who had the opportunity to \nhear it or who maybe had the opportunity to review the transcript of \nthat hearing, will no doubt attest to Mr. Sutton's keen intellect, his \neven temperament, and the depth of his legal knowledge. These \nattributes demonstrate why Jeffrey Sutton is one of the finest \nappellate lawyers in the United States today, and why he will be an \nexcellent Federal judge.\n  Mr. Sutton's legal and life experiences have been extensive. He spent \nthe first part of his life living abroad. The Sutton family remained \nabroad until a couple of years before Mr. Sutton started high school. \nThey returned to the States because his father took over a boarding \nschool for children with severe cerebral palsy. For over 6 years, Jeff \nspent much of his time around the school doing odd jobs for his dad. He \nwas deeply affected by this experience and by the interactions he had \nwith these students. It reinforced what he had been taught by his \nparents, that serving others is an important calling and virtue.\n  Mr. Sutton attended Williams College where he was a Lehman Scholar \nand varsity soccer player. He graduated with honors in history. After \ncollege, from 1985 to 1987, Mr. Sutton taught 7th grade geography and \n10th grade history while also serving as the coach of a high school \nvarsity soccer team and a middle school baseball team.\n  From there, he went on to law school and graduated first in his class \nfrom The Ohio State University College of Law, where he served as an \neditor of the Law Review. Mr. Sutton then clerked for Judge Thomas \nMeskill on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. From this \nposition, he went on to clerk for two U.S. Supreme Court justices--\nretired Justice Lewis Powell and Justice Antonin Scalia.\n  From 1995 to 1998, Mr. Sutton was the State Solicitor of Ohio, which \nis the State's top appellate lawyer.\n  During his service, the National Association of Attorneys General \npresented him with the Best Brief Award for practicing in the U.S. \nSupreme Court--a recognition he received an unprecedented four years in \na row.\n  Jeff Sutton is currently a partner in the Columbus law firm of Jones, \nDay, Reavis & Pogue. He is a member of the Columbus Bar Association, \nthe Ohio Bar Association, and the American Bar Association. He also has \nbeen an adjunct professor of law at The Ohio State University College \nof Law since 1994, where he teaches seminars on Federal and State \nconstitutional law.\n  Every lawyer who knows Jeff Sutton already knows he is one of the \nbest lawyers in the country. Recently, The American Lawyer confirmed \nthis by rating him one of its ``45 under 45''--that is, they named him \nas one of the top 45 lawyers in the country under the age of 45.\n  He has appeared frequently in court, having argued 12 cases before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, where he has a 9 and 3 record. In the Supreme \nCourt's 2000-2001 term, Mr. Sutton argued four cases--that's more cases \nthan any other private practitioner in the country. Can you imagine \npreparing to argue one case before the Supreme Court, much less four? \nMr. Sutton, by the way, won all four cases.\n  Mr. Sutton also has argued twelve cases before the Ohio Supreme \nCourt, six cases before various U.S. Courts of Appeals, and numerous \ncases before the State and Federal trial courts. And, over the years, \nMr. Sutton has been the lawyer for a range of clients on a wide range \nof issues.\n  Some of these cases were quite well known and at least one of them \nhas already been raised in debate here on the Floor. For example, he \nrepresented the State of Ohio in City of Boerne v. Flores, the State of \nFlorida in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, and the State of Alabama \nin University of Alabama v. Garrett.\n  While many of the cases that he has argued are well known, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to tell my colleagues about some of his \nlesser-known cases. Jeff Sutton represented Cheryl Fischer, a blind \nwoman who was denied admission to a State-run medical school in Ohio \nbecause of her disability.\n  He also represented the National Coalition of Students with \nDisabilities in a lawsuit alleging that Ohio universities were \nviolating the Federal ``motor voter'' law by failing to provide their \ndisabled students with voter-registration materials.\n  Jeff Sutton also defended Ohio's minority set-aside statute against \nconstitutional attack, and in another case he filed an amicus brief in \nthe Ohio Supreme Court defending Ohio's hate-crimes statute on behalf \nof the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, and an assortment of other \ncivil-rights groups. As this sampling of cases makes evident, Mr. \nSutton has represented a variety of clients in the course of his career \nas an appellate lawyer. I think it is important for Senators to \nremember this fact as we consider Mr. Sutton's nomination.\n  In addition to his professional work as a lawyer, Jeff Sutton has \nfound an extraordinary amount of time to give back to his community. \nBetween a demanding law practice and spending time with his wife Peggy \nand their three young children--Margaret, John, and Nathaniel--Mr. \nSutton serves on the Board of Trustees of the Equal Justice Foundation, \na non-profit provider of legal services to disadvantaged individuals \nand groups, including the disabled. He has spent considerable time \ndoing free legal work, averaging between 100 and 200 hours per year. He \nis an elder and deacon in the Presbyterian Church, as well as a Sunday \nschool teacher.\n  He participates in numerous other community activities, including ``I \nKnow I Can,'' which provides college scholarships to inner-city \nchildren, and ProMusica, a chamber music organization. He also coaches \nyouth soccer and basketball teams.\n  In conclusion, when considering Jeff Sutton's nomination, I encourage \nthe Senate to consider his broad range of life experiences, as well as \nhis stellar legal background. I also urge my colleagues to take into \naccount his testimony and the very straightforward way that he answered \nthe many questions posed to him during his confirmation hearing. He has \nbeen straightforward, and he has been frank with our committee. \nFinally, I encourage the Senate to consider Mr. Sutton's astute \ncharacterization of the role of a\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\nFederal judge. As he said, a Court of Appeals judge must try at all \ntimes to ``see the world through other people's eyes.''\n  I believe that is an excellent summary of one of the core \nresponsibilities of an appellate court judge.\n  Jeff Sutton understands well the skills and the temperament necessary \nto be a good federal judge. He has the intellect for the job, and I am \nconfident that he will approach his duties on the bench in a pragmatic, \ntempered, and thoughtful way. I strongly support his nomination and \nencourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just before we broke for the recess, I \nspoke here on the Senate floor for a short amount of time about the \nnomination of Jeffrey Sutton to be on the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals and about the deep concerns I have about this nomination. I \nwant to take more time today to explain my concerns that Mr. Sutton, I \ndon't believe, will be able to put aside his own deeply felt and deeply \nheld ideological views; that he will not be able to put aside his \ndetermination to be an activist judge and give people a fair and \nimpartial hearing, especially when it comes to cases dealing with civil \nrights and, more specifically, when it comes to cases dealing with \nrights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Sutton for over an hour and a \nhalf in my office. We had a great conversation. I found him to be very \npersonable. I listened to my friend from Ohio talking about how bright \nhe was, that he is an accomplished attorney. I will grant all of that. \nHe is a very bright, capable, and accomplished attorney. He has a great \nresume: Ohio State Law School, first in his class, and former Ohio \nSolicitor. He has argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he \nhas won many of them. But qualifications are just one aspect of whether \nor not a person ought to have a life tenure--think about it: life \ntenure--as a Federal judge.\n\n  Qualifications are certainly important, obviously. But that is only \none part of the equation. The other part has to deal with this person's \nviews. What is the historical analysis of what this person has both \nsaid and written in terms of how he would view his role as a Federal \njudge?\n  So, again, I think we have a responsibility as Senators to take into \naccount both the qualifications but also this other side of the agenda \nas to whether or not this person would be a Federal judge who could \ngive a fair and impartial hearing to those who come before him.\n  These are not occasions on which the Senate ought to just rubberstamp \na nominee. This nominee was brought up on the evening before we went \nout for the break. No one was here. Now it is a Monday, and there are \nno votes today, so Senators are drifting back from their 2-week spring \nrecess, and we are supposed to vote on Mr. Sutton tomorrow. I hope the \nmajority leader will allow us a little bit more time to discuss this \nrather than asking Senators just to rubberstamp this nominee.\n  I can tell you, after careful review of his advocacy, both inside and \noutside the courtroom, I am not convinced that Mr. Sutton would be able \nto put aside his personal agenda. I am not convinced that someone with \na disability rights or civil rights claim would get a fair shake from \nMr. Sutton. Especially, for me, I cannot support putting someone on a \nFederal bench who has worked to undermine the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n  Again, many of my colleagues know that when I first came to the \nSenate in the mid-1980s, I began to work, as I had done in the House, \nwith many disability groups around the country to finally address the \nglaring omission from the 1964 Civil Rights Act, that glaring omission \nbeing Americans with disabilities.\n  So at that time I became chairman of the Disabilities Subcommittee on \nthe then-Education, Labor, and Health Committee under the great \nleadership of Senator Kennedy. In fact, before I took over, it was \nSenator Lowell Weicker, a Republican, who had introduced the first \nversion of the Americans with Disabilities Act, who became a great \nchampion, and still is a great champion, for Americans with \ndisabilities. So it was really a bipartisan effort in those days to get \na civil rights bill through that closed that loophole of not having a \nFederal civil rights bill that covered people with disabilities.\n  As many of my colleagues knew at that time--maybe some do today--I \nhad a brother with whom I grew up who was deaf. I saw how he had been \ntreated as a child, growing up, and as an adult, and how he was \ndiscriminated against simply because he had a disability.\n  He was sent away at a young age halfway across the State of Iowa to \nattend the Iowa State School for the Deaf. In those days, they called \nit the ``School for the Deaf and the Dumb.'' As my brother once said: \n``I may be deaf, but I'm not dumb.'' But that is the way people were \ntreated. In other words, if you had a disability, you were segregated, \nyou were taken out of your home, out of your home community, without \nany consideration for the family or anything, and you were sent to an \ninstitution someplace; in this case, it was a school for the deaf.\n  While he was there, my brother was told he could be one of three \nthings: He could be a baker, a shoe cobbler, or a printer's assistant--\nand nothing else. Well, he did not want to be any of those, so they \nsaid: OK, you're going to be a baker.\n\n  Again, because he had a disability, because he could not hear, it \nwas, I guess, accepted or thought that people had to be told what to \ndo; they could not decide for themselves. Their horizons were limited. \nThat was the real world in which I grew up, the real world of what \nhappened to people with disabilities--travel, accommodations, jobs, \nemployment, everything.\n  So we in Congress began to look at this. What was it like in this \ncountry to be a person using a wheelchair? What was it like to be a \nperson with cerebral palsy? What was it like to be a person with \nblindness? What was it like to be a person who was deaf, like my \nbrother? What was it like? What were their lives like? How did they \nlive? And how did our Constitution cover them? Were they equal to us? \nWere they equal to the nondisabled community in America? Or were they \nsomehow discriminated against because of their disability?\n  We in Congress did not just rush through a law, like Mr. Sutton says. \nWe did not just have a bunch of staff with laptop computers and they \njust sort of turned it out. We laid the groundwork--years, years, years \nof accumulating data, of findings, of investigation, of hearings--a \nlegislative record fully documenting the overwhelming evidence that \ndiscrimination in this country against people with disabilities was \nrampant--not a little bit here, not a little bit there, but rampant.\n  At the time of the drafting of the ADA, we took care to make sure \nthat this important civil rights law had the findings and the \nconstitutional basis to pass muster with the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Here are some of the things we did: 25 years of studies by the \nCongress, going clear back to 1965 with the National Commission on \nArchitectural Barriers; in 1974, the White House Conference on \nHandicapped Individuals; in 1983, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission \npublished ``Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities,'' with \na comprehensive report on discrimination against people with \ndisabilities; in 1986, the National Council on Disabilities--I knew \nthem well; they were the first group I started to work with when I came \nto the Senate--15 appointees by then-President Reagan, and their report \ndocumenting pervasive discrimination and the need for an omnibus civil \nrights statute.\n  I am not going to go through them all, but, again: study after study, \n17 formal hearings by congressional committees and subcommittees, a \nmarkup by 5 separate committees, 63 public forums across the country, \noral and written testimony by the Attorney General of the United \nStates, Governors, State attorneys general, State legislators.\n  We had in excess of 300 examples of discrimination by State \ngovernments in the legislative record--300 examples--and yet in the \nGarrett case--I will speak more about that; and I was there; I was \nsitting in the Supreme Court the day Mr. Sutton argued the case there--\nMr. Sutton said--and I could not believe my ears when I heard\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\nit--he said there was really no evidence that this was needed, that \nbasically States were doing a pretty good job, that the ADA was not \nneeded. There were over 300 examples of discrimination by State \ngovernments.\n  It took the tireless work of Democrats and Republicans, and when it \npassed the Senate, it passed 91 to 6. That is pretty overwhelming \nsupport. In the House, it passed 403 to 20. Attorney General \nThornburgh, Republican Attorney General, the Chamber of Commerce, \nPresident Bush, the first one, stood with us. Why did we all stand \ntogether on the Americans with Disabilities Act? It was the right thing \nto do. Justice demanded it.\n  At the time he signed the ADA into law, President Bush had many good \nthings to say about it. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record \nPresident Bush's statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Remarks by the President During Ceremony for the Signing of the \n                Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990\n\n\n                             july 26, 1990\n\n       THE PRESIDENT: Evan, thank you so much. And welcome to \n     every one of you, out there in this splendid scene of hope, \n     spread across the South Lawn of the White House. I want to \n     salute the members of the United States Congress, the House \n     and the Senate who are with us today--active participants in \n     making this day come true. (Applause.)\n       This is, indeed, an incredible day. Especially for the \n     thousands of people across the nation who have given so much \n     of their time, their vision, and their courage to see this \n     Act become a reality.\n       You know, I started trying to put together a list of all \n     the people who should be mentioned today. But when the list \n     started looking a little longer than the Senate testimony for \n     the bill, I decided I better give up. or that we'd never get \n     out of here before sunset. So, even though so many deserve \n     credit, I will single out but a tiny handful. And I take \n     those who have guided me personally over the years.\n       Of course, my friends, Evan Kemp and Justine Dart up here \n     on the platform with me. (Applause.) And of course, I hope \n     you'll forgive me for also saying a special word of thanks to \n     two who--from the White House. But again, this is personal, \n     so I don't want to offend those omitted. Two from the White \n     House--Boyden Gray and Bill Roper, who labored long and hard. \n     (Applause.)\n       And I want to thank Sandy Parrino, of course, for her \n     leadership, and I again--(applause)--it is very risky with \n     all these members of Congress here who worked so hard. But I \n     can say on a very personal basis, Bob Dole inspired me. \n     (Applause.)\n       This is an immensely important day--a day that belongs to \n     all of you. Everywhere I look, I see people who have \n     dedicated themselves to making sure that this day would come \n     to pass. My friends from Congress, as I say who worked so \n     diligently with the best interest of all at heart, Democrats \n     and Republicans. Members of this administration--and I'm \n     pleased to see so many top officials and members of my \n     Cabinet here today who brought their caring and expertise to \n     this fight.\n       And then, the organizations. So many dedicated \n     organizations for people with disabilities who gave their \n     time and their strength and, perhaps most of all, everyone \n     out there and others across the breadth of this nation are 43 \n     million Americans with disabilities. You have made this \n     happen. All of you have made this happen. (Applause.)\n       To all of you, I just want to say your triumph is that your \n     bill will now be law, and that this day belongs to you. On \n     behalf of our nation, thank you very, very much. (Applause.)\n       Three weeks ago we celebrated our nation's Independence \n     Day. Today, we're here to rejoice in and celebrate another \n     ``Independence Day,'' one that is long overdue. With today's \n     signing of the landmark Americans for Disabilities Act, every \n     man, woman and child with a disability can now pass through \n     once-closed doors into a bright new era of equality, \n     independence and freedom.\n       As I look around at all these joyous faces, I remember \n     clearly how many years of dedicated commitment have gone into \n     making this historic civil rights Act a reality. It's been \n     the work of a true coalition. A strong and inspiring \n     coalition of people who have shared both a dream and a \n     passionate determination to make that dream come true. It's \n     been a coalition in the finest spirit. A joining of Democrats \n     and Republicans. Of the Legislative and the Executive \n     Branches. Of federal and state agencies. Of public officials \n     and private citizens. Of people with disabilities and \n     without.\n       This historic Act is the world's first comprehensive \n     declaration of equality for people with disabilities. The \n     first. (Applause.) Its passage has made the United States the \n     international leader on this human rights issue. Already, \n     leaders of several other countries, including Sweden, Japan, \n     the Soviet Union and all 12 members of the EEC, have \n     announced that they hope to enact now similar legislation. \n     (Applause.)\n       Our success with this Act proves that we are keeping faith \n     with the spirit of our courageous forefathers who wrote in \n     the Declaration of Independence: ``We hold these truths to be \n     self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are \n     endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.'' \n     These words have been our guide for more than two centuries \n     as we've labored to form our more perfect union. But \n     tragically, for too many Americans, the blessings of liberty \n     have been limited or even denied.\n       The Civil Rights Act of '64 took a bold step towards \n     righting that wrong. But the stark fact remained that people \n     with disabilities were still victims of segregation and \n     discrimination, and this was intolerable. Today's legislation \n     brings us closer to that day when no Americans will ever \n     again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life, liberty, \n     and the pursuit of happiness. (Applause.)\n       This Act is powerful in its simplicity. It will ensure that \n     people with disabilities are given the basic guarantees for \n     which they have worked so long and so hard. Independence, \n     freedom of choice, control of their lives, the opportunity to \n     blend fully and equally into the rich mosaic of the American \n     mainstream.\n       Legally, it will provide our disabled community with a \n     powerful expansion of protections and then basic civil \n     rights. It will guarantee fair and just access to the fruits \n     of American life which we all must be able to enjoy. And \n     then, specifically, first the ADA ensures that employers \n     covered by the Act cannot discriminate against qualified \n     individuals with disabilities. (Applause.) Second, the ADA \n     ensures access to public accommodations such as restaurants, \n     hotels, shopping centers and offices. And third, the ADA \n     ensures expanded access to transportation services. \n     (Applause.)\n       And fourth, the ADA ensures equivalent telephone services \n     for people with speech and hearing impediments. (Applause.) \n     These provisions mean so much to so many. To one brave girl \n     in particular, they will mean the world. Lisa Carl, a young \n     Washington State woman with cerebral palsy, who, I'm told is \n     with us today, now will always be admitted to here hometown \n     theater.\n       Lisa, you might not have been welcome at your theater, but \n     I'll tell you--welcome to the White House. We're glad you're \n     here. (Applause.) The ADA is a dramatic renewal, not only for \n     those with disabilities, but for all of us. Because along \n     with the precious privilege of being an American comes a \n     sacred duty--to ensure that every other American's rights are \n     also guaranteed.\n       Together, we must remove the physical barriers we have \n     created and the social barriers that we have accepted. For \n     ours will never be a truly prosperous nation until all within \n     it prosper. For inspiration, we need look no further than our \n     own neighbors. With us in that wonderful crowd out there are \n     people representing 18 of the daily points of light that I've \n     named for their extraordinary involvement with the disabled \n     community. We applaud you and your shining example. Thank you \n     for your leadership for all that are here today. (Applause.)\n       Now, let me just tell you a wonderful story--a story about \n     children already working the spirit of the ADA. A story that \n     really touched me. Across the nation, some 10,000 youngsters \n     with disabilities are part of Little League's Challenger \n     Division. Their teams play just like other, but--and this is \n     the most remarkable part--as they play at their sides are \n     volunteer buddies from conventional Little League teams. All \n     of these players work together. They team up to wheel around \n     the bases and to field grounders together and most of all, \n     just to play and become friends. We must let these children \n     be our guides and inspiration.\n       I also want to say a special word to our friends in the \n     business community. You have in your hands the key to the \n     success of this Act. For your can unlock a splendid resource \n     of untapped human potential that, when freed, will enrich us \n     all.\n       I know there have been concerns that the ADA may be vague \n     or costly, or may lead endlessly to litigation. But I want to \n     reassure you right now that my administration and the United \n     States Congress have carefully crafted this Act. We've all \n     been determined to ensure that it gives flexibility, \n     particularly in terms of the timetable of implementation; and \n     we've been committed to containing the costs that may be \n     incurred.\n       This Act does something important for American business \n     though, and remember this--you've called for new sources of \n     workers. Well, many of our fellow citizens with disabilities \n     are unemployed, they want to work and they can work. And this \n     is a tremendous pool of people. (Applause.) And remember this \n     is a tremendous pool of people who will bring to jobs \n     diversity, loyalty, proven low turnover rate, and only one \n     request, the chance to prove themselves.\n       And when you add together federal, state, local and private \n     funds, it costs almost $200 billion annually to support \n     Americans with disabilities, in effect, to keep them \n     dependent. Well, when given the opportunity to be \n     independent, they will move proudly into the economic \n     mainstream of American life, and that's what this legislation \n     is all about. (Applause.)\n       Our problems are large, but our unified heart is larger. \n     Our challenges are great, but our will is greater. And in our \n     America, the most generous, optimistic nation on the face of \n     the earth, we must not and will not rest until every man and \n     woman with a dream has the means to achieve it.\n       And today, America welcomes into the mainstream of life all \n     of our fellow citizens\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\n     with disabilities. We embrace you for your abilities and for \n     your disabilities, for our similarities and indeed for our \n     differences, for your past courage and your future dreams.\n       Last year, we celebrated a victory of international \n     freedom. Even the strongest person couldn't scale the Berlin \n     Wall to gain the elusive promise of independence that lay \n     just beyond. And so together we rejoiced when that barrier \n     fell.\n       And now I sign legislation which takes a sledgehammer to \n     another wall, one which has--(applause)--one which has, for \n     too many generations, separated Americans with disabilities \n     from the freedom they could glimpse, but not grasp. Once \n     again, we rejoice as this barrier falls for claiming together \n     we will not accept, we will not excuse, we will not tolerate \n     discrimination in America. (Applause.)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. A lot of the work we did is being termed irrelevant. \nSomehow, according to Mr. Sutton, we did not do enough. You may be \nwondering why I go into all of this. Mr. Sutton says we didn't have the \nfindings, basically.\n  When I look back on the Supreme Court decisions handed down in the \nlast few years, I am troubled that a lot of the work we have done on \ncivil rights over the last 30 years is in jeopardy. In particular, I \nsee a chipping away of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the bill \nthat symbolizes the inclusion of people in our society. Mr. Sutton has \nheld the hammer and the chisel.\n  That is why I am convinced Mr. Sutton does not possess all of the \nqualities needed to serve a life tenure on the Sixth Circuit. I am not \nconvinced that someone with a civil rights claim could walk in the \ncourtroom and be confident they will get a fair shake.\n  It is not the person himself that troubles me. It is his ideology. It \nis where he is coming from. It is what he has said and written and \nadvocated. He has advocated for the proposition that civil rights \nprotections for persons with disabilities belongs in the hands of each \nof the 50 separate States. His arguments before the Supreme Court \narticulate that States can do a better job of it than Congress and that \nwe did not find enough evidence.\n  We found the evidence, and it is there in the record. I don't know \nhow anyone in the real world could say: Disability discrimination in a \nconstitutional sense is really difficult to show.\n  That is what Jeffrey Sutton said on National Public Radio October 11, \n2000. You will hear a lot of talk, probably today and leading up to the \nvote tomorrow, that Jeffrey Sutton was representing his clients. He \nsaid this on National Public Radio. He was not representing a client. \nHe said: It is really difficult to show disability discrimination in a \nconstitutional sense.\n  The unfortunate history of unequal treatment of persons with \ndisabilities in our country has been locked away in institutions for \nyears: People with mental disabilities are subjected to involuntary \nsterilization; persons with severe hearing loss labeled, as my brother, \ndeaf and dumb; and for way too many years, those who were blind forced \nto sell pencils on the street corner for a living.\n  Mr. Sutton seems to have an extremely limited view of our authority \nas Congress to legislate in this important civil rights area, as well \nas others. From his arguments before the Supreme Court, he seems to \nbelieve each State does its job to protect the constitutional rights of \npersons with disabilities as the State sees fit. After what I saw, what \nI heard after all these many years, all the hearings and the record, I \ncan't fathom anyone would actually reach the conclusion that the States \nwere doing a good job protecting people with disabilities. Some States, \nyes, had pretty decent laws on the books covering people with \ndisabilities. Other States did not.\n  But I ask, as an American citizen, as a citizen of the United States, \nshould your civil rights depend on your address? Should your civil \nrights depend on the State in which you happen to live?\n  I believe the Constitution and civil rights cover us all. And what we \nfound during all these years, all the hearings, the record, was that \nthere was a patchwork quilt of laws around the country so if you were \nin a State, maybe, that didn't have very good laws and protection of \npeople with disabilities, the only way you could ensure your civil \nrights was to move to another State. I don't believe that is what the \nConstitution intends when it covers all Americans with civil rights.\n\n  Again, people will say: Mr. Sutton was just defending his clients. He \nwas duty bound to advocate on behalf of his clients.\n  I am a lawyer. I know the professional code of conduct. But that \ndoesn't tell the whole story. Mr. Sutton has written articles, \nparticipated in radio talk shows and panel discussions, where he has \nexpressed his own personal views--not his clients', his views. That \nkind of publicity is not required by his role as a lawyer advocating on \nbehalf of clients. It is clear to me this lifetime appointment would be \ndetrimental to the civil rights that protect all Americans. He \nzealously advocates for States rights at the expense of individual \nrights. Persons with disabilities, senior workers, people of color, and \nunderprivileged children deserve better.\n  More than 400 disability rights and civil rights groups agree. This \nchart depicts that. More than 400 have come out in opposition to Mr. \nSutton being on the Sixth Circuit.\n  Jeffrey Sutton did not have to talk to the Legal Times about his \npursuit of federalism cases. I want to speak about not the clients he \nhas represented but what he said outside of the courtroom. In a \nNovember 2, 1998 article, the reporter writes that Mr. Sutton told him \nhe and his staff were ``always on the lookout for cases coming before \nthe court that raise issues of federalism or will affect local and \nState government interests.'' He is quoted as saying:\n\n       It doesn't get me invited to cocktail parties, but I love \n     these issues. I believe in this federalism stuff.\n\n  From the cases he has aggressively pursued, his view is that State \npower trumps the rights of U.S. citizens. I believe in States rights, \ntoo, to do certain things. One of the geniuses of our system is 50 \ndifferent States experimenting in doing things. But when it comes to \nbasic human rights, civil rights, we are all U.S. citizens. As I said, \nwe should not let a State decide what our civil rights are. That is \ndecided by the Constitution. My freedom of speech should not depend on \nwhether I am in Iowa or California or Georgia or wherever. It is the \nfact that I am a U.S. citizen, here in this country. The Bill of Rights \ncovers us all regardless of the State in which we may happen to live.\n  On National Public Radio he said:\n\n       As with age discrimination, disability discrimination in a \n     constitutional sense is really very difficult to show.\n  That was on National Public Radio, October 11, 2000. I guess, \naccording to Mr. Sutton, all of the hearings we had, all of the \nmarkups, all of the public forums, all of the witnesses, all of the \nexamples, do not mean a thing. What matters to him is his narrow view \nthat it is up to the States to take care of this.\n  Now, again, on that same NPR radio broadcast, Mr. Sutton said:\n\n       I think it's a positive attribute of this system of divided \n     government that when 51 different sovereigns [including the \n     District of Columbia there], 51 different legislatures [we \n     don't have that here in the District of Columbia] tackle a \n     difficult social problem, they all arrive at different \n     approaches, and the ultimate idea and really transcendent \n     purpose of federalism is to have them compete for the best \n     solution.\n\n  He wasn't representing a client here. These are his own personal \nviews. What happens when a State wins in these competitions? Do they \nget a prize? What about the people who are in the ``losing'' States? \nAre they out of luck? As I said before, do they have to move to another \nState?\n  After listening to all of the testimony on the ADA over a several \nyears period of time, I find it hard to believe the 50 States were \ncompeting for the best solution on disability discrimination.\n  In 1997, Mr. Sutton served as a moderator for a panel discussion \nsponsored by the Federalist Society. As the moderator, Mr. Sutton \ncriticized States for sacrificing ``federalist principles in order to \nobtain near-term politically favored results.''\n  I am not certain I know what that means, but I do know it is an \nopinion. He wasn't representing a client. It is his opinion. I think it \nis an opinion that State officials should challenge things like the ADA \nand civil rights laws that cover the elderly, and the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\n  According to Mr. Sutton, the reason they don't contest a lot of this \nis because they don't want to upset the respective constituency with \nwhat those constituents would probably consider bad policy. I can think \nof a lot of people in my State who would consider it bad policy to \nallow discrimination against people with disabilities. Mr. Sutton said \nhe was ``frustrated that, in the pursuit of particular political goals, \nthe States are not rising up together and defending their authority \nagainst the encroachments by Congress.'' Frustrated? To me, that is a \npersonal opinion, a personal emotion. I think the majority of us \nexperience frustration when someone is adamant about disagreeing with \nus. We get frustrated when someone doesn't agree with our point of \nview. So he is ``frustrated that States are not rising up together''--\nthese are his words--``and defending their authority against \nencroachments by Congress.''\n  If he is frustrated, he must think that is what they should do. Maybe \nhe is agitated because the States and Federal civil rights laws are \ndifferent than what he would want. Maybe most States don't see them as \nencroachments on their State authority.\n  A lot of States are not joining in his extreme views on congressional \nauthority to pass civil rights laws. Some States see it differently \nthan Mr. Sutton. Fourteen State attorneys general signed on in support \nof Patricia Garrett in Garrett v. Alabama. Arizona, Connecticut, \nIllinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New \nMexico, New York, North Dakota, Vermont, and Washington wrote saying \nthat Congress had the authority to enact the ADA. The 14 States I just \nnamed opposed Alabama's position represented and argued by Mr. Sutton.\n  Mr. Sutton seemed to favor a States rights philosophy in civil rights \nbased on a personal opinion about what Congress is and what Congress \ndoes and how we do our work. Listen to this on the Violence Against \nWomen Act, on which we had extensive findings that supported the \npassage of that law. He said in an article for the Federalist Society--\nagain not representing a client, but in his own writing:\n\n       Unexamined deference to the VAWA [Violence Against Women \n     Act] factfindings . . . would give to any congressional \n     staffer with a laptop the ultimate Marbury power--to have the \n     final say over what amounts to interstate commerce. . . .\n\n  Evidently, we Senators and Congressmen, with all these hearings, all \nof the investigations, all of the public forums, all of the testimony \nwe have, all of the examples we have compiled--it doesn't mean \nanything. Evidently, we don't do that. We just have staffers with \nlaptops and they churn out civil rights legislation.\n  Finally, in another article for the Federalist Society in 2001, Mr. \nSutton stated his belief that federalism is a ``zero-sum'' situation in \nwhich either a State or Federal lawmaking prerogative ``must fall.'' He \nwrote:\n\n       The National Government in these types of cases invariably \n     becomes the State's loss and vice versa.\n\n  Think about that. Passing the Americans with Disabilities Act becomes \na State's loss. How can Mr. Sutton hold such a view, that we break down \nthe barriers of discrimination long held in our society against people \nwith disabilities; and he says the Federal Government wins, the State \ngovernments lose. Well, quite frankly, we all saw it differently--\nRepublicans and Democrats. We saw this as a win-win. Everyone wanted \nthis. American citizens wanted it when we broke down these barriers. \nStatutes like the ADA set a minimum bar for the country. States can \nalways do more, but we passed a minimum bar. To me, that is not a zero-\nsum game. I don't see the Federal Government winning and States losing \non that. I see all of us winning when we become a more inclusive \nsociety.\n  So, again, it is not Mr. Sutton's clients who are driving these \nissues. It is not just the fact that Mr. Sutton advocated for his \nclients, as we will hear and have heard and will continue to hear. It \nis what Mr. Sutton himself believes. It is how he feels. It is his \nviews on whether or not we here in the Congress have the authority to \npass civil rights legislation. According to him, no, we don't. The \nrecord, Mr. President, was replete. We didn't just pass it overnight, \nas I said.\n  We had case after case after case, and I can mention a few. There was \nthe zookeeper who would not admit a child with mental retardation to \nthe zoo because it would upset the chimpanzees. Another child with \ncerebral palsey was kept out of school because the teacher said his \nappearance ``nauseated'' his classmates.\n  What does all this discrimination do to those children with \ndisabilities as they grow up? We had a woman who said:\n\n       We can just go on so long constantly reaching dead ends. I \n     am broke, degraded, angry, and have attempted suicide three \n     times. I know hundreds. Most of us try, but which way and \n     where can we go?\n\n  Well, in Mr. Sutton's America, she cannot go to the U.S. Congress. \nDespite all of the evidence, Congress did not have the power to pass \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act because of States rights. We \nappointed a task force, led by Justin Dart. We went all over the Nation \nand had 63 meetings, as I said. Justin Dart heard from over 8,000 \npeople in 50 States. He gathered stacks and stacks of letters into \nevidence. Just as an example from a health administrator who is blind. \nHe wrote:\n\n       When I walked into the office of one department head, he \n     looked at me and said, ``Ah--if I knew you were blind, I \n     wouldn't have bothered bringing you in for an interview.''\n\n  Prior to the ADA, that was all right. A person could be denied a job \nbecause he was blind, even though he was fully qualified for it.\n  We have to go back to July 26, 1990. Well, let's go back to July 25, \n1990. On July 25, 1990, if one was a person of color, say an African \nAmerican, and they saw an ad in the paper for a job for which they were \nqualified, and they went down to interview for this job and their \nprospective employer took a look at them and said, get out of here, I \nam not hiring black people--probably would have used a word worse than \nthat--on July 25 of 1990, he could have walked out of that door, gone \nright down the street to the courthouse and filed a lawsuit for a \nviolation of his civil rights.\n  The same day, July 25, 1990, a person using a wheelchair sees an ad \nin the paper for a job for which they are qualified. They roll their \nwheelchair down there, go in the door, and the prospective employer \nlooks at them and says, get out of here; I am not hiring your kind; \ncripples, get out of here. I do not want anybody like you around here. \nThe person rolled their wheelchair out of there and went down to the \ncourthouse on July 25, 1990, but guess what, the courthouse door was \nlocked. They could not get in because they had no cause of action.\n  On July 25, 1990, as it had been for hundreds of years before, to \ndiscriminate against a person on the basis of their disability was not \na violation of their civil rights. But on July 26, 1990, after \nPresident Bush signed it into law, if a person rolled their wheelchair \ndown there and someone said, get out of here; I am not hiring people in \nwheelchairs, they could roll their wheelchair down to the courthouse \ndoor and, just like African Americans, or national origin, religion, or \nsex, they could then get in the courthouse door. Think about that. \nBefore that, they could not do anything.\n  I will be honest and say some States did have certain laws on the \nbooks that might have protected people with disabilities. A lot of \nStates did not. That is why we found this patchwork quilt. So a \nperson's civil rights depended upon what State they lived in. We said, \nthat is not correct. We said, that should not be so.\n  Well, Mr. Sutton's view that the Americans with Disabilities Act is \nnot needed would turn us back to July 25, 1990, where one could be \ndiscriminated against.\n  I suppose Mr. Sutton might say, well, that was then; this is now. \nStates are more enlightened now. Surely they would not do anything like \nthat now.\n  A couple of years ago--I think 4 years ago, if I am not mistaken--\nPatricia Garrett, from Alabama, had breast cancer. Patricia Garrett is \nright here in this picture. She went for medical attention, had \nsurgery, chemotherapy, and then she returned to her work as a nursing \nsupervisor.\n  Her boss wanted to get rid of her, not because she could not do her \njob but because her boss did not like having people around who were \nsick and had cancer. So Mrs. Garrett lost her job. She had to take a \nlower-paying job, but she decided to fight back. This was in 1997.\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\n  Six years later, she is still fighting in the courts about whether \nCongress had the ability to pass a law that applied to her because \nAlabama did not. She had to litigate whether Congress could pass the \nADA.\n  Just as an aside, now Alabama claims she cannot sue under the Rehab \nAct either.\n  The Garrett case had to do with whether or not Congress had the power \nto pass Title I of the ADA so it applied to all the States. Mr. Sutton \nargued for Alabama and against Mrs. Garrett that all 50 States had laws \nabout disability discrimination and therefore Federal laws were not \nneeded. Mrs. Garrett's case today shows why that argument is so wrong \nand why it is so harmful to individuals whose civil rights are being \nviolated.\n\n  Mrs. Garrett could not have sued her employer, the University of \nAlabama, using State law. The State of Alabama had no enforceable law. \nThey had some nice policy statements but no law. That is why we had to \npass the ADA.\n  As I said earlier, and I will keep saying it, one's civil rights \nshould not depend on their address. It is the role of Congress to enact \nnational legislation to protect people from discrimination wherever \nthey might live.\n  Mrs. Garrett did not want to rely on her State for her civil rights. \nShe said:\n\n       Mr. Sutton has described the relationship between Congress \n     and the States as a zero sum game where only one side can \n     win. It is distressing that someone with this view could be \n     nominated as a Federal appeals judge. In Mr. Sutton's eyes, \n     I, and others with disabilities, seem to be pawns in a game \n     of power between the Federal Government and the States.\n\n  That was Mrs. Garrett at a press conference last month. Mrs. Garrett, \nand the millions of Americans with disabilities, do not want to be \npawns in a power game. They want Federal civil rights laws to apply to \nthem no matter where they live. They want Federal civil rights laws \nthat protect them from a boss who does not like sick people or a \npotential boss who would not even consider them because of their \ndisability.\n  The 14th amendment of the Constitution gives Congress the power to \nprovide that protection. The whole point of it is to give Congress the \nability to do something when individuals are denied their rights and \ntreated unequally as U.S. citizens. In my mind, that was the original \nintent of the amendment.\n  So, again, when one listens to Mr. Sutton, what he said--and again, \nthis is not a court case. This is Mr. Sutton outside the courtroom. He \nsaid:\n\n       I think it is a positive attribute of this system of \n     divided government that when 51 different sovereigns, 51 \n     different legislatures tackle a difficult social problem, \n     they all arrive at different approaches.\n\n  Mr. Sutton said that on the radio, not in a courtroom with a client, \nbut of himself he said that. So what does this mean? Does this mean Mr. \nSutton thinks it is a positive outcome--let's see, what did he say? He \nsaid, a positive attribute. Does he think it is a positive attribute \nthat Mrs. Garrett is out of luck in Alabama, but she would be in luck \nif she lived in another State? Is that a positive attribute?\n  Should Mrs. Garrett have to move to another State to have her civil \nrights enforced because some States enforce it more than others or have \nlaws on the books, leave her home, leave her friends, leave her family \nin Alabama to go somewhere else?\n  In our Senate report, Harold Russell, the chairman of the President's \nCommittee on the Employment of People with Disabilities, said:\n\n       The 50 State Governors' Committees with whom the \n     President's committee works report that existing State laws \n     do not adequately cover such acts of discrimination.\n\n  The 50 States Governors' Committees with whom the President's \ncommittee works report that existing State laws do not adequately cover \nsuch acts of discrimination against people with disabilities.\n  According to Mr. Sutton, Congress should not have the power to make \nthat determination and people with disabilities have to just hope their \nState is going to take care of them.\n  Perry Tillman, a Vietnam veteran, testified before a Senate \nsubcommittee, and he said: ``I did my job when I was called on by my \ncountry. Now it is your job and the job of everyone in Congress to make \nsure that when I lost the use of my legs in battle, I did not lose my \nability to achieve my dreams.''\n  Under Mr. Sutton's theory of federalism, Mr. Tillman would still be \nwaiting for the American with Disabilities Act to help him achieve his \ndreams.\n  Mr. Sutton has a clear lack of understanding of Congress's role in \ncivil rights laws. Should we put on the Federal bench for life a \nnominee who basically says staffers with laptops are deciding what the \nConstitution of the United States says by relying upon the 14th \namendment to the Constitution?\n  I may have my differences with Senators on one side of the aisle or \nthe other. We have good healthy debates here. We may not view \neverything the same. I think that is healthy. I don't know of laws that \nare passed of this magnitude that cover civil rights that are not \nthoroughly investigated, aired, hearings, reports, findings, over a \nlong period of time. It is not just some, as he said, ``staffer with a \nlaptop.''\n  We found time and time again that there were reasons to have this \nlaw. We found discrimination against individuals persisting in critical \nareas of employment in the private sector as well as the public sector, \nas well as State government. I cannot understand why Mr. Sutton feels \nthat after all this we should have not only the right but the \nresponsibility to do something. Mr. Sutton has a narrow view because he \nbelieves this ought to be only in the States and not the Federal \nGovernment. That would be a dangerous precedent to set.\n  Let's look at the Olmstead case. Mr. Sutton did not argue this case \nbut he wrote the brief for it. Let's think what would happen in the \nOlmstead case if Mr. Sutton's view prevailed.\n  In the Olmstead case, in Georgia, two women brought suit, arguing \nthat their needless confinement in a mental institution violated the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Mr. Sutton wrote the brief for that \ncase for the State of Georgia. Under his theory, the ADA did not \nspecifically address needless confinement of people with disabilities. \nImagine that. He wrote, ``The issue of deinstitutionalization simply \nwas not before Congress, was not raised by Congress, was not debated by \nCongress during the adoption of the ADA.'' That is what Mr. Sutton said \nin his brief.\n  Mr. Sutton may be a bright individual but he did not do his homework \non this one. One does not have to look further than the findings of the \nADA to see that Congress addressed this issue precisely when we passed \nthe ADA. Our findings specifically state: ``Discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as \ninstitutionalization.'' Mr. Sutton says it was not raised by Congress. \nIt was. We said it. Either Mr. Sutton is ignoring this or he simply did \nnot do his homework, and whoever did his research did not do good \nresearch.\n  We in Congress also specifically found ``individuals with \ndisabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination \nincluding segregation.'' Institutionalization, segregation--that is \nwhat we found. Mr. Sutton says that is not enough. Once again, Mr. \nSutton was ignoring our specific findings, arguing somehow that we had \nnot done enough to show that we meant to end the practice of needlessly \nlocking people in institutions.\n  Listen to this argument of Mr. Sutton. He said the discrimination \n``necessarily requires uneven treatment of similarly situated \nindividuals.'' In other words, you have to show that people without \ndisabilities were treated better than people with disabilities. He \nwrites, ``no class of similarly situated people were even identified.''\n\n  But the Court said no. The Court said dissimilar treatment \ncorrespondingly exists in this key respect. In order to receive needed \nmedical services, persons with mental disabilities must, because of \nthose disabilities, relinquish participation in community life they \ncould enjoy given reasonable accommodations, while persons without \nmental disabilities can receive the medical services they need without \nsimilar sacrifice.\n  For Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson, two women in this case, if Mr. \nSutton's views had prevailed, they still would be locked up. Lois spent \nmost of her life in an institution, since the age of 14. Elaine had \nbeen living in a locked ward of a psychiatric hospital for over a year. \nShe told the district court judge in the case that when she lived in \nthe institution she felt like she was sitting\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\nin a little box with no way out. Day after day, the same routine, same \nfour walls. No wonder Elaine felt like she was in a little box. The ADA \nwas designed to break apart that box. So Elaine and Lois brought suit \nunder the ADA, arguing that their segregation was discrimination.\n  As I mentioned, our findings in the ADA clearly stated that people \nwith disabilities continually encounter various forms of \ndiscrimination, including segregation, and that discrimination persists \nin critical areas such as institutionalization.\n  Fortunately, the Supreme Court disagreed with the State of Georgia \nand with Mr. Sutton. The Court talked about the two reasons, to \nconclude that needless segregation is discrimination.\n  First, needless segregation perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that \npersons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in \ncommunity life; second, that confinement in an institution diminishes \nthe everyday activities of individuals. The Court was focusing on what \nmatters and how it affects real people.\n  I mentioned that Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson were institutionalized \nfor many, many years. How do they live today? Elaine now lives in a \nhouse with a caretaker and a friend. Elaine shops, chooses her own \nclothes, attends family events and celebrations. Lois has close friends \nin her group home. She visits them all, picks out her own clothes, has \nfavorite meals, plans a menu. At a hearing in the case, Lois and Elaine \nspoke of the little things that have changed. They can make Kool-Aid \nwhen they want to make it. They can go outside and take walks anywhere \nthey want to go. We all take it for granted that we are going to choose \nwhat we eat, what we drink, what clothes we are going to put on in the \nmorning, and where we are going to go to take a walk. But those kinds \nof ordinary activities are not ordinary if you are in an institution \nand someone else dictates every aspect of your life.\n\n  In Mr. Sutton's world, Elaine and Lois would still be living in the \ninstitution. You know what Mr. Sutton would say? I am sure he would \nsay: Gee, that's just too bad, but that's the State law. That is the \nGeorgia State law.\n  What are Elaine and Lois supposed to do, move? They are locked up in \na mental hospital. They are locked up in wards. They cannot even leave \nof their own volition. That is Mr. Sutton's world--tough, tough that \nthey have to live in a State where they institutionalize people. That \nis why we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, to get people out \nof institutions, to get them into the communities and give some dignity \nand value to their lives outside an institution. That is precisely why \nwe passed the ADA. But Mr. Sutton says: Sorry, Congress did not have \nthe authority to do that.\n  We all know the law can be a straitjacket if that is the way you want \nto interpret the law or the law can give you freedom, the ability to \ndevelop and grow and expand your horizons, to have dreams and be able \nto live out your dreams. The law can do that or the law can shatter \nyou. The law can put you in an institution. The law can send you to the \nState school for the deaf and dumb.\n  Mr. Sutton's view is that narrow view of law that, if the State \ndoesn't do it, you are out of luck. But as I said, after it is all \nover, we are all U.S. citizens, and our civil rights should not depend \non where we live.\n  That is why I have taken this time and will take some more time to \ntalk about Mr. Sutton and why he should not be approved to sit on the \nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Sometimes these are tough decisions. As I said, I met with Mr. \nSutton. He seems like a fine individual. He would probably be a good \nneighbor. That is not the point. When he puts on that robe for life and \nhe sits on that circuit court, Elaine Curtis or Lois Wilson or Pat \nGarrett--what are their chances if they have to appear before Mr. \nSutton?\n  Every time I read the things Mr. Sutton has said about inadequate \nfindings, leaving it to the States, I am reminded what Justice Thurgood \nMarshall said in his concurring opinion in City of Cleburne:\n\n       A regime of state-mandated segregation and degradation soon \n     emerged that in its virulence and bigotry rivaled, and indeed \n     paralleled the worst excesses of Jim Crow. Massive custodial \n     institutions were built to warehouse the retarded for life . \n     . . Many disabled children were categorically excluded from \n     public schools based on the false stereotypes that all were \n     uneducable, and on the purported need to protect nondisabled \n     children from them. State laws deemed the retarded ``unfit \n     for citizenship.''\n\n  Justice Marshall further pointed out:\n\n       The mentally retarded have been subject to a lengthy and \n     tragic history of segregation and discrimination that can \n     only be called grotesque.\n\n  That is what we were facing when finally the Congress of the United \nStates stepped up and passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nPeople were institutionalized, segregated, taken from their families, \ntaken from their communities, excluded from going to school. I can't \ntell you how many people I have met in my sojourn through all these \nyears of fighting for disability rights--I can't tell you how \nmany people I have met with cerebral palsy whose bodies didn't work \nright and maybe they couldn't control their muscles, maybe their heads \nhung down, maybe they drooled, maybe they couldn't communicate \nverbally, but inside that body was a brilliant mind with the capability \nto contribute to our society. They had the ability to dream and to live \nout those dreams. Yet they were excluded from education simply because \nthey had cerebral palsy.\n\n  If you haven't seen the movie ``My Left Foot,'' which came out almost \n20 years ago now, I think you ought to see it. That was exactly the \ncase there. The person could only use his left foot to write, but what \na brilliant writer he became. And he was excluded simply because he had \na disability.\n  As I said earlier, how many blind people were confined to selling \npencils? How many people using a wheelchair were discriminated against \nbecause they wouldn't make a minor modification at a workplace so that \nperson could do the job?\n  We take curb cuts for granted. We take ramping for granted. We take \nwide doors for granted. It was not too many years ago there were not \nany curb cuts and there were not ramps and there were not wide doors \nand there were not accessible bathrooms.\n  My nephew Kelly was injured in the line of duty in the military. He \nbecame a quadriplegic. While I have seen how society had discriminated \nagainst my brother who was deaf, I guess I had not realized the \ndiscrimination in our society against someone using a wheelchair until \nI saw what Kelly had to go through just to get an education. They \ndidn't have ramps. If the class was on the third floor and they didn't \nhave an elevator--tough luck; he couldn't take the class. If it was in \na building where there were steps and there was not a ramp--tough luck; \nhe would have to go someplace else--going into a restaurant; going to a \nmovie theater just to watch a movie, be turned away; we don't allow \nwheelchairs in here; out of here. Get out of here; you can't watch a \nmovie. Later on, they would have a place up in the back to put a few \nwheelchairs, if they came. But you couldn't sit with your friends and \nyour family. I saw what they had to go through. That is why we passed \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. Some States had better laws than \nothers. One would have to kind of look and see which States are best \nfor this law and that law, and move there away from their family, \nfriends, and community. Things are a lot better. But we didn't get that \nway because we relied upon 50 different States in passing 50 different \nlaws dealing with disabilities. We got there because the U.S. Congress \nsaw its responsibility to break down the barriers of discrimination and \nto for once and for all say people with disabilities are every bit as \nmuch of an American as you, me, or anybody else; that there shouldn't \nbe artificial barriers and real barriers; and that there should be \naccommodations made.\n\n  Mr. Sutton says we didn't have enough findings. He said the ADA was \nnot needed. Tell Pat Garrett that. Tell Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson \nthat the ADA wasn't needed to get them out of the institutions they \nwere in and to give them their freedom as human beings and as American \ncitizens to live outside of an institution. Tell them that the ADA was \nnot needed. Tell my nephew Kelly that the Americans with Disabilities \nAct wasn't needed.\n  Mr. Sutton can say all he wants and people here can argue, Well, he \nwas\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\njust representing his clients. But as I have said and will continue to \npoint out, it wasn't just his clients. It was what he said and what he \nwrote outside of the courtroom.\n  I believe also his opinions and his views are that Congress doesn't \nhave this power--this right--to pass civil rights legislation.\n  In The Legal Times, as I said, on November 2, 1998, Mr. Sutton was \nquoted as saying, ``It doesn't get me invited to cocktail parties. But \nI love these issues. I believe in federalism stuff.''\n  He said on National Public Radio--not in a court case but on National \nPublic Radio--``As with age discrimination, disability discrimination \nin a constitutional sense is really very difficult to show.''\n  Seventeen hearings, 5 committee markups, 63 public forums across the \ncountry, 8,000 pages of transcripts, oral and written testimony from \nthe Attorney General of the United States, Governors, State Attorneys \nGeneral, legislators--on and on--and he said it is difficult to show.\n  As I said, it is either clear that he doesn't understand how Congress \nworks or he understands but disdains what we do here in the area of \ncivil rights and civil liberties.\n  These comments and others seem to suggest Mr. Sutton was doing much \nmore than merely advocating a response, and, in fact, reveal an extreme \nview of federalism that promotes State power over the rights--the civil \nrights--of a U.S. citizen.\n  I know it is said, Well, Mr. Sutton has represented the other side, \nbut we have looked and we have not found any case Mr. Sutton has taken \nthat would be on the opposite side of States rights--not one. My friend \nfrom Utah said Mr. Sutton represented people with disabilities and sits \non a board that looks out for the interests of people with \ndisabilities. I took a look at that. Mr. Sutton, for the Record, did \nrepresent the National Coalition for Students with Disabilities in a \ncase brought in Federal district court, alleging that the Ohio \nSecretary of State violated the National Voter Registration Act \nregarding voter registration sites for persons with disabilities. The \ncase was filed on November 6, 2000. Mr. Sutton was nominated for the \nSixth Circuit vacancy on May 9, 2001, and it appears Mr. Sutton did not \nbecome the attorney of record until April 26, 2002.\n  It was said earlier by my friend from Ohio that Mr. Sutton \nrepresented Cheryl Fischer in her attempt to gain admission to Case \nWestern University Medical School. Ms. Fischer, who is blind, dreamed \nof becoming a psychiatrist. The university wouldn't admit her to \nmedical school because of her disability. Yes. Mr. Sutton worked on \nthis case. But he did not represent Cheryl Fischer. As Ohio's \nsolicitor, Mr. Sutton represented the Ohio Civil Rights Commission \nbecause it was his job. Cheryl Fischer's attorney was Thomas Andrew \nDowning.\n  Again, I know others are on the floor to speak and I don't want to \nhold up the floor any longer. But I think it is clear that all Mr. \nSutton has said, all that he has written, and views espoused by him, \ngive us nothing other than a portrait of an individual with extreme \nviews on States rights--a person who will be an activist judge, a \nperson who is an ideologue.\n  I quote from the New York Times editorial of this morning entitled \n``Another Ideologue for the Courts.''\n\n       Mr. Sutton argued a landmark disability rights case in the \n     Supreme Court. Patricia Garrett, a nurse at an Alabama state \n     hospital, asserted that her employer fired her because she \n     had breast cancer, violating the Americans With Disabilities \n     Act. Mr. Sutton argued that the act did not protect state \n     employees like Ms. Garrett. His states'-rights argument \n     narrowly won over the court, and deprived millions of state \n     workers of legal protection. He also invoked federalism to \n     urge the court to strike down the Violence Against Women Act. \n     It did so, 5 to 4, dismantling federal protection for sexual \n     assault victims. Mr. Sutton has said that he was only doing \n     his job, and that his concern was building a law practice, \n     not choosing sides. But throughout his career, he has taken \n     on major cases that advance the conservative agenda. He has \n     left little doubt in his public statements that he supports \n     these rulings.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 28, 2003]\n\n                    Another Ideologue for the Courts\n\n       It seems likely that Jeffrey Sutton, a nominee to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in \n     Cincinnati, will be confirmed by the Senate this week. But it \n     is important to recognize why he was selected, and how he \n     fits the Bush administration's plan for an ideological \n     takeover of the courts. Whichever way the Senate votes on \n     him, it must insist that the administration start selecting \n     judges who do not come with a far-right agenda.\n       There is no shortage of worthy judicial nominees. Federal \n     courts are filled with district court judges, Republicans and \n     Democrats, who have shown evenhandedness and professionalism, \n     and many would make fine appeals court judges. State courts \n     are overflowing with judges and lawyers known for their \n     excellence, not their politics.\n       The Bush administration, however, has sought nominees whose \n     main qualification is a commitment to far-right ideology, Mr. \n     Sutton is the latest example. He is an activist for \n     ``federalism,'' a euphemism for a rigid states'-rights legal \n     philosophy. Although federalism commands a narrow majority on \n     the Supreme Court, advocates like Mr. Sutton are taking the \n     law in a disturbing direction, depriving minorities, women \n     and the disabled of important rights.\n       Mr. Sutton argued a landmark disability rights case in the \n     Supreme Court. Patricia Garrett, a nurse at an Alabama state \n     hospital, asserted that her employer fired her because she \n     had breast cancer, violating the Americans With Disabilities \n     Act. Mr. Sutton argued that the act did not protect state \n     employees like Ms. Garrett. His states'-rights argument \n     narrowly won over the court, and deprived millions of state \n     workers of legal protection. He also invoked federalism to \n     urge the court to strike down the Violence Against Women Act. \n     It did so, 5 to 4, dismantling federal protection for sexual \n     assault victims. Mr. Sutton has said that he was only doing \n     his job, and that his concern was building a law practice, \n     not choosing sides. But throughout his career, he has taken \n     on major cases that advance the conservative agenda. He has \n     left little doubt in his public statements that he supports \n     these rulings.\n       At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sutton faced protesters \n     with guide dogs and wheelchairs, who were upset about his \n     role in rolling back disability law. Naturally, they urged \n     the Senate to reject him. But the senators' duty to advise \n     and consent goes beyond their vote on any particular nominee. \n     They must make it clear that in a nation brimming with legal \n     talent, it is unacceptable to focus the search for federal \n     judges on a narrow group of idealogues.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, no doubt Mr. Sutton is a very bright \nindividual. He is very capable. He has argued cases before the Supreme \nCourt. I don't argue his qualifications--not a bit. But I do argue his \nviews--his views which, if he is permitted to take a seat on the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, I believe would mean that when Mrs. Garrett \nor my nephew Kelly or other people with disabilities walked into that \ncourtroom, or wheeled their chairs into that courtroom--that Mr. Sutton \nwouldn't see a person. He would not see the years and years of \ndiscrimination against people with disabilities. He would not see what \nthat individual person has to put up with day after day.\n\n  He would only see one thing: What is the State law? If the State law \ndid not cover it, then we in Congress have no power to act.\n  That, Mr. President, is an extreme view--an extreme activist view--of \nthe role of our Federal judges, and one which this Senate should not \naccept.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, thank you for allowing me to speak on \nbehalf of Jeff Sutton, a star in the Ohio bar. I am here to express my \nstrongest recommendation for Jeff, whom the President nominated to \nserve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on May 9, \n2001. Can you believe that? On May 9, I was at the White House when \nPresident Bush nominated Jeff, and here we are, almost 2 years later, \nfinally voting on his nomination.\n  I am extremely disappointed at the length of time it has taken for \nthis most qualified nominee to reach the floor of the Senate. Much of \nmy disappointment stems from the fact that anyone who knows Jeff knows \nhim to be a man of unquestioned integrity, intelligence, and \nqualifications, with vast experience in commercial, constitutional, and \nappellate litigation. Jeff will bring a special quality to the bench.\n  His first career was as a teacher. He was a 7th grade geography and \n10th grade history teacher, as well as a soccer and baseball coach \nbefore heading off to law school.\n  Jeff graduated first in his law school class from the Ohio State \nUniversity\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\nCollege of Law, followed by a clerkship with the Honorable Thomas \nMeskill of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and a \nclerkship for Justices Powell and Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  From 1995 to 1998, Jeff left his Jones, Day law firm behind and \nanswered the call to public service as the State solicitor general of \nOhio. It was during this time that the National Association of \nAttorneys General awarded Jeff a Best Brief Award for practice before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court 4 years in a row. After his tenure as State \nsolicitor, Jeff returned to Jones, Day to practice law, where he works \ntoday. Because he was the State solicitor of Ohio when I was Governor, \nI worked with him extensively when he represented the Governor's \noffice, and, in my judgment, he never exhibited any predisposition with \nregard to any issue and had great interpersonal skills.\n\n  Jeffrey Sutton has exactly what the Federal bench needs: a fresh, \nobjective perspective. In spite of being a brilliant lawyer, he has \nnever exhibited anything but humility. In fact, Professor John Jeffries \nof the University of Virginia agrees with me on this point, calling \nJeff ``compassionate, humane and modest.'' He goes on to say that Jeff \n``does not rush to judgment, nor is he burdened by the kind of \nunwarranted confidence in his own opinion that closes the mind to \nconcerns of others.'' Let me repeat that: He is not ``burdened by the \nkind of unwarranted confidence in his own opinion that closes the mind \nto concerns of others.''\n  Jeff Sutton's qualifications for this judgeship are best evidenced \nthrough his experience. He has argued 12 cases and filed over 50 merits \nand amicus curiae briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, both as a \nprivate attorney and as Solicitor for the State of Ohio. In addition to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, Jeff has also argued 13 cases in State supreme \ncourts, 8 cases before the Federal Court of Appeals, and dozens more \ncases in State and Federal trial courts.\n  I want to share a story with you that reflects how good a lawyer Jeff \nreally is. I visited the Supreme Court last year to move the admission \nof some of my fellow Ohio State Law School alumni. We were having our \n40th class reunion here in Washington. While giving us a tour of the \nSupreme Court, Bill Suter, the Clerk of the Court, upon realizing that \nwe were Ohioans, went way out of his way to commend Jeff's abilities as \nan appellate lawyer. I cannot think of higher praise than the Clerk of \nthe Supreme Court, who witnesses so many arguments and sees so many \nlawyers every year, remembering Jeff and having nothing but praise for \nhim.\n  In fact, Jeff has earned such a vaulted reputation among the Supreme \nCourt Judges that they regularly seek him out to participate in \nproceedings before the High Court. These cases include that of Becker \nv. Montgomery, where the Supreme Court appointed Sutton to represent an \ninmate in a prisoner's rights lawsuit against his jailors. The Court \nunanimously agreed with his position, and Justice Ginsburg even went so \nfar as to remark in the opinion that ``[Jeff's] able representation . . \n. permit[s] us to decide this case, satisfied that the relevant issues \nhave been fully aired.''\n  It is also worthy to note that the lawyer for the State of Ohio in \nthis case, Stewart Baker, said of Jeff:\n\n       [T]he Becker case illustrates the fallacy of claims that \n     Mr. Sutton's judicial philosophy can be gleaned from the \n     positions he has advocated in court. . . .While the Becker \n     case may or may not tell us something about his personal \n     views, Mr. Sutton's willingness to take the case without \n     compensation does tell us a lot about his compassion and \n     commitment to justice.\n\n  In Westside Mothers v. Haveman, the Supreme Court again invited \nJeff's participation in a Medicaid case as amicus curiae after it found \nthe parties' briefing to be ``less than satisfactory.'' And again, the \nCourt responded with thanks and praise, stating:\n\n       Particularly noteworthy for its quality and helpfulness is \n     the amicus participation at the court's request of the \n     [Michigan Municipal] League and its pro bono counsel, Mr. \n     Jeffrey Sutton.\n\n  In addition to his appellate practice and family responsibilities, \nJeff has exhibited an appreciation that one has a responsibility to \ncontribute to the legal profession. He has been an adjunct professor of \nlaw at Ohio State, teaching seminars in constitutional law. He also \nteaches continuing legal education seminars on the U.S. Supreme Court \nand Ohio Supreme Court to Ohio State court judges and develops \ncurricula for appellate judges on behalf of the Ohio State Judicial \nCollege.\n  While his unwillingness to shy away from challenging or controversial \ncases has, in some instances, led critics to allege he has a \npredisposition toward certain cases, I believe such comments are not \naccurate--for instance, the allegation that Jeff is biased against \npeople with disabilities.\n  I disagree strongly with my colleague, the Senator from Iowa, on this \npoint. Anyone who really knows this man knows these allegations are \njust untrue and that Jeff should not be judged on a handful of cases \nwhere he did his job by vigorously advocating on behalf of his clients.\n  I believe it is patently unfair for groups to take the position that, \nbased upon his advocacy in this handful of cases, this man wants to \ncurtail the civil rights of persons with disabilities. Nothing--\nnothing--could be further from the truth.\n  First, I would like to point out that it is a well-established \nprinciple in the legal profession that lawyers should not be held \nresponsible for the positions of their clients. By serving as a lawyer \nto certain groups or individuals, Jeff does not necessarily adopt their \nviewpoints as his own; he just does his job, as he is supposed to, by \nsubordinating his own interests to those of the client and doing \neverything possible within the bounds of the law to win.\n  In fact, the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional \nConduct state:\n\n       A lawyer's representation of a client, including \n     representation by appointment, does not constitute an \n     endorsement of the client's political, economic, social or \n     moral views or activities.\n\n  Second, instead of focusing on a handful of cases, Jeff's detractors \nshould review his history of representing a very diverse group of \nclients who advocate every conceivable point on the political spectrum. \nThis includes Cheryl Fischer, a blind woman refused entry to an Ohio \nmedical school, whom Jeff represented when he was the Ohio State \nsolicitor. Ms. Fischer wrote a letter of support on Jeff's behalf \nstating:\n\n       I recall with much pride just how committed Jeff was to my \n     cause. He believed in my position. He cared and listened and \n     he wanted . . . to win for me.\n  Jeff represented the National Coalition of Students with Disabilities \nwhere he successfully argued that Ohio State-run universities were \nviolating the motor voter law by failing to provide their disabled \nstudents with voter registration materials. This is very important. In \nthat particular case, Benson Wolman, a former law school classmate of \nmine, who would smile with great pleasure if described as a liberal \ncivil rights advocate, and a former director of the ACLU in Ohio, asked \nSutton to help out in this motor voter case. He supports his \nnomination, stating:\n\n       [Mr. Sutton's] commitment to individual rights, civility as \n     an opposing counsel, his sense of fairness, his devotion to \n     civic responsibility, and his keen and demonstrated intellect \n     all reflect the best that is to be found in the legal \n     profession.\n\n  This is the former head of the Ohio Civil Liberties Union saying Mr. \nSutton's commitment to individual rights, his civility as an opposing \ncounsel, his sense of fairness, his devotion to civic responsibilities, \nand his keen and demonstrated intellect all reflect the best that is to \nbe found in the legal profession.\n  Wolman's endorsement of Jeff is very important. It should give \ncomfort and alleviate the fears of my colleagues who believe Jeff may \nbe too conservative and not sensitive to liberal causes and civil \nrights.\n  Third, Jeff's service on the board of the Equal Justice Foundation, a \npublic interest organization that provides pro bono legal services on \nbehalf of disadvantaged individuals, including people with \ndisabilities, is evidence of his interest to advance the interests of \nthe disabled. During his tenure, the foundation tackled a variety of \ncases which advanced these interests: One, for example, suing three \nOhio cities to force them to build curb cuts to make their sidewalks \nwheelchair accessible; two, suing an amusement park company that had a \nblanket policy banning the\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\ndisabled from their rides; and, three, representing a girl with tubular \nsclerosis in a case alleging that her school was not providing her with \nan adequate education plan--to name a few.\n  Last, anyone who knows of Jeff's work when he was younger at his \nfather's school for children with cerebral palsy knows this is not a \nman who wants to curtail the rights of the disabled. Think about that. \nHis father ran a school for children with cerebral palsy. Can you think \nthat someone who had that experience in his family would want to \ncurtail the rights of the disabled? In fact, you only need to read the \nletters of support from those who work in the disabled community to see \nthe number of people who support Jeff.\n  These include Francis Beytagh, legal director of the National Center \nfor Law and the Handicapped, who wrote:\n\n       I believe Jeff Sutton would make an excellent federal \n     appellate judge. He is a very bright, articulate and \n     personable individual who values fairness highly. . . . I do \n     not regard him as a predictable ideologue. . . . I recommend \n     and support his confirmation without reservation.\n\n  And James Leonard, codirector of the University of Alabama's \nDisability Law Institute, who wrote:\n\n       In my opinion, Jeffrey Sutton is well-qualified to sit on \n     the Sixth Circuit Court and should be confirmed. . . . I see \n     no ``agenda'' on Mr. Sutton's part to target disabled \n     citizens--\n\n  That is something that is going to be advocated on the floor of the \nSenate for the next day and a half.\n  He says:\n       In my opinion, Jeffrey Sutton is well-qualified to sit on \n     the Sixth Circuit Court and should be confirmed. . . . I see \n     no ``agenda'' on Mr. Sutton's part to target disabled \n     citizens. . . .\n\n  Seth Waxman, President Clinton's Solicitor General and Jeff's \nopposing counsel in University of Alabama v. Garrett, stated:\n\n       I know that some have questioned whether the position Mr. \n     Sutton advocated last Term . . . reflected antipathy on his \n     part toward the Americans with Disabilities Act. I argued \n     that case against Mr. Sutton, and I discerned no such \n     personal antipathy. Mr. Sutton vigorously advanced the \n     constitutional position of his client in the case, the State \n     of Alabama; doing so was entirely consistent with the finest \n     traditions of the adversarial system.\n\n  Jeff Sutton should not be criticized on assumptions that past legal \npositions reflect his personal views. Instead, he should be lauded for \nalways zealously advocating his client's interest, no matter the issue.\n  While I could continue praising Jeff as a lawyer, what I am most \nimpressed by is that I could spend equally as much time praising Jeff, \nthe man. There is no question that Jeffrey Sutton is one of this \nNation's premier appellate lawyers and could remain at his law firm and \nliterally make millions of dollars. He has chosen, however, to turn his \nback on that opportunity because he is deeply committed to public and \ncommunity service and believes he can do more for his fellow men and \ntheir quality of life and the legal system by serving on the appellate \nbench. His motives, in my opinion, are fundamental to one who seeks a \nlifetime appointment to a Federal circuit court of appeals.\n  Jeffrey Sutton wants his job for the right reasons. He does not need \nit for his ego or the financial well-being of having a permanent job. \nHe has a wonderful wife and three children, whom I have met and talked \nto, who are willing to make the financial sacrifice so that Jeff can \nserve.\n  Jeff is an elder and deacon in the Presbyterian Church, as well as a \nSunday school teacher. He also participates in the I Know I Can \nprogram, which provides college scholarships to inner-city children; \nProMusica, a chamber music organization; and coaches youth soccer and \nbasketball teams.\n  I have met some exceptional people during my 35 years in government, \nand Jeff is one of the most exceptional. I have worked closely with \nJeff and know that he will make an exemplary addition to the Sixth \nCircuit, which is in crisis because of the vacancies now on it. I \nrespectfully urge the Senate to confirm Jeff Sutton's nomination as \nquickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nnomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit. I am not convinced \nthat Jeffrey Sutton will be fair and openminded in the range of issues \nthat would come before him; in particular, those on the balance between \nFederal and State power and the ability of individuals to enforce their \ncivil rights in court.\n  Mr. Sutton has been the most visible advocate in the rightwing \nmovement to weaken the basic civil rights laws that have brought our \ncountry closer to equal opportunity for all of our citizens. Because of \nthe civil rights laws enacted over the last 40 years, we have increased \nopportunities for minority citizens in all aspects of our Nation. Women \nand girls have many more educational and sports opportunities. People \nwith disabilities have new opportunities to fully participate in our \nsociety. Without the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, the Housing Act of 1968, the enactment of title IX in 1972, and \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act in 1991, these extraordinary \nadvances could never have been achieved. All of these laws had strong \nbipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans.\n  Mr. Sutton has been at the forefront of a campaign to weaken many of \nthese civil rights laws by claiming that Congress has no power to make \nthese laws enforceable against the States or by claiming that \nindividuals cannot enforce these rights in court.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Sutton has often found willing support in recent \nyears by five justices of the Supreme Court. Over the last decade, a \nnarrow majority of the Supreme Court has ushered in what some are \ntrying to call the ``new federalism.'' Five justices have rewritten \nmany of the rules on the power of the Federal Government, in some \ninstances overturning their own precedent and ignoring long-standing \nconstitutional language to do so. More Congressional statutes have been \nstruck down or severely limited by this Supreme Court than at any point \nsince the now-widely discredited Supreme Court of the 1930s which \nattempted to block the progressive legislation of the New Deal.\n  The agenda in Mr. Sutton's advocacy is all too clear. It's to reduce \nthe power of the Federal Government to protect civil rights. Our \nconstitutional system was founded on respect for the States. But the \nCivil War Amendments gave broad power to the Federal Government to \nenact civil rights statutes and make them enforceable against States. \nMr. Sutton's advocacy clearly undermines these profound changes made \nover a century ago in our Constitution.\n  The human impact of Mr. Sutton's victories at the Supreme Court is \nalso clear. Mr. Sutton's advocacy has meant that: Individuals like \nPatricia Garrett, a breast cancer survivor who was demoted after \nworking for seventeen years for the University of Alabama, cannot seek \ndamages under the ADA; workers over 40 who are fired or demoted from \ntheir state jobs because they are considered too old have no effective \nfederal remedy for age discrimination. In a recent case, a supervisor \nin a state agency fired a plaintiff because of his age and told the \njury that ``In a forest, you have to cut down the old, big trees so the \nlittle trees can grow.''\n  The plaintiff in this case was fired at the age of 48.\n  Sutton's advocacy has also meant that: Individuals can no longer \nbring suit under regulations implementing the 1964 Civil Rights Act. \nThis makes it difficult for Bonnie Sanders and Rose Townsend to remedy \nracial discrimination in their low-income minority community in New \nJersey which suffers high rates of asthma and respiratory illnesses \nfrom the large number of contaminated waste sites and superfund sites \nunfairly placed in their small community; persons who complain about \ngender discrimination in school sports or education programs can be \nfired or demoted without being able to bring a challenge under Title \nIX's provisions.\n  Mr. Sutton's response to many of the concerns raised about his record \nis that he was making arguments on behalf of his client. All of us \nunderstand that the arguments lawyers make in their briefs or in oral \narguments do not necessarily represent their own views. But Mr. \nSutton's claim that he is not seeking to advance a broad States rights \nagenda is absurd.\n  He admits that he has not been involved before the Supreme Court in \nany cases on the other side of the issue--he has not sought to defend \nFederal power to enact civil rights laws.\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\nHe consistently represents only those States--and there are many States \non the other side--who want to limit the scope of Federal civil rights \nlaws. Indeed, Mr. Sutton has stated that he is ``on the lookout'' for \nStates' rights cases.\n  He is a top officer of the Federalist Society, and he has repeatedly \nexpressed his views on the question of Federal and State power. He has \nexpressed his ``love''--he actually used that word for making State \nsovereignty claims, even when his arguments are unpopular. He has \ncharacterized questions of federalism as a ``zero-sum'' game, an \nendless battle between the Federal and State governments.\n  Mr. Sutton called our attention to a few cases in which he has \ndefended the rights of people with disabilities. I commend him for \nthose cases. But I find it curious that we are meant to believe that \nthose few cases reflect his real views on civil rights, while his \nadvocacy in major States rights cases in the Supreme Court reflects \nonly the views of his client. For every plaintiff like Cheryl Fischer--\nthe blind woman whom Sutton represented in his Government capacity \nafter she was denied admission to medical school--thousands more were \nharmed by his advocacy to deny civil rights protections.\n  The case that casts the most doubt on Mr. Sutton's claim that he was \nmerely representing his clients and that demonstrates his activism in \nsupport of States' rights is Westside Mothers. Poor children and their \nmothers had challenged Michigan's failure to provide adequate dental \nservices, as required under Medicaid. They were not claiming money \ndamages. They only wanted the State of Michigan to provide the health \ncare required by Federal law. They brought suit under section 1983, \nwhich the Supreme Court has long held allows persons to bring claims \nfor violations of Federal statutes. Mr. Sutton argued in a friend-of-\nthe-court brief that these children could not enforce their Medicaid \nrights using section 1983. The district court accepted his arguments, \nbut the Sixth Circuit reversed--unanimously.\n  If Mr. Sutton's arguments had prevailed, it would have limited the \nenforcement of a wide range of spending power statutes, contrary to \nmore than a quarter-century of Supreme Court precedent. He would have \neffectively closed the court house doors to: Working parents in North \nCarolina who drove up to 3\\1/2\\ hours each way to obtain dental care \nfor their children, because they could not find a dentist closer to \nhome who would accept Medicaid--even though the Medicaid law requires \nStates to ensure an adequate supply of providers; children with mental \nretardation and developmental disabilities in West Virginia who faced \ninstitutionalization because they could not get Medicaid to pay for the \nhome-based services they needed, even though the Medicaid law requires \nStates to cover the services; families in Arizona who were not \nreceiving notices or hearings when their Medicaid HMOs denied or \ndelayed needed treatments, even though the Medicaid law requires States \nto provide those rights.\n  Mr. Sutton's advocacy, if he had prevailed, would have closed the \ndoors to relief for all these individuals.\n  Mr. Sutton even sought to achieve this result by encouraging the \ndistrict court to ignore Supreme Court precedent. He failed to cite in \nhis opening brief the leading Supreme Court cases that allowed \nplaintiffs to bring the challenges. In his reply brief, he told the \ndistrict court that it need ``not be overly concerned'' with this \nprecedent. It is very disturbing that a judicial nominee would be so \ncavalier in his dismissal of Supreme Court rulings, and would even \ninvite the lower court to disregard it.\n  In response to questions about the Westside Mothers case, Mr. Sutton \ndid not back away from the positions he took in the case. He continued \nto maintain that the far-reaching arguments he made were supported by \nthe law. The Department of Justice and over 75 law professors, liberal \nand conservative, filed their own friend-of-the-court briefs to \nemphasize that Mr. Sutton's view, if it had been accepted, would \nradically change the law.\n  One of the professors who wrote to us about Mr. Sutton's views in \nthis case was Professor Douglas Laycock. He said that while Mr. Sutton \npersuaded the district judge that none of the Supreme Court's \nprecedents was binding, his arguments were actually in defiance of \nsettled law. As Professor Laycock wrote, ``The truth is that the power \nto enforce Federal law by suits against State officers was settled and \nfundamental.'' Professor Laycock concluded by saying: ``What Westside \nshows is Sutton aggressively creating new doctrine to restrict or \noverturn settled law, leading the way at the frontier of the campaign \nto roll back Federal power and leave citizens without effective \nprotection for their Federal rights.''\n  Mr. Sutton's advocacy in this case, far beyond what the Supreme Court \nhas ever held, raises major concerns that he will continue to follow \nhis own extreme views on what the law should be if he is confirmed as a \njudge.\n  The issue is not whether Mr. Sutton dislikes disabled people. It is \nnot about whether he is a good man. He is very personable, highly \ncredentialed, very intelligent. The question is whether he is committed \nto the principles of the Constitution, including genuine enforcement of \nFederal civil rights laws. His record fails to show that he will be \nable to set aside his own extreme agenda in rolling back Federal power.\n  Many of the White House nominees to lifetime appointments to our \nFederal courts of appeals raise such a question. Those courts are \ncharged with making decisions vital to the everyday lives of American \npeople, but far too many of them have records that are extreme. Their \ngoal is to use the Federal courts to limit the rights of workers, \ndismantle environmental protection, roll back civil rights, undermine \nthe rights of women, and to reject the right of privacy.\n  When the White House submits nominees who show that they will be fair \nand open minded in the cases that come before them, we should all \nsupport them. Judge Edward Prado, for example, a nominee to the Fifth \nCircuit, is one such nominee. He is a Republican. He likely holds views \nwith which some of us disagree. He has shown, however, in his time on \nthe bench that he is committed to the rule of law and to honoring the \nConstitution and the Federal laws, not reshaping the law to fit a \nright-wing ideological agenda. He was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously. There was not a single letter of opposition \nagainst him. He is ready to be voted on by the full Senate.\n  Nominees such as Judge Prado should get our full support; nominees \nsuch as Jeffrey Sutton should not.\n  The basic values of our society, whether we will continue to be \ncommitted to equality, freedom of expression, and the right to privacy, \nare at issue in each of these controversial nominations. If the \nadministration continues to nominate judges who would weaken the core \nvalues of our country, roll back the laws that have made our country a \nmore inclusive democracy, the Senate should reject them. No President \nhas the unilateral right to remake the judiciary in his own image. The \nConstitution requires the Senate's advice and consent on judicial \nnominations. It is clear that our duty is to be more than a \nrubberstamp, and I urge my colleagues to vote against Jeffrey Sutton.\n  I see my colleague and friend from Iowa in the Chamber. He is a \nmember of our Human Resources Committee. In looking over several of \nthese items, he can remember very well, as I am sure I can, the time \nand deliberation we took on a number of these legislative matters, such \nas the Americans with Disabilities Act. That legislation in one form or \nanother was before the Congress probably 8 to 10 years before we were \neventually able to work that matter through to acceptance. We had broad \nbipartisan support that said we were going to be an inclusive Nation, \nwe were going to include those individuals who were facing the \nchallenges through some form of disability, and we were going to be a \nbetter country because of that.\n  The overwhelming celebration we had at the White House--I can \nremember the Senator from Iowa being there when President Bush 1 signed \nthat bill and stated that he believed this was probably the most \nimportant single legislative achievement and accomplishment he had \nduring the time of his Presidency. Guarantees were put into place in \norder to protect those who had some disability so that they would be \nable to have their rights protected.\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\n  That is not what Mr. Sutton says. That is not what the holding is in \nhis case in the Garrett decision. It points out in those cases he has \noutlined that the State employees will not be covered under the ADA and \nthey will not have those protections. We on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee had hearing after hearing and listened to the \nchallenges the disabled people were facing in this country. We took \ntime and listened to suggestions and recommendations from Republicans \nand Democrats alike so we could pass a meaningful bill to protect those \nindividuals. We thought we did that and the President of the United \nStates believed we had and the Justice Department thought we had at \nthat time, but not Jeffrey Sutton. No, no protections for State \nemployees. I never heard Jeffrey Sutton bring these ideas up before our \ncommittee or over in the House of Representatives.\n\n  Maybe later on the Senator from Iowa can tell me whether he ever \nremembered that being brought up or whether or not we were attentive to \nour duty and our responsibility, or that it was the failure of our \ncommittee and the responsibility of the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Massachusetts that we failed to provide those protections, \nbecause we believed that we had. We did not hear any opposition to it.\n  The Senator from Iowa remembers the various lengthy hearings we had \nabout age discrimination which was taking place in this country, about \nworkers who were being singled out solely on the issue of their age. \nThe Senator can remember the days and the weeks of hearings we had on \nthat issue, and that the legislation we passed was supported by \nRepublican and Democrat alike, but not from Mr. Sutton; one can go \nright ahead and discriminate freely on the basis of age according to \nhis decision. We had not heard that--we never heard it from the Justice \nDepartment during that period of time.\n  Many of these things occurred during the time when we had a \nRepublican Justice Department which had supported this legislation.\n  The Senator has talked about the Violence Against Women Act \nlegislation, to which Jeffrey Sutton filed an amicus brief to say there \nis no civil remedy under the Violence Against Women Act. The Senator \ncan remember the time we spent on that legislation.\n  Then there was the Religious Restoration Act on which my friend from \nUtah and I worked long and strenuously, inviting constitutional \nauthorities from all over this country to help us shape legislation to \nmake sure we really were going to move ahead in the protection of \nrights to be able to practice one's own religion, but we were not able \nto do it under the holding of Mr. Sutton.\n  Then, finally the striking down of title VI of the Civil Rights Act, \nwhich is basically an opportunity for individuals, primarily poor, \nprimarily men and women of color, when there are going to be actions \nthat are going to be taken which are so blatant and flagrantly \ndiscriminatory that puts their lives and their health at risk--no, no, \nthat particular title VI of the 1964 act was going to be struck down as \nwell.\n  The common factor is--and the Senator from Iowa would agree--the \nkinds of protections we are talking about in such legislation as this \nis for the most vulnerable, in many instances the weakest people, in \nour society. We have heard from those who are going to defend Mr. \nSutton that that is not really Jeffrey Sutton; that he was just taking \na case at a time. Well, he has taken all of these cases, and he has \nlooked for more, and he has never been a spokesperson for the opposing \nview in terms of defending these individuals.\n  We have a difficult time in terms of providing these protections for \nindividuals who are being left out and being left behind. We are always \nreminded every single day in this city and in this country how those \nwith power and those with wealth are able to take care of themselves \nvery well. But we are talking here about those individuals who had \nprotections under these various statutes who by and large came through \nour committee after weeks and months of hearings, where there was a \nbipartisan effort to try to ensure that legislation was carefully \ndrafted and focused and attended to, but they do not meet the test of \nJeffrey Sutton.\n\n  I say that Jeffrey Sutton does not meet my test either.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for the dialog. I thank the Senator \nfor his statement, but I thank the Senator for his great leadership in \nthe 1980s.\n  When I first came here in 1985 and became a member of the Labor \nCommittee under the leadership of Mr. Kennedy, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, we were beginning to develop, as the Senator knows, at \nthat time, the underlying legislation for ADA. It was the Senator from \nMassachusetts who provided the great leadership that brought us \ntogether--Republicans and Democrats, Republican Attorney General, \nRepublican President, States attorneys general, Governors--all over the \ncountry, coming together saying, finally, we have to do something about \nthis.\n  That is why Mr. Sutton's view is so disturbing in how he approaches \nthis matter. As the Senator from Massachusetts so correctly stated, a \nlot of people are saying he was representing his client. However, he \nwas on an NPR radio interview--not representing a client there, he was \nrepresenting himself--in which he said disability discrimination in a \nconstitutional test is hard to show, difficult to show.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts alluded to how much work we had done \nto show that, 25 years of study. The first study done by Congress \nshowing discrimination against people with disabilities was in 1965, \nthe National Commission on Architectural Behaviors. Finally, in 1989 we \npassed the Americans with Disabilities Act. Mr. Sutton says that is not \nenough.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, we had 17 formal \nhearings by the committee of the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nsubcommittee which I chaired. Five separate committees marked up this \nbill. We had 63 public forums across the country, led by Justin Dart, \nhead of the President's national committee--8,000 pages of testimony--\nas the Senator mentioned, the Attorney General of the United States, \nThornburg, Governors, State attorneys general, State legislators. But \nespecially as it pertains to the Garrett case, Mr. Sutton basically \nsaid that Congress had not made a showing, that States were not living \nup to their responsibility to protect people with disabilities. There \nwere 300 examples that came into our committee regarding discrimination \nby State governments. Mr. Sutton says that is not enough.\n  I wonder aloud to my friend from Massachusetts, how many do we need, \n325? Is it 350? What is the magic number to show that State governments \nwere violating constitutional rights of their citizens? With 300 \nexamples, Mr. Sutton says that is not good enough.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his statement, for his \nlifelong advocacy and support, especially of people with disabilities. \nI have geared my remarks on that--and for his advocacy and support for \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  People say Mr. Sutton is a nice guy and all that kind of stuff. I \nsuppose he is. I spent an hour and a half with him. I found him to be a \nvery pleasurable individual. The Senator from Ohio said that he does \nnot have any bias against people with disabilities. I don't contend \nthat. I know the Senator from Massachusetts does not contend that Mr. \nSutton has any personal bias against people with disabilities. However, \nhis rigid ideology in that we in the Congress cannot pass national laws \nprotecting the civil rights of people with disabilities sets the clock \nback 25 years or more. So that is the problem with Mr. Sutton. He has \nthis rigid ideology that says people may be hurting, people may be \ndiscriminated against because they use a wheelchair or they have \ncerebral palsy or they are deaf or they are blind, and isn't that just \ntoo bad, our hearts go out to them, but we can't do anything about it \nunless the State does something about it.\n  I find that to be the primary reason why Mr. Sutton should not be on \nthe circuit court of appeals. If he wants to be on the State bench some \nplace, at a State court he can espouse that, but not as a member of the \ncircuit court of the United States.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend from Iowa for giving life to the \npoints\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\nI tried to make about the kind of due deliberation we had on the \ndifferent pieces of legislation which came through our committee and \nfor which we have a good deal of awareness and knowledge.\n  I remember when we considered the Americans with Disabilities Act. We \nwould have such questions: How does it apply to a ski lift if someone \ncomes up and is disabled? How many chairs will have to be on a ski \nlift? We were asked every conceivable policy question, wondering what \nwould happen if it was a little bookstore with one person in it and a \nblind person walks on in: is the person at the cash register going to \nhave to go back and help the blind person find the books or will they \ncontinue to be able to look after the cash register? These are the \nkinds of questions we had coming out of our ears; so many people were \nskeptical of taking that kind of action to give protections to our \nfellow citizens, over 40 million in this country. We faced every \npossible challenge on these issues. The Senator was there.\n  But suddenly now we find a new way of rolling all that back. Who is \nthe author? Mr. Sutton. We heard from the Justice Department during \nthat period of time. There was never any kind of question from the \nJustice Department. I ask the Senator from Iowa, does the Senator \nremember that the Justice Department commented--I hope you understand \nyou are getting into a real hornet's nest, from a constitutional \nquestion. Did you hear that with regard to age or protections of people \nunder the 1964 Civil Rights Act or the Violence Against Women Act? Were \nwe ever told by any Justice Department, Democrat or Republican: \nAbsolutely no.\n  Here we have a nominee who was able to get a viewpoint and a position \nthat has been effectively undermining those kinds of protections. He \nhas been doing it step by step by step.\n  I, for one, am not prepared to vote because the next one who is going \nto come will come right out there on the issues of protection on the \nbasis of race, the last major kind of civil rights issue. That is the \nlarge enchilada this is building up to. As we know, slavery was written \ninto the Constitution and this country has paid an extraordinary price \nto free us from forms of discrimination. We fought a civil war and \nexperienced all the pain, suffering, tears and blood by Dr. King and \nothers.\n  It was from that strength with the passage of the legislation we \nmoved ahead to try to eliminate discrimination in other forms, \ndiscrimination against the disabled, discrimination against the \nelderly, discrimination against women. And here we have the architect \nto undermine those commitments. I, for one, am not prepared to vote to \ntake advantage and say maybe he will just stop here and not see a \ncontinued rollback.\n  I agree with the Senator. He is a very fine person and we have a high \nregard for him but there are many other people that are fine and for \nwhom we have a high regard. We have a responsibility, I believe, that \nSupreme Court nominees ought do have a commitment to the fundamentals \nof the Constitution. I am not prepared to take a chance on where he is \ngoing to go in the future.\n\n  I thank the Senator for his excellent presentation this afternoon. I \nthink it has been very helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening with a great degree \nof interest at the comments of my colleagues. I, for one, as one of the \nprime authors of the Americans with Disabilities Act, contend that Mr. \nSutton does agree with the bill and that he is an advocate for those \nwho are suffering from disability, in spite of what has been said.\n  I rise today in support of the nomination of Jeffery Sutton to be a \nJudge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Sutton is one of the \ntop appellate lawyers in this country today. He has argued over 45 \nappeals for a diversity of clients in Federal and State courts across \nthe country, including an impressive number--12--before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. We have not had nominees like this for years, who have \nthe ability, experience, capacity, knowledge and the decency that some \nof these nominees of President Bush have. In 2001, he had the best \nrecord of any advocate before the Court, arguing 4 cases and winning \nall of them. On January 2, 2003, the American Lawyer named him one of \nthe best 45 lawyers in the country under the age of 45. He is an \noutstanding nominee, and I urge all of my colleagues to support him.\n  Mr. Sutton served as a law clerk for United States Supreme Court \nJustices Lewis Powell and Antonin Scalia. Like his mentor Justice \nPowell, Sutton is a moderate who favors judicial pragmatism: According \nto Sutton, Justice Powell ``believed in people more than in ideas, in \nexperience more than ideology and in the end, embraced a judicial \npragmatism that served the country well.'' Mr. Sutton served as State \nSolicitor for the State of Ohio and currently is a partner in the \nprestigious law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue. He also serves as \nan Adjunct Professor at Ohio State University School of Law.\n  During his legal career, he has not only demonstrated keen intellect, \nstrong advocacy skills and a commitment to the rule of law, but has \ndedicated a substantial amount of his time to providing pro bono legal \nservices to a variety of individuals and groups. He enjoys strong \nsupport from lawyers in Ohio and across the country, who have written \nto praise not only his first-rate legal abilities, but also his \nfairness, open-mindedness, and personal integrity. There can be no \nserious question as to Mr. Sutton's qualifications for this position. \nHe represents the best of the legal profession and it is shameful to \nindicate otherwise.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues seem to be looking past his \nunassailable credentials in search of issues that could be used to \ndisparage him. I would like to address those points and explain why my \ncolleagues need not be concerned--maybe that is a nice word to use \nhere.\n  There have been suggestions that Mr. Sutton's record somehow \ndemonstrates a bias against Americans with disabilities. However, there \nis no evidence in his record to suggest that he has a personal bias \nagainst those with disabilities or any other group of individuals. In \nfact, even the People for the American Way has conceded that ``No one \nhas seriously contended that Sutton is personally biased against people \nwith disabilities.'' I think that is a very important point.\n  When he was young, Mr. Sutton regularly assisted at his father's \nschool for children with cerebral palsy, and a closer look at his legal \nrecord demonstrates that Mr. Sutton has taken up the causes of disabled \nAmericans several times. He represented a talented young woman named \nCheryl Fisher, who sought to get into medical school, but was turned \ndown because she was blind. In a letter of support of Mr. Sutton, Ms. \nFisher wrote:\n\n       I recall with much pride just how committed Jeff was to my \n     case. He believed in my position. He cared and listened and \n     wanted badly to win for me . . . I realized just how \n     fortunate I was to have a lawyer of Jeff's caliber so devoted \n     to working for me and the countless others with both similar \n     disabilities and interests.\n\n  In National Coalition of Students with Disabilities v. Taft, he \nsuccessfully argued that Ohio Universities were violating the federal \nmotor-voter law by failing to provide disabled students with voter \nregistration materials. Again he received high praise from someone \ninvolved in the case. Benson A. Wolman, former Director of the ACLU for \nOhio and currently a member of its National Advisory Council, who \nrecruited Mr. Sutton to work on the case, wrote:\n\n       Mr. Sutton's commitment to individual rights, his civility \n     as an opposing counsel, his sense of fairness, his devotion \n     to civic responsibilities, and his keen and demonstrated \n     intellect all reflect the best that is to be found in the \n     legal profession.\n\n  Mr. Sutton also served on the Board of the Equal Justice Foundation, \na public interest organization that provides pro bono legal services to \nthe disadvantaged. During his tenure on the board, the Foundation has \nsued three Ohio cities to force them to build curb cuts to make their \nsidewalks wheelchair accessible, sued an amusement park company that \nbanned disabled individuals from their rides, represented a mentally \ndisabled woman in an eviction proceeding against her landlord who tried \nto evict her based on her disability, and represented a girl with \ntubular sclerosis in a case alleging that the school was not properly \nhandling her individual education plan.\n  There are also many in the disabled community who, though not \ndirectly\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\ninvolved with Mr. Sutton's cases, understand that he is committed to \nthe law and support his nomination. Francis Beytagh, Legal Director of \nthe National Center for Law and the Handicapped wrote:\n\n       I believe Jeff Sutton would make an excellent federal \n     appellate judge. He is a very bright, articulate and \n     personable individual who values fairness highly . . . I do \n     not regard him as a predictable ideologue . . . I recommend \n     and support his confirmation without reservation.\n\n  We should pay attention to this person.\n  James Leonard, co-director of the University of Alabama's Disability \nLaw Institute, writes:\n\n       In my opinion, Jeffery Sutton is well-qualified to sit on \n     the Sixth Circuit Court and should be confirmed . . . I also \n     see no ``agenda'' on Mr. Sutton's part to target disabled \n     citizens. . . . Just as I would not infer an anti-disabled \n     agenda from Mr. Sutton's participation in Garrett, neither \n     would I assume from his role in the Fisher case that he had \n     the opposite inclination. Rather, he seemed to be a good \n     lawyer acting in his client's interest.\n\n  Gee, that is what he is, a good lawyer who represents clients and \nwins.\n  Beverly Long, Immediate Past President of the World Federation of \nMental Health and former Commissioner of President Carter's Commission \non Mental Health writes:\n\n       I have followed news reports of the intense lobbying \n     against Mr. Sutton by various people who advocate on behalf \n     of the disabled. This effort is unfortunate and, I am \n     convinced, misguided. I have no doubt that Mr. Sutton would \n     be an outstanding circuit court judge and would rule fairly \n     in all cases, including those involving persons with \n     disabilities.\n\n  I assume, after listening to my colleagues on the other side, what \nthey are trying to do is beat up Mr. Sutton now so that he will bend \nover backwards in every way for persons with disabilities.\n  I don't think they have to worry about that. But I think it is \nunfortunate that they are beating up on a man who basically understands \nthe disability community and who has long fought for it, but who has \nrepresented some clients with interests that my friends on the other \nside don't like.\n  I agree with Ms. Long, and I have no doubt Mr. Sutton would rule \nfairly in all cases, including those cases involving disabled \nAmericans. Mr. Sutton's critics hold up the Garrett case as evidence to \nhis insensitivity to the disabled community. I want to take just a few \nmoments to discuss why that criticism is misguided.\n  Mr. Sutton did not seek to represent the State of Alabama in that \ncase out of any desire to curb the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nInstead, he was approached by Alabama's attorney general to represent \nAlabama at the appellate stages of the litigation.\n  He was approached because he is an excellent lawyer and one of the \nbest appellate lawyers in the country.\n  As an attorney looking to build a practice before the Supreme Court, \nMr. Sutton accepted that representation. I do not see anything wrong \nwith a young lawyer accepting cases in order to gain more experience \nbefore our Nation's highest tribunal. I concur with my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from the State of California who pointed \nout that she hears from lawyers all the time that they were trying to \nbuild Supreme Court practices and picked up cases to do so.\n  It is a common practice for those who are fortunate enough to try \ncases before the Supreme Court. I give Mr. Sutton marks for candor for \nexplaining that reason at his hearing.\n  Mr. Sutton did nothing wrong in accepting that representation--State \ngovernments are certainly entitled to representation under our legal \nsystem. Yet, I can understand the frustration that some of my \ncolleagues may feel to see the protections of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act limited by the Supreme Court. I worked many long hours \nto see that piece of legislation enacted. However, I do not blame Mr. \nSutton for the Supreme Court's decision--he is guilty of nothing more \nthan being a very good lawyer for his client. The principle of judicial \nreview is very well-established in American jurisprudence. If anything, \nwe should be thankful that there are lawyers as able as Mr. Sutton to \nensure the effective working of our system of checks and balances. It \nwas the Supreme Court that made the decision; Mr. Sutton was simply \nrepresenting his client.\n  And, by the way, that is what attorneys do. He had a right to do it. \nIt was legitimate to do it. He did a very good job.\n  There is no evidence that Mr. Sutton was motivated by a personal \nagenda when he represented those State governments. In fact, former \nClinton Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman, and Sutton's opposing Counsel \nin the Garrett case, wrote, ``I argued the case against Mr. Sutton, and \nI discerned no such personal antipathy. Mr. Sutton vigorously advanced \nthe constitutional position of his client in the case, the State of \nAlabama; doing so was entirely consistent with the finest traditions of \nthe adversarial system.''\n  It is important to note that the ABA Model Rules of Professional \nConduct state that no inference about a lawyer's personal views should \nbe gleaned from the positions of his client. The rule states, ``A \nlawyer's representation of a client, including representation by \nappointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client's \npolitical, economic, social or moral views or activities.'' My \ndistinguished colleague, the junior Senator from New York, seems to \nagree. Back in February, on the Senate floor she noted, ``A long time \nago, I used to practice law. I represented a lot of clients of \ndifferent kinds, all sorts of folks. Their views and positions were not \nnecessarily mine. I won some and I lost some in the trial court, in the \nappellate court, and in the administrative hearing room, but I do not \nbelieve that any of my clients spoke for me. My advocacy on behalf of \nclients was not the same as my positions about the law, about \nconstitutional issues, and about many other matters.''\n  I personally think that was very well said by the distinguished \njunior Senator from New York.\n  Obviously, I do not think anybody in this body would seriously \nconsider voting against a nominee because of a dislike of the nominee's \nclients. All of those of us who practice law and try cases represent \nclients with whom some in the Senate might disagree.\n  We had an important discussion about clients in connection with the \nnomination of Marsha Berzon, now a judge on the Ninth Circuit, and the \nSenate decided not to hold her responsible for her clients' views and \nconfirmed her. I advocated for her even though I probably disagree with \nher philosophy in many respects. Judge Berzon is well qualified.\n  Judge Berzon had been a long-time member of the ACLU, serving on the \nBoard of Directors and as the Vice President of the Northern California \nBranch. She testified that:\n\n       ``[I]f I am confirmed as a judge, not only will the ACLU's \n     positions be irrelevant, but the positions of my former \n     clients, indeed, my own positions on any policy matters will \n     be quite irrelevant and I will be required to and I commit to \n     look at the statute, the constitutional provisions, and the \n     precedents only in deciding the case.''\n\n  Mr. Sutton made similar assurances at his hearing that he will follow \nthe law as an appellate court judge. He stated, ``. . . there's no \ndoubt that when a Federal statute is passed, as the U.S. Supreme Court \nhas made clear, there's a heavy presumption of constitutionality. And \nthere's no doubt that a Court of Appeals judge has every obligation to \nfollow that presumption.'' We accepted Judge Berzon's answer and we \nshould do the same for Mr. Sutton instead of trying to destroy his \nreputation.\n  If there are members of this body who nevertheless try to hold Mr. \nSutton responsible for the views of the states that he represented, I \nask that they at least judge Mr. Sutton on his entire record and not \njust on a select handful of cases--or here a case, there a case, once \nin awhile another isolated case, and not just a select handful of \ncases.\n  Mr. Sutton has represented a wide range of clients in his legal \npractice. Most of the clients in the cases that displease his critics \npaid him to represent them, but he has represented a significant number \nof clients with very diverse interests on a pro bono basis. These \nclients include death row defendants, prisoner rights plaintiffs, the \nNational Coalition for Students with Disabilities, the NAACP and the \nCenter for Handgun Violence--to name a few.\n  In 2001, he was appointed by the U.S. Supreme Court to represent--pro \nse--Dale Becker in a prisoner rights complaint. Opposing counsel, and \nformer\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\nGeneral Counsel of the National Security Agency during the Bush and \nClinton Administrations, Stewart A. Baker, wrote in support of Mr. \nSutton stating, ``If Mr. Sutton is to be judged by the positions he \ntakes on behalf of his clients, the Becker case suggests that he favors \nincreased inmate litigation in federal courts as well as a broad and \nflexible reading of the courts' rules, at least when a literal reading \ndoes harm to pro se litigants. In fact, the Becker case illustrates the \nfallacy of claims that Mr. Sutton's judicial philosophy can be gleamed \nfrom the positions he has advocated in court. Although he has \napparently taken conservative positions on behalf of some clients, Mr. \nSutton has also championed left-liberal positions when his client's \nwelfare called for such arguments.''\n\n  Take for example, Mr. Sutton's defense of Ohio's minority set-aside \nstatute when he was Solicitor General. Fred Pressley, Ohio attorney and \nDemocrat who worked with Sutton on the case wrote, ``As Solicitor \nGeneral, Mr. Sutton was a tenacious defender of all Ohioans, regardless \nof their race, gender, disability or nationality.''\n  In addition, I recently received a supportive letter from Mr. Riyaz \nKanji, a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice David Souter and \nJudge Betty Fletcher of the Ninth Circuit. He said that he contacted \nMr. Sutton in August to ask for assistance on an amicus brief for the \nNational Congress of American Indians in an Indian Law case pending \nbefore the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Kanji wrote, ``Mr. Sutton \ntook the time to call me back from vacation the very next morning to \nexpress a strong interest in working on the case. In our ensuing \nconversations, it became apparent to me that Mr. Sutton did not simply \nwant to work on the matter for the small amount of compensation it \nwould bring him--he readily agreed to charge far below his usual rates \nfor the brief--but that he instead had a genuine interest in \nunderstanding why Native American tribes have fared as poorly as they \nhave in front of the Supreme Court in recent years . . . I think it is \nfair to say that most individuals who are committed to furthering the \ncause of State's rights without regard to any other values or interests \nin our society do not evidence that type of concern for tribal \ninterests.''\n  I could go on and on in discussing the numerous letters of support \nthat I have received on Mr. Sutton's behalf, but I think the best \nspokesperson for Mr. Sutton is Mr. Sutton himself. In a 12-hour \nhearing, Mr. Sutton answered all questions put to him candidly and \nhonestly. He was extremely considerate and deferential, displaying a \nrespect for the process as well as his very impressive legal ability.\n  Jeffrey Sutton is the best the legal profession has to offer. I urge \nmy colleagues to examine his full and accurate record. I am confident \nif they do, my colleagues will vote overwhelmingly to confirm Mr. \nSutton.\n  Mr. President, let me just take a moment to address some of my \ncolleagues' concern about the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \nSupreme Court's decision in Garrett. I was a prime cosponsor of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and I am very proud of it. But this \ndebate is not about whether this body did the right thing in passing \nthat legislation. I personally think we did the right thing, and I \ncould talk for hours on how important that legislation is. However, in \nour system of checks and balances, the Supreme Court has a role here. \nAnd all parties before the Court deserve to have competent, in fact, \nzealous legal representation--States as well as individuals.\n  In the Garrett case, the State of Alabama sought the representation \nof Jeffrey Sutton. Mr. Sutton argued zealously on behalf of the State. \nHowever, nowhere--nowhere--does Alabama's brief suggest that Congress \ndoes not have the power to protect Americans with disabilities.\n  Mr. Sutton did not, as some have contended, argue the Americans with \nDisabilities Act as a whole was not needed or should be repealed. \nStatements to this effect are a mischaracterization of both the nature \nof the question before the Court in the Garrett case and the arguments \nMr. Sutton advanced on behalf of the State of Alabama.\n  In fact, Alabama's brief stated:\n\n       The ADA advances a commendable objective--mandatory \n     accommodation of the disabled. . . .\n\n  Further, the brief stated specifically that:\n\n       Alabama . . . has not challenged Congress' authority under \n     the Commerce Clause to regulate State employees through the \n     ADA, [or] an individual's authority to bring an injunction \n     action against State officials in Federal court, or the \n     Federal government's authority to bring a claim for \n     injunctive or monetary relief against States in Federal \n     court.\n\n  Alabama's brief also specifically credited the Federal Government for \nprohibiting Government-based discrimination against the disabled, and \naffirmatively requiring all manner of employment and public-access \naccommodations designed to provide the disabled with the kind of equal \nopportunity and dignity all individuals deserve.\n  Finally, at oral argument before the Court, Mr. Sutton clarified that \nhis client was ``happy that the ADA was enacted.'' Even if his client's \nstatements or sentiments are deemed his own--which they should not be--\nMr. Sutton's written and oral statements in the Garrett case dispel any \ncredible notion that he believes the ADA is not needed.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt that every litigant appearing in \nJeffrey Sutton's courtroom will get a fair shake. Now, some of my \ncolleagues have tried to distort his record, have tried to imply he is \nnot the man that he is, have tried to indicate he is against the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act because he represented clients with \nwhich some of my colleagues disagree, and that he is not worthy to be \non this court. The total record suggests and demands otherwise.\n  We should be lucky if we can get other nominees, whichever party is \nin charge of the White House, who have the kind of abilities and \ncapacities that Jeffrey Sutton has. I have no doubt every litigant \nappearing before Mr. Sutton will be treated fairly, with dignity, and \nthat the laws will be interpreted appropriately. This is an honest man. \nThis is a great lawyer, although young, and he is a person who will, I \nthink, bring a great deal of balance, integrity, capacity, and ability \nto the Federal courts of this country and, in particular, the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  So I hope our colleagues in the Senate will ignore some of the, I \nthink, disparaging remarks that have been made and look at the real \nrecord. And if they do, they will vote for Jeffrey Sutton.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I might note before I begin, seeing the \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair, who is my neighbor across the \nConnecticut River--and both he and I, as natives of our States, know \nyou never want to jump to hasty conclusions--it appears that spring is \nactually coming to New Hampshire and Vermont. It does not mean the bud \nseason is over, but crocuses have been spotted. And, as one of my \nneighbors used to tell me: The croci have appeared.\n  Our official reporter, Patrick Renzi, is going to figure out how to \nspell ``croci,'' and I will be no help to him at all. I am sure, with \nhow good all the reporters are, those who take down our debates here in \nthe Senate, how superb they all are, they will find the correct \nspelling.\n  Mr. President, on a more serious matter, Senator Hatch, Senator \nKennedy, Senator DeWine, Senator Voinovich, and Senator Harkin have \nspoken about the Sutton nomination, and I want to speak to it, too.\n  Today, the Senate is considering the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton of \nOhio to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n  The responsibility to advise and consent on the President's life-\ntenured judicial nominees is one that I take seriously and is not an \noccasion to rubber stamp. And I have taken that position whether we \nhave had a Republican or Democrat in the White House. The\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\nnomination of Jeffrey Sutton presents a number of areas of concern to \nme. For these reasons, I, along with seven other members of the \nJudiciary Committee, voted against Mr. Sutton in Committee and I will \nvote against him being confirmed to a lifetime position on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n  The number of individual citizens who came to the hearing to oppose \nMr. Sutton, along with the number of Senators who came to question Mr. \nSutton, several times in some cases, is some indication of the \ncontroversial nature of this nomination. The hearing had to be moved to \na bigger room, a room that had been reserved in advance of the hearing, \nin order to accommodate the public interest in the nomination. I \nthanked the Chairman to acceding to my suggestion and the suggestions \nof others to move the hearing into the larger hearing room in order to \nprovide access to the public and, in particular, those members of the \npublic who are disabled.\n  In the days preceding his hearing, the Committee received thousands \nof letters from individuals and organizations, both in and out of Ohio, \nexpressing concerns about appointing Mr. Sutton to the Sixth Circuit, \nand those letters raise serious issues. Mr. Sutton did not clear up \nthese concerns at his hearing. In fact, his answers to many Senators' \nconcerns, along with his answers to follow-up written questions, seem \nto raise even more concerns about his impartiality and judgment.\n\n  In the few weeks before Mr. Sutton was voted on by the Committee, we \nreceived hundreds of calls from individuals and organizations opposed \nto his nomination. Since he was voted on in Committee, opposition has \ncontinued to mount, and I and other Senators have received numerous \nadditional letters of opposition and calls from citizens across the \ncountry opposing Mr. Sutton. In fact, these are among the letters I \nhave received, from Members of Congress to individuals, in opposition \nto Mr. Sutton. It weighs about 25 pounds just lifting the letters.\n  From my own State of Vermont, I have received letters of opposition, \nsuch as a letter from the Vermont Council on Independent Living, and I \ncontinue to receive phone calls opposing Mr. Sutton. What I heard and \nwhat I continue to hear about this nominee, from people in Ohio and \naround the country, is troubling.\n  Mr. Sutton is clearly a bright, legally capable, and accomplished \nattorney. Yet, as a lawyer, in his own personal writings, and on his \nown time, he has sought out opportunities to attack federal laws and \nprograms designed to guarantee civil rights protections. Let me be \nclear, unlike what those on the other side of the aisle may say, I am \nnot opposing Mr. Sutton because he ``happened'' to represent clients \nwhose positions I may disagree with. I have voted on thousands of \nFederal judges since I have been here, many of them representing \nclients I totally disagreed with on positions diametrically opposite to \nmy own. As my record shows, I have voted for more than 100 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, many of whom took positions or represented \nclients with which I disagreed, including President Bush's two prior \nnominees to the Sixth Circuit, who were confirmed while I was Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee. While I disagreed with a number of the \npositions they took, I made sure they had hearings, and I made sure \nthey were confirmed.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle continue to wrongly characterize \nSenators' opposition to Mr. Sutton. They claim that those who are \nopposed to his lifetime confirmation object only to the clients he \nrepresented or the court decisions in the cases he argued. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. For example, I served in private \npractice. I defended clients charged with crimes. Then I was a \nprosecutor, and I prosecuted people charged with crimes. I did a \nlawyer's job in making sure there was adequate representation on both \nsides.\n  My opposition to Mr. Sutton is not based on his clients. It is based \non the fact that Mr. Sutton has aggressively pursued a national role as \nthe leading advocate of states' rights and has pushed extreme positions \nin order to limit the ability of Congress to protect civil rights. \nMoreover, he displayed at his hearing and in his written questions, \nthat he is not able to put aside these strong personal views in order \nto be fair and impartial.\n  It was Republicans who most recently held up or voted against a \nnumber of President Clinton's circuit court nominees because they were \nconcerned about the clients the nominee represented or disagreed with \nthe nominee's ideology.\n  For example, President Clinton nominated Timothy Dyk to be a judge on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Judge Dyk was \noriginally nominated in April 1998 but was not confirmed by the \nRepublican-controlled Senate until more than two years later, in May \n2000. Judge Dyk received 25 votes against him on the Senate floor, many \nof them from Republicans who objected to the clients he represented. \nFor example, former Senator Smith, voting against Judge Dyk, explicitly \nstated that he did not approve of the clients Mr. Dyk represented on a \npro bono basis, such as the well-known and well-respected organization \nPeople for the American Way. Other Senators who voted against Judge \nDyk, expressed concern over Judge Dyk's involvement in a case in which \nhe represented the Action for Children's Television in a challenge to \nFCC regulations.\n\n  As I have said, I have voted to confirm hundreds of individuals who \nhave represented unpopular clients or positions with which I disagreed. \nI would like to note, that some of the most respected judges in our \nhistory are judges who have stood up to unpopular sentiment to protect \nthe rights of minorities or people whose views made them outcasts. Mr. \nSutton is not one of these people. In fact, he has done the opposite. \nHe has stood up for states' rights and against civil rights, and for an \narcane constitutional theory over the rights of injured individuals. \nAny simplification of the opposition against Mr. Sutton as based solely \non who he represented is false and misleading.\n  I have taken a careful look at Mr. Sutton's advocacy record along \nwith his personal writings and speeches. Mr. Sutton has acted as more \nthan just counsel, he has aggressively pursued a national role as the \nleading advocate of a certain view of federalism and he has succeeded \nin pushing extreme positions in order to limit the ability of Congress \nto act to prevent discrimination and protect civil rights. Mr. Sutton \nhimself has stated that his advocacy on the principles of federalism \nare not just arguments he makes for his clients, but something in which \nhe strongly believes. In a Legal Times article, he was quoted as \nsaying, ``It doesn't get me invited to cocktail parties. But I love \nthese issues. I believe in this federalism stuff.''\n  Let me just note that, when asked about this comment at his hearing, \nMr. Sutton provided conflicting answers. First, he told me that this \ncomment was in response to his pursuit of Supreme Court cases after he \nleft the State Solicitor's office and returned to private practice at \nJones Day. However, when later asked about the same comment by Senator \nDeWine, Mr. Sutton stated that, at the time of the article, he was \nState Solicitor and that he was on the lookout for cases because the \nOhio Attorney General asked him to look for cases that affected the \nState. In follow-up written questions, while Mr. Sutton admits that he \nwas on the lookout for Supreme Court cases at Jones Day, he disavows \nthat he was similarly on the lookout as State Solicitor. Rather, he \nstates that he was only a ``subordinate'' and that ``everything [he \nwas] described as doing in the article was done to further'' the \ninterests of the Ohio Attorney General. In contrast, the Legal Times \narticle had several other sources who corroborated that it was Mr. \nSutton's own efforts and passion that led to Ohio taking so many cases \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court to assert state sovereign immunity. For \nexample, the Supreme Court Counsel for the National Association of \nAttorneys General (who applauds Mr. Sutton's work), said that Mr. \nSutton was a ``court-watcher'' with a ``first-out-of-the-gate \naggressiveness'' who had ``taken a very active role'' in taking on \nfederalism cases.\n  Based on Mr. Sutton's passionate advocacy and personal efforts to \nchallenge and weaken federal laws and individual rights, and his \nextreme activism against federal protection for state workers, a large \nnumber of disability\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\nrights groups, civil rights groups, environmental protection groups, \nand women's rights groups are opposed to his confirmation. It is \nunprecedented for the disability community to speak out so loudly in \nopposition to a judicial nominee. Overall, his nomination to the Sixth \nCircuit is opposed by hundreds of national, state and local disability \ngroups, and thousands of individuals.\n\n  Mr. Sutton has advocated for states' rights over civil rights and has \nsought to limit individuals' ability to be compensated when their \nrights are violated.\n  Mr. Sutton's record reveals a strong desire to limit Congress' power \nto pass civil rights laws and to limit the ability of individuals to \nseek redress for existing civil rights violations. In the last six \nyears, as both a State Solicitor and in private practice, Mr. Sutton \nhas been the leading advocate urging the Supreme Court to develop a new \njurisprudence that uses states' rights as grounds to limit the reach of \nfederal laws on behalf of the disabled, the aged, women, and \nenvironmental protection. He has argued major cases on civil rights, \nreligion, health care, and education, and, in all of these cases, his \narcane constitutional theory of the Eleventh Amendment--not based on \ntext, legislative history, or decades of precedent--has undermined the \nrights of millions of people.\n  He has argued, among other things, that Congress exceeded its \nauthority in passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, enacted in \n1993 with broad bipartisan support under the leadership of Senator \nKennedy and Senator Hatch, and parts of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990, a bipartisan bill championed by former Senator Bob Dole \nand Senator Harkin, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the \nViolence Against Women Act of 1994, a bipartisan act cosponsored by \nSenator Hatch and Senator Biden.\n  In addition to weakening Congress' ability to protect the rights of \nindividuals, Mr. Sutton has sought to limit the ability of individuals \nto seek redress in federal court for civil rights violations. For \nexample, he has argued to limit the remedies available to victims of \nsexual abuse and to limit the ability of Medicaid recipients to enforce \ntheir rights under the law. In essence, he has argued for the Supreme \nCourt to repudiate more than 25 years of legal precedents that \npermitted individuals to sue states to prevent violations of federal \ncivil rights regulations.\n  One of Mr. Sutton's most recent and significant cases in which he \nattempted to erode legal rights passed by Congress was Board of \nTrustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), \na case in which he argued that Congress exceeded its authority in \nenacting certain provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In \nthis case, in which a nursing director was demoted after undergoing \ntreatment for breast cancer, Mr. Sutton argued against the ability of \nstate employees to sue under Title I of the ADA for money damages if \ntheir employer discriminated against them. Mr. Sutton argued that \nalleged discrimination against the disabled should only receive \n``rational basis'' review and that Congress unconstitutionally elevated \nthe standard for disability discrimination in the ADA, an argument that \nwould severely limit Congress' authority to protect individual rights. \nMoreover, he argued that Congress had not identified a pattern of \nabuse, despite extensive hearings and findings of discriminatory \nactions by states, including unnecessary institutionalization and \ndenials of education. During oral argument, Mr. Sutton even said that \nthe ADA was not needed and that the case was a ``challenge to the ADA \nacross the board.''\n  Mr. Sutton was questioned heavily about his involvement in the \nGarrett case both at his hearing and in follow-up written questions, \nbut his answers were incomplete and deeply disturbing. Most of his \nanswers flatly contradicted statements that he made in either his legal \nbriefs or articles, or danced around the important substantive issues \nraised. Moreover, he consistently tried to redirect any questions about \nhis involvement in Garrett to be a discussion about the only case prior \nto his nomination in which he represented a disabled individual. He is \na skilled oral advocate and his skills were on display at his hearing. \nThat is not the question. The question before us is whether he should \nbe confirmed to be a circuit judge, not whether we would like him to \nargue an appellate case.\n  At his hearing, Mr. Sutton repeatedly brought up his involvement in \nOhio Civil Rights Comm'n v. Case Western Reserve University, 666 N.E. \n2d 1376 (Ohio 1996), a case involving a blind student denied admission \nto medical school, as an example of the idea that he is sympathetic to \npersons with disabilities. While no one that I know of has alleged that \nMr. Sutton has any personal antipathy to people with disabilities, it \ntroubles me that he has used his representation in this case as a \nresponse to questions I and other Senators asked about his involvement \nin the Garrett case. He testified that he was involved in the Garrett \ncase, without examining the issue of whether his representation would \nhelp or hurt people, or was legally right or wrong, because he was \neager to develop a Supreme Court practice.\n  The situation in the Case Western case is, perhaps, more revealing \nthan Mr. Sutton thought when he placed so much reliance on it. In that \ncase, Mr. Sutton was the Ohio Solicitor General in charge of all of the \nState of Ohio's appeals and, in such a capacity, he would normally have \nrepresented a state agency, like the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. Mr. \nSutton's statements regarding how he came to take this case are widely \ndivergent and irreconcilable: In his Senate Questionnaire, he states \nthat the case ``fell'' to him as Ohio State Solicitor, since it \n``fell'' to the Ohio Attorney General to defend the Commission's \ndecision through the state courts. At his hearing, he testified that he \nhad a choice of which side to take and that it was his job to make a \nrecommendation to the Attorney General. And, in answer to my follow-up \nquestions, he states that he chose to represent the Commission and, \nthereafter, ``did not have discretion to recommend'' to the Attorney \nGeneral that she not weigh in on the state medical schools' side of the \ncase. I still do not understand why the Attorney General had to agree \nto represent the state universities as an amicus party on the other \nside of the Civil Rights Commission in this case, and would guess that \nin almost all cases the Attorney General's office did not represent an \namicus on the opposite side of a case from a state agency. Regardless, \nI am troubled by Mr. Sutton's reliance on this case.\n  Not only does Mr. Sutton's descriptions of his involvement in this \ncase create irreconcilable differences, but his answers display an \nadvocate's skills rather than a judicious consideration of the \nsituation. It troubles me that Mr. Sutton's answers indicate that he \nbelieves that the representation of a blind student in one case--and a \ncase in which he acted in his official capacity--balances out the \nsignificant detrimental impact that his extreme arguments in Garrett \nhad on millions of disabled individuals. There is nothing that can undo \nthe elimination of rights by Garrett. Mr. Sutton's argument indicates a \ncommitment to ideology over people and convinces me that he is not able \nto put aside his advocacy even to present his involvement in a case \nobjectively.\n\n  Mr. Sutton has also tried to claim that he has represented many \nclients pro bono. However, in answer to my written questions, he \nindicates that he did not argue any other case involving disability \nrights prior to his nomination in May 2001. Since he submitted his \noriginal Senate Questionnaire in 2001, he notified us--in January \n2003--that he has taken on two death penalty cases and other criminal \nappeals. He also argued one disability rights case, involving whether \nthe Ohio Secretary of State violated the National Voter Registration \nAct in failing to designate the disability services offices at state \nuniversities as registration sites. This seems like the classic case of \n``nomination conversion,'' a nominee who has had his whole career to \nwork on different sides of issues, but, only after he is nominated, \ndoes he take cases to ``balance'' out his record. It must certainly be \nmore than a coincidence that every time he chose as a lawyer in private \npractice to argue a disability rights case before his nomination, he \nwas always on the same side of this issue against the rights of \ndisabled individuals.\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\n  Among Mr. Sutton's many other attempts to erode essential legal \nrights passed by Congress are:\n  Olmstead v. LC, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), a case involving Title II of the \nADA, where Mr. Sutton argued on behalf of the petitioners that it \nshould not be a violation of the ADA to force people with mental \ndisabilities to remain in an institutionalized setting rather than a \ncommunity-based program despite clear Congressional findings to the \ncontrary. Mr. Sutton's arguments in this case were accepted by Justices \nScalia and Thomas, but rejected by the majority of the Court.\n  Pennsylvania Dept of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 (1998), \nwhere Mr. Sutton filed an amicus brief arguing that the ADA does not \napply to state prison systems, a position which would have furthered \nweakened the ADA and severely limited its applicability, had it been \naccepted.\n  Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000), where Mr. \nSutton argued for severe limits on the ability of state employees to \nsue under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, stating that older \nworkers are adequately protected by local anti-discrimination laws, and \nthat Congress had no record of a pattern and practice of prior \nconstitutional violations by the States and that Congress exceeded its \nauthority since the legislation was concerned with age and not with \n``suspect'' classifications like race and national origin. The four \nSupreme Court Justices dissenting in this case stated that the decision \nwill have a serious impact on Congress' authority and ability to \nprotect civil rights and represented a ``radical departure'' from the \nproper role of the Supreme Court.\n  United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), where he filed an \namicus curiae brief on behalf of one state, the state of Alabama, \nchallenging the constitutionality of the federal civil remedy for women \nwho are the victims of sexual assault and domestic violence in the \nViolence Against Women Act. Of note, VAWA was passed by a broad and \nbipartisan coalition, and 36 states submitted briefs in support of the \nconstitutionality of the Act. Mr. Sutton argued, and the 5-4 majority \nof the Court accepted, that gender-based violence does not \nsubstantially affect interstate commerce because it is not an \n``economic'' activity and the impact of such crimes has only an \nattenuated connection to interstate commerce. He also argued that the \ncivil remedy provision for private acts of gender-motivated violence \nwas not permissible under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), where he argued that \nindividuals could not privately enforce disparate impact regulations \npromulgated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The \nSandoval decision reversed an understanding of the law that had been in \nplace for more than 27 years, and makes it nearly impossible to enforce \na range of practices with an unjustified disparate impact, such as \ndisproportionate toxic dumping in minority neighborhoods, the use of \neducationally unjustified testing or tracking practices that harm \nminority students, or the failure to provide appropriate language \nservices in health facilities. Mr. Sutton argued not only that the \ndisparate impact regulations could not be privately enforced, but that \nthese regulations were an invalid exercise of agency power. If this \nargument had been accepted by the Court, it would have made it \nimpossible for even the federal government to enforce actions with an \nunjustified disparate impact. In addition, Mr. Sutton argued in his \nbrief and in oral argument that implied rights of actions are never \npermissible under the spending power, an argument that the Court also \ndid not accept.\n  Westside Mothers v. Haveman, 1313 F.Supp.2d 549 (E.D. Mich. 2001), \nwhere he argued that Medicaid recipients have no legal rights to sue \nstates in order to enforce their rights under Medicaid. Mr. Sutton's \nprimary argument, which formed the core of the district court's ruling, \nwas that Spending Clause statutes were not ``federal law,'' but simply \na contract. He then argued that because Spending Clause statutes were \nsimply contracts, the individuals who sought to enforce the contract \nwere mere third-party beneficiaries to such contracts and were not \nenforcing any federal laws and thus suit could not be brought under \nSection 1983. Such far-reaching arguments go well-beyond the Supreme \nCourt's jurisprudence, and were ultimately rejected by the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, in a case with significant implications for \neconomically disadvantaged individuals.\n  City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), where he argued in an \namici curiae brief on behalf of 16 states that the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act (RFRA) exceeded Congress' power under Section 5 of the \nFourteenth Amendment and violated state sovereignty, stating that \nCongress could not enact a sweeping law without any evidence that \nreligious freedoms were being interfered with and urging that the \nstates ``be the principal bulwark when it comes to protecting civil \nliberties.'' Mr. Sutton applauded the court's ruling as ``a watershed \ncase . . . \nrespecting states' ability to govern themselves and to look after \nreligious liberties themselves,'' according to a Washington Post \narticle, and, in an essay written for the Federalist Society, he \npraised the decision as a ``victory for federalism.''\n  Mr. Sutton's record shows his tendency to present arguments with \nbroad implications that go well-beyond where even the activist, \nconservative majority on the Supreme Court has been willing to go. For \nexample, in Garrett and Kimel, he advocated a very narrow view of \nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment (the clause which allows for \nlegislation to enforce that Amendment) so that little remedial \nlegislation in the civil rights area could pass muster unless the \nplaintiffs can prove longstanding and well documented abuses by the \nstates.\n  Mr. Sutton's arguments in the case involving the Violence Against \nWomen Act also went beyond what the Court accepted. For example, he \nstated that ``the record is utterly devoid of support for the notion \nthat the States . . . have violated the rights of their citizens.'' \nAmicus Curiae Brief in Support of Respondents, 1999 WL 1191432 at 19. \nMr. Sutton took a more jaundiced view than the Supreme Court of \nevidence of discrimination; which could certainly translate into \nharsher rulings against women and minority interests. Moreover, in an \narticle after the VAWA decision, Mr. Sutton demonstrates his support \nfor the court's outcome and his view of Congress. He wrote:\n\n       Once accepted, only the most unimaginative lawmaker would \n     lack the resources to contend that all manner of in-State \n     activities will have rippling effects that ultimately affect \n     commerce. Such an approach would have a disfiguring effect on \n     the constitutional balance between the States and the \n     National Government . . . and would ultimately make \n     irrelevant virtually every other delegation of power to \n     Congress under Article I.\n\n  Unexamined deference to the VAWA fact findings would have created \nanother problem as well. It would give any congressional staffer with a \nlaptop the ultimate Marbury power to have a final say over what amounts \nto interstate commerce and thus to what represents the limits on \nCongress's Commerce Clause powers.\n  These condescending comments towards Congress are troubling. In \ngeneral, Congress is uniquely situated to gather facts from across the \nnation, obtain information from constituents who have first-hand \nexperience with the issues, and assess the magnitude of the problem. \nMoreover, VAWA was passed after numerous hearings, extensive inquiry, \nand fact-finding and with the bipartisan support of the Senate and \nHouse, the President and most states.\n  Mr. Sutton stated at his hearing that he has not attacked disability \nor other civil rights but has, instead, merely acted as an advocate for \nhis clients, advancing a theory of limited government.\n  Yet the record reveals that he has not simply taken an unpopular \nposition in the name of zealously representing the interests of his \nclients. As I have described, Mr. Sutton has often taken extreme \npositions and his record is one of activism in order to limit the \nability of Congress to act to prevent discrimination and protect civil \nrights. It seems to me to be no coincidence that Mr. Sutton has been \nthe chief lawyer in case after case arguing that individuals have no \nright to enforce the civil rights protections that Congress has given \nthem.\n  As I noted, Mr. Sutton has said that he has been ``on the lookout'' \nfor cases\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\nwhere he can raise issues of federalism or that will affect local and \nstate government interests. And his federalism practice boomed as he \nactively pursued cases attractive to his ideology and through his \ncontacts among the members of the Federalist Society. In answer to my \nfollow-up questions, Mr. Sutton admitted that he had taken no case in \nwhich he argued against a state claiming immunity from suit under the \nEleventh Amendment. Despite his protestation that he might argue either \nside of any case, it must certainly be more than a coincidence that \nevery time he has argued before the Supreme Court he has always been on \nthe same side of this issue. Despite numerous questions, Mr. Sutton did \nnot adequately address these concerns at his hearing nor show that he \nhas the ability to put aside his years of passionate advocacy and treat \nall parties fairly. On the contrary, when you talk to Mr. Sutton and \nyou look at his testimony, he demonstrates he has not considered the \nimpact that his arguments have on the lives of millions of women, \nseniors, the disabled, low-income children, and state employees, and \nthat he favors ideas over people, states' rights over civil rights, and \na patchwork of local rules over national standards.\n\n  He has every right to these views, but when it becomes clear that \nthose are the views that would be expressed by an extremist, then we \nhave to ask ourselves: Are we rubberstamping or are we advising and \nconsenting? Frankly, I believe in this case we would be rubberstamping, \nnot advising and consenting.\n  Mr. Sutton has stated in several articles that states should be the \nprincipal bulwark in protecting civil liberties, a claim that has \nserious implications given a history of state discrimination against \nindividuals. In numerous papers for the Federalist Society, he has \nrepeatedly stated his belief that federalism is a ``zero-sum situation, \nin which either a State or a federal lawmaking prerogative must fall.'' \nIn his articles, he has stated that the federalism cases are a battle \nbetween the states and the federal government, and ``the national \ngovernment's gain in these types of cases invariably becomes the \nState's loss, and vice versa.''\n  He also states that federalism is ``a neutral principle'' that merely \ndetermines the allocation of power. This view of federalism is not only \ninaccurate but troubling. First, these cases are not battles in which \none law-making power must fall, but in which both the state and the \nfederal government--and the American people--may all win. Civil rights \nlaws set federal floors or minimum standards but states remain free to \nenact their own more protective laws. Moreover, federalism is not a \nneutral principle as Mr. Sutton suggests, but has been used by those \ncritical of the civil rights progress of the last several decades to \nlimit the reach of federal laws.\n  Mr. Sutton tried to disassociate himself from these views, by saying \nthat he does not specifically recall these remarks and that, in the \nones he recalls, he was constrained to argue the positions that he \nargued on behalf of his clients. As far as I know, no one forced Mr. \nSutton to write any article, and most lawyers are certainly more \ncareful than to attribute their name to any paper that professes a view \nwith which they strongly disagree. In my view, Mr. Sutton's suggestions \nthat he does not personally believe what he has written are \nintellectually dishonest, insincere and misleading.\n  In sum, Mr. Sutton's extreme theories would restrict Congress' power \nto pass civil rights laws and close access to the federal courts for \npeople challenging illegal acts by their state governments (limiting \nindividuals' ability to seek redress for violations of civil rights). \nIf a State government does something wrong, we ought to be able to sue \nthe State government.\n  I remember shortly after the Soviet Union broke up, when a group of \nparliamentarians and lawyers came here to visit with a number of \nSenators about how they would set up a judicial system in the former \nSoviet Union.\n  One asked the question: We have heard that there are cases where \nsomebody may sue the Government, and the Government loses. How could \nthat possibly happen?\n  So we explained the independence of our courts, and we look for \njustice in the law and so on.\n  He said: You mean you didn't fire the judge if he allowed the \nGovernment to lose?\n  I said: Quite the opposite. In fact, the Government often loses.\n  Listening to Mr. Sutton, there are a lot of areas where the Federal \ncourts would be closed to people who challenge illegal acts by their \nState government.\n\n  In the name of the concept of sovereign immunity, Mr. Sutton \nthreatens to undermine uniform national laws protecting individuals' \nrights to welfare, housing, clean air, equality, and a harassment-free \nenvironment, and to undermine the core protections and services \nafforded by Congress to workers, the disabled, the aged, women, and \nmembers of religious minorities.\n  This view of federalism undermines the basic principle, announced in \nMarbury v. Madison, that ``[t]he very essence of civil liberty \ncertainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the \nprotection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.'' The judicial \nrole of enforcing and upholding the Constitution becomes hollow when \nthe government has complete immunity to suit. The burden should be on \nMr. Sutton to show that he will protect individual rights and civil \nrights as a lifetime appointee to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThis he has not done.\n  As I have said on other occasions, when the President sends us a \nnominee who raises concerns over qualifications or integrity or who \ndisplays an inability to treat all parties fairly, I will make my \nconcerns known. This is one of those times. In his selection of Mr. \nSutton for the Sixth Circuit, the President and his advisors are \nattempting to skew its decisions out of step with the mainstream and in \nfavor of States' rights over civil rights, anachronistic ideas over \npeople.\n  The Sixth Circuit is one on which Senate Republicans stalled three \nnominees of President Clinton during his last four years in office. \nThey closed and locked the gates to this court in 1997. Professor Kent \nMarkus' courageous testimony about that partisan process rings in my \nears. Despite those excesses by Senate Republicans, during my \nchairmanship, the Senate confirmed two new conservative members to the \nSixth Circuit. With this nomination, the plan of Republicans to pack \nthis court and tilt it sharply out of balance is evident for all to \nsee.\n  Before and after he took office, President Bush said that he wants to \nbe a uniter and not a divider, and yet he has sent and resubmitted to \nthe Senate several nominees who divide the American people. The Senate \nhas already confirmed 119 of his other judicial nominees. The Committee \nand the Senate made the judgment that those nominees will fulfill their \nduties to act fairly and impartially. Most were not divisive or \nextreme. I urge the President to choose nominees who fit that profile, \nrather than the alternative he seems intent on imposing for so many \ncircuit court nominees. End the court-packing effort and work with all \nin the Senate to name consensus, fair-minded federal circuit judges.\n  The oath taken by federal judges affirms their commitment to \n``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to \nthe poor and to the rich.'' No one who enters a federal courtroom \nshould have to wonder whether he or she will be fairly heard by the \njudge. Jeffrey Sutton's record does not show that he will put aside his \nyears of passionate advocacy in favor of states' rights and against \ncivil rights, and his extreme positions favoring severe restrictions on \nCongress' authority. Accordingly, I will not vote to confirm Mr. Sutton \nfor appointment to one of the highest courts in the land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5422-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5422-S5431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF JUDGE EDWARD PRADO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that Senate Republicans \ncontinue to focus on the most divisive judicial nominees and the White \nHouse continues its efforts to pack the courts ideologically, while the \nnomination of Judge Edward Prado to the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit is being held captive on the Senate calendar. All \nDemocratic Senators serving on the Judiciary Committee voted to report \nthis nomination favorably. All Democratic Senators have indicated that \nthey are eager to proceed to this nomination and, after a reasonable \nperiod of debate, voting on the nomination.\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\n  I am confident this nomination will be confirmed by an extraordinary \nmajority--maybe unanimously. The question arises why the Republican \nleadership in the Senate has made no effort to proceed to Senate \nconsideration of this judicial nomination--none.\n  In a statement in the Record early this month, I raised this matter. \nThen at the Judiciary Committee business meeting on April 10, more than \ntwo weeks ago, I raised this matter, again. Still, there has been no \nresponse and no effort to bring this matter before the Senate for \nconsideration and a vote. The Republican leadership would rather focus \nexclusively on those controversial circuit court nominees that raise \nthe most problems than proceed to fill vacancies with nominations on \nwhich we are able to achieve agreement.\n  That is most unfortunate and most telling.\n  Instead of proceeding to the nomination of Judge Prado, Republicans \ninsisted on pressing forward with the controversial and divisive \nnomination of Priscilla Owen in early April and with the controversial \nand divisive nomination of Jeffrey Sutton this week.\n  Judge Prado is nominated to the Fifth Circuit and is an exceptional \ncandidate for elevation to the appeals court. He has significant \nexperience as a public servant in west Texas. Perhaps the fact that he \nhas bipartisan support is the reason why he is not being brought \nforward at this time for a floor vote.\n  That does not fit the Republican message but reveals the truth: That \nDemocratic Senators, having already acted on 119 judges appointed by \nPresident Bush are prepared to support even more of his nominations \nwhen they are mainstream, consensus nominees. Perhaps the fact that \nDemocrats unanimously supported his nomination in Committee is seen as \na drawback for Mr. Prado in the Republican world of nomination \npolitics. I hope that is not the case.\n  I also hope the fact that Judge Prado is Hispanic is not a factor in \nthe Republican delay. Some have suggested that Judge Prado is being \ndelayed because Democratic Senators are likely to vote for him and \nthereby undercut the Republican's shameless charge that the opposition \nto Miguel Estrada is based on his ethnicity. Republican partisans have \nmade lots of partisan hay attacking Democrats in connection with the \nEstrada nomination. We all know that the White House could have \ncooperated with the Senate by producing his work papers and the Senate \ncould have proceeded to a vote on the Estrada nomination months ago. \nThe request for his work papers was sent last May.\n  Rather than respond as every other administration has over the last \n20 years and provide access to those papers, this White House has \nstonewalled. Rather than follow the policy of openness outlined by \nAttorney General Robert Jackson in the 1940's, this administration has \nstonewalled. And Republican Senators and other partisans could not wait \nto claim that the impasse created by the White House's change in policy \nand practice with respect to nominations was somehow attributable to \nDemocrats being anti-Hispanic. The charge would be laughable if it were \nnot so calculated to do political damage and to divide the Hispanic \ncommunity. That is what Republican partisans hope is the result. That \nis wrong.\n  So some have come to the conclusion that Republican delay in \nconnection with the consideration of Judge Prado's nomination may be \nrelated to the political strategy of the White House to unfairly \ncharacterize Democrats. Might the record be set straight if Democrats \nwere seen to be supporting this Hispanic nominee to the Fifth Circuit. \nMight the Republicans' own record of opposing President Clinton's \nnominations of Judge Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno to that same \ncircuit court be contrasted unfavorably with Democrats' support of \nJudge Prado.\n  Might Judge Prado, a conservative from Texas with a public record \nservice as a Federal district court judge, become the first Hispanic \nappointed by President Bush to the circuit courts with widespread \nsupport from Senate Democrats. Might this more mainstream, consensus \nnominee stand in stark contrast to the ideological choices intended to \npack the courts on which the White House and Senate Republicans \nconcentrate almost exclusively.\n  Judge Prado has 19 years of experience as a U.S. District Court \njudge, which provides us with a significant judicial career to \nevaluate. A review of Judge Prado's actions on the bench demonstrates a \nsolid record of fairness and evenhandedness.\n  While I may not agree with each and every one of his rulings or with \nevery action he has taken as a lawyer or judge, my review of his record \nleads me to conclude that he will be a fair judge. No supervisor or \ncolleague of Judge Prado's has questioned his ability or willingness to \ninterpret the law fairly. Judge Prado enjoys the full support of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus and the Mexican American Legal Defense \nand Education Fund. Not a single person or organization has submitted a \nletter of opposition or raised concerns about Judge Prado. No \ncontroversy. No red flags. No basis for concern. No opposition.\n  This explains why his nomination was voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee with a unanimous, bipartisan vote on an expedited basis.\n  To understand the importance of Judge Prado's nomination, we must put \nit in the context of prior nominations to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Until Judge Prado's hearing, it had been more than a decade \nsince a Latino nominee to that Court had even been allowed a hearing by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, let alone a vote on the floor. I recall \nPresident Clinton's two Hispanic nominations to the Fifth Circuit and \nthe poor treatment they received from the Republican-led Senate.\n  Judge Jorge Rangel was a former Texas State judge and a dedicated \nattorney in private practice in Corpus Christi, Texas when President \nClinton nominated him to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit in 1997. Judge Rangel is a graduate of the University of \nHouston and the Harvard Law School and earned a rating of ``Well \nQualified'' by the American Bar Association. Yet, under Republican \nleadership, he never received a hearing on his nomination, let alone a \nvote by the Committee or by the full Senate. His nomination languished \nwithout action for 15 months. Despite his treatment, this outstanding \ngentleman has recently written us in support of a judicial nominee of \nPresident Bush.\n  After Judge Rangel, disappointed with his treatment at the hands of \nthe Republican majority, asked the President not to resubmit his \nnomination, President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno, a distinguished \nattorney in private practice in El Paso, Texas. Mr. Moreno is a \ngraduate of Harvard University and the Harvard Law School. He was given \nthe highest rating of unanimously ``Well Qualified'' by the ABA. Mr. \nMoreno also waited 15 months, but was never allowed a hearing before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. President Clinton renominated him at \nthe beginning of 2001, but President Bush, squandering an opportunity \nfor bipartisanship, withdrew the nomination and refused to renominate \nhim.\n  In addition, President Clinton nominated H. Alston Johnson to the 5th \nCircuit in 1999. This talented Louisianan came to the Senate with the \nsupport of both of his home state Senators, but he never received a \nhearing on his nomination or a vote by the Committee or the full Senate \nin 1999, 2000, or the beginning of 2001. His nomination languished \nwithout action for 23 months.\n  In contrast, when I served as Chair of the Judiciary Committee last \nCongress, we granted Edith Clement a hearing within months of her \nnomination. At that time there had been no hearings on 5th Circuit \nnominees since 1994 and no confirmations since 1995.\n  Under Republican leadership, none of President Clinton's nominees to \nthis Court received a hearing during his entire second term of office.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made the \noutrageous claim that Democratic Senators are anti-Hispanic or anti-\nLatino. I think it is important to set the record straight.\n  Of the 10 Latino appellate judges currently seated in the Federal \ncourts, eight were appointed by President Clinton. Three other Latino \nnominees of President Clinton to the appellate courts were blocked by \nRepublicans, as\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\nwell as several others for the district court. In fact, in contrast to \nthe President's selection of only one Latino circuit court nominee in \nhist first 2 years in office, three of President Clinton's first 14 \njudicial nominees were Latino, and he nominated more than 30 Latino \nnominees to the Federal courts.\n  During President Clinton's tenure, 10 of his more than 30 Latino \nnominees, including Judge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Christine \nArguello to the circuit courts, were delayed or blocked from receiving \nhearings or votes by the Republican leadership.\n  Republicans delayed consideration of Judge Richard Paez for over \n1,500 days, and 39 Republicans voted against him. The confirmations of \nLatina circuit nominees Rosemary Barkett and Sonia Sotomayor were also \ndelayed by Republicans. Judge Barkett was targeted for delay and defeat \nby Republicans based on claims about her judicial philosophy, but those \nefforts were not successful.\n  After significant delays, 36 Republicans voted against the \nconfirmation of this nominee who received a ``Well-Qualified'' rating \nby the ABA. Additionally, Judge Sotomayor, who also received a ``Well-\nQualified'' rating and had been appointed to district court by \nPresident George H.W. Bush, was targeted by Republicans for delay or \ndefeat when she was nominated to the Second Circuit. She was confirmed, \nalthough 29 Republicans voted against her.\n  It is unfortunate how few Latino nominees this President has sent to \nthe Senate. It is reassuring, however, that the Latino nominations that \nwe have received have been acted upon in a expeditious manner.\n  They have overwhelmingly enjoyed bipartisan support. Under the \nDemocratically-led Senate, we swiftly granted hearings for and \neventually confirmed Judge Christina Armijo of New Mexico, Judge \nPhillip Martinez and Randy Crane of Texas, Judge Jose Martinez of \nFlorida, U.S. Magistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, and Judge Jose Linares of \nNew Jersey to the district courts. This year, we also confirmed Judge \nJames Otero of California, and we would have held his confirmation \nhearing last year if his ABA peer rating had been delivered to us in \ntime for the scheduling of our last hearing.\n  Also on the Senate executive calendar is the nomination of Cecilia \nAltonaga to be a Federal judge in Florida.\n  We expedited consideration of this nominee at the request of Senator \nGraham of Florida. She will be the first Cuban American woman to be \nconfirmed to the Federal bench when Republicans choose to proceed to \nthat nomination. Indeed, Democrats in the Senate have worked to \nexpedite fair consideration of every Latino nominee this President has \nmade to the Federal trial courts in addition to the nomination of Judge \nPrado.\n  Another example, may be the nomination of Consuelo Callahan to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. Unlike the divisive nomination of \nCarolyn Kuhl to the same court, both home state Senators returned their \nblue slips and support a hearing for Judge Consuelo Callahan. I hope \nshe receives a hearing in the near future and look forward to learning \nmore about her record as an appellate judge for the State of \nCalifornia. Rather than disregarding time-honored rules and Senate \npractices, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to help us \nfill more judicial vacancies more quickly by bringing those nominations \nthat have bipartisan support to the front of the line for Committee \nhearings and floor votes.\n  As I have noted throughout the last two years, the Senate is able to \nmove expeditiously when we have consensus, mainstream nominees to \nconsider. Nationally-respected columnist David Broder made this point \nin an April 16 column that appeared in the Washington Post. Mr. Broder \nnoted that when he asked Alberto Gonzales if there might be a lesson in \nJudge Prado's easy approval, Mr. Gonzales missed the point. In Mr. \nBroder's mind: ``The lesson seems obvious. Conservatives can be \nconfirmed for the courts when they are well known in their communities \nand a broad range of their constituents have reason to think them fair-\nminded.'' To date the Senate has proceeded to confirm 118 of President \nBush's nominees, 100 in the 17 months in which Democrats made up the \nSenate majority.\n  The lesson that less controversial nominees are considered and \nconfirmed more easily was the lesson of the last two years and that \nlesson has been lost on this White House.\n  Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise \nserious concerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties \non all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the \nprocess. I invite the President to nominate more mainstream individuals \nlike Judge Prado. His proven record and bipartisan support makes it \neasier for us to uphold our constitutional duty of advise and consent. \nI encourage those on the other side of the aisle to allow us to \nconsider his nomination.\n  I look forward to casting a vote in favor of his confirmation.\n  I, again, urge the Senate Republican leadership to work with us and \nto agree to proceed to this consensus nomination, to provide adequate \ntime for debate and to proceed to a vote without further delay. Judge \nPrado's nomination has been delayed on the Senate executive calendar \nfor several weeks, unnecessarily in my view. I recall all too vividly \nwhen anonymous Republican holds delayed Senate action on the nomination \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit for seven months. I do \nnot want to see that experience repeated by Judge Prado. Let us work \ntogether. Let us debate and act on the nomination of Judge Prado \nwithout further unnecessary delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of David Broder's April 16 column \non the nomination of Judge Prado be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Tale of Two Judges\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Were it not for an old friend, I would have been as \n     oblivious to the story of Judge Edward Prado of San Antonio \n     as the rest of the Washington press corps.\n       Judge Tom Stagg of Shreveport, La., told me his pal was up \n     for appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th \n     Circuit and suggested I go by and ``see how they treat him'' \n     at his confirmation hearing.\n       Turns out it's like the Sherlock Holmes story of the dog \n     that didn't bark. In the midst of the bitter partisan battle \n     in which Democrats have repeatedly blocked a Senate \n     confirmation vote on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Prado went \n     through like gangbusters.\n       The story of why one Latino Republican has such an easy \n     time while another creates such controversy is an instructive \n     tale--and one with hopeful implications.\n       Estrada has been denied an up-or-down vote on the Senate \n     floor because Democrats call him ``a stealth nominee,'' a man \n     of high credentials but no judicial experience and one they \n     say was unresponsive to their questions. Their demand to look \n     at memos he wrote while serving in the Justice Department has \n     been rejected by the administration and neither side has \n     yielded.\n       Given this background, I was expecting to see Prado, 55, \n     put to the test at his Judiciary Committee hearing. His \n     credentials are impressive: a graduate of the University of \n     Texas and its law school, four years each as a prosecutor and \n     a public defender, a short stint as a state judge, U.S. \n     attorney for three years and, since 1984, a federal district \n     judge--the last two appointments coming from President Ronald \n     Reagan.\n       But Prado is also a character. His courtroom is wired with \n     the latest audiovisual equipment, which Prado, a music lover \n     and showman, loves to demonstrate. Three years ago, during a \n     murder-for-hire trial, he came onto the bench while a \n     recording of ``Happy Together'' by the Turtles filled the \n     air, and then sang: ``Imagine me as God. I do. I was \n     appointed by the president. Appointed forever. My decisions \n     cannot be questioned by you. I'm always right.''\n       Many judges may feel that way; few say so, and even fewer \n     put it to music.\n       More seriously, in answering the committee's questionnaire, \n     Prado noted controversial cases in which he ruled against a \n     woman's claim of job discrimination by the San Antonio fire \n     department, a diabetes patient's claim that he was unfairly \n     found to be medically ineligible for a police officer's job, \n     and a claim that the Texas high school graduation test \n     discriminated against Hispanics.\n       In another part of the questionnaire, he listed 68 \n     criminal, immigration and civil cases in which he had been \n     reversed or criticized by the court of appeals. Plenty of \n     fertile ground, one imagined, for liberal groups to challenge \n     elevating a Reagan judge to a closely balanced and important \n     bench just one level below the Supreme Court.\n       But in fact the Congressional Hispanic Caucus--which has \n     vigorously opposed the Estrada nomination--wrote a letter \n     endorsing Prado. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat and \n     co-signer of the letter, told me that he had known Prado for \n     almost 40 years and ``he was everything you want in a\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\n     judge--he's smart and articulate, he's not arbitrary, and he \n     really understands people. Some of his rulings I would take \n     issue with, but when the caucus interviewed him, he talked \n     honestly about cases that have impacted minorities and he \n     made it clear he knows how important the courts have been to \n     us. It was so different from our hour's conversation with \n     Estrada, who conveyed no sense of what we would think a \n     Latino should appreciate about the historical role of courts \n     in bringing us to where we are today and where we need to be \n     tomorrow.''\n       With the backing of the White House and the Hispanic \n     caucus, Prado's confirmation hearing was perfunctory Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat and scourge of \n     Estrada, read a statement complaining of past Republican \n     treatment of President Bill Clinton's Latino nominees, then \n     left without asking any questions. The two Republicans \n     present--Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Jeff Sessions of \n     Alabama--said they had known Prado for years and simply \n     congratulated him.\n       Prado was then unanimously confirmed by the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       When I asked Alberto Gonzales, the White House counsel, if \n     there might be a lesson in Prado's easy approval, he replied, \n     ``It's hard to say. We view Judge Prado as no more qualified \n     than Miguel Estrada or others they [the Democrats] have \n     opposed.''\n       But the less on seems obvious. Conservatives can be \n     confirmed for the courts when they are well known in their \n     communities and a broad range of their constituents have \n     reason to think them fair-minded. Even if they can't resist \n     breaking into song.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am concerned that we seem to have these \ndivisive nominees. The Republicans are unwilling to bring forward Judge \nEdward Prado to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I \nmention this because I have checked every single Democrat who is \nwilling to have an extremely short time agreement and go to a vote on \nJudge Prado. Apparently, it is not being brought forward because of a \nhold on the Republican side. I mention this because we hear often from \nthe White House: Why are Democrats holding up these court of appeals \njudges?\n  Well, here is one where every Democrat is willing to vote on the \nPresident's nomination to the Fifth Circuit. He is a distinguished \nHispanic, Judge Edward Prado. We are ready to vote on him. We have \ncleared it on this side of the aisle. Apparently, it is being held up \non the Republican side. So the next time the White House asks why we \ncannot move forward with some of these people, let's say: Don't look at \nus; you may want to ask the other side.\n  It is even interesting that David Broder wrote a column, April 16, on \nthe nomination of Judge Prado to this seat and pointed out that he had \ncome to the hearings to see what kind of divisiveness there was and \nfound a love-in, and he was probably surprised--I don't want to put \nwords in his mouth, but he is probably surprised that it has not been \nvoted on.\n  I will note that Judge Prado has significant experience. I do not \nagree with him on everything, by any means, but he was originally \nappointed, I believe, by President Reagan to the district court. He is \na conservative Republican, a Hispanic. Every Democrat is prepared to go \nforward. I ask whoever is holding him up on the Republican side to \nrelease the hold, let this man go forward and let him be elevated to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to talk for just a moment about a \ncase that has seen the most attention in this debate over Mr. Sutton's \nnomination, and that is the case of the Board of Trustees of the \nUniversity of Alabama v. Garrett.\n  Mr. Sutton has been criticized for representing the University of \nAlabama in the U.S. Supreme Court; specifically, for presenting \nAlabama's constitutional sovereignty immunity argument before the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  In the Garrett case, the Supreme Court held that a disabled \nindividual cannot sue a State for money damages for employment \ndiscrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Court \nheld that in order for Congress to pass that particular remedy--money \ndamages against a State--it first had to show that States were engaging \nin a pattern of employment discrimination against the disabled. The \nCourt said that Congress had not met the burden of proof required by \nthe Constitution. That was the finding of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I disagreed with the Court's decision in Garrett, and I disagreed \nwith Alabama's argument as presented by Mr. Sutton in the Supreme \nCourt. I believe that Congress did, in fact, meet its burden in passing \nthe ADA. Congress established a record of discrimination against the \ndisabled necessary to pass constitutional scrutiny by the courts. \nCongress sent a loud and clear message to the courts in the findings of \nthe ADA and in an extensive legislative history.\n  What happened in Garrett was that the Supreme Court--unwisely, I \nbelieve--substituted its judgment for ours. The Court reviewed our \nextensive findings and our legislative history, then, one by one, \ndismissed them as inadequate.\n  I must say to my colleagues that I am deeply troubled by the Court's \nlack of deference to Congress in the Garrett case. This lack of \ndeference is why many of us in this body believe the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, in Garrett, simply got it wrong.\n  Ultimately, whether I agree or disagree with Mr. Sutton's arguments, \nor whether this Senator from Ohio agrees or disagrees with the Supreme \nCourt in that Garrett case, is really irrelevant to whether Mr. Sutton \nis qualified to serve on the Federal bench because, you see, Mr. Sutton \nwas doing nothing more than acting as a lawyer, as an advocate.\n  It is clear that all Mr. Sutton has done is successfully argue his \nclient's position in that case and in some other controversial cases. \nBluntly, that is what lawyers do. They argue for their clients. As Mr. \nSutton has testified, he has argued on behalf of a wide range of \nclients, on a wide range of issues.\n  Back in January of this year, the Columbus Dispatch weighed in on \nthis exact point when it wrote:\n\n       The fact is, Sutton is guilty of nothing except being a \n     good lawyer. When he represents a disabled client, he fights \n     hard for the disabled client. When he is representing a State \n     opposing an extension of Federal power, as in the ADA case, \n     he fights hard for his State client. That is what attorneys \n     are supposed to do.\n  I absolutely agree with that editorial from the Columbus Dispatch and \nwith that assessment. I believe arguing that Jeff Sutton should not be \nconfirmed because of his legal representation in Garrett or any other \ncase would set a very bad precedent for this body. We should not go \ndown that path today or tomorrow when we vote. We should not go down \nthe path of denying the confirmation of a nominee because we may not \nlike some of the clients he has represented or because we disagree with \nthe arguments he has made as an attorney. Think about it. If that is \nthe standard we apply, we would never confirm anyone who has a \nbackground as a criminal defense lawyer.\n  The examples are legion.\n  What would this criterion have meant for Supreme Court Justice \nThurgood Marshall? In 1943, Thurgood Marshall successfully argued a \ncase before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of an accused rapist.\n  He used a technical jurisdictional argument to defend his client. \nSpecifically, he argued that the Federal Government could not prosecute \nhis client for a rape that took place on a Federal military \ninstallation in Louisiana, based on an obscure land acquisition act. \nThere was no question in this case as to the actual guilt of the \ndefendant, only whether the Federal Government had jurisdiction to \nprosecute the individuals guilty of the crime.\n  Nobody argued that Thurgood Marshall should not be confirmed because \nof his role as a defense lawyer in that case. He was doing his job--\ndefending his client's legal position.\n  Obviously his role in this case did not mean that he believed that \nthe Federal Government should not be able to prosecute crimes, or that \nThurgood Marshall was not sympathetic to women's issues, or that he was \nin any way sympathetic to rapists, for Heaven's sake.\n  Let me raise an example that was called to the attention of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee by a another Court of Appeals nominee--the \nfamous example is John Adams. John Adams, the revered and well-known \npatriot of our Nation's Revolutionary War, represented extremely \nunpopular clients while acting in his capacity as a private attorney.\n  As some of my colleagues may recall, John Adams argued in a murder \ntrial on behalf of a prominent captain in the British army and several \nof his soldiers\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\nwho had allegedly killed five Boston citizens and injured several \nothers in what is known as ``the Boston Massacre.'' Adams described his \nwork on behalf of the British soldiers as ``the most gallant, generous, \nmanly and disinterested Actions of my whole life, and one of the best \npieces of service I ever rendered my country.'' He also described his \ninvolvement in the Boston Massacre case as a source of great anxiety--\nevidence enough that his representation of the soldiers was, as a \npolitical and social matter, extremely unpopular at the time.\n  As my colleagues know, John Adams was successful in his \nrepresentation of the soldiers. Clearly, however, John Adams was not \nsympathetic to British rule or murder nor opposed to popular citizen \nuprisings.\n  Would the Senate have not confirmed John Adams to a court because of \nhis work as a lawyer? I certainly hope that would not have been true.\n  There are many examples of individuals who were confirmed by this \nbody for service on the Federal bench and had, during their time in \nprivate practice, represented unpopular clients or causes.\n  Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, for example, represented two \ncorporations charged in two separate cases with conspiracy to \nmonopolize markets and illegal restraint of competition. Despite his \nwork on behalf of these corporations, few would argue that Justice \nStevens unfairly favors the interests of businesses over those of \nconsumers or that his efforts as a lawyer in these cases reflect his \npersonal feelings about corporate misconduct.\n  To take a few more recent examples, Eric Clay, confirmed in 1997 to \nthe 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, represented a number of client \npositions that many might find personally problematic: An insurance \ncompany that was seeking to deny benefits to a disabled individual \ncovered by the company's policy; a defendant in a sex discrimination \nsuit; and a corporation which was seeking to displace, by condemnation \nif necessary, an entire town in Michigan so that an automaker could \nbuild an assembly plant on the land. Nonetheless, nobody would argue \nthat Judge Clay then or now on the basis of his work as an attorney, \nheld personal views that were hostile toward employees, the disabled, \nor people who live in small towns.\n  Frank Hull, who was confirmed in 1997 to the 11th Circuit, \nrepresented a company seeking to deny life insurance benefits to the \nspouse of a deceased employee and also represented an accounting firm \nthat was accused of financial fraud. Justice Hull was confirmed 96 to \n0. Nobody believed that Judge Hull had a bias against widows or that he \nsupported financial fraud.\n  Merrick Garland was confirmed in 1997 to the D.C. Circuit Court. \nPrior to that, in his capacity as a Federal prosecutor, he successfully \nopposed a defendant who was trying to assert his constitutional right \nto due process in order to overturn a drug conviction. Nobody in the \nSenate believes that Judge Garland has any personal opposition to \nconstitutional due process protections.\n  Robert Bruce King, confirmed in 1998 to the 4th Circuit Court of \nAppeals, represented a client accused and convicted of defrauding the \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Nonetheless, nobody \nbelieves that Judge King advocates the practice of defrauding the \nGovernment or that he is somehow hostile toward the mission of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  The list goes on and on, and I am sure that Members of the Senate and \ntheir staffs could easily come up with a laundry list of examples where \nan individual has represented potentially unsavory clients or causes in \nprivate practice and has nonetheless been confirmed to the Federal \nbench by the Senate. Members of this body did not oppose these nominees \njust because they might not have liked all of the nominee's clients, or \nbecause they did not like the positions they took or the issues they \nstood for while advocating for that particular client.\n  This should not even be an issue. The idea of zealously advocating \nfor your client, no matter who that client is and what he or she is \naccused of, is basic and fundamental to the very idea of being a \nlawyer. And, I might add, it goes to the core obligation of being a \nlawyer. Once a person takes a case, they must represent that client to \nthe fullest of their ability.\n  In fact, the American Bar Association Model Code of Professional \nConduct explicitly addresses this issue. The Model Code, Canon 7-1, \nstates this:\n\n       The duty of a lawyer, both to his client and to the legal \n     system, is to represent his client zealously within the \n     bounds of the law.\n\n  The individuals listed above represented their clients, even the \nunpopular ones I have mentioned, because they understood their role as \nattorneys. They were dedicated to representing their clients, whomever \nthey might be, and to advocating the cause and positions of their \nclients. Jeff Sutton has shown the same dedication.\n  He has been a passionate advocate for his clients, as every lawyer is \nduty-bound to be. He should be judged by his advocacy and ability as a \nlawyer. He should not be condemned for this.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened with care to the arguments \nespoused now by my good friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine. \nI compliment him on many aspects of his statement especially when he \nfirst opened up and said that he believed the Court got it wrong in the \nGarrett case; Congress did have our findings, which I have pointed out \ntime and time again this afternoon that, in fact, Congress did have \nyears and years of testimony, markups by five separate committees, 17 \nformal hearings, on and on, making the case for the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. As I understood what my colleague from Ohio said, he \nbelieved the Court got it wrong. I commend him for his statement on \nthat; obviously, I concur in that opinion.\n  My good friend from Ohio goes on to say that basically Mr. Sutton, in \narguing against Mrs. Garrett and in arguing for the State of Alabama in \nthis case, was simply representing his client and following the canons \nof legal ethics in making sure he fought as vigorously as possible on \nbehalf of his client. I understand that and I can accept that is what \nMr. Sutton was doing in this particular case.\n  However, the canons of legal ethics also make it clear that in \nrepresenting your client to the best of your ability and to vigorously \ndefend your client that you also have to adhere to the codes of ethics \nand legal ethics and one of those is to be truthful and to do due \ndiligence in terms of understanding the parameters of mistakes. People \ndo make mistakes; I understand that, but I do believe Mr. Sutton in \nwhat he said in his oral argument before the Court when he said the ADA \nwas not needed. I think that goes a little bit far. Earlier I said he \neither did not know what Congress had done or he did know and treated \nit with disdain. If that were the only thing, if Mr. Sutton's \nrepresentation in the Garrett case were the only thing, I would say \nthose who oppose him would, indeed, have a weak reed on which to stand.\n  But that is not the point. It is not just Garrett. It is the things \nMr. Sutton has said outside of his representation of a legal client.\n  Before I get to that I will, again, reiterate for the sake of \nemphasis what the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, said \nearlier, that in all of his representations he has never taken a case \non the other side that is against States rights. Never; not one. So he \npicks out and looks at those cases where he can be on the side of \nStates rights versus ability or the authority of Congress to legislate \non a national basis.\n  Beyond that, it is what Mr. Sutton has said outside of the courtroom. \nFirst, I have pointed out before the Legal Times article in 1998 in \nwhich Mr. Sutton told a reporter he and his staff were always on the \nlookout for cases that would be coming before the Court that raise \nissues of federalism. He is always looking out for those cases. And \nwhat cases does he take? Only those in which he can argue on behalf of \nStates rights versus Federal authority. He says: It does not get me \ninvited to cocktail parties, but I love\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nthese issues. I believe in this federalism stuff.\n  Again, that in and of itself might be kind of harmless. But then on \nNational Public Radio in 2000 he said, ``As with age discrimination, \ndisability discrimination in the Constitution is really very difficult \nto show.'' Here is the evidence: 17 hearings, markup by five \ncommittees, 63 public forums across the country, thousands of pages of \ndocuments, oral and written testimony by the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, Governors, State attorneys general, State legislators, \nor 300 examples of discrimination by State governments, all on the \nlegislative record. Yet he said it is really difficult to show. He did \nnot say this on behalf of a client; he said this in a radio interview. \nSo we have to add all of these and look at the whole picture that \nemerges of Mr. Sutton.\n\n  Then in an article for the Federalist Society of 2000 Mr. Sutton \nsays: Unexamined deference to the Violence Against Women Act fact \nfindings would give to any congressional staffer with a laptop the \nultimate Marbury power to have the final say over what amounts to \ninterstate commerce.\n  Take that with the statement about how difficult it is to show in a \nconstitutional sense, discrimination against disability, then his \ncomments about how he believes and loves this federalism stuff, and the \nfact that he only takes cases on that side of the ledger. It adds up to \none thing: That Mr. Sutton, in wanting to be a Federal judge, believes \nthat when it comes to civil rights legislation, States rights trumps \nwhat we do here. When it comes to our ability to address underlying \ncivil rights issues, States rights trumps the Federal Government. The \nfact he would even think that somehow Congress, in passing a law such \nas the ADA or the Violence Against Women Act, or any of these other \ncivil rights bills, that somehow we have a staffer just sit down and \ntype it out on a laptop and we bring it out here and pass it, again, \nthat either illustrates that Mr. Sutton has a terribly uninformed view \nas to how we operate or he just has a disdain for what we do here.\n  As I said, I may disagree with some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle on this issue or that issue, or how we approach this, \nbut I do believe, whether it is under Republican control or Democratic \ncontrol, Senators and Congressmen work very hard. We take an oath of \noffice to uphold and defend the Constitution. We do not come out here \nwilly-nilly and let ``staffers with laptops'' draft up a bill and just \nsort of vote it through. That is not what we do.\n  According to Mr. Sutton, he says we do that. Well, we do not do that. \nWe have hearings. We have findings. We work things out. We took a long \ntime in the case of the Americans with Disabilities Act--many, many \nyears--to get it right, to make sure that we pass constitutional \nmuster.\n\n  So it is not just Mr. Sutton's representation of his client in any \nparticular case. It is the cases he takes, the writings he has made, \nthe statements he has made outside the courtroom that indicate he would \nbe an ideology-driven, activist judge on the circuit court.\n  If Mr. Sutton is so balanced, why didn't he ever take a case that \ntook the opposite side on States rights? Not one. Not one.\n  My friend from Utah earlier pointed out he has represented people \nwith disabilities and he sits on a board that looks out for the \ninterests of people with disabilities. Let's take a look at that. \nJeffrey Sutton did, indeed, represent the National Coalition of \nStudents with Disabilities. According to my staff's research, the case \nwas filed on November 6, 2000. Mr. Sutton was nominated for this court \non May 9, 2001, almost 6 months later, and then Mr. Sutton did not \nbecome attorney of record on this case until April 26, 2002. That is \nquite a bit later. I find that very curious. In all the cases Mr. \nSutton has taken, the one case they point to where he represented some \npeople with disabilities he took after he was nominated for the vacancy \non the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  We have heard here time and time again that Mr. Sutton represented \nCheryl Fischer in her attempt to be admitted to Case Western Medical \nSchool. Again, Mr. Sutton did work on the case, but he did not \nrepresent Cheryl Fischer. He was the Ohio Solicitor. He represented the \nOhio Civil Rights Commission that supported Cheryl Fischer because that \nwas his job. Again, he represented his client, which was the Ohio Civil \nRights Commission. Cheryl Fischer's attorney was Thomas Andrew Downing.\n  Again, I commend Mr. Sutton's work on that case. But I guess it \ntroubles me that Mr. Sutton's hearing testimony indicates his view that \nhis work on that single case, a case in which he acted in his official \ncapacity, balances out the significant impact that his arguments had on \nall these other cases, Garrett included.\n  Last, someone said Mr. Sutton sits on the board of the Equal Justice \nFoundation. Mr. Sutton came on that board a year before he was \nnominated. My question is, Has Mr. Sutton ever been the lawyer for any \nof the cases my colleagues mentioned that the foundation took? The \nfoundation took cases. Was Mr. Sutton ever a lawyer for any of the \ncases my colleagues mentioned?\n  My friend from Utah named a few individuals who ``work in the \ndisability community'' who support Mr. Sutton. I understand that. There \nare a few individuals who claim to be active in the disability \ncommunity, and they support Mr. Sutton's nomination. But here is a list \nof 400 civil rights organizations, including every major disability \norganization, that have come together opposed to Mr. Sutton's \nnomination. As I look through this list, as I look especially at those \nwho deal with disability issues, because that is my area of interest, I \nsee sometimes they might have been opposed to this judge and then a \ndifferent part of the group might have been opposed to that judge, but \nthis is the first time that I know of that all of them came together on \none judge: Mr. Sutton. All of them came together in opposing him.\n  My friend from Utah mentioned a person in particular, Francis \nBeytagh, mentioned by the Senator as the Director of the National \nCenter of Law and the Handicapped.\n  I have been dealing in disability issues now going on 25 years. I \nsaid I don't know about this group. Let's find out about it. There is \nnothing in Mr. Beytagh's current and very detailed resume posted on the \nWeb page of the Florida Coastal School of Law that mentions any work of \nhis in the disability community--not even one mention. But I did find \nout that the National Center of Law and the Handicapped was founded in \nthe early 1970s, in South Bend, IN, and has not existed for 15 years at \nleast, according to Harvey Bender, one of its founders.\n\n  I don't know. My friend from Utah said he was the legal director for \nthe National Center of Law and the Handicapped. We can't even find that \nthat exists anymore, but evidently, in the 1970s, it was someplace at \nNotre Dame.\n  I understand from Mr. Beytagh's letter of support he worked \nextensively with Mr. Sutton when Mr. Beytagh was Dean of the Ohio Law \nSchool, and I also notice Mr. Beytagh also worked for Jones Day law \nfirm, which is on his resume, which of course is the law firm for which \nMr. Sutton works.\n  That is all great. But the statement that Mr. Beytagh represents a \nviewpoint of the disability community is totally inaccurate--totally \ninaccurate.\n  I just wanted to make those points to clear up some misconceptions \nthat may have come out here on the floor earlier today, and hopefully I \nwill have some more to say about this tomorrow.\n  Again, I want to make it very clear that it is not just Mr. Sutton's \nstatements in the Garrett case. My friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine, is \nabsolutely right. He is representing his client. That is not the point.\n  However, he did say one thing in that case that bothers me. That was, \nbasically, that ADA was not needed.\n  OK, maybe you might excuse that and say that is just pushing the \nenvelope on being a vigorous proponent of his client's views. But then \ntake that in the contextual framework of everything else--Mr. Sutton \nalways taking cases that are just on one side of the States rights \nissue, just one side; the fact that on numerous occasions outside the \ncourtroom, in speaking and in writing, Mr. Sutton has shown either a \ntotal misunderstanding of how we operate here or a clear disdain for \nthe ability of Congress to respond nationally in the area of civil \nrights. Take this all together and, again, it points to a person who \nhas an ideology, as the New\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nYork Times editorial said this morning: It is another ideologue for the \ncourt, someone who is driven by an ideology.\n  I don't mind someone having an ideology. All of us have different \nbeliefs. But to be driven by an ideology and to carry that on the court \nindicates to me that Mr. Sutton would be an ideologically driven \nactivist judge who would do all that he could to find on behalf of \nStates rights as opposed to Federal rights.\n  There may be times when States rights should trump Federal rights--\nobviously. Sometimes Federal rights ought to trump States rights. That \nis the give and take of our system. But according to Mr. Sutton's \nviews, his writings, his statements, the cases he has taken, his view \nis that States rights should always trump what we do here at the \nFederal level.\n  That is why I believe Mr. Sutton should not be on the circuit court. \nMaybe he should be on a State court someplace but not on the Federal \nbench.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make some remarks on the \npending nomination of Jeffrey S. Sutton, a nominee for the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. He is an extraordinary and excellent attorney \nwhom the President has nominated.\n  In 1990, he graduated first in his class at Ohio State University Law \nSchool. I know Senator DeWine would agree that that is one of America's \ngreat law schools. After law school, he served as a law clerk for a \njudge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the same kind of court of \nappeals on which he would be now a judge. He has had firsthand \nexperience on how a court of appeals operates. Then he clerked for two \nJustices on the U.S. Supreme Court. That is not something easily \nachieved for a graduating lawyer. To be chosen to be a law clerk for a \nSupreme Court Justice is a remarkable achievement. Not many get it, and \nmany apply for it. He clerked for Justices Lewis Powell and Antonin \nScalia on the Supreme Court.\n  From 1995 to 1998, he served as the Solicitor for the State of Ohio. \nThat means he was chosen to argue appellate cases for the State of \nOhio, to advise the State on what cases to take up, what positions to \ntake on those cases. Again, it is the kind of experience that is \ninvaluable for a court of appeals nominee.\n  Since 1995, he has taught courses on Federal and State constitutional \nlaw as adjunct professor at Ohio State. He is currently a partner in \nthe Columbus, OH, office of the esteemed law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis \n& Pogue.\n  Mr. Sutton has argued 12 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court; he has \nwon 9 of them. That is quite an extraordinary record. Whether he won \nthem or not, just being chosen to argue any case before the Supreme \nCourt is a great honor. Very few lawyers in their entire career will \never be able to argue a single case before the Supreme Court. Why was \nhe chosen to argue 12 cases before the Court? Because he was recognized \nas a brilliant lawyer, a person who understood appellate law and \nprocedure, who understood constitutional issues and statutory \nconstruction and the things that appellate judges do. That speaks well \nof him. He also has argued 14 cases in State supreme courts.\n\n  Just this year, the American Lawyer magazine named Mr. Sutton one of \nthe best lawyers in America under age 45. To recite his credentials is \nto reach one conclusion: If you need representation in appellate court, \nyou could hardly do better than Jeffrey Sutton. We are looking at a \npreeminent nominee, one of the best lawyers in America.\n  The ABA has given Mr. Sutton what the Democrats call the gold \nstandard, a qualified rating, with a minority voting ``well-\nqualified.'' His qualifications don't seem to matter to a few who are \ndedicated opponents, and who, I have to say, are not being realistic in \nthis matter. They are not being fair, and they are showing \npartisanship, and an extreme ideological bent.\n  The special interest groups and some in this body have targeted this \nnominee. They have raised the same arguments we have heard before. They \nallege, amazingly, that he is hostile to the rights of the disabled. \nThey claim he favors weakening laws that deal with age discrimination. \nThey say he is pro-life because he is a member of the supposedly pro-\nlife Federalist Society. But these claims are not pertinent. They miss \nthe mark.\n  Let's start with this disability rights question. It is a very \nimportant issue. It is something we ought to talk about with regard to \nJeffrey Sutton, and we need to remember the concepts on this matter as \nwe deal with other nominees who come before the Senate.\n  The charges and complaints are based in large part on Mr. Sutton's \nrepresentation of my home State of Alabama in Board of Trustees of the \nUniversity of Alabama v. Garrett. In the Garrett case, what happened \nwas that an employee of the university sued the university, claiming \nthat university's policies violated the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. Mr. Sutton argued on behalf of the State of Alabama, and the \nSupreme Court agreed with him that Congress had not identified a \npattern of irrational State discrimination in employment against the \ndisabled. Congress, therefore, he argued, could not abrogate the \nState's 11th amendment immunity from suits for money damages by the \npassage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This well-established \nprinciple was recognized centuries ago by Blackstone before the \nfounding of this country.\n  I would say parenthetically that I served as attorney general of the \nState of Alabama. I know what the duties of attorneys general are, as \ndoes Senator Cornyn in the chair, a member from the State of Texas. It \nis the duty of the State to defend its prerogatives. An attorney \ngeneral who does not defend the legal authority of a State, and allows \nthat authority to be eroded from any source whether it be the Congress \nor any other entity is failing in his or her duty.\n  Blackstone, with regard to the concept of being able to sue the \nStates, said:\n\n       No action lies under a republican form of government \n     against the state or nation, unless the legislature has \n     authorized it: [this is] a principle recognized in the \n     jurisprudence of the United States, and of the individual \n     states.\n  So no action lies against the State or the Nation unless a \nlegislature authorizes it.\n  The reason is pretty simple. The power to sue is the power to \ndestroy. States or the Federal Government will not allow themselves to \nbe destroyed by lawsuits. So the ability of private parties to sue a \nsovereign Federal Government, or a sovereign State government, is \nlimited.\n  Now, State sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment is the \nconcept we are dealing with, but those who want to oppose Mr. Sutton \nhave taken the position that his defense of sovereign immunity shows \nthat he is opposed to the Disabilities Act. Critics say he doesn't care \nabout disabled children because he defended the legitimate interests of \nthe State of Alabama in a lawsuit involving how the Americans with \nDisabilities Act ought to be interpreted. This argument is baseless on \nmany levels.\n  First, I want to talk about these sovereign immunity cases. Some \ncritics say that because Mr. Sutton argues for state sovereign \nimmunity, he somehow believes that persons who are discriminated \nagainst because of their disabilities are not entitled to redress. That \nis not true. The National Association of Attorneys General--which I was \npleased to be a member of, as was the Presiding Officer, and I'm sure \nas were a majority of attorneys general at that time who were also \nmembers of the Democratic Party--in a letter signed by 27 of their \nmembers, including 12 Democrats, said:\n\n       We are particularly concerned when we see a lawyer being \n     attacked not for positions he advocated as a private \n     individual, but for positions he argued as a legal advocate \n     for the State government.\n\n  Well said. It is not a question of whether Mr. Sutton believed that \nan employee of any State ought not to have redress. The question is \nwhether or not this was a constitutionally proper way to go about it. \nIf lawyers were\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nattacked for vigorous client representation, this would have a chilling \naffect on their willingness to take unpopular cases. That would be \nunfortunate for our legal system.\n  With respect to the Garrett case, it is not an exaggeration to say \nthat the case has nothing to do with the overall worthiness of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act--nothing at all. Mr. Sutton himself \nstressed in his brief to the U.S. Supreme Court that the ADA ``advances \na commendable objective--mandatory accommodation for the disabled.''\n  Seth Waxman, President Clinton's Solicitor General and Mr. Sutton's \nopponent in the Garrett case, said he saw nothing to suggest that Mr. \nSutton disagreed with the aims of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nWhat Mr. Sutton did argue was that the 11th amendment principle of \nState sovereign immunity protects States from lawsuits in federal court \nasserting violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Seven \nother States--Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, and \nTennessee--submitted briefs joining with him to affirm this position. \nThe Supreme Court ultimately agreed.\n  In the Garrett case, the question before the Supreme Court was not \nthe validity or purpose of the ADA; it was whether the Federal \nGovernment could abridge State sovereign immunity by making States \nliable in Federal court for violations of the ADA. This issue involves \na very narrow and small part of the act. In fact, only the 3.7 percent \nof the American workforce employed by a State would be affected by this \nissue. The 96.3 percent of the workforce not employed by a State was \nnot at all affected by the Supreme Court's decision. In other words, \nthis Congress authorized individuals to file lawsuits for ADA \nviolations against both private entities and also against the States. \nThe State of Alabama said that allowing the Garrett lawsuit to go \nforward against the State violated the State's sovereign immunity.\n\n  When the State of Alabama took the case to the Supreme Court, it \nlooked around the country for one of America's best appellate lawyers, \nand it chose Jeffrey Sutton. He argued the case and won it in the \nSupreme Court. That win does not gut the ADA; it hardly impacts it in \neven a minor way. Only 3.7 percent of the workforce would be impacted \nby it. So the Supreme Court's decision in Garrett meant almost nothing, \nas far as the overall enforcement of the ADA was concerned, in dealing \nwith discrimination against those employees who are disabled.\n  What was at stake for the States in Garrett was how the Constitution \ndefined the fundamental relationship between the State government and \nFederal Government. The Supreme Court explained the relationship in the \nGarrett case this way:\n\n       The ultimate guarantee of the Eleventh Amendment is that \n     nonconsenting States may not be sued by private individuals \n     in Federal Court. We have recognized, however, that Congress \n     may abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity when it \n     both unequivocally intends to do so and ``act[s] pursuant to \n     a valid grant of constitutional authority.'' Congress may \n     subject nonconsenting States to suit in Federal Court when it \n     does so pursuant to a valid exercise of its Section 5 power \n     under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n  That is what the Supreme Court was talking about. It didn't have \nanything to do with the merits or demerits of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act itself. The Supreme Court went on to conclude that the \nnarrow provision applying the ADA to the States was not a valid \nexercise of Congress's section 5 power under the 14th amendment:\n\n       Congress is the final authority as to desirable public \n     policy, but in order to authorize private individuals to \n     recover money damages against the States [also sovereign \n     entities, I add parenthetically], there must be a pattern of \n     discrimination by the States which violates the Fourteenth \n     Amendment, and the remedy imposed by Congress must be \n     congruent and proportional to the targeted violation. Those \n     requirements are not met here.\n\n  So when my good friend Senator DeWine--an excellent lawyer from \nOhio--earlier indicated he thought the Supreme Court was in error, \nmaybe that was because he was here when the ADA was passed and I \nwasn't. But as a former attorney general, I think the Supreme Court was \ncorrect: If we allow Congress to go around willy-nilly and knock down \nthe classical, historic sovereign immunity of our States, it will \nweaken the States to an extraordinary degree.\n  The Supreme Court went on to take pains to emphasize that its \ndecision did not deprive the disabled of their rights:\n\n       Our holding here that Congress did not validly abrogate the \n     States' sovereign immunity from suit by private individuals \n     for money damages under Title I [of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act] does not mean that persons with \n     disabilities have no Federal recourse against discrimination. \n     Title I of the ADA still prescribes standards applicable to \n     the States. Those standards can be enforced by the United \n     States in actions for money damages, as well as by private \n     individuals in actions for injunctive relief. . . .\n       In addition, State laws protecting the rights of persons \n     with disabilities in employment and other aspects of life \n     provide independent avenues of redress.\n\n  In other words, the Supreme Court said this would not leave a \ndisabled person who works for a State without a remedy for \ndiscrimination. That person can file for an injunction, receive back \nwages if they have been unfairly terminated, and get an order that they \nhave to be reinstated. But given the classical doctrine of sovereign \nimmunity, given the record this Congress developed in passing the ADA, \nand given the language of the statute that was passed, the Supreme \nCourt could not legitimize an action for money damages against the \nStates.\n  As a matter of fact, I would note all 50 States have passed laws to \ngive protections to the disabled, in addition to the Federal ADA, in \npart by providing remedies like injunctions and back pay. It is simply \nnot true that the States do not have any concern for disabled citizens.\n  I also think it is notable that when Congress passed the ADA, it did \nnot impose on the Federal Government the obligations it placed on the \nStates. The Members of this body express great anguish that the States \ndid not gracefully allow themselves to be sued, and they complain that \nthe attorneys general of the States did not knuckle under by allowing \npeople to sue the States. But when Congress passed the ADA, it did not \nmake the act applicable to the United States Government. Even though \nthe Federal Government is the largest employer in America, it does not \nhave to extend to its own disabled employees the same benefits it \ndemands of the States. It would be ironic, to say the least, for us to \ncriticize Jeffrey Sutton for advocating State constitutional immunity \nfrom suit under the ADA when this very Senate exempted the Federal \nGovernment from the ADA's requirements.\n  This criticism is particularly unfair to Mr. Sutton because he has a \ndemonstrated commitment to the disabled. Beyond his sound historical \nand effective legal arguments in the Garrett case before the Supreme \nCourt, anyone who knows Jeffrey Sutton knows that he is sensitive to \nthe needs of the disabled. When Mr. Sutton started ninth grade, his \nfather became head of the Matheny School in Peapeck, NJ. Matheny was a \nboarding school providing education and life skills to disabled \nchildren with cerebral palsy.\n  Mr. Sutton spent time at the school doing maintenance work. This \nexperience made him well aware of the challenges faced by the disabled.\n  Since that time, Mr. Sutton has continued his commitment to the \ndisabled. Few are better qualified to speak about that than Cheryl \nFischer. Ms. Fischer, a blind woman, applied for admission to Case \nWestern Reserve University's medical school. The school denied her \nadmission because of her disability.\n  Mr. Sutton was asked to participate in the case by Ohio's attorney \ngeneral, and was given a choice of whom to represent. He was told, \n``you can represent the school and oppose a blind woman's right to be \nadmitted to the medical school, or you can represent her.'' He chose to \nrepresent Cheryl Fischer, without charge, pro bono, and he passionately \nargued her case before the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n  He lost the case, but Ms. Fischer has no doubt about Mr. Sutton's \nability and integrity. She said:\n\n       I think he believes thoroughly in the civil rights of all \n     people. He is not someone who would want to minimize the \n     rights of disabled people. He helped me stand up for what I \n     believe in.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       I would definitely like to see him on the Federal court.\n\n  Cheryl Fischer is just one of many who believe Jeffrey Sutton would \nprotect disability rights and civil rights\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\ngenerally as a judge on the very important Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Mr. Sutton is also a board member of the Equal Justice Foundation. It \nis a nonprofit organization based in Columbus, OH, that provides legal \nrepresentation to the disadvantaged, including the disabled. In 1999, \nthe Foundation sued to compel the city of Columbus to comply with the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act by installing curb cuts for wheelchairs \non city streets.\n  The executive director of the Equal Justice Foundation, Kimberly \nSkaggs, disagrees with Jeffrey Sutton politically but supports his \nnomination to the Sixth Circuit. She said:\n\n       Mr. Sutton possesses all the necessary qualities to be an \n     outstanding Federal judge. I have no hesitation whatsoever in \n     supporting his nomination.\n\n  Frankly, I have been disappointed by the leaders of the disability \ncommunity on this issue. They have stirred up opposition. They have \ntold the American disabled community that Jeffrey Sutton does not care \nabout the disabled. That is not true, but that is what they have said. \nThey said that the sovereign immunity position he advocated for his \nclients in ADA cases meant he personally did not care about the \ndisabled, that he did not like them, that he was opposed to them, and \nthat he would not give them a fair shake in court.\n  That is basically what they have said. They have suggested his legal \nefforts were aimed at harming the disabled, when in truth he was simply \nvindicating the historical legal protection of the States for his \nclients. The State governments have long enjoyed this protection from \nfederal lawsuits.\n  Another groundless allegation is that Mr. Sutton opposes laws against \nage discrimination. This allegation stems from his representation of \nthe State of Florida in a case called Kimel v. Florida Board of \nRegents. In Kimel, the Supreme Court agreed with Mr. Sutton's argument \nthat it was not necessary for Congress to abrogate State sovereign \nimmunity through the Age Discrimination in Employment Act because the \nStates were already protecting their senior citizens against \ndiscrimination. As with the disabilities right issue, Mr. Sutton did \nnot advocate judicial repeal of the act. Far from it. He explicitly \nstated that the ADEA advances a commendable policy--nondiscrimination \nagainst the elderly. What he argued for was the proper constitutional \nbalance between the State and Federal governments. The Supreme Court \nagreed with him. So now these people are saying that a reasonable and \nhonorable position he advocated for his client--whether he won or not, \neven though he did in fact win--somehow disqualifies him from the \nbench. I think that is unfair, and I am disappointed with some of the \npeople who are making these arguments because I think if they took a \nmoment to look at it, they would know these arguments were not well \ntaken.\n  Some have even brought up that he is a member of the Federalist \nSociety. One special interest group deems the society hostile to \nreproductive rights, and suggested that this nominee is guilty by \nassociation. The way some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have talked about the Federalist Society, it would seem that \nmembership might amount to a scarlet letter that nominees should wear \nduring the hearings. But this is an unwarranted attack on the Society \nand its members. Although it sponsors numerous discussions of \ncontroversial issues, from abortion to the war against terrorism, the \nFederalist Society takes no position on any of these issues. Regular \npanelists at their conferences include noted liberals like Harvard law \nprofessor Laurence Tribe and ACLU president Nadine Strossen. The \nsociety cannot be said to be hostile to abortion rights or any other \nrights, and so its members--here, Jeffrey Sutton--should not be blamed \nfor having participated in the Society.\n  Finally, we should move this nomination forward because of the \nunderstaffed Sixth Circuit bench. The Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, which deals with court staffing and other issues related to our \nFederal judges, has determined that the vacancy that would be filled by \nMr. Sutton's appointment is a judicial emergency. In fact, there are \ncurrently six vacancies on the Sixth Circuit, all of which have been \ndeemed emergencies. This court is in crisis. Those six vacancies impair \nthe administration of justice.\n  The current understaffing on that court makes it imperative we \npromptly examine and approve nominations of all the six circuit \ncandidates, particularly this eminently, extraordinarily qualified \nnominee, one of the best lawyers in America, Jeffrey Sutton.\n  I had the pleasure to see Mr. Sutton testify. He was asked questions \nall day long until 9 p.m. at night. He was complimented by Senator \nDianne Feinstein for his willingness to discuss anything he was asked. \nHe answered the questions openly. He answered the questions with great \nlegal skill and judgment time after time after time. I cannot think of \na single answer that he gave in that long examination that anyone found \noffensive. It was a tour de force of legal exposition. I was extremely \nimpressed not only with his brilliance but with his kind demeanor and \nhis sensitivity to the questions. He listened to people's questions. He \nresponded very carefully and sensitively to those questions.\n  Those were precisely the qualities I believe would make him an \nextraordinary court of appeals judge. You could look throughout this \ncountry and find very few people more qualified by ability, by \nexperience, by integrity, to hold this high office.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to confirm his nomination.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the opportunity today to listen to \nSenator Harkin speak on the Sutton nomination. I was terribly impressed \nwith his ability to explain to the American public on a very personal \nbasis, as a result of his brother's handicap, why this nomination is so \nimportant. I hope all the Senate has the opportunity to see and review \nSenator Harkin's comments. They were so appropriate and directly on \npoint.\n  Again, the Senator from Iowa, the junior Senator from Iowa is a \nperson of stature who always brings substance to a debate as he did in \nthis instance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will comment to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada about Senator Harkin's passionate advocacy for the \ndisabled in America. He cares deeply about that issue and there is no \none more eloquent on it than he is.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada if he is aware that Jeffrey Sutton \nvoluntarily agreed, on a pro bono basis, to prepare and to passionately \nargue a case before the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio that a woman \nwho was blind should be admitted to the Case Western University Medical \nSchool, even though he lost the case. I wonder if the Senator knew \nthat? A lot of the Senators have not known that he has a personal \nconcern about this issue and has given of his own wealth--that is, his \ntime--toward that effort.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished Senator from Alabama, I am aware \nof the information we have all been given on the nomination, and he \ncertainly did do this.\n  What we have to look at, though, is his entire background and we will \nall do that. My point was that I think the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin, laid out a foundation for our taking a very close look at this \nnominee. As the Senator from Alabama knows, the nominee has stated his \nviews over a considerable period of time, more than just the one case \nhe argued in Ohio.\n  All Members have a decision to make tomorrow as to whether this man, \nJeffrey Sutton, would be the kind of person we want on the circuit \ncourt. We all have that decision to make, and we can weigh what he has \ndone with what he has not done and make that judgment.\n  My point I was making is that we oftentimes in the Senate debate in \nthe abstract. Senator Harkin did not do that. He formed his debate \nbased upon his brother, who was accepted to a school for the deaf and \ndumb; as Senator Harkin said, his brother may have been deaf but he \nwasn't dumb. I think this is the only case I am aware of where the \ndisabled community has been so up in arms over a nominee.\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\n  First, I hope we have the opportunity tomorrow to speak to our \nrespective caucuses--the majority leader has to make that decision as \nto whether we will vote at noon tomorrow or after the caucuses. \nRegardless, it is quite clear that we are going to vote tomorrow. All \n100 Senators have to make a decision as to what they want to do.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I note that the Senator from Nevada, who is himself a \nsuperb lawyer, has represented criminals and defended them on occasion, \nas I have. I would point out that just because he represented a cause \nand advocated it, it does not necessarily mean he shared all those \nviews, personally. I also would note, and am pleased to see, that the \nState of Nevada joined Alabama as amicus curiae in the Garrett case.\n  Maybe the Senator would like to once again respond. I am not entitled \nto the last word. If not, I will go forward with morning business.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could just ask the Senator to yield, I \nhave learned, having served in the Senate, that the majority always \ngets the last word, so the last word is that of the Senator from \nAlabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5431-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I rise today, as I do every \nyear, to commemorate the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. It has \nnow been 88 years since this tragic event unfolded, and after another \nyear, the historical fact of this atrocity continues to be questioned.\n  April 24, 1915, marked the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's brutal \nand unconscionable policy of mass murder, directed against men, women \nand children Armenians. Over 8 years, Armenians faced starvation, \ndeportation, and violent death at the hands of their own government. \nBefore the genocide began, 2.5 million Armenians lived in the Ottoman \nEmpire. One and a half million Armenians were killed and another \n500,000 were driven from their homes, their property and land \nconfiscated.\n  Many descendants of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide live in \nthe United States, and some actual survivors settled in my own State of \nCalifornia. Overall, half a million Armenian Americans live in \nCalifornia, and I am proud to serve them in the Senate. The strength \nand importance of their community exemplifies how any group of people \ncan be reborn in the United States. Armenian Americans are at the \nforefront of the effort to keep the events of the Armenian Genocide in \nthe public eye, but it is the duty of us all, as citizens of a nation \nthat embodies justice, liberty, and freedom not to forget.\n  We must take time each year to acknowledge this act of ethnic \ncleansing because we cannot afford to forget. The 20th century saw too \nmany genocides, the events in the Ottoman Empire being only the first. \nIn Germany and Eastern Europe, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Serbia, \nmillions of people were killed because of their race, ethnicity, or \nreligion.\n  Through these tragedies, too many have remained silent. We must make \nclear, in the 21st century, that mass murder cannot be tolerated, will \nnot be tolerated. We cannot afford to forget or hide events such as the \nArmenian Genocide, or another group in another place will experience \nthe same persecution and the same systematic intent to destroy an \nentire people. This is why we must commemorate this horrific period in \nthe history of the Armenian people each and every year.\n  Let us remember the Armenian Genocide. Let us ensure that those who \nsuffered did not die in vain. Let us ensure that those who survived did \nnot do so to watch the world forget their sufferings. We honor the \nliving by speaking out today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5431-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    GUADALUPE CENTER FOR DEDICATION TO IMPROVING THE LIFE OF LATINO \n                               COMMUNITY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I would like to commend the \nGuadalupe Center Inc. for their continued commitment to improving the \nlife of Latinos throughout Kansas City, MO.\n  The Guadalupe Center began as a volunteer school and well baby clinic \nfor Mexican immigrants in Kansas City's Westside in 1919, becoming one \nof the Nation's first social service agencies for Latinos in the United \nStates.\n  Once working out of the rectory of Our Lady of Guadalupe Shrine on \nWest 23rd Street, the Guadalupe Center now has nine buildings and has \nexpanded to serve the entire Kansas City Metropolitan Latino community.\n  Today, the Center provides a number of essential services and is a \nleading advocate for the Latino community.\n  Health programs at the center include substance abuse, teen \npregnancy, and HIV/AIDS education and counseling. The center's diligent \nwork in reaching this disproportionately affected Latino population is \nto be congratulated and encouraged.\n  Also, the center has had a great deal of success with increasing \nemployment opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed in the \nLatino community. This success goes hand in hand with the center's \nconstantly expanding education programs, which provide participants \nwith a number of opportunities, including second language GED and job \ntraining skills.\n  Beyond reaching adult and young adults, the center also works to \nexpand opportunities for children through its Plaza de Ninos preschool, \nwhich prepares young Latino children for early school success and helps \nthem with the necessary English language skills, while providing \nchildcare for working parents.\n  The Guadalupe Center's activities and services, which continue to \ngrow in number and impact, serve as an example of the center's vision \nand dedication for the Latino community.\n  The future of Kansas City and the quality of life for its residents, \nespecially the Latino community, depends on the decisions and the \ninvestments made today. The Guadalupe Center had taken the lead in \nmaking these strategic investments in Kansas City's urban core. Their \nefforts have improved the lives of the Latino community's children and \nfamilies and the effects will be felt for generations to come.\n  I look forward to partnering with the Guadalupe Center in future \ninvestments in Kansas City's Latino community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5431-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5431-S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CHAMPION TREE PLANTING AT THE U.S. CAPITOL\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a \nwonderful Arbor Day gift that was donated to the U.S. Capitol by the \nChampion Tree Project and the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. Last \nThursday, on April 24, 2003, the U.S. Capitol planted a 6-foot sapling \nclone of a white ash tree grown by George Washington in the late 1700s. \nThis sapling clone is the first successful recreation of the Champion \nTree Project's efforts to spawn exact genetic duplicates of each of \nWashington's surviving trees at Mount Vernon.\n  This gift is extremely special to me for two reasons. First, the \nChampion Tree Project is a Michigan-founded, grassroots organization \nthat was founded by a Michiganian father and son team, David and Jared \nMilarch. The Milarch family has been the driving force behind this \norganization, and I commend them for their historic efforts to protect \nthese important trees. In addition to working to protect historically \nsignificant trees like those on the Mount Vernon estate, the Champion \nTree Project is dedicated to protecting Champion trees, which are the \nbiggest--and often among the oldest--known members of their species in \nthe United States. After cloning, these saplings are planted in \nprotected sites where they can be enjoyed and studied by future \ngenerations.\n  Second, I was at Mount Vernon on August 1, 2001, when the Champion \nTree Project collected the budwood and branches from the 13 surviving \ntrees planted under George Washington's direction over 200 years ago. \nThe DNA\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\nthat was collected at Mount Vernon over a year and half ago is what was \nused to create this white ash sapling clone, and I am proud that this \nsapling has found a wonderful home at the U.S. Capitol today.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Champion Tree Project and the Mount Vernon \nLadies' Association for their historic gift and their ongoing \ndedication to preserving these trees for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5432-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LEXINGTON POLICE CHIEF ANTHANY BEATTY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to one of Kentucky's finest law enforcement officers. Lexington \nPolice Chief Anthany Beatty has been recognized as Eastern Kentucky \nUniversity's Outstanding Alumnus for 2003 and was inducted into EKU's \nHall of Distinguished Alumni.\n  Chief Beatty's commitment to excellence has not only honored the \nLexington police force where he has served since 1973 but also his alma \nmater, Eastern Kentucky University. A 1978 graduate of EKU, Beatty \ncredits his success in law enforcement to the undergraduate work he \ncompleted while majoring in police administration. The obstacles Beatty \novercame as a student would prepare him for the challenges faced by the \nLexington police force.\n  Included in the recognition to Anthany Beatty's rise to chief of \npolice, which he was selected for in August of 2001, is his family. The \nrelentless years of love and support that Anthany's wife Eunice and \ntheir two sons, Embry and Anthany, Jr., have shown provided Anthany \nwith the stability and stature necessary to meet the high demands of \npolice work. His family's support and his spirituality have made all \nthe difference in his life and career.\n  Chief Anthany Beatty's example should be followed by law enforcement \nofficers throughout Kentucky. The citizens of Lexington are fortunate \nto call Anthany Beatty one of their own. They should be privileged to \nbe served by such a fine officer. Congratulations, Anthany. And may God \nbless you and your family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5432-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5432-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/28/senate-section/article/S5432-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 7, 2003, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on April 12, 2003, during the recess of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe House has agreed to the following concurrent resolution:\n\n       S.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to make \ngrants for security improvements to over-the-road bus operations, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Hollings, Hutchison, Lautenberg, Smith, and Snowe in \nintroducing the Over-the-Road Bus Security and Safety Act of 2003. The \npurpose of the bill is to provide funding assistance for security \nimprovements to the intercity bus industry. The legislation is the \nbipartisan product of work that occurred during the last Congress under \nthe leadership of Senator Max Cleland.\n  Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Congress and the \nAdministration have taken extraordinary steps to improve security. We \nhave enacted the Homeland Security Act, which consolidated 22 agencies \nin a new Department of Homeland Security. We also have enacted the \nAviation and Transportation Security Act, ATSA, which closed security \ngaps at our nation's airports and largely transferred the \nresponsibilities of the security of air transportation to the federal \ngovernment. In addition, we've enacted the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act, MTSA, which, for the first time ever, established a \nframework for security at our nation's maritime ports. Yet, much \nremains to be done as we work to identify and close security gaps.\n  As we have witnessed in other countries, bus transportation can be \nthe target of terrorist attacks. This is further evidenced by the fact \nthat terminals that have already implemented a passenger screening \nprocess have seen a rise in discarded weapons in bus stations. In our \nview, facility improvements and baggage screening efforts\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\nwould be a significant step to improving bus security.\n  Therefore, the bill we are introducing today authorizes $35 million \nfor fiscal year 2003 and $99 million for fiscal year 2004 to fund an \nintercity bus security grant program that would be administered by the \nSecretary of Transportation. It would include a matching requirement \nthat recipients of federal grants fund 10 percent of the security \nimprovement expenses.\n  Already, $15 million was appropriated for bus security grants in the \nfiscal year 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act and another $10 \nmillion was appropriated in the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations \nAct. This bill, if enacted, will authorize the funding already \nappropriated, along with an authorization of $99 million for fiscal \nyear 2004 and, in turn, give Congress time to further study existing \nand future needs for bus transportation security and determine what, if \nany, changes should be made to the program.\n  The bill will help improve bus security by authorizing grants for \nsecurity improvements at terminals; for the installation of \nsurveillance equipment; for improvements to protect or isolate the \ndriver; and for other specified improvements. The legislation also \nwould require the Department of Transportation to complete a \npreliminary report assessing the adequacy of over-the-road bus security \nand determine what, if any, additional steps should be taken to improve \nbus security.\n  There have been several well-publicized bus accidents since September \n11, 2001, including an accident on October 3, 2001, that involved an \nattack on the driver and claimed seven lives. Passing this measure will \nallow Congress to take short-term action that will have a beneficial \neffect on the security of the bus industry and does not preclude \nconsideration of longer-term security policy considerations.\n  Efforts to pass similar legislation is also underway in the House of \nRepresentatives, where the House Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, under Chairman Young's leadership, has already reported \nlegislation to be considered by the full House.\n  I want to thank Senators Hollings, Hutchison, Breaux, Lautenberg, \nSmith, and Snowe for joining me in this effort. I look forward to \nworking with all members to move this legislation forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 929\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Over-the-Road Bus Security \n     and Safety Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

PLAN REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary may not make a grant under \n     this Act to a private operator of over-the-road buses until \n     the operator has first submitted to the Secretary--\n       (1) a plan for making security improvements described in \n     section 2 and the Secretary has approved the plan; and\n       (2) such additional information as the Secretary may \n     require to ensure accountability for the obligation and \n     expenditure of amounts made available to the operator under \n     the grant.\n       (b) Coordination.--To the extent that an application for a \n     grant under this section proposes security improvements \n     within a specific terminal owned and operated by an entity \n     other than the applicant, the applicant shall demonstrate to \n     the satisfaction of the Secretary that the applicant has \n     coordinated the security improvements for the terminal with \n     that entity.\n\n     SEC. 4. OVER-THE-ROAD BUS DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``over-the-road bus'' means a bus \n     characterized by an elevated passenger deck located over a \n     baggage compartment.\n\n     SEC. 5.
