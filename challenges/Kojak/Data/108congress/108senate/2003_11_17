Mr. President, today the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the VA-HUD appropriations measure. We were unable to \nreach an agreement for finishing the bill, and it is unclear how much \nfurther progress we can make on this bill. At this time, we will \ncontinue with the bill this afternoon and make a determination later \ntoday as to whether the Senate can complete action on this important \nmeasure.NOTICE\n\nIf the 108th Congress, 1st Session, adjourns sine die on or before \nNovember 21, 2003, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \nthe 108th Congress, 1st Session, will be published on Monday, \nDecember 15, 2003, in order to permit Members to revise and extend \ntheir remarks.\nAll material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \ndelivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \nDebates (Room HT-60 or S-410A of the Capitol), Monday through \nFriday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through \nFriday, December 12, 2003. The final issue will be dated Monday, \nDecember 15, 2003, and will be delivered on Tuesday, December 16, \n2003.\nNone of the material printed in the final issue of the \nCongressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any \nevent that occurred after the sine die date.\nSenators' statements should also be submitted electronically, \neither on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to \nthe Official Reporters of Debates at ``Record@Sec.Senate.gov''.\nMembers of the House of Representatives' statements may also be \nsubmitted electronically by e-mail, to accompany the signed \nstatement, and formatted according to the instructions for the \nExtensions of Remarks template at http://clerkhouse.house.gov/\nforms. The Official Reporters will transmit to GPO the template \nformatted electronic file only after receipt of, and authentication \nwith, the hard copy, and signed manuscript. Deliver statements to \nthe Official Reporters in Room \nHT-60 of the Capitol.\nMembers of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material \nsubmitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by \ncontacting the Office of Congressional Publishing Services, at the \nGovernment Printing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of 8:00 \na.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.\nBy order of the Joint Committee on Printing.\n                                                                \nROBERT W.

It is hoped that cloture will be invoked and that \nthe Senate can complete its work on the conference report today. Again, \nthat vote is expected around 5:30 this afternoon.\n  Also later today, the Senate will conduct a 1-hour debate on the \nissue of jobs and the economy. There will be two Members from each side \nof the aisle engaged in that debate, and all Senators are encouraged to \nbe present for the discussion.\n  As a reminder, two cloture motions were filed with respect to the \nnomination of Thomas Dorr to be Under Secretary of Agriculture for \nRural Development. Those cloture votes will occur tomorrow morning, and \nSenators will be notified of the exact timing of those votes.\n  Finally, on behalf of the majority leader, I remind everyone this is \nexpected to be a busy workweek in the Senate. There are a number of \nimportant conferences that have been completed and others that will be \nfinished shortly. These legislative matters will be scheduled as soon \nas they are available so the Senate may adjourn at the earliest \npossible time. All Senators should adjust their schedules for a busy \nsession as we approach what will very likely be the final week of this \nsession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14924-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nmajority whip, is there some estimate as to when we would get to the \nconference reports on Energy and Medicare?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, it is a \nlittle bit difficult to ascertain exactly when, but we hope the Energy \nbill might be ready by Wednesday.

Mr. President, I hate to broach the subject because last \ntime it didn't work out as well as I had contemplated, but I hope if \nsomething comes up that we can't finish our work on Friday, we will go \nover into the weekend because everyone believes they would rather \nwork--I don't know about everyone--most people believe they would \nrather work this weekend knowing we don't have to come back until after \nthe first of the year. I hope the leadership on the other side will \nkeep that in mind and alert Senators that we may have to work Saturday \nand maybe even Sunday to get out of here for the Thanksgiving holiday \nand the year generally.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, I think \nthat is a widely held sentiment on this side of the aisle as well. It \nwill be vastly more desirable to wrap it up this week, even if this \nweek means a longer week than normal, than to carry it over to next \nweek or certainly December. We are going to be pushing to complete the \nbusiness of the Senate this week. This week ideally would be Friday, \nbut it could end up being Saturday or later.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a period of morning business until 1:30 p.m. with Senators \npermitted to speak therein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, like every loyal Red Sox fan, I believe \nthat next season my team will be victorious. I bring this same level of \noptimism to my efforts to reduce the amount of wasted resources and \nlitter caused by discarded beverage containers.\n  I rise today to speak again to the National Beverage Producer \nResponsibility Act of 2003, the bottle bill, convinced that this is our \nyear.\n  I have long been an advocate for increased recycling. Vermont passed \nits bottle bill in 1972 when I was state attorney general. In 1975, \nduring my first session as a Representative in the U.S. House, I \nintroduced a national bottle bill, closely resembling Vermont's very \nsuccessful example. Last Congress, as chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, I convened the first Congressional hearing in \nmany years on recycling, in which the committee heard expert testimony \non the merits of a national program to recycle beverage containers.\n  The reason that I continue to push this issue is simple--it makes \nsense. Beverage container recycling is one of the simplest ways to see \na dramatic improvement in our environment. As this chart shows, 120 \nbillion--let me repeat, 120 billion with a ``b''--beverage containers \nwere wasted by not being recycled in 2001.\n  If we could raise the Nation's recycling rate to 80 percent, we would \nsave the equivalent of 300 million barrels of oil over the next 10 \nyears and eliminate 4 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions \nannually. States that have enacted bottle bills also have benefited by \nreducing road side litter by up to 84 percent.\n  These savings may sound unrealistic. But in Vermont alone, recycling \nefforts in 2001 reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 94,000 metric tons \nof carbon equivalent. That's equal to approximately two-thirds of all \nindustrial carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion in \nVermont and 4.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. To me, those \nsavings sound remarkable.\n\n  Why a refundable deposit program? Thirty years of experience \ndemonstrates that refundable deposit bottle bills are dramatically more \neffective than voluntary efforts. As this chart illustrates, the ten \nStates that have implemented deposit laws recycle more containers than \nall of the other 40 States combined.\n  While I applaud curbside and other voluntary recycling efforts, the \n71 percent of Americans who live in non-bottle bill States account for \nonly 28 percent of recycled beverage containers. My bill, the National \nBeverage Producer Responsibility Act of 2003, strikes a balance between \nthe wishes of industry, the authority of individual States, and the \nneeds of a healthy environment.\n  Unlike traditional bottle bills, this legislation would fully harness \nmarket incentives by setting an 80 percent recovery performance \nstandard and allowing industry the freedom to design the most efficient \ndeposit-return program to reach the standard. States that already have \nbottle bills will retain their authority to continue their programs in \ntheir own individual ways as long as they meet the national performance \nstandard.\n  This past Saturday, November 15, 2003, was America Recycles Day in \nVermont and across the country. Two years ago, to help commemorate the \n2001 America Recycles Day, I participated in a public service \nannouncement to raise awareness regarding the need to buy recycled \ngoods.\n  The importance of recycling deserves, however, more than a 30-second \npublic service announcement and more than its own day on the calendar. \nFor it to work, recycling must be a commitment of all of ours each and \nevery day of the year.\n  Vermont's commitment to recycling has provided some impressive \nstatistics. For example, in 2001, 31 percent of Vermont's municipal \nwaste was diverted from landfills. That year, 13,260 tons of containers \nwere recycled through soft drink and beer distributors and materials \nrecovery facilities.\n\n  The benefit of these programs is, of course, that they help keep our \nGreen Mountains green.\n  I commend and thank Governor Jim Douglas for his many recent \ninitiatives to encourage and improve the efficiency of recycling across \nVermont. For example, under Governor Douglas' leadership, Vermont has \nimplemented beverage container recycling programs at 20 State \ninformation centers.\n\n[[Page S14925]]\n\n  In the first phase, in less than 2 months, over 200 pounds of \naluminum, glass, and plastic were recovered from 51,00 visitors passing \nthrough one such information center in Willison, VT. And today, the \nU.S. Senate's other Vermonter, Patrick Leahy, joins me and Senators \nJoseph Lieberman, Daniel Akaka, and John Kerry as original cosponsors \nas I introduce the National Beverage Producer Responsibility Act of \n2003.\n  I recommend that all take advantage of this wonderful system we have \nin Vermont and in other States. I ask everyone to take a close look and \nsee if we wouldn't be much better off if the rest of the country \nfollows suit.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, the conference report on H.R. 6, the \ncomprehensive energy legislation, was released over the weekend. As the \nranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have \ncome to the floor today to share my deep concern that this bill will \nendanger our environment and unfairly benefit special interests.\n  The final conference report contains provisions that significantly \nchange environmental law and undermine long-standing environmental \nprotections. It is my sincere hope that the conference will remove many \nof these provisions during their meeting today.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee, on which I serve, has \njurisdiction over environmental matters, and we were not consulted in \nthe development of any of these provisions.\n  This bill drastically rewrites existing clean air law. It postpones \nozone attainment standards across the country. This is a matter never \nconsidered in either House or Senate bill that has been inserted into \nthe conference report. By inserting this language, the conference will \nexpose the public to dangerous air pollution emissions for far more \ntime than under existing law. Several Federal courts have already \nstruck down regulatory proposals similar to the provisions in the \nconference report as violations of the Clean Air Act.\n  The gasoline additive MTBE, which is known to contaminate \ngroundwater, would have been phased out in 4 years in the Senate bill. \nThis conference report extends the phaseout for a decade and includes \nprovisions that would allow the President to decide to continue the \nMTBE use.\n  This bill provides legal immunity to large petrochemical companies \nfrom ``defective product'' liability arising from the contamination of \ngroundwater supplies by the gasoline additive MTBE.\n  It also terminates a lawsuit filed by the State of New Hampshire by \nreaching back to provide immunity as of September 5, 2003. This \nlanguage allows a contaminating product to be used, possibly \nindefinitely, and provides communities with no fiscal remedies to clean \nit up.\n  As a further subsidy to the industry, the bill exempts all \nconstruction activities at oil and gas drilling sites from coverage \nunder the runoff requirements of the Clean Water Act.\n  This means that contaminants, such as toxic chemicals, grease, and \nother pollutants from oil and gas drilling, will end up in our \nwaterways.\n  Conferees have also removed hydraulic fracturing, an underground oil \nand gas recovery technique, from coverage under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct. This is a process in which water, sand, and toxic chemicals are \ninjected under high pressure into oil- and gas-bearing rocks, \npotentially polluting drinking water supplies.\n  This bill suspends these existing drinking water protections, even \nthough courts have found that hydraulic fracturing should be regulated \nto protect the public health.\n  Also, the conferees have included language to speed up energy \nexploration and development at the expense of environmental review and \npublic participation on both Federal and non-Federal lands. The public \nwill have less time to review and consider the impact of these \nprojects.\n  When these reviews occur, oil, gas and geothermal energy companies \ncan be reimbursed through credits against future royalties payable to \nthe taxpayer for the costs of undertaking environmental assessments. \nThese provisions subsidize energy development on our public lands.\n  The conferees have also included provisions that mandate specific \ntimeframes and deadlines for agency decisions on Federal oil and gas \nleases. This would establish oil and gas development as the dominant \nuse of our Federal public lands.\n  Our other Federal lands are at risk of becoming electric transmission \ncorridors with this bill as well. The Department of Energy can open new \nareas for transmission line construction, harming the wildlife, water \nquality, recreational and other values we have sought to protect for \nyears.\n  My colleagues should know that this is not an exhaustive list of the \nenvironmental provisions of concern in this bill.\n  In almost every title, there are significant changes to long standing \nenvironmental law and policy. In addition, important issues which \nreceived majority support in the Senate, such as a Renewable Portfolio \nStandard for electricity, requirements to reduce our dependency on \nforeign oil, and adoption of sensible climate change policy, have been \ndropped.\n  While I support the establishment of a comprehensive energy policy \nfor the United States, we should not use the final energy bill as a \nmeans to roll back important environmental protections.\n  This bill will not promote energy self-sufficiency, will not promote \nit, and will cause environmental damage. It is my sincere hope that \nthese unwise provisions will be removed, and I urge my colleagues to \nconsider seriously the environmental effects of this legislation in \nmaking their final decisions regarding whether or not to support this \nmeasure when it come before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a short time this \nafternoon to talk about some of the concerns that I have on the \nrecently agreed to proposition on the Medicare prescription drug \nagreement that was reached over the course of the weekend.\n  As we are anticipating this measure which is now being examined in \nterms of the Congressional Budget Office estimates and the legislative \nlanguage that is being prepared, I expect that we will be addressing it \nat the end of this week or sometime in the very near future. I want to \nat least bring some focus and attention to some of the provisions in \nthe legislation that haven't gotten the focus and attention they \ndeserve, which they should have, and which I hope our Members will give \nstudy.\n  There is no truer indication of a nation's priorities than the \ninvestment it makes, and the legislation the Senate considers today I \nbelieve squanders a historic opportunity with a disregard for the \nNation's health, particularly for our seniors. There is a provision in \nthis bill dealing with a $12 billion slush fund to lure HMOs into \nMedicare.\n\n  Let's see if I have the reasoning behind this fund right. The \nsupporters of\n\n[[Page S14926]]\n\nthe legislation are so concerned that HMOs can provide health care to \nseniors more efficiently than Medicare that they give HMOs a $12 \nbillion payoff so they can compete. If they are so efficient, why do \nthey need the handout? I guess the sponsors of the legislation believe \na 9 percent reimbursement bonus for HMOs is not enough. In this \nlegislation there is the assurance the HMOs will get a 9 percent \nincrease over Medicare in reimbursement rates.\n  In addition, there is what they call a stabilization fund which is \neffectively a $12 billion slush fund which will also be available to \nsubsidize the HMOs.\n  That package adds up to a rather extraordinary benefit to the HMOs. \nThe bill calls for competition between Medicare and the HMOs. Yet in \nthis agreement private plans are going to get paid 109 percent of \ntraditional Medicare reimbursements. And, those enrolled in HMOs are 16 \npercent healthier. That cumulatively is a 25 percent bonus to the \nprivate sector to compete with Medicare, without even considering the \n$12 billion slush fund. Our friends on the other side say we want \ncompetition in this system. Yet they are giving them the 25 percent \nadvantage in order to compete with Medicare.\n  The bill that passed the Senate was a prescription drug bill that had \nbipartisan support, with 76 Members for it. I was proud to stand here \nand support it. But now we basically have the restructuring of our \nMedicare system. We do it in a way that provides a fundamental risk to \nthe Medicare system. That is why I am opposed to this agreement and the \nproposal.\n  I have given one illustration of why this proposal that is strongly \nsupported by our friends in the House is going to weight this agreement \nso heavily for the HMOs and the PPOs. They talk about a fair playing \nfield between the private sector and the Medicare. That is hogwash. In \nthe Senate bill we passed a prescription bill. It had real competition \nfor all parts of the country with a backup system of Medicare, but not \nin the proposal that comes out of the conference.\n  I remind our seniors the 25 percent bonus that is going to the HMOs \nis effectively being paid by our seniors today in the Medicare \npremiums. They are the ones, on the one hand, who are paying into this \nfund; on the other hand, it is the conference report that is \neffectively taking the 25 percent and giving it over to the private \nsector.\n  And we wonder why seniors might be somewhat concerned about that \narrangement. Do Members think the seniors at home will not ask: Why \naren't we using all that money to either make sure the benefit package \nis a stronger benefit package to help me, to help my family, or to help \nmy grandparents? The decision made in the conference was no, we insist \non ``competition.'' But they are going to take the 25 percent, which \nhas been paid in dollar by dollar by dollar by hard-working Americans \nover a lifetime that they thought was going to be put into the Medicare \nsystem, and we are going to use that to subsidize the private sector. I \nhope we will have a chance for explanations.\n  Second, there is a provision included in this conference that was not \nincluded in the Senate proposal, premium support. I never heard the \nPresident indicate strong support for it, or those who speak for the \nPresident. I don't think a great many of our colleagues are able to \ndefine what premium support is, but they will learn about it soon \nenough if they vote for this legislation. Premium support is a proposal \nthat is primarily sponsored by those who are opposed to the Medicare \nsystem.\n  Let's make no bones about it. There are a number of other colleagues \nwho are still strongly opposed to Medicare. That is no mystery, no \nsecret. This proposal puts forward one of their strongest beliefs--that \nwe need to change the Medicare system--I say undermine the Medicare \nsystem--with premium support. What that means is the averaging of \nvarious premium bids to determine the Medicare system reimbursement \nrate. The difference between what the Medicare system reimburses and \nwhat real cost is going to be paid by the individual. The premium \nsupport proposal does what the insurance companies do best, and that is \ncherry pick the healthiest senior citizens for their plans so they are \nable to make money, and leave those who are sicker and older in the \nMedicare system where the premiums will rise.\n\n  I will demonstrate with this chart. This is the Medicare actuarial \nestimates of the disparity of the premium support, what the premium \nwould be under the proposed legislation. The national average of the \ncurrent law is $1,200. Several years ago, the estimate under the \npremium support was $1,771. The new average this year is $1,501. How do \nwe know what the true estimates will be? Premium support is untested, \nuntried, unworkable. We are playing roulette with premium costs for our \nsenior citizens. This is a social experiment that uses our seniors as \nguinea pigs. That is what premium support is.\n  Look at the difference, say, if you are in Florida. The agreement \nreached said by the year 2010 the Secretary will be able to designate \nsix metropolitan statistical areas that qualify. Currently, half the \nStates have those areas. With the kind of subsidies we are providing in \nthis legislation, by the year 2010, I doubt whether there is any State \nthat will not have the opportunity to qualify. I hope our colleagues \nlisten carefully to that because this diversity in premiums is going to \ncome to your State and you are going to have to explain why a senior in \none county, who pays same taxes, worked just as hard all his life, and \nwho deserves Medicare, has to pay twice as much as his neighbor in the \nnext county over in premiums for medicare.\n  Medicare is a universal system that guarantees everyone will be \ntreated equally, according to their medical needs. This legislation \nturns that proposition on its head and makes your medicare benefits \ndependent on where you live and what will help private insurance \ncompanies the most.\n  This is the House Budget Committee, the Medicare actuarial data. The \ndifference if we have premium support in Florida, what the premiums \nwould be 1 year in Dade County and another year in Osceola, Fl: Double \nthe premium for the Medicare patients living in Dade; half that for \nthose in Osceola. Now that is in Florida.\n  Take premium support in California. If you live in Los Angeles, \n$1,700; in Yolo, CA, $775.\n  It is just based on where you live. You have lived there all your \nlife. You have your home. You have paid your taxes. You have brought up \nyour children, and you have retired, and you find you are going to pay \n$1,700 for your premium; and someone in Yolo County, CA, is going to \npay $775. Why? Because of this new concept of premium support.\n  It will happen in every State. For New York City, the Medicare \nactuaries' estimate that in Queens, seniors would pay $2,000, but only \n$975 in Erie, NY, because that is the estimate of what the premiums \nwill be with competition in New York.\n  Try to explain that to your seniors who have lived their life, who \nhave served this country, brought the Nation out of the Depression, \nfought in the wars, are living back home, and find out their premiums \nhave increased 100 percent or 200 percent or 300 percent.\n  This is not just what I am saying about premium support, these are \nthe Medicare actuaries. This information comes to us from testimony \ngiven before the Finance Committee.\n  Here we have figures from my home State of Massachusetts: $1,450 in \nBarnstable, $1,000 in Hampden, MA. So, $400 more if you live down in \nBarnstable County, in Cape Cod, than the center part of the State.\n  So if you support this proposal, and you support the premium support, \nthen you are going to have to explain to your constituents and to your \nelderly people that if they live in one community, they may be paying \ndouble what their neighbors are paying in another community.\n  What this proposal puts forward has never been tried. It has never \nbeen tested. And it is mandated--mandated--in this compromise from the \nHouse of Representatives. It is mandated in this bill.\n  You will hear the other side saying: Senator Kennedy has not got it \nquite right. You will hear them say: We put a restriction in there, \nthey can only go up 5 percent this year. Five percent this year, 10 \npercent the next year, 50 percent the year after.\n  Let's get real. Look at the direction in which we are going. This \nproposal\n\n[[Page S14927]]\n\nhas heavy subsidies for the HMOs and a roll of the dice on the premiums \nfor our senior citizens. And that is not even the beginning.\n  Currently, of our 40 million seniors, there are 6 million who have \nMedicare but also who have what they call Medicaid to those who are \nvery poor, we are talking about 100 percent of poverty or below. Those \nbeneficiaries have to pay copayments for medical care. Most of the \nStates pick up those copayments. That is what is existing today.\n  Do you think that is going to continue under this bill? No. No, no. \nNo, no, that does not continue under this proposal. That is actually \nprohibited under this legislation.\n  There will be 6 million of our seniors who are getting help and \nassistance from their States today who will be prohibited from getting \nit under this proposal. Why? This all saves the money--probably $9 to \n$12 billion--to use for other purposes.\n  If you come from a State with large numbers of very poor, and where \nthe State is paying that $1, $3, $5, in terms of the prescription \ndrugs, it does not sound like a lot of money. But if seniors need that \ndrug two or three times a week, it piles up every week, it piles up \nevery month, and it piles up every year.\n  Why does the conference bill do that? Why in the world did they do \nthat? It was not in the Senate bill. It was in the House bill, and it \nwas accepted in the conference.\n  Now we come back to those who are the very needy and the very poor, \nand we see many of our elderly who are excluded from this program with \nwhat we call an asset test.\n  The asset test is basically the following: If you own a car that is \nworth more than $4,500, you have a wedding ring worth $2,300, you have \n$6,200 in savings, and you have a burial plot that is worth more than \n$1,500, all that is considered in terms of your assets to exclude you \nfrom being eligible for benefits targeted to the poorest of the poor.\n  The Senate bill said that low-income people could get the assistance \nthey needed without going through a cruel and demeaning assets test.\n  Senators from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Domenici offered an \namendment, which passed by 67 votes, to reaffirmed the Senate's desire \nnot to penalize people because they managed to save a small amount of \nmoney during their working lives. I was proud of the Senate, of \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, for recognizing that if we were going \nto pass a prescription drug bill, it ought to be targeted on the \nneediest of the needy. But the bill put forward by this conference went \nin the opposite direction and restored that cruel and demeaning assets \ntest.\n\n  We had a good bill. We did not provide these large subsidies to the \nPPOs and the HMOs. We did not have premium support program that so \nthreatens, undermines and endangers Medicare. No, no, we did not have \nthose. Ours was basically a prescription drug program focused on the \nneediest seniors built on private sector delivery with a backup in \nterms of the Medicare system. That was the compromise.\n  But not here. The conference needed more money to pay for what they \ncall health savings account, the medical savings account, which they \nhave put in this particular conference report, at the cost of anywhere \nfrom $6 to $7 billion, draining our national deficit even more and adds \nto the total cost of the legislation.\n  Health savings accounts are designed for the healthiest and \nwealthiest people in our society leaving the sickest and poorest of the \nworkers in this country in the private sector where their premiums \ncould be increased by 20 to 30 to 40 percent. As the debate unfolds, we \nwill be presenting further estimates on this. It was best estimated, \nfrom the Urban Institute, at 60 percent increases.\n  This conference report gives us a whole new kind of a system. We have \nthe heavy subsidizing of private plans with 25 percent more being paid \nfor by seniors. We have the experimental system where you are going to \nhave those enormous swings in premiums all over the country without any \npredictability, and it is untested and untried. We have the cutting \nback of 3 million of the neediest people because of the reimposition of \nthe asset test. We have the introduction of the health savings account \nwhich is going to skew the health delivery system for millions of \nworkers and the young people in this country.\n  Many people are going to bail out of their traditional system, and \nleave their coworkers, who may have greater kinds of health threats, to \npay a very enhanced premium and also enhance the premium of the \ncompanies themselves.\n  What are we talking about with this legislation? Let's add it up. Of \nthe about 10 to 12 million American workers who now have retiree \naccounts, under this proposal, the best estimate is that 2 to 3 million \nof those who are covered today will lose that, according to CBO.\n  We heard the estimate--this was a real good one--that up to 30 \npercent of those who were getting coverage were going to lose it. And \nthen some of our Republican friends said that is too much, that is too \nmany, so let's expand the base, which they did. Let's include all the \nFederal employees. Let's include other groups in there to lower the \npercentage. Now they come out and say: I know it was 33 percent before; \nnow it is only 12 or 14 percent.\n  The total numbers are the same. You are going to lose the 3 million.\n  This is what we have: 6 million Medicaid beneficiaries who now have \nwraparound coverage; they are going to be paying more. You have 2 to 3 \nmillion retirees who lose their coverage. They are going to be hurt by \nthis legislation.\n  We have 6 million people in the untested, untried premium support \ndemonstration. Add that up, 15 million of the elderly and disabled are \ngoing to be impacted or affected by this program. At the same time we \nare talking about billions of dollars in the slush fund for the PPOs. \nWe are talking about the health savings accounts, which are billions of \ndollars, that the taxpayers are going to end up paying. Then we have \nthe asset test which is going to exclude many of our seniors.\n  This legislation has been altered and changed. It was a prescription \ndrug program when it passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support. \nNow it is a Medicare Program. At the heart of this program are the \nkinds of instruments that can undermine Medicare and threaten our \nseniors now and in the years to come.

Mr. President, I will make my remarks as if in \nmorning business, but my remarks pertain to the HUD-VA bill, and in \nparticular to the small engine provision of that bill.\n  If Members will remember, the Senator from Missouri, in the \nAppropriations Committee, placed an environmental rider into the HUD-VA \nbill which would prevent California from moving forward with its \nregulation to regulate off-road engines under 175 horsepower. The State \nhas developed a regulatory scheme to do so because these engines were a \nsubstantial part--17 percent--of the mobile source pollution in the \nState, and it was believed by the California Air Resources Board that \nregulation of these engines could be achieved and, in fact, could \nreduce pollutants considerably.\n  On the floor of the Senate, the Senator from Missouri offered an \namendment to his amendment from committee. The new language which \nchanged the amendment, in my view, making it better, by only affecting \nengines under 50 horsepower. I spoke against his amendment in the \nAppropriations Committee. I did not press for a vote on the small \nengine amendment which he offered on the floor largely because I \nthought we would lose it and that we had a better chance of trying to \nremove the language from the bill in conference.\n  The bill has been preconferenced. Sadly, we have not been able to \nremove that language from the bill. I am told today that if I were to \nsubmit the amendment we had prepared which would eliminate the Bond \namendment in its entirety, I would not be allowed a vote on that \namendment. I believe the rationale is because I agreed to go to \nconference. I had only because I didn't want to lose on the floor and I \nthought I didn't have the votes.\n  Since that time, a number of States have realized that their \nregulatory schemes would also be impacted by this provision. Other \nStates would be affected because the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air \nAct essentially said that California has the ability to regulate these \nengines, and other States may then take various components of that \nregulation and enact them as their own State law if they so choose. \nSince last week, a number of States have weighed in indicating they \nhave regulatory regimes underway that would be affected and that they \nare opposed to the Bond amendment. Nonetheless, we are where we are.\n  I have come to the floor today simply to speak about why I think this \nis so egregious--and I do think it is egregious. I believe it is the \nfirst major setback from the clean air amendments of 1990, and \nspecifically from the amendments allowing States to regulate air \nquality for the protection of their own people. By eliminating this, we \nare taking important rights away from the States certain rights and \ndiminishing the States' ability to take care of their own people.\n  As the fire chiefs have said to me in a letter, if they waited for \nthe Federal Government to regulate bedding and upholstery, they would \nbe still be waiting for that regulation. Instead, the States have taken \nit on their own to make those regulations. The people of California are \nmuch safer because of it.\n  Let there be no doubt. I believe very strongly that this small engine \nprovision should be removed from the bill and that we should restore \nthe States' rights to protect public health under the Clean Air Act.\n  On the surface, the amendment that was adopted on Wednesday looked \nlike a substantial improvement. At the time I thought it was an \nimprovement simply because it dropped from 175 horsepower to 50 \nhorsepower. However, the amendment still blocks all States from \nregulating some of the dirtiest engines out there.\n  The States will lose the ability to reduce pollution from all spark-\nignition engines smaller than 50 horsepower. This includes lawn and \ngarden equipment, some forklifts, recreational boats, off-road \nmotorcycles, and all-terrain vehicles. The original small engine \nprovision would not have affected boats or off-road motorcycles. But \nthe amendment adopted on Wednesday is broad enough to affect a whole \nnew group of engines.\n  This provision will take four California regulations off the books. \nMy State will lose regulations on lawn and garden equipment, \nrecreational boats, and off-road motorcycles.\n  I don't know whether the effects on additional engines were \nintentional or not. We told the Senator from Missouri about them and \nthe language did not change.\n  But I want to point out another important fact about the amendment \nadopted on Wednesday. The language requires the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency to propose a new national regulation by December 1, \n2004. It does not require the EPA to finalize that regulation, ever. \nThey could propose a regulation and never finalize it. The one \npromising part of this amendment guarantees nothing. The States need to \nreduce these emissions now.\n  I want to remind my colleagues just how dirty these engines are. You \nwill see here that mowing the lawn produces as much pollution as \ndriving a car for 13 hours. I didn't know that before. I didn't know \nthat if you mow your lawn for 1 hour it is like driving the automobile \nfor 13 hours.\n  This chart shows how long you would have to drive a car to produce as \nmuch pollution as when you operate various types of equipment for one \nhour.\n  In other words, using a weed trimmer for 1 hour produces as much \npollution as driving a car for 8 hours, mowing a lawn for 1 hour \nproduces as much pollution as driving a car for 13 hours, and operating \na forklift for 1 hour produces as much pollution as driving a car for a \nfull 17 hours.\n  Clearly, this is a problem. In 8 hours a person can drive from \nWashington to Charleston, SC. Or he can mow the lawn for an hour and \nproduce just as much pollution. The States need to be able to clean up \nthese engines.\n  The small engine provision is bad for the States and for public \nhealth. The compromise from last week did not change the substantive \nissues.\n  The small engine provision is still using an appropriations bill to \nmake fundamental changes to the Clean Air Act. It is an environmental \nrider on the HUD-VA bill. It has had no authorization. It has had no \nhearing. It does not belong in this bill.\n  The amendment from Wednesday still takes a longstanding right away \nfrom the States. States with serious air pollution need to be able to \nreduce emissions from these engines. The 1990 amendments to the Clean \nAir Act guarantee the States the right to do so. This provision \noverturns that right without even going through the proper channels.\n  Under the compromise, my State alone will lose the right to regulate \nover 4 million cars' worth of pollution. That is what is being taken \naway--access to 4 million cars' worth of pollution. That means the \nState is most likely going to have to tighten regulations on stationary \nsources, which is going to mean more expense to major industries in the \nState of California. That means job loss in other industries.\n  I cannot see how building cleaner engines should cost jobs to \nindividuals at one company when every other company has said they will \nbe able to build the engines without job loss. Because Briggs & \nStratton does not like one California regulation, every State in the \nUnion is going to permanently lose the right to reduce pollution from \nthese engines. States with serious pollution problems need to be able \nto reduce these emissions or risk harming public health and losing \ntransportation funds.\n  This provision affects every single State, not just California. For \nexample, I understand that New York has already adopted the California \nregulation affecting recreational boat motors. New York will lose that \nregulation because of this provision.\n  Eight southeastern States--Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, \nMississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee--have all \nwritten a\n\n[[Page S14929]]\n\nletter opposing this provision. The letter clearly states that any \ncompromise that does not fully restore the State's rights is \nunacceptable to those States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the November 10 letter \nfrom the Southeastern States Air Resources Managers be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thirdly, States still need flexibility to improve air \nquality. One size-fits-all solutions just do not work. We should not \nforce every State to rely on national regulations. National regulations \nmove too slowly and are often just not strong enough for States with a \nlot of pollution.\n  We have heard a lot about unfunded mandates lately in the Senate. We \nhave given the States a duty to protect public health. The small engine \nprovision does not change the States' responsibility but it takes away \na mechanism by which they might comply with this mandate. This \nprovision, in a sense, creates another unfunded mandate.\n  The amended provision still creates a very bad precedent. I don't \nthink one company should be allowed to overturn States' rights under \nthe Clean Air Act, especially when that company said on their annual \nreport to the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11, 2003, \nthat the disputed regulation would not ``have a material effect on \ntheir financial condition or results of operations, given that \nCalifornia represents a relatively small percentage of Briggs & \nStratton's engine sales and increased costs will be passed on to \nCalifornia consumers.''\n\n  This is their 10-K, their report to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, from just 2 months ago. Where does the truth really lie? If \nCalifornia is just a small part of the company's market and the company \nwill just pass on the costs, why does Briggs and Stratton object to the \nCalifornia regulation and insist on changing the Clean Air Act? It \nmakes no sense.\n  I believe people will pay the necessary costs for cleaner engines. I \nbelieve that people will pay for cleaner lawnmowers when they learn \nthat you have to drive your car for 13 hours to produce as much \npollution as your lawn mower does in 1 hour.\n  Every company and every industry needs to do their part to protect \npublic health. Briggs & Stratton should be no different. We should not \nallow them to pass the buck to other industries.\n  Once again I will quote from a letter from Allen Lloyd, the Chairman \nof the California Air Resources Board, about this provision. According \nto Mr. Lloyd,\n\n     . . . the aggregate impact of the 50 hp [horsepower] \n     preemption will be 70 tons per day of smog by 2010, the date \n     by which California's various offroad regulations would have \n     been fully effective. This tonnage impact is over and above \n     Federal regulations for the same emission sources and \n     reflects California's more health-protective rules. For \n     context, 70 tons per day is equivalent to adding 2.4 million \n     cars to California roadways . . .\n\n  So when the conference committee includes this provision in their \nconference report, they are effectively adding 70 tons of pollutants to \nCalifornia's air each day. The California Air Resources Board has also \nsaid that this provision could well result in the death of more than \n300 people per year in California alone.\n  California already has seven nonattainment areas, more than any other \nState. My State has the worst air quality in the country, and now this \nprovision is taking away the State's right to regulate some of the \ndirtiest engines available. It is a strike at the core of States' \nrights under the Clean Air Act.\n  The small engine provision also threatens our economy. California has \nto reduce emissions from these engines to comply with air quality \nrequirements under the Clean Air Act. Taking away the State's right to \nreduce emissions threatens our State Implementation Plan, with serious \neconomic consequences.\n  Violating the State's plan will jeopardize $1 billion in \ntransportation funds per year in Southern California alone. The South \nCoast could lose those funds next summer. The South Coast has the worst \nair quality in the nation and cannot afford to lose $1 billion per year \nin transportation funds.\n  Statewide, this provision threatens $2.4 billion in transportation \nfunds. And this is just in California.\n  So this has huge ramifications for my State and every other State \nfacing serious pollution. They will all be in a serious situation in \nthe future when the time comes and they find their hands are tied \nbecause one company did not want to build cleaner engines.\n  It has become clear that the supporters of the small engine provision \nhave confused two very different ideas. Just because a group is \nconcerned about the California regulation on lawn and garden equipment \ndoes not mean they support the small engine provision.\n  The California Association of Fire Chiefs has expressed important \nsafety concerns about a specific regulation. But the chiefs have also \nclearly said they oppose the small engine provision because of its \naffect on States' rights. The Fire Chiefs understand the importance of \nstate leadership on these issues. To quote the chiefs' November 11 \nletter in reference to the small engine provision:\n\n       We were never asked to comment on this matter, but for the \n     record, we do not support legislation that would interfere \n     with a state's ability to protect its own citizens.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Fire Chiefs' letter \nfrom November 11 be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I do not quite know what to do. I \nwould very much like to have a vote on this matter. I have tried to \nimportune the conferees. I am told the Governor of California, Mr. \nSchwarzenegger, now inducted as Governor, has indicated his support for \nthe removal of this amendment. It is my understanding that a whole \npanoply of States oppose this provision.\n  It is clear to me this is a bad thing. It is clear to me this is \ngoing to set back the cause of clean air. It is clear to me this is \ngoing to impact youngsters and the elderly with asthma and other lung \ndiseases. It is clear to me that it is going to impact our \ntransportation dollars. It is clear to me that by 2010, because of one \ncompany, California is going to have deal with 70 additional tons of \nsmog per day. None of this needs to happen.\n  I regret that I cannot send an amendment to the desk. I regret I am \nnot being allowed a vote on the amendment. But this is the wrong thing \nto do.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           Southeastern States Air\n\n\n                                      Resource Managers, Inc.,\n\n                                                November 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Zell Miller,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Miller: Southeastern States Air Resource \n     Managers, Inc. (SESARM), representing the directors of the \n     southeastern state air pollution control agencies in Alabama, \n     Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, \n     South Carolina, and Tennessee, is writing this letter to \n     encourage your support of the removal of a position \n     introduced by Senator Bond in S. 1584, the Fiscal Year 2004 \n     VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill. The \n     provision would amend Section 209(e)(1)(A) of the Clean Air \n     Act to curtail a state's authority to reduce emissions from \n     diesel and gasoline off-road equipment and engines.\n       While Senator Bond's proposed provision regarding the off-\n     road engines apparently was intended to address rules adopted \n     only in California, it will limit the ability of all states \n     to solve serious public health-related air quality problems. \n     Senator Bond's proposal revises a very important provision of \n     the Clean Air Act which allows states to adopt engine \n     emission standards more stringent than the federal standards \n     as long as appropriate federal review processes are followed. \n     Congress wisely put this provision into the Act to give \n     states the ability to deal with serious air quality problems \n     across the country. SESARM opposes the impact of the Bond \n     proposal on this important provision.\n       Please note that other compromise amendments which fall \n     short of fully restoring Section 209(e)(1)(A) are, in our \n     opinion, unacceptable and will constrain states as discussed \n     above. SESARM and your state air pollution control agency \n     would appreciate your support of removal of the Bond \n     Amendment from S. 1584.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John E.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Feinstein: The California Fire Chiefs Association \n     (CFCA) has been expressing concerns about the potential fire \n     hazard posed by catalytic converters that may be required for \n     certain lawnmowers and other outdoor power equipment. In just \n     the past few days, out concerns seem to be receiving \n     significant attention.\n       After further investigation we have determined that there \n     were some misunderstandings between CFCA representatives and \n     the California Air Resources Board (CARB) as it relates to \n     the regulations.\n       The fire safety issues we raised need more attention and \n     require independent assessment before engineering and \n     production decisions are made. In our most recent discussions \n     with CARB, they support the idea of an independent study, and \n     have proposed moving forward with a study, much the same as \n     what is now underway with catalytic converters being used in \n     marine applications. We enthusiastically support this idea, \n     and will be working closely with CARB, the Sate Fire Marshal, \n     and the US Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that all \n     fire safety concerns are addressed. We wish to make clear \n     that we regard fire safety and environmental quality as being \n     equally important, and wish to make it clear that we support \n     without reservation the air quality goals of the proposed \n     requirements. We support the regulation moving forward as we \n     have received assurances from CARB that our safety concerns \n     will be addressed through the independent study.\n       Finally, we understand that as a separate matter, the \n     Senate is debating the question of whether states are free to \n     develop safety and environmental standards. We were never \n     asked to comment on this matter, but for the record, we do \n     not support legislation that would interfere with a state's \n     ability to protect its own citizens. To the contrary, we have \n     had to count on the Sate of California to develop fire safety \n     standards for upholstered furniture, mattresses and bedding \n     because the federal government has failed to do so. The \n     issues of fire safety and air quality as they relate to \n     outdoor power equipment can be addressed, and I believe \n     that working closely with CARB we will find a solution \n     that will provide a high degree of fire safety while \n     maintaining CARB's goals for air quality.\n       In closing, allow me to express my personal apologies to \n     you. We were not aware that you had an interest in this \n     matter or that we were engaged in anything beyond fire \n     safety. As you know, we have had our hands full in the past \n     month. Even so, if we had been aware of your interest, we \n     would have asked for your help in sorting through these \n     issues. You have always been there when we've needed your \n     help. We look forward to moving beyond the current issues and \n     working with you on higher levels of air quality and fire \n     safety for the communities of California.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          William J. McCammon,\n\n                                                        President,\n                               California Fire Chiefs Association.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have had numerous discussions with the \nSenator from California. Obviously, we see these issues very \ndifferently.\n  Let me point out to my colleagues, this is not something that has \njust come up. When we had the committee markup of this bill, the \nSenator and I had an opportunity to debate it at that point. An \namendment, not modified, such as the one I presented on the floor last \nweek, was kept in the bill. Her motion to strike failed 17 to 12.\n  After that time, we met with the Senator from California and other \nconcerned Senators to make sure we did not do the things that the \ncurrent California Air Resources Board regulation would do; that is, \ncost 22,000 American jobs and put at risk of fire, burn, and explosion \npeople using small engines, whether they be in a lawnmower, a leaf \nblower, a weed eater, or a chain saw. These were the real problems in \nthe California Air Regulation Board proposal.\n  Now, when I listened to the Senators, they wanted to make sure, No. \n1, they did not affect diesels. I said good point; make sure we cut \ndiesels. They wanted to make sure it only applied to smaller engines, \nand that is why we put the 50 horsepower and smaller engine limitation \nin it. They wanted to make sure you could require retrofitting, and we \nmade it clear it was only for new engines.\n  Most of all, almost every State wanted to get some form of reduction \nof pollution from these small engines, so we crafted an amendment that \nmade all those changes and specifically directed the EPA to move \nforward with a rule. The fastest they can do that rule is that it is to \nbe proposed by December 1, 2004; and then the EPA is required to move \nforward on it. That would be a quicker reduction in emissions than \nunder CARB, the California Air Resources Board, proposal.\n  Now, when this measure came to the floor, I had a number of \ncosponsors, people who felt very strongly, as do I, about this \namendment, and we debated it on the floor. The Democratic leadership \ncame to us and said: We do not want to vote on this. We want to accept \nit by voice vote. We said: All right, we will cut off the debate, \naccept it by voice vote, if that is the last we are going to deal with \nit.\n  Now, today, my colleague from California says she was not a party to \nthat agreement and she wants a vote on it. Well, I view it as a failure \nto live up to that agreement.\n  Nevertheless, there are a very significant number of Senators on my \nside, and I assume on the other side, who would want to weigh in on it, \nand some of those Senators are not back. As I said, we have a deadline \nthis afternoon when we are going to try to take other amendments on \nthis bill. I said we would not be debating this amendment today because \nother Senators have amendments that must come up.\n  But there is so much misunderstanding about what the Clean Air Act \nprovides, what CARB has done, and what my amendment would do.\n  First, the Senator has said, on a number of instances, that every \nState loses the right to fight pollution. States can take bits and \npieces of the California ruling and use it in their State.\n  Well, No. 1, California is the only State that has a narrow exemption \nfor engines under 175 horsepower that do not affect agriculture and \nconstruction. Obviously, many of these engines that are affected would \naffect agriculture and construction. No State can pick and choose and \ndevelop its own regulations from part of the California regulation or \ntake bits and pieces of the California regulation. No State, on its \nown, can go out and regulate these small engines. There was a \npresumption in the Clean Air Act that we would have a national \nstandard.\n\n  Now, the EPA has moved forward on regulations on a wide variety of \nengines. We are directing them specifically to go after these small \nengines and get the proposed rule out within 1 year, to consider job \nloss, and to consider the fire hazard of these catalytic converters.\n  I understand the CARB regulation would not go into effect until 2007. \nMy colleague from California said we cannot force all States to rely on \nnational standards. Well, that is what the Clean Air Act does. We want \nto make sure the national standards are imposed to give every State the \nreduction in air pollution which comes about from implementing the \nkinds of changes that were made for ATVs and snowmobiles that do not \nrequire catalytic converters.\n  At the end of the day, if they cannot get the reductions, then EPA, \nwhich has a national responsibility, can listen to all of these \narguments. Frankly, many of the arguments made by the Senator from \nCalifornia reflect a completely different understanding than I have on \nthe science and on the technology involved.\n  Under these circumstances, I do not think we ought to be exporting \n22,000 jobs to the Far East, perhaps China, and posing a significant \nfire risk to anybody using small engines.\n  As I have said before, I use those small engines. When I am using a \nchainsaw, I am very aware of the danger of that saw blade. If it had a \ncatalytic converter-heated engine, at 1,100 degrees, I do not know how \nI would do it. I would probably, if I cut down a tree, set the tree on \nfire with the catalytic converter.\n  When we are talking about fire hazards, as I would think anybody in \nCalifornia would be very much concerned about, a catalytic converter is \na tremendous fire hazard. I will go into that in a moment.\n  But my colleague said one company, referring to Briggs and Stratton, \nshould not be allowed to change our air quality rules. Frankly, \nCalifornia wrote a rule that favors one company, Honda, which \nmanufactures small engines and has very significant production in the \nFar East already.\n  They could start up just like that because the American companies \nwould\n\n[[Page S14931]]\n\nnot be able to retool immediately. Honda would capture the market. I am \narguing for the jobs of 5,000 workers in Missouri, 5,101 workers for \nBriggs & Stratton, and about 2,000 of them work for Briggs & Stratton; \n3,000 of them work for other companies that have part of this: In \nWisconsin, 5,158 jobs; Georgia, 2,542 jobs; Kentucky, 2,198 jobs; \nIllinois, 2,116 jobs; Alabama, 1,288 jobs.\n  I am worried about the workers. I have visited those workers. I did \nnot know the Senator from California was coming to the floor today. \nOtherwise, I would have brought out a scroll signed by the workers who \nwould lose their jobs if this amendment were adopted.\n  The Senator points out that Briggs & Stratton said it wouldn't cause \nthem much trouble. Well, they are a multibillion-dollar company. They \ncan move their production to China as well. I fully expect that they \nwould. It wouldn't make much of a difference to the shareholders. They \nsaid it wouldn't affect the shareholders, no. But it will affect 22,000 \njobs in the United States. That is why this amendment is important.\n  These arguments and the totally differing view of how this problem \ncan be addressed should rightly be debated at the national level. The \nEPA is directed to move forward, take all the technological \ninformation, take the arguments, listen to the safety concerns, listen \nto the cost benefit arguments, and figure out how the Nation can get \ncleaner air by further limiting the pollution from these small engines. \nIf they come down with a modified catalytic converter proposal at the \nend of the day, so be it.\n  But the California fire chiefs were excluded from the negotiations. \nThe negotiation went on between CARB and Honda. The California fire \nchiefs were stunned because they had been assured that there would not \nbe a problem with the regulation causing fire.\n  After they saw the CARB rule, the California State fire marshals \nwrote a letter saying:\n\n       We categorically do not support the CARB proposed \n     regulation because we believe it will lead to a substantial \n     increase in residential and wildland fires.\n\n  The Senator and the chief of staff from California have had very \ndirect conversations with representatives of the California fire \nchiefs. They must have been very persuasive because now their letter \nsays:\n\n       We are sure that the safety concerns can be addressed.\n\n  I think that suggests that there was a great deal of effective \npersuasion applied. But they were not the only ones who believed there \nwas a problem, when you look at the other people who have raised \nquestions about it. The National Association of State Fire Marshals \nremains very concerned that the CARB rule cannot be safely met. The \nU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission expressed concerns over the \npotential for burn, fire, or material hazards that remain unaddressed. \nThe Missouri State fire marshals remain concerned that the CARB rule \ncreates a significant threat to the safety of the people, property, and \nthe environment. The National Marine Manufacturing Association is \nconcerned that California's activities create marine safety issues that \nmust be evaluated further before they are imposed on industry.\n  There is one place where they can evaluate those concerns and \nevaluate the technology and make sure we clean up the air without an \nundue cost, a cost in risk of fire and explosion. I was talking with a \nfellow in Missouri this weekend at a football game. His neighbor drove \na car with a catalytic converter out into the field, caught the field \non fire. A lot of people are very much concerned, in addition to these \ngroups, as to the dangerousness of catalytic converters, which can get \nup to 1,151 degrees.\n\n  In the November 6 letter I received before there was this very \npersuasive meeting with the eloquent Senator from California, the \nCalifornia fire chiefs said:\n\n       Earlier this year, in oral and written communications to \n     the California Air Resources Board, our association expressed \n     serious concerns about the CARB's plan to require catalytic \n     converters on lawn mowers and other lawn and garden power \n     equipment. Firefighters have far too much experience \n     suppressing fires caused by catalytic converters on \n     automobiles carelessly parked on combustible grass and \n     leaves. After this past month of fighting wildland fires, we \n     are almost too tired to think about catalytic converters on \n     lawn mowers which, after all, are intended for use on grass. \n     California does not need yet another way of igniting fires.\n\n  That was the November 6 letter sent to me.\n  Grass ignites at about 500 degrees. Grass clippings ignite at 518 \ndegrees. High efficiency catalytic converters from CARB's own testing \nreach temperatures of 1,126 degrees Fahrenheit. We wrote to CARB. I \nasked them if they had any safety data, if they had done any studies, \nhad they looked at alternative methods, had they tried out any of these \nsmall engines with catalytic converters, had they done any tests. We \nasked them a whole list of questions that any responsible agency would \nbe expected to answer. I fully expect the Environmental Protection \nAgency to make sure we have a rule that cleans up the environment but \ndoesn't cost jobs and doesn't increase significantly the risk of fire.\n  There are many issues we are not going to be able to resolve here \ntoday. I want to see these technology issues debated, worked out on a \nprompt schedule, and produced in a resolution by the EPA.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. BOND. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been working with the distinguished \nSenator from California for more than a day. I am trying to work out \nthis very sensitive issue dealing with small engines, which has been \ntalked about at some length.\n  I am very disappointed that the majority is not going to allow the \nSenator from California to have a vote on this amendment. It is too \nbad. It happens. It happens too much around here. When there is some \ndecision made that they may not be able to win the vote, they just \ndon't give us a vote. I think that is unfortunate.\n  I have spoken to the Senator from California and, of course, \neverybody needs to hear it from her. We are going to take our chances \nin conference on this matter. The House has said this should not be in \nthe bill. The Senator from California, if she wanted to be like too \nmany people are around here and say if she doesn't get what she wants, \nnobody will get anything, could hold up action on this important \nlegislation that Senator Mikulski has worked on for many months with \nthe majority.\n  The only thing I can say is I applaud the Senator from California for \nwhat she has indicated she reasonably might do, and that is not go \nforward on this amendment. I think it is too bad.\n  I have said it before, and I will say it again. I personally think \nshe is on the right side of this issue. If this matter were brought to \na vote, I think she would win it on the Senate floor. Obviously, we \nhave been here now for 3\\1/2\\ hours, and the majority has indicated \nthey are not going to allow a vote. When this amendment goes down, it \nwill allow us to move forward with other pieces of this legislation.\n  I say to my friend from California, it is my understanding that she \nhas heard the statements that I have made. And as I have indicated \nthrough the Chair to the Senator from California, this happens far too \noften here. When it appears there is a chance that we can win a vote, \nthey don't give us a vote. As a result of that, we are not going to be \nable to have a vote. But for the Senator from California, being the \nteam player she is, we would not be able to go forward on the bill. I \nstill think the Senator from California and the Senator from Nevada are \nmembers of the conference, and we will do our best in full conference \nto see that justice prevails. I will do what I can.\n  I express my appreciation to the Senator from California for her not \nmoving\n\n[[Page S14932]]\n\nforward with the amendment at this time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic whip for his \nconcern and his words.\n  I want to correct a couple of things. The Senator from Missouri \npointed out that catalytic converters are fire hazards. That may be \ntrue with some. But virtually every automobile, every pickup truck, \nevery sport utility vehicle driving on the roads and highways of \nCalifornia today is equipped with a catalytic converter. It has been \nthat way for a substantial period of time. Catalytic converters are \nnothing new.\n  Secondly, I want you to know that Honda has said that they would \nincrease their U.S. production of these engines even with the \nCalifornia regulation. So, in other words, there are other companies \nmanufacturing these engines in the United States that have said they \nwould adhere to these new regulations and produce cleaner engines.\n  Thirdly, I want you to know that Briggs & Stratton has already moved \nsome of its operations to China. I very much doubt that this California \nregulation has much to do with it. I am told they have been \nmanufacturing in China since 1986, and in April of this year they \nincreased their ownership share of two factories in China from 52 \npercent to a controlling 90 percent. I am also told that California \nregulators have incorporated Briggs & Stratton's own recommendations \ninto its final rule issued in September. The Air Resources Board \nrelaxed the regulation's exhaust emissions standard, relying instead on \ncontrolling evaporative emissions, as recommended by Briggs & Stratton.\n  So I don't know why this is being done. But I will tell you one \nthing: everybody who votes to sustain this will be also voting to put \n70 more tons of smog into California's skies in 2010. That is how \nimportant this issue is to our State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator is \ngoing to withdraw the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I did not send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business at this \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Could the bill be reported?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask that we go to the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14932-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14932-S14940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND \n         INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the actions taken by the \ndistinguished minority whip, the Senator from Nevada, and also the \nagreement by the Senator from California to withdraw her amendment.\n  All I can say about it is, No. 1, we had an agreement, we thought, \nwith the floor staff when we debated this last week--requested by the \nminority floor staff--that there not be a vote because they did not \nwant a vote.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on damages caused by the \n          regime of Saddam Hussein during the First Gulf War)\n\n       On page 125, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 418. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert \n     Storm (in this section, collectively referred to as the \n     ``First Gulf War''), the regime of Saddam Hussein committed \n     grave human rights abuses and acts of terrorism against the \n     people of Iraq and citizens of the United States.\n       (2) United States citizens who were taken prisoner by the \n     regime of Saddam Hussein during the First Gulf War were \n     brutally tortured and forced to endure severe physical trauma \n     and emotional abuse.\n       (3) The regime of Saddam Hussein used civilian citizens of \n     the United States who were working in the Persian Gulf region \n     before and during the First Gulf War as so-called human \n     shields, threatening the personal safety and emotional well-\n     being of such civilians.\n       (4) Congress has recognized and authorized the right of \n     United States citizens, including prisoners of war, to hold \n     terrorist states, such as Iraq during the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein, liable for injuries caused by such states.\n       (5) The United States district courts are authorized to \n     adjudicate cases brought by individuals injured by terrorist \n     states.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) notwithstanding section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11; 117 \n     Stat. 579) and any other provision of law, a citizen of the \n     United States who was a prisoner of war or who was used by \n     the regime of Saddam Hussein and by Iraq as a so-called human \n     shield during the First Gulf War should have the opportunity \n     to have any claim for damages caused by the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein and by Iraq incurred by such citizen fully \n     adjudicated in the appropriate United States district court;\n       (2) any judgment for such damages awarded to such citizen, \n     or the family of such citizen, should be fully enforced; and\n       (3) the Attorney General should enter into negotiations \n     with each such citizen, or the family of each such citizen, \n     to develop a fair and reasonable method of providing \n     compensation for the damages each such citizen\n\n[[Page S14933]]\n\n     incurred, including using assets of the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein held by the Government of the United States or any \n     other appropriate sources to provide such compensation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nGraham of Florida, and on behalf of 17 brave Americans who were taken \nhostage and tortured by Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War.\n  I have already spoken in this Chamber about the horrible treatment \nthese Americans endured. Saddam's evil henchmen violated international \nlaw in the treatment of these war prisoners, and they violated every \nlaw of human decency.\n  After the war, these prisoners sought justice against Saddam. They \ndid it not only because he had tortured them in violation of the law, \nbut also to send a message that would protect other Americans in the \nfuture. And Congress supported their effort. In 1996, Congress amended \nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act so their case would be able to \nproceed.\n  They won their case in court on its merits because they had the truth \nand the law on their side. But now they are in danger of losing the \njudgment they legally obtained because they do not have the United \nStates Government on their side.\n  The Justice Department intervened to prevent them from collecting \ntheir judgment from seized Iraqi assets. And when this Senate responded \nby passing this very same amendment a few weeks ago, the State \nDepartment intervened by seeking to strike the amendment from the \nspecial Iraq-Afghanistan appropriations bill.\n  In a letter dated October 27, Deputy Secretary of State Armitage \nwrote these words:\n\n       Under the President's May 7, 2003 Determination . . . any \n     provision of law that applies to countries that have \n     supported terrorism was made inapplicable to Iraq.\n\n  This is the country we invaded as part of our war on terrorism . . . \nyet the President has said that Iraq will not be treated as a nation \nthat supported terrorists.\n  I think that is wrong, and my amendment, which is exactly the same as \nthe one the Senate earlier approved, makes perfectly clear the \nlongstanding intent of Congress that terrorists who torture U.S. \ncitizens must be held accountable.\n  Saddam Hussein was a tyrant who committee horrible atrocities against \nhis own people and against Americans. In fact, many believe that he is \nbehind the continuing attacks on our American solders. It is beyond my \ncomprehension why these Federal bureaucrats are now siding with Saddam \nHussein and against these former prisoners of war who suffered at his \nhands.\n  These brave heroes are merely seeking to hold Iraq accountable for \nits crimes, and deter the torture of any American citizen by a \nterrorist state in the future. A civilized world cannot let such crimes \ngo unpunished. The perpetrators must be held to account.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I join Senator Reid today in \noffering an amendment that would allow a group of 17 prisoners of war \nfrom the first war in Iraq and their families, to collect the damages \nthat have been awarded to them in a court of law, that are being \nblocked by the Bush administration.\n  Historically, foreign nations and their diplomats have been protected \nfrom lawsuits in the United States, for their actions. However, that \nhistorical protection has been limited in certain instances. In 1996, \nCongress amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow American \ncitizens and families of American citizens to sue nations that have \nbeen found to be ``terrorist states,'' for acts of terrorism such as \ntorture or taking of hostages. Congress went on to enact the Terrorism \nRisk Insurance Act of 2002, which included a provision to allow frozen \nassets of terrorist states in U.S. banks to be used to pay court-\nawarded damages.\n  Relying upon this legal framework, 17 of 21 prisoners of war of the \n1991 Persian Gulf War and 37 members of their immediate families filed \nsuit against Iraq. I won't describe the horrific experiences of every \none of these brave men or the unimaginable distress of their families. \nBut I do want to tell you about the experience of three of these POWs: \nLTC Michael Robert; LTC Russell Sanborn; and LTC Craig Berryman, three \nservice members from Florida. It is important for the Senate and the \nAmerican people to understand what they suffered while they were held \nin captivity.\n  These soldiers endured horrendous treatment and are fortunate just to \nhave survived. LTC H. Michael Roberts was shot down while flying over \nIraq on January 19, 1991, He was able to eject but was immediately \ncaptured when he landed. In captivity, he suffered repeated beatings--\nhis captors cut his head from repeated blows from their rifle butts and \nhe was shocked with an electronic prod.\n  LTC Russell Sanborn's plane was shot down on February 9, 1991, and he \nwas taken prisoner by a group of Iraqi soldiers. He was brutally beaten \nand suffered severe malnutrition. He lost 14 pounds in 26 days. Upon \nhis release, Russell was diagnosed with parasitic anomalies and hearing \nloss.\n  LTC Craig Berryman's aircraft was shot down on January 28, 1991. In \ncaptivity he survived numerous beatings and torture. As a result of his \nabuse in Iraq, Craig has continued to experience health problems.\n\n  After having to relive these horrors in court, on July 7, 2003, a \njudgment was rendered in their favor and they were awarded compensatory \nand punitive damages. The problem is that when they went to collect \ntheir damages against the frozen Iraqi assets held in U.S. banks, the \nmoney was no longer there. That is because on March 20, 2003, \nimmediately after start of military action against Iraq, President Bush \nissued an executive order confiscating Iraq's frozen assets in the \nUnited States and placing them in the Iraq Development Fund for use in \nits reconstruction.\n  The Bush administration has done every thing in its power to \nundermine the integrity of this judicial process and to protect the \ninterests of Iraq over the interests of American former prisoners of \nwar. On May 22, 2003, the President issued another executive order \nwhich prohibits any judicial action that would seek funds from the \nDevelopment Fun for Iraq, or other Iraqi national assets. The Bush \nadministration went on to interpret the language in the 2003 emergency \nwar supplemental intended to remove restrictions to providing foreign \nassistance to Iraq as a bar attachment of Iraqi foreign asset.\n  When repeatedly asked about why the administration is standing in the \nway of these veterans being paid their court-awarded damages, the White \nHouse spokesman, never answered the question, but reiterated, three \ntimes, that ``there is no amount of money that can truly compensate \nthese brave men and women for the suffering they went through at the \nhands of Saddam Hussein.'' If the Bush White House has their way, there \nwill, in fact be no amount of money to compensate these brave men and \nwomen despite having proven their case in a court of law.\n  Earlier this month, Congress approved President Bush's $87 billion \nsupplemental appropriation request for the occupation and rebuilding of \nIraq. At that time, I raised some significant questions as to our \nnational priorities. We are facing mounting national debt. While our \nroads, bridges, schools, water and sewer lines, and electric grids are \ndeteriorating, we will be sending billions of dollars to rebuild Iraq.\n  This is another one of those questions. We are sending money to \nrebuild Iraq, but we are turning our back on a judicial decision that \nwas achieved under laws this body created. We are turning our backs on \nthe torture inflicted upon these 17 veterans who were taken as \nprisoners of war while serving our country.\n  Mr. President, the costs of war do not end at the borders of Iraq; \nveterans will continue to pay them for years to come. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in this effort to see this injustice is \nrectified. I thank Senator Reid for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are willing to accept the amendment on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, again this is an amendment that was offered \nand adopted earlier. It deals with Americans who were held prisoner of \nwar in the first gulf war. This is legislation that is directly in \nkeeping with the sense of the last amendment that was\n\n[[Page S14934]]\n\nadopted. Senator Graham feels strongly about this issue, as do I. I ask \nthat the Senate approve the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2194.\n  The amendment (No. 2194) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nas in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, are we on the VA-HUD appropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that at 4:30 we are going to move \nto the FAA reauthorization bill. Understanding that deadline faces us, \nwith the approval of the chairman of the subcommittee--I hope to have \nhis attention before I make this request--if I might ask the Senator \nfrom Missouri, would it be acceptable for me to divide the time between \nnow and 4:30 so that I would use 15 minutes and then yield to Senator \nDayton for 15 minutes, who also has an amendment to offer? That way, we \nwould reach the 4:30 deadline by dividing the time equally. If that \nmeets with the approval of the chairman of the subcommittee, I would \nlike to make a unanimous consent request along those lines.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, to respond to my good friend, No. 1, we are \nready to accept his amendment. If we could have some more time to \nhandle other business, I would like to. If, perhaps, the Senator--each \nSenator could take 5 minutes or 10 minutes?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me thank the chairman for accepting my amendment. I \nwill take 5 minutes and that is all. I would like to give 15 minutes, \nif it is acceptable, to Senator Dayton to offer his amendment, and then \nI think that leaves you a balance of 10 minutes before 4:30.\n  Let me say I accept the offer of the Senator from Missouri. I will \nspeak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2195\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CHAMBLISS). Without objection, the pending \namendment is set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. \n     Cantwell, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2195.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       None of the funds provided in this Act may be expended to \n     apply, in a numerical estimate of the benefits of an agency \n     action prepared pursuant to Executive Order 12866 or section \n     812 of the Clean Air Act, monetary values for adult premature \n     mortality that differ based on the age of the adult.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the following Senators be added as \ncosponsors of this amendment: Senators Snowe, Jeffords, Boxer, \nLautenberg, Cantwell, and Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In 5 minutes, I will try to describe very briefly what \nthis amendment does.\n  This amendment will stop the Environmental Protection Agency and \nother agencies funded in this bill from using the discriminatory method \nknown as the senior death discount. Right now, heart disease, cancer, \nand strokes are the leading causes of death of people over 65. \nAccording to CDC, air pollution can be particularly devastating to the \nhealth of seniors.\n  The EPA should be creating regulations to protect everybody. However, \nnow we are in the cost-benefit era, and that means each regulation has \nto be costed out. In other words, we must determine the burden \nregulations have on the private sector of our economy, including what \nwill it cost them. We must also determine the benefit regulations have \nfor all Americans.\n  In order to reach the proper evaluation of any regulation, you have \nto determine the cost of the harm that is being done. That is why this \namendment is being offered.\n  Right now, the EPA is discounting the lives of senior citizens. You \nmay have seen this ad in magazines and newspapers showing this forlorn \nsenior. This lady has been told that since she is over the age of 70, \nshe is only worth 63 percent of any other person, say someone age 69. \nYou can understand her sadness, and a sadness that might be shared, \nincidentally, by some 19 Senators who are 70 years old or older. Try to \ntell these Senators they are worth only two-thirds of those younger, \nand you are in for a fight--and rightly so. Their lives are as \nimportant to them and to our Nation as anyone else's life.\n  We need to try to establish the cost to America in honest terms, to \ndetermine, for example, the real cost of the regulation relating to \nheavy diesel equipment, and not say senior citizens are worth less \ntoday than others.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of my amendment from \nthe AARP be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     Senate Dirksen Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: AARP commends you for your efforts to \n     amend H.R. 2861, the Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill for \n     Fiscal Year 2004, to prohibit the use of funds to ``apply \n     numerical values for adult premature mortality that differ \n     based on the age of the adult in a numerical estimate of the \n     costs and benefits of an agency action. . . .'' We urge that \n     you continue your efforts as the bill is folded into an \n     omnibus appropriations measure.\n       AARP submitted comments in May to the Office of Management \n     and Budget in response to its Draft 2003 Report to Congress \n     on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations. In them, we \n     expressed our deep concerns regarding the arbitrary 37 \n     percent discount to the life value of adults aged 70 and over \n     incorporated by the Environmental Protection Agency in its \n     cost-benefit analysis of the Administration's Clear Skies \n     Initiative. We noted that the discount lacked a sound \n     scientific basis, and we voiced concerns regarding its \n     ultimate impact not only on older persons, but on the rest of \n     the population as well.\n       OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n     subsequently called upon EPA to discontinue use of the age \n     adjustment factor cited above, and advised other federal \n     agency analysts that they should not use it either. At the \n     same time, the agency appeared to encourage other \n     methodologies that might assign monetary values for adult \n     premature mortality that differ based on the age of the \n     adult. Application of age-related analytical methodologies or \n     others involving population subgroupings--particularly when \n     monetary assessments are assigned to life value--hold great \n     risks. We are concerned that there may be insufficient \n     science to justify such action.\n       Again, AARP strongly supports your efforts as well as those \n     of Representative Thomas Allen, to ensure that the lives of \n     older people not be devalued, and that needed protections not \n     be shortchanged by the application of biased analytical \n     approaches. We urge your colleagues in conference to do the \n     same.\n       Should you have any questions, please contact me or have \n     your staff contact Jo Reed or Tim Gearan in our Federal \n     Affairs office at 202-434-3800.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Naylor,\n                                             Director of Advocacy.\n\n\n[[Page S14935]]\n\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. What we see, and I will summarize, is an effort by some \nto discount the lives of senior citizens in America when judging the \nimpact of public health regulations. That has to come to an end. We \nhave to make certain the policy we follow in this country, the policy \nthat is being articulated by John Graham, the head of the OMB \nregulatory office, is one that counts senior citizens the same as any \nother citizen.\n  Some of the statements made by Mr. Graham are troubling. But with \nthis statement, and the amendment we have offered today, which is \nidentical to the one offered by the House of Representatives, this bill \nwill say once and for all that senior death discounting has to come to \nan end.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of supporting groups be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. To reiterate, this amendment would stop the EPA and other \nagencies funded in this bill from using a discriminatory method of \nregulatory analysis known as the senior death discount.\n  Heart disease, cancer, and strokes are the leading causes of death \nfor people age 65 and older. According to the CDC, air pollution can be \ndevastating to the healthiest Americans, but can be deadly for senior \ncitizens and other vulnerable populations with these diseases. The EPA \nshould be creating regulations that maximize health protections for \neveryone, especially older Americans.\n  However, instead of maximizing the benefits for everyone, the \nregulatory analysis is being manipulated in a way that makes seniors' \nlives, and the lives of other vulnerable populations, worth less than \nthe lives of other Americans. This practice, commonly known as the \nsenior death discount, devalues the lives of almost 30 million \nAmericans who are over the age of 70.\n  To give you a sense of how this works, when the EPA develops \nenvironmental regulations, it must evaluate the costs and benefits of \nmultiple regulatory alternatives. As part of the calculation of \nbenefits, the EPA places a dollar amount on each life that can be saved \nby implementing each alternative. The EPA often makes a determination \nabout which regulatory alternative to adopt based on the comparison of \nthe benefits and costs.\n  Historically, the EPA valued all lives equally by using the same \ndollar amount for every potential life saved. But now the OMB is \nencouraging agencies to base the value of a life on the age of a \nperson. In many cases, when discounting was applied, the life of each \nperson over the age of 70 was valued at 37 percent less than the life \nof a younger person. In other cases, each year people aged, their lives \nwere considered to be worth less--leading to some lives being worth a \nde minimus amount. In still other cases, the lives of people with \nillnesses or other health conditions were further devalued.\n  The use of the senior death discount has played a significant role in \nsome very important environmental policies. In a rule to cut emissions \nfrom heavy diesel equipment, the EPA not only lowered the value of \nsaving the lives of seniors, but also for children and the disabled. In \nthe end, discounting calculations shrank the benefits from over $81 \nbillion to just over $12 billion.\n  In a regulatory proposal to control air pollution from snowmobiles, \nthe benefits were originally calculated to be approximately $77 billion \nby 2030. However, the health benefits dropped to only $8.8 billion--\nhalf of this decrease was due to the senior death discount and half was \ndue to selective use of scientific studies limiting the amount of \npeople who were affected. Applying the senior death discount in this \ninstance made certain regulatory alternatives less appealing, and the \nrule was ultimately weakened as a result.\n\n  Some of my colleagues may wonder whether this amendment is still \nnecessary, given that former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman \nsaid the agency would no longer discount the lives of seniors by 37 \npercent when calculating the benefits of regulatory policies. However, \nthere is no guarantee that the new administrator or other agencies will \nfollow this policy.\n  In addition, Whitman's remarks did not apply to other forms of \ndiscounting, which continue to be used. These other forms of \ndiscounting also reduce the benefits of important regulatory policies. \nBesides seniors, vulnerable populations, such as children and those \nwith chronic illnesses and disabilities, are affected when these forms \nof discounting are used.\n  John Graham, the head of the OMB regulatory office, has backed away \nfrom his support of the 37 percent discount rate for seniors. However, \nas recently as June 16, he is still insisting that the value of saving \nlives should depend on a person's age, and he is still pushing agencies \nto use forms of discounting.\n  It seems that the end goal is to whittle down the benefits, until \nthey are so close to the costs that regulations will be difficult to \njustify. So unless we take action today, it appears that the lives of \nvulnerable Americans will continue to be devalued.\n  The House already passed Congressman Allen's amendment to the House \nVA-HUD bill, which is similar to my amendment. Members from both sides \nof the aisle spoke in favor of the amendment and it was accepted \nunanimously. It's now time for the Senate to act.\n  Twenty-two national organizations, including AARP and a host of \nenvironmental and faith-based organizations, support this amendment.\n  Our Nation's regulatory system must use methods of analysis that \nproduce regulations that will fairly protect all Americans from the \neffects of air pollution, toxic waste and other dangerous substances in \nour environment. We cannot afford to back away from decades of \nenvironmental laws that have improved the quality of life for all of \nus.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       The following organizations support stopping the Senior \n     Death Discount: 20/20 Vision; American Association of Retired \n     Persons; American Baptist Churches USA; American Lung \n     Association; Breakthrough Technologies Institute; Christian \n     Church Disciples of Christ; Church Women United; Clean Air \n     Task Force; Clear The Air; Coalition on the Environment and \n     Jewish Life (COEJL); League of Conservation Voters; Natural \n     Resources Defense Council; National Environmental Trust; OMB \n     Watch; Physicians for Social Responsibility; Presbyterian \n     Church (USA), Washington Office; Sierra Club; Sisters of \n     Mercy of the Americas, Institute Leadership Team; United \n     Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries; United \n     Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society; United \n     States Public Interest Research Group; Unitarian Universalist \n     Association of Congregations.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the chairman for accepting the amendment. I ask \nthe chairman if at this point we could move the adoption, but I defer \nto him first.\n  Mr. BOND. As I indicated, we are ready to accept the amendment by the \nSenator from Illinois by voice vote.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I support this important \namendment, to put a halt to the Bush administration's disrespectful and \ndisturbing treatment of the lives of America's seniors in setting \nenvironmental policy. It is unconscionable that the administration \ncontinues to push agencies to evaluate pollution-control proposals on \nthe basis of the age of the individuals who are protected. Judging \npeople as less worth protecting based on their age--and to do so for \nthe benefit of polluters--is preposterous and wrong.\n  Despite statements by administration officials aimed to quiet protest \nover the ``senior death discount'' factor --a factor used by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency in recent regulatory cost-benefit \nanalyses that literally devalues the lives of Americans 70 and older--\nthe administration continues to push agencies to apply economic \ntechniques for evaluating pollution-control proposals on the basis of \nthe life expectancies of the individuals protected, slanting the \nanalysis against the elderly who, of course, have fewer years left.\n  This effort by the administration reinforces the broader bias against \nthe environment inherent in economic cost-benefit analysis, which can \ngive short shrift to unquantifiable values of human health and a strong \necology, while overestimating the economic costs to polluters. By \nlowering the calculated economic benefit of protecting\n\n[[Page S14936]]\n\nthe elderly, these techniques will understate the apparent benefits of \nenvironmental protection, because the old are among the most vulnerable \nto respiratory and other diseases caused by pollution. The intended \nresult is to block tougher environmental protections.\n  Selling out America's grandparents at a discount for the benefit of \npolluters is discriminatory and wrong. I am pleased to support this \namendment to put a halt to this repugnant practice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2195) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. What is the pending business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Clinton amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2193\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be set aside and \nthat I be allowed to offer amendment No. 2193.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2193.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To fully fund the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for \n                          Community Building)\n\n       On page 58, line 21, strike ``$1,112,130,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,111,030,000''.\n       On page 125, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 418. There shall be made available $1,100,000 to the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the purposes \n     of making the grant authorized under section 3 of the Paul \n     and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building Act.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment will provide $1.1 million \nin funding for the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community \nBuilding at the Neighborhood House in St. Paul, MN. It is funding for \nthe completion of a commitment which Congress made last year as a \nmemorial for the late Senator Paul Wellstone, my colleague and my \nfriend, who lost his life in an airplane crash last October along with \nhis wife Sheila, his daughter Marcia, and three staff members and two \npilots.\n  This is a very emotional subject for me at an emotional time, so I \nask my colleagues for their forbearance. We just passed the first \nanniversary of that terrible day Paul and Sheila and the others were \nlost forever. One of Minnesota's greatest Senators and most \npassionately loved and admired political leaders--not unanimous, but \nthe most widely shared and deeply felt connection that I have ever seen \nin my lifetime between a political figure and the people of Minnesota.\n  He lost his life while flying to northern Minnesota for the funeral \nof the father of a State legislator, up on the Iron Range of Minnesota \nwhere a funeral is community. He knew, even though he had other \ncommitments elsewhere, and even though Senator Ted Kennedy had \ngraciously come to Minnesota to the metropolitan area on his behalf \nbefore the elections, which were just a few days away--those events \nwere important, but Paul knew the family of the deceased would be \nhelped in their grief by his presence. The community up there would be \nhonored by his presence as a United States Senator, so he left his \ncampaign schedule and the media market to go worship and pray and mourn \nwith those others, friends and family and relatives, fellow citizens, \nas their U.S. Senator and as their friend.\n  That is what all of us do all the time in our jobs--Republicans, \nDemocrats, liberals, conservatives, Senators here, Congressmen and \nCongresswomen, across the country--we drive, and if there is not time \nwe charter small planes into small airports in our States. That day \nPaul's plane didn't land on the runway. It crashed perpendicular to it \n2 miles away into a Minnesota forest and peat bog and caught on fire \nand burned eight people.\n  Tomorrow--another reason this is an emotional topic for all of \nMinnesota--we are told in the news reports today, the National \nTransportation Safety Board will hold a hearing to pass final judgment \non the causes of that crash. Whatever they were, they will not bring \nPaul and Sheila and Marcia and the others back. The circumstances, as \nthey are reported, are unofficial, so I will not comment on them here, \nbut as they report them in the press, it will make it, if anything, \nmore difficult, more painful, more awful an accident that didn't have \nto happen.\n  Paul Wellstone lost his life as a U.S. Senator in service of his \ncountry.\n  As the late Senator John Heinz, Republican from Pennsylvania, lost \nhis life several years ago in a small plane crash in the service of his \ncountry; as other Senators, Members of the House, Governors, Cabinet \nSecretaries, and public officials have lost their lives in airplane \ncrashes or other accidents in the performance of their official duties \nin the service of their country; and when brave men and women lose \ntheir lives in the service of their country, I call that man or woman a \ntrue American hero. If they are wearing the service uniform of our \nArmed Forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, or elsewhere around the world, they \nare true American heroes. If they are wounded or maimed when serving in \nthose awful conditions, they are American heroes.\n  I have been to funerals for Minnesotans who lost their lives in \ntraining exercises in this country and overseas. They gave their lives \nand paid the ultimate price in the service of their country. They are \ntrue American heroes.\n  Paul Wellstone is a true American hero. He would have been under any \ncircumstances losing his life, but he is even more so, and forever, in \nmy judgment. That is why it is so fitting and appropriate--and I was \nglad that I thought it only appropriate--that the Senate last year did \nwhat I would want to do for any colleague of this body or of the House \nwho lost his or her life under similar--or any--circumstances in the \nperformance of his or her official duties--to find a suitable memorial, \na fitting tribute to that American hero.\n  The surviving members of the Wellstone family--two sons, David and \nMark Wellstone--through their own deliberations, identified this \nproject and St. Paul, MN, where especially people from other \ncountries--recent immigrants to the United States--in need of all sorts \nof assistance but who want to become part of this country, who want to \nhave a chance to participate and raise their kids as American citizens \nand become the next Paul and Sheila Wellstone, so they can get the help \nthey need and give a helping hand as Paul and Sheila would have given \nthemselves.\n  We authorized $10 million. The House didn't have anything in there on \nthat matter. But we went to the President of the United States. He was \ngracious enough to assist, and we got the funding provided in that \nbill--the authorization of $10 million. President Bush invited the \nMinnesota congressional delegation and members of the Wellstone family \nto the Oval Office last December for the signing ceremony. He just \ncouldn't have been more extraordinary in his graciousness to the \nsurviving members of Paul and Sheila's families. He took the time and \nextended his schedule to be with us, to share his condolences and make \nit a truly memorable occasion for the members of that family. I know \nthey were enormously grateful, as I was to the President for his \ncompassion and for his humanity.\n  When we got to the appropriations for this fiscal year, it was \ndelayed. The bill that finally came forward provided $8.9 million for \nthe $10 million project that was authorized. I am hopeful the balance \nof that commitment as a memorial to our former colleague will be part \nof the committee bill that is coming before us today.\n  I was disappointed there was nothing provided in it, and there is \nnothing provided in the House bill. I pursued this matter and indicated \nmy intention to offer this amendment for $1.1 million--that is an ``m'' \nfor million, not ``b'' for billion--$1.1 million to complete the \ncommitment that was made--the authorization to commit the money the\n\n[[Page S14937]]\n\nPresident authorized by his own signature into law. I was told via my \nstaff and in talking with committee staff that if this amendment were \nagreed to by the Senate, then it would be taken out of some other \nproject for the people of Minnesota--from the people in Roseville, MN, \nin the northwestern part of the State who were victims of flooding last \nspring, who need help in relocating, who are still rebuilding and \ntrying to reconfigure the locks and dams in that river so they don't \nflood again--and from all sorts of other projects around the State in \ncounties that need sewer systems so people can have safe drinking \nwater, so the kids don't get sick.\n\n  I have to share with the people of Minnesota a confession. They think \nwhen they send us out here, we each have a vote; since we are all \ntaxpayers, and since Minnesotans' taxes as a relatively high income \nState are proportionate to others that send tax money to this great \nFederal Government, we get back at least our fair proportionate share. \nBut it doesn't work that way in this legislation. It doesn't work that \nway. We get the appropriations and those who have more seniority, who \nhave been here longer, have more influence, connections, whatever--it \ndoesn't come out the same. If you were to rank Minnesota with other \nStates, you would find that we give more than our share in \ncontributions to this great center of our Nation and we get in return \nrelatively less than most other States.\n  I find it deeply offending that I am essentially being told, \nforewarned, threatened, that if I bring this amendment forward and it \npasses the Senate, it is going to come out of some other Minnesota \nproject. I appreciate at least being told that so I know what I am \ngetting into here.\n  So much happens in these conference committees. It is just a sneak \nattack behind closed doors. In Minnesota, we have an open meeting law \nwhere you can't go behind closed doors with three or four members of \nthe elected body and conduct public business in private somewhere. That \nlaw is a foreign concept here on Capitol Hill; it happens all the time. \nPeople go behind closed doors and members of conference committees \ncan't even get into the conference room to find out what is going on.\n  They have a bill coming up next for reauthorizing the FAA. Somebody \nin that conference committee stuck something in the bill that hurts the \npeople of Minnesota--thousands of people in and around airports in my \nState--no hearings, no deliberation, no vote in the Senate, no vote in \nthe House, just put in by Senators who don't represent the people of \nMinnesota.\n  The conference committees are great places where you can put \nsomething in there and you can vote on it. I had an amendment to the \nMedicare bill which is coming up, and it is going to come out of \ncommittee, I am told and I am quite sure. I have an amendment that \nwould require Members of Congress to receive prescription drug coverage \nthat is the same and is no better than seniors of America and other \nMedicare beneficiaries receive. Boy, it passed the Senate by a vote of \n93 to 3. That is pretty overwhelming support.\n  I thought: My goodness gracious, the Senate is going to back this one \nbecause the people of America would back that one. I know from my \nexperience in Minnesota that we sure agree with that concept and \nprinciple--that Members of Congress should receive a prescription drug \nbenefit no better than we vote for senior citizens. But then I read an \narticle the next week stating that many of those who voted for it had \nbeen told they could do so because it was guaranteed to die in the \nconference committee and it would not become part of the law.\n\n  I respect those three who voted against my amendment because they \nweren't going to take that escape route and say, Oh, I voted for that \namendment, and to my great dismay it is not going to get conference \nsupport.\n  So Members of Congress can continue to get drug coverage twice as \ngood or more or better than those senior citizens of America.\n  In this case, before this bill goes into the conference committee, I \nurge my colleagues--and I will ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment--if they don't particularly think enough of the situation, \nand circumstances, and the memory of Paul Wellstone, then vote against \nit. I will ask the conferees, if it passes and goes to conference and \nis going to come out of some other Minnesota project, to drop the \namendment because I know what Paul would say. I know what he would want \nus to do. That would be to do what is best for all the people of \nMinnesota. This project is true to the people of Minnesota. But the \nlast thing Paul Wellstone would want to do is take $1.1 million away \nfrom people who are suffering and need help and give it to other people \nin Minnesota in his memory. That would be the antithesis of what is \ngood, for what he believed in, and what he spoke for on this floor. It \nwould be far preferable if the Senate said forthrightly, that is the \nview of the Members or the powers that be, that $1.1 million of the $10 \nmillion authorized last year is too much to bear, too much money, and \nit is just not available in the budget for the people of Minnesota, for \nthe State of Minnesota. Unlike other States, we would not have this \ndiscussion on the Senate floor--it would be $1.1 million for anything \nany Member wanted.\n\n  If they cannot find it, won't find it, do not want to find it, forget \nit. But tell the American people that. Tell the people of Minnesota \nthat. Don't take it out of somewhere else in Minnesota for a project \nthat is underfunded to begin with, that is needed to save people's \nlives, that makes their communities stronger. They elected the two \nSenators to do just as much as any other State in this Nation. Tell \nthem that straight, and then Paul will wait. He should not have to, but \nhe will.\n  The Senate should do the right thing, pass this amendment, put it in \nthe bill, and instruct the conferees to come out of the conference \nreport with the money for the Wellstone Community Center and every \nproject in Minnesota, and not sell anybody out behind closed doors, \nbehind our backs, and I will once again respect this body, the Senate \nof the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Minnesota feels \nstrongly about this; both Senators do.\n  I ask that Senator Coleman be added as a cosponsor.\n  We are willing to accept the amendment. I ask that it be accepted by \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I object. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object to the adding of a \ncosponsor?\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator does not object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is added as a \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I repeat my request for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds by the Department of Veterans \n  Affairs to implement policies that prohibit the Veterans Integrated \n Service Networks from conducting outreach or marketing to enroll new \n                       veterans in such Networks)\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n       Sec. 116. No funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     for the Department of Veterans Affairs by this Act or any \n     other Act may be obligated or expended to implement the \n     policy contained in the memorandum of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs dated July 18, 2002, from the Deputy Under \n     Secretary for Health for Operations and Management with the \n     subject ``Status of VHA Enrollment and Associated Issues'' or \n     any other policy prohibiting the Directors of the Veterans \n     Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) from conducting outreach \n     or marketing to enroll new veterans within their Networks.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and the \nranking member of the subcommittee for agreeing to accept my amendment \npertaining to veterans outreach programs. My amendment would restore a \nvaluable--and statutorily mandated--service to our nation's veterans \nand their families.\n  In July 2002, the Department of Veterans Affairs Deputy Under \nSecretary for Health for Operations and Management sent a memo to \nVeterans Integrated Service Network Directors ordering them to ``ensure \nthat no marketing activities to enroll new veterans occur within \n[their] networks.''\n  This memo cited an increased demand for VA health care services as \nthe reason for this change in policy. While it is clear that more \nfunding should be provided for VA health care and other programs and I \nstrongly support doing so it is inappropriate for the VA to institute a \npolicy to stop making veterans aware of the health care services for \nwhich they may be eligible.\n  I joined with a number of our colleagues last year in sending a \nletter to the President asking that this policy be immediately \nreversed. I regret that the VA's reply indicated that the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs stands by this policy, which remains in effect.\n  My amendment would prohibit the VA from using Federal funds to \nenforce this policy, or any other policy prohibiting regional health \ncare directors from conducting outreach to enroll new veterans into the \nVA health care system. A similar amendment offered earlier this year by \nCongressmen Sanders and Kanjorski was accepted to the House version of \nthe underlying VA-HUD appropriations bill.\n  I have long been concerned that tens of thousands of our veterans are \nunaware of Federal health care and other benefits for which they may be \neligible. We can and should do more to educate our veterans and their \nfamilies about these benefits, and to provide adequate funding to \nensure that all veterans who wish to take advantage of their benefits \nare able to do so. Halting health care marketing activities is not the \nanswer. Our brave veterans have earned these benefits. The Federal \ndepartment that is charged with advocating for and providing benefits \nto our veterans should not be allowed to continue to restrict health \ncare outreach activities.\n  This is especially important as we welcome home a new generation of \nveterans who are serving in Iraq and in the fight against terrorism. \nToday's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are tomorrow's veterans. \nThese men and women selflessly put their lives on the line to protect \nour freedoms, as have countless military personnel before them. We must \nensure that their service and sacrifice, which is much lauded during \ntimes of conflict, is not forgotten once the battles have ended and our \ntroops have come home.\n  Our veterans and their families have made great personal sacrifices \nto protect our freedoms. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. Making \nsure that our veterans know about the benefits that they have earned is \nan important first step in starting to repay this debt.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for working with me on this important issue.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is an amendment with respect to VA \nmarketing. It is acceptable on both sides. I ask that be it be agreed \nto on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2197) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2198 to Amendment No. 2150\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, because we had done a list of amendments and \nwe neglected to include an amendment by Senators Cantwell, Carper, \nBrownback, Hagel, and others with respect to section 8 public housing, \nmoving to work demonstration agreements, I ask unanimous consent that \nthis be acceptable and I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Ms. Cantwell, for \n     herself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Roberts, \n     Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. DeWine, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2198 to amendment No. 2150.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require a study of the Moving to Work demonstration \n                    program, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 125, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 418. EXTENSION OF CERTAIN PUBLIC HOUSING/SECTION 8 \n                   MOVING TO WORK DEMONSTRATION AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Extension.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development shall extend the term of the Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement entered into between a public housing \n     agency and the Secretary under section 204, title V, of the \n     Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of \n     1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, April 26, 1996) if--\n       (1) the public housing agency requests such extension in \n     writing;\n       (2) the public housing agency is not at the time of such \n     request for extension in default under its Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement; and\n\n[[Page S14939]]\n\n       (3) the Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement to be \n     extended would otherwise expire on or before December 31, \n     2004.\n       (b) Terms.--Unless the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development and the public housing agency otherwise agree, \n     the extension under subsection (a) shall be upon the \n     identical terms and conditions set forth in the extending \n     agency's existing Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement, \n     except that for each public housing agency that has been or \n     will be granted an extension to its original Moving to Work \n     agreement, the Secretary shall require that data be collected \n     so that the effect of Moving to Work policy changes on \n     residents can be measured.\n       (c) Extension Period.--The extension under subsection (a) \n     shall be for such period as is requested by the public \n     housing agency, not to exceed 3 years from the date of \n     expiration of the extending agency's existing Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement.\n       (d) Breach of Agreement.--Nothing contained in this section \n     shall limit the authority of the Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development to terminate any Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement of a public housing agency if the \n     public housing agency is in breach of the provisions of such \n     agreement.\n\n     SEC. 419.

Mr. President, this is acceptable on our side.\n  Mr. REID. There is no objection on this side.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest we agree to it by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2198) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we delay the \nFAA bill for 5 minutes and the debate would be from 4:35 to 5:35 and a \nvote occur at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      congressional award program\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, several Senators were prepared to offer an \namendment today to provide for support for the Congressional Award \nProgram, through a collaboration with the Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service. I understand from the Subcommittee the difficulties \nthat this would present and will not press forward with such an \namendment at this time. I did want to engage the Chairman of the VA-\nHUD-Independent Agencies Subcommittee in a colloquy about this valuable \nprogram.\n  Congress established the highly successful Congressional Award in \n1979 to recognize initiative, achievement, and service in young people. \nThe Congressional Award is the U.S. Congress' award for young \nAmericans. It is nonpartisan, voluntary, and noncompetitive. The award \nenjoys broad bipartisan support. This excellent program has grown by \nmore than 3,000 participants during fiscal year 2003, and currently, \nthere are some 14,750 active participants from across the nation.\n  In the past, the Congressional Award Program has been able to sustain \nitself. Because of the tremendous growth of this program, its resources \nhave been stretched to the breaking point. After the events of 9/11 and \nthe recent recession, patterns of charitable giving have changed and \nthis program, like many worthy causes, has had an extremely difficult \ntime maintaining earlier levels of contributions, much less \naccommodating its rapid growth. The congressional award needs a modest \namount in a funding base to regain its footing and momentum and \ncontinue its growth for the future. Congressional support is needed to \nleverage renewed and increased private donations.\n  Supporters of this program had looked to this bill because the \nCongressional Award Program already is being cited by the Corporation \nfor National and Community service as the kind of program it supports \nand encourages and already is listed as an official partner of \nAmerica's Promise, another related program. Congress already has \nexplicitly provided in the Congressional Award Act that, while this \nprogram may not receive a direct appropriation, it may receive \nfinancial support through collaborations with other programs receiving \nappropriated funds.\n  I note that the Appropriations Committee, in the report accompanying \nthis bill, has expressed its concern with current costs per participant \nin volunteer service programs. In particular, the report mentioned the \n$16,000 cost per AmeriCorps members for program and education award \ncosts and called upon the Corporation to reduce costs. In contrast, the \nCongressional Award Program costs only about $68 per participant. It is \nmore than just a great program, it is a bargain.\n  The Congressional Award is one of only two standing awards given by \nCongress. The other is the Congressional Medal of Honor. It is time \nthat Congress became a partner of the congressional award in more than \njust name.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I add my comments in support of the Congressional Award \nProgram. This excellent program is open to all 14- to 23-year-olds. \nParticipants earn bronze, silver, and gold congressional award \ncertificates and bronze, silver, and gold congressional award medals. \nEach level involves setting goals in four program areas: volunteer/\npublic service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition/\nexploration. Earning the award is a fun and interesting way to get more \ninvolved in something young men and women already enjoy or something \nthey might like to try for the first time.\n  Regardless of an individual's situation, he or she can earn this \naward. The congressional award has no minimum grade point average \nrequirements. It accommodates young people with special needs or \ndisabilities who are willing to take the challenge. The award is open \nto all. We consider this to be a valuable priority within a fiscally \nresponsible appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, this is a program that all of us want to see grow and \nflourish. It is not just another program. It is not just another \nfoundation pursuing a worthy cause. It is our award--a unique program \ncreated by the Congress to recognize and encourage leadership and \nvoluntary service to the community by our young people. It requires and \ndeserves our support.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleagues for their attention to this matter.\n  It is certainly our intent, in continuing congressional support for \nthe corporation, that it look for additional ways for actively \npartnering and collaborating with organizations such as the \nCongressional Award Program. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on appropriate ways to carry that goal forward.\n\n\n   capital asset realignment for enhanced services (cares) initiative\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the managers for working with \nSenator Enzi, Senator Schumer and myself on a compromise to ensure that \nour concerns are addressed. We understand that they have committed to \npursue language in the conference report that expresses the committee's \nconcerns about the Draft National CARES Plan recommendations of closure \nand reduction of services in long-term care, domiciliary care, and \nmental health services at VA facilities. The language urges that no \nclosures or reduction in long-term care, domiciliary care, and mental \nhealth care services take place until the full analysis is completed. \nThe language would also require the VA to submit updates on their \nprogress in this analysis to the appropriate committees. Finally, the \nmanagers have agreed to send a letter to VA Secretary Principi \noutlining these concerns on our behalf.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to add to my colleague's discussion. I got \ninvolved in this process to bring attention to the concerns of veterans \nin rural and frontier areas. Based on these concerns, I hope in any \nfurther analysis on the future needs of veterans health care the\n\n[[Page S14940]]\n\nVA will consider all access issues related to travel, such as road \nconditions, the number of lanes on roads, and seasonal changes and \nother factors relating to the weather. I know many of my colleagues \nshare these concerns and I appreciate their taking this opportunity to \naddress them.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friends from Missouri and Maryland for \nengaging us in this colloquy, and appreciate their efforts to work with \nus on addressing our concerns with the CARES process. Among these \nconcerns, I am particularly pleased that the managers of this bill have \nagreed to work with us in addressing the participation of veterans at \nhearings held by the CARES Commission. The participation of veterans is \ncritical to a process that so directly impacts the quality of \nhealthcare they receive from the VA. It is my understanding that the \nmanagers have committed to addressing this specific issue by presenting \nlanguage to the conference that would recognize the benefits of and the \nneed to have CARES related hearings within 30 miles of all facilities \nfacing closure or a reduction in services, as well as the importance of \nveteran participation at these hearings. I also understand that the \nmanagers have committed to presenting language to the conference that \nencourages the VA to hold additional hearings in all affected \ncommunities following the Secretary's final recommendation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President I thank the Senators from New York and the \nSenator from Wyoming for their thoughtful comments. Their understanding \nis correct, and we will pursue such language in the conference report. \nSenator Mikulski and I will also be sending a letter on their behalf to \nSecretary Principi with these concerns.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I acknowledge the validity of my colleagues' concerns \nand look forward to working with them to try to address these concerns \nin conference and with Secretary Principi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we have reached the point where we \nare ready to get a final list and a means of proceeding. So if it is \nagreeable on both sides, I ask unanimous consent that the only other \namendments in order to the VA-HUD bill, other than the substitute, be \nthe following: Dayton No. 2193 with 5 minutes equally divided; Senator \nMcCain, amendment on NASA; Senator Inhofe, amendment on air quality; \nSenator Jeffords, National Academy of Sciences study; further that \nfollowing the scheduled cloture votes on Tuesday, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill for the consideration \nof the remaining amendments.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \ndebate on cloture dealing with FAA be for a full 1 hour, with the time \nequally divided pursuant to the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to any of the foregoing \nrequests?\n  Mr. REID. I express my appreciation to Senator Lautenberg and Senator \nLott for allowing us to go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14940-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14940-S14952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    VISION 100--CENTURY OF AVIATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT--CONFERENCE \n                            REPORT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 4:40 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to consideration of the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2115, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 2115, an act to amend \n     title 49, United States Code, to reauthorize programs for the \n     Federal Aviation Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nequally divided for debate prior to a vote. The Senator from \nMississippi will control one-half hour, the Senator from New Jersey \nwill control one-half hour.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is an important piece of legislation \nthat has been in the process all year now. As we know, the aviation \nindustry has had its difficulties since the events of 9/11 and the Iraq \nwar. Aviation across the board has struggled to comply with additional \nsecurity requirements and to become economically viable again. A lot of \nchanges are happening in the industry.\n  But Congress certainly has not been insensitive to the needs of this \nindustry. We passed legislation to be of assistance in, I guess, 6 \nweeks after the 9/11 events, and then earlier this year additional \nassistance was provided to the airline industry as a result of losses \nthey were experiencing and expected to experience as a result of the \nwar in Iraq.\n  But they need the broader long-term Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization. I consider this legislation to be the third leg of the \nstool to give the aviation industry, as a whole, an opportunity to get \nup and running, to provide service to the American people, and to, \nfrankly, see blue skies again. That is why this legislation is very \nimportant.\n  If we do not extend this FAA reauthorization, there are certain parts \nof the program that will either be deferred or will have to shut down. \nSo it is not insignificant that we are up against the wall in terms of \nextending the Federal Aviation Administration legislation.\n  I emphasize, too, that this is not just about the agency. This is \nabout an important part of our economy. We are very mobile in America. \nTransportation is such an important part of our economy. Americans are \nflying all over the country, as we speak, on airlines and in general \naviation. They are in our airports. It is an important part of our \neconomy. It creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, when it is allowed \nto function as it should. So we need to get this legislation passed.\n  It is, in my opinion, about safety in the aviation industry at our \nairports, in general aviation, with the airlines. We need to make sure \nthe money is there for the aviation program, for the security that \nneeds to be put in place on the airplanes, in the airports, on the \nperimeters. This is very important legislation. It is part of our \noverall homeland security program.\n  I remind my colleagues that H.R. 2115, the FAA reauthorization bill, \nis a 4-year $60 billion bill. This is a huge piece of legislation. We \nneed to get it done.\n  I would like to point out to my colleagues some of the impacts we see \nas a result of this industry and what it means. First, aviation \ngenerates more than $900 billion in GDP every year. Over the life of \nthis bill, the legislation is expected to create approximately 665,000 \njobs; $14.2 billion in airport grant funding would create these 665,000 \njobs. There would be 162,000 jobs in 2004 alone; $14.2 billion will be \nused for security, safety, and capacity projects at airports; $13.3 \nbillion would be to modernize the air traffic control system, and $500 \nmillion for the Essential Air Service program.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. A lot of money is \ninvolved. It is not just about the big airports; this is about the \nsmaller airports. We do have good programs included here, including the \nEssential Air Service, and also a program that allows communities to be \ninvolved and participate with some funding of their own.\n  We have had an experimental program in place now for the last couple \nyears. This would extend that small community Essential Air Service \nprogram. A number of communities around the country are very much \ninterested in having that opportunity.\n  It also provides new opportunities for flights out of Reagan National \nAirport, 8 new flights inside and 12 new flights outside the perimeter. \nSo this is very important legislation in terms of the airports.\n  For the first time we actually make sure the regional airlines get \nsome assistance. When we passed the big legislation back in 2001, the \nregional airlines were sort of left out. So we would get that done.\n  It provides for cost-effective programs that could save the taxpayers\n\n[[Page S14941]]\n\n$173 million per year. It has a huge impact on States all over the \ncountry. I would like to show a chart to give you some idea of the \namount of money and the amount of jobs that would be affected by this \nlegislation. I have the list here. It is too small probably for most of \nyou to see, but I will just pick a couple of them: Alaska, $522 \nmillion, 24,000-plus jobs.\n  I see the Senator from Georgia, a very important terminal in Atlanta, \none of the most important in the country, $162.6 million; 7,722 jobs; a \nsmaller State, North Dakota, $59.2 million, 2,814 jobs.\n  The list is here. If you want to see how your State would be affected \nwith dollars and jobs, we have the information for you.\n  The question would be, Why has this taken so long? We passed it back \nin May in the Senate. It passed the House. We went to conference. We \nworked out an agreement on good legislation. But it did include some \nlanguage that became controversial. It did say there would not be \nprivatization of the air traffic control system, but it identified 69 \nsites in medium and small communities where contract hours could be \nconsidered or could be actually put into place. So there was a \ncriticism about that.\n  After trying to work it out in a variety of ways, we went back to \nconference and took that language out. So we basically went back to the \nstatus quo. We don't say there won't be privatization of the air \ntraffic control system, and there won't be. We didn't say that, well, \nthese 69 contract areas might be considered for contract hours. We took \nboth of those out, thinking, well, we are ready to go now.\n  Strangely enough, that was not acceptable, either. So we have been \nworking in a bipartisan way to try to come up with some solution that \nwould satisfy both parties, all parties, and how this could be handled.\n  Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nDorgan, and I sent a letter to the FAA Administrator, Marion Blakey, \nlast week saying we thought it would be appropriate to have a 1-year \nmoratorium on any effort of privatization. We have been working with \nthe administration on that issue since that time.\n  The administration, I believe, is willing to make a commitment to not \ngo forward for 1 year, for a moratorium, while GAO does a study of the \nimpact of privatization, and also so the Commerce Committee, chaired by \nthe Senator from Arizona, can have hearings on that matter. But they \nwant to be able to go forward with those things that are already \nunderway.\n  The net result for the air traffic controllers and for other unions \nwithin the FAA would be a 1-year moratorium. However, where there is an \nongoing A-76 study, that would not be stopped. Now I am being told \nmaybe even that is not enough. I ask, how much is enough?\n  This is very important legislation that affects the economy of the \ncountry and this industry. Are we going to let 1 or 2 groups decide we \nwill not have this $60 billion bill unless they get some guarantee on \nsomething that is not going to happen, anyway? I don't believe that is \nreasonable. I think we need to go forward and have this vote. Let the \nAmerican people see who wants to be of assistance to aviation, who \nreally wants to have safety in the skies.\n  Let me say to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, be \ncareful how you vote because this legislation provides funds for \nsecurity at airports. It changes who pays for the security costs and \nwhere that money would go. The AIP, airport improvement program, which \nwas used for $500 million in security costs over the last couple of \nyears would not continue to be used for that purpose. It would go back \nto being used for what it was originally intended--improvements at \nterminals, runways, and aprons, but there would be a dedicated line of \nmoney that would go to security. If you vote against this legislation, \nand it continues to drag out indefinitely, and we don't get these \nsecurity funds to the proper place they are supposed to go--\nparticularly the airports--if we have another instance at an airport, \nor with the airline industry, I would not want to be on record voting \nagainst this very important legislation that has been developed over a \nlong period of time, in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lott for all the work he \ndid as chairman of the subcommittee on this issue. I know we don't have \na great deal of time. Is the Senator aware in this bill we have $14.2 \nbillion for security and safety for AIP, $13 billion to modernize the \nair traffic control system, $31 billion to operate--the list goes on \nand on. There are billions of dollars, including drastically needed \nimprovements in security and essential air service.\n  I note the Senator from West Virginia, as long as I have been on the \ncommittee, has sought money for essential air service. We also have \nenvironmental provisions. These are all being held up on one issue on \nwhich we have tried to reach some kind of compromise.\n  My question to the Senator from Mississippi is this: Let's suppose we \ndon't achieve cloture and we don't have 60 votes on this bill. What do \nthe opponents gain by that? It seems to me what they gain is sooner or \nlater we are going to extend the existing programs, which allows \nfurther privatization of the towers and other aspects of our air \ntraffic control system, which is what they are fighting against. Yet \nthey will lose. Is this some kind of a statement being made or is this \nreality? Is there anybody who believes we are going to shut down the \nair traffic control system, shut down aviation in America if we don't \npass this bill? Either existing law will be extended or we are going to \npass this bill. Is that the Senator's assessment? I think our \ncolleagues ought to know what the consequences of this vote will be if \nwe fail to achieve cloture.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee he has put his finger right on the heart of the problem. \nThere are funds that would not go out for security and airport \nimprovement if we don't pass this legislation. The alternative would \njust be to extend the current law for, I don't know, 6 months. The \nSenator is right that in that case the status quo is in place. As a \nmatter of fact, any privatization efforts that might be underway or \nthey want to do in that period could go forward. We had worked it out \nwhere we had language both in the conference report and in a letter \nthat would say there would not be privatization of the air traffic \ncontrol system.\n  Finally, even other parts of the FAA would get a 1-year moratorium. \nThis is the classic example of where my colleagues in the Senate--\nDemocrats--seem to be hopelessly pursuing where the last rose lingers. \nWe have a whole bouquet in this bill. It is good for the American \npeople. It is going to be good for the industry and it will create \njobs. We are looking for this one last thorny rose we can claim and \nsay, well, we got it done. I note the House has already passed this \nlegislation and we are, I assume, sometime in the next month going to \ncomplete our session of this year. We need to get this done. It would \nbe very positive for the industry and for the Congress for us to go \nahead and complete this action.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. The alternative, if we don't pass \nthis legislation, is the status quo, which would allow the \nadministration to do whatever they please in terms of privatization \nunder legislation Congress has previously passed.\n  I will make one other note. On this idea of contract towers, there \nare mixed emotions on both sides of the aisle. It is not a Republican \nor Democrat thing. But there have been hundreds of these contractors \nput into place. Usually, they are supported by local congressmen and \nsenators--and, by the way, it is an idea that really exploded and was \nused extensively during the Clinton administration. I am not being \ncritical. In many cases, it makes common sense. In many communities, if \nyou don't have the contract towers, you would not have anything.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why we haven't been able to \nbring this to conclusion. I think it is time to vote and see who is for \ngetting this legislation done and who wants to preserve the status quo, \nI guess, or have nothing, which would hold up funds to the tune of \nbillions for security and improvements at our airports.\n  Since the chairman is here, and I know Senator Lautenberg is waiting\n\n[[Page S14942]]\n\nto speak, I will reserve the remainder of my time. We will claim more \ntime after Senator Lautenberg has had a chance to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. On my time, I ask the Senator from Mississippi just \none question, if the Senator is available. I want to put a question to \nhim.\n  Can the Senator tell me why Congressman Young from Alaska fought so \nhard to take two of his airports off of the privatization possibility?\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on the time of the Senator, I am glad to \nrespond.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Take a short minute, if you will.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will give the Senator a direct answer. Senator Stevens \nindicated that is what he wanted. I understand there are extenuating \ncircumstances with those two areas in Alaska. That varies from State to \nState. In some States, they want contract towers for a particular site, \nand in others not. I agree with the Senator on that. I think we should \nnot have excluded them.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is apparent the Congressman from \nAlaska wants to make sure his people are safe when they are in and out \nof that airport. He doesn't want to be privatized, and neither do I, or \nmost of the people in the Chamber.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from Mississippi. He and I will \nagree on lots of things. When we don't, they are usually deep \ndisagreements. We all want the system to function. The Senator from \nArizona certainly understands aviation and how the system operates, but \nhe said something in his remarks that really struck me. No matter what \nhappens, this program is going to get funded. It is going to get funded \nregardless of the action we take tonight. Why it is that the President \nof the United States and his people decided to delay implementation of \nthis reauthorization, I will never know. This is kind of like a \nCuster's last stand: We are going to teach you Democrats something.\n  Don't teach us; teach the American people how you care about them, \nabout their safety. Why, suddenly, are we so concerned about going \ncommercial? We took roughly 28,000 baggage handlers and said, you know \nwhat. The private sector can't handle them. They mess up all the \ninspections. They are terrible. We have to get them in Government hands \nwhere we know things can be properly operated. But when it comes to the \nFAA, the people who responded so heroically when the tragedy of 9/11 \nstruck our country, no, then we want to put security on the cheap. We \nwant them to be operated by Acme Air, or whoever else it is.\n\n  The aviation industry has had a lot of difficulty. Much of that is \nbecause our country had an overwhelming tragedy strike us on 9/11, and \nso our citizens were afraid to travel. They were afraid to get up in an \nairplane. Now they don't have to worry so much, except for shoulder-\nguided missile launchers and except for terrorists constantly trying to \nbreak through. And now, to make life easier, we are going to take the \nFAA, the most well-trained group in the country, people who are on the \njob 24/7, constantly, they are always there when we need them, \nregardless of weather, regardless of what else happens--when those \nairplanes struck the Trade Towers, we are now talking about my \nneighborhood.\n  I saw the Trade Towers from my apartment house. I didn't see them \nthat day because I happened not to be there, but I notice their \nabsence. It is very clear. The people in the tower at Newark--I know \nthose guys and the ladies. I know them well. I have been up in that \ntower many times. I used to be commissioner of the Port Authority of \nNew York and New Jersey. I know what goes on in towers. I know we used \nto gauge rainfall with a pail outside. It wasn't that long ago. The \nfact is, they could see the buildings burning, and when the order came \nto take safer action, they did.\n  We are going to soon be voting cloture on the FAA conference report, \nand it would have passed except for the fact there was an insert put in \nafter neither House had a Democrat in the conference--neither the \nSenate nor the House of Representatives, neither had a Democrat in the \nconference. Nevertheless, we are now suddenly delivered a program that \nincludes a recommendation from the White House, which neither body \nacted upon, and when we voted overwhelmingly to preserve the no-\nprivatization view.\n  On June 24, 2002, just in the aftermath of 9/11, the President signed \nan Executive order. So this issue has been in the works for some time. \nWe don't have to talk about who is delaying the movement of the \nreauthorization bill. There it is. June 4, 2002: Section 1 of this \nExecutive order:\n\n       The first sentence of that order is amended by deleting `` \n     . . . an inherently governmental function.''\n\n  That is what the President of the United States said on June 4, 2002, \nnot too many months after 9/11 took place.\n  We took up the FAA bill in June. The Senate spoke loudly and clearly: \nNo privatization. The House also spoke loudly: No privatization. But in \nthe conference, the prohibitions disappeared. Conference leaders simply \ndropped all the language dealing with privatization.\n  Why did the Members of the conference, sitting behind closed doors, \nignore the mandates for safety and security of our aviation system? If \nyou ask them, they say the White House said we had to; so the order. \nBoth Houses of Congress were clear. Both Houses spoke on the issue. \nBoth Houses said no privatization of air traffic controllers. But in \nthe conference, that commitment disappears. Why? Apparently in this \nCongress, we pass bills in both Houses, and then the White House writes \nthe conference report.\n  It is presented graphically on this chart. House bill: No \nprivatization. Senate bill: No privatization of air traffic \ncontrollers. White House position: Silence on privatization. Conference \nbill: Silence on privatization. That is a coverup. What that means is \nthey can go ahead and do it any time they want to.\n\n  In this Congress, if the House and Senate agree on something and you \nthrow it out and allow the White House to write whatever they want, we \ndon't usually respond favorably to that happening. The stakes are high \nbecause the safety and security of our families, our friends, and our \nneighbors are at stake. The clearest evidence of this is how our air \ntraffic control system performed on September 11, 2001.\n  The first airplane struck one of the Trade Towers at 8:45 a.m. This \nchart shows what the skies looked like at that time. The little light \ngreen areas represent airplanes. You can barely see the ground. This \nwas 1 hour, and it was even more crowded than that. The order came out \nto get the airplanes out of the sky, get them on the ground, get people \nsafely to someplace where they could call their families and let them \nknow what was happening.\n  One hour later, 5,000 airplanes were taken out of the sky, directed \nto land at destinations that were not originally planned, and the \npicture looks like this chart. It is a lot safer. If my family was \nflying, I would have been very happy to hear they landed someplace, \nwhether it was in Wyoming or Arizona--anyplace else besides New Jersey. \nI would have just been happy to know they were on the ground.\n  My State suffered major losses. Almost 700 people--691, to be exact--\nfrom New Jersey lost their lives that day in the World Trade Center \nattack. We are very sensitive to safety. We know this hits home. This \nis no academic exercise for us. We know there are families tortured by \nthe loss of a father or mother or brother or sister. My oldest daughter \nlost her best friend in that World Trade Center. They worked together \nat one financial firm. My daughter went to law school, and this lady \nwent to a place called Kantor Fitzgerald. They lost 700 of their 1,000 \nemployees.\n  These acts of terror utilizing our aviation system introduced a new \nera of fear for the U.S. travelers.\n  September 11 also highlighted the heroic act of many public employees \nwho did their jobs, as they do every day, with skill, courage, and \nprofessionalism. Emergency responders, rescuers, firefighters, police \nofficers, and other government employees aided people out of the \nburning buildings. We heard of a historic incident where a couple of \npolicemen and firemen went into the buildings knowing very well their \nlives were at stake. Unfortunately, they were right; their lives were \nat stake, but they tried to save others.\n\n[[Page S14943]]\n\n  As our aviation system was both under attack and being used as a \nmeans of attack, it was the air traffic controllers who protected the \ntens of thousands of Americans aboard aircraft at that time. The \nsnapshots we have seen tell us the picture quite precisely. Within an \nhour of the time that the flights were ordered to the ground, the \nNation's air traffic controllers made unbelievable progress. We saw \nthat in the chart. Within an hour, numbers of those planes--huge \nnumbers--were successfully grounded.\n  I repeat, almost 5,000 aircraft were guided safely to the ground in a \nmatter of hours, a tremendous feat. All parts of the system worked \nwell, worked together, and worked safely to bring home those traveling \nby plane that day. This included roughly 15,000 air controllers, 6,000 \ntechnicians, and 2,800 flight service station employees.\n  These people acted bravely and professionally. So why does President \nBush want to honor these heroes of 9/11 by firing them? I do not get \nthat at all. The administration plans to privatize our air traffic \ncontrol system.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Mississippi say there are no \nplans, no, but just take away the safeguards and anything one wants can \nbe done. This conference report allows them to do exactly that. It is a \nbad idea, truly disrespectful to the thousands of September 11 heroes \nand disrespectful to all of those who worry about air travel when they \nread about shoulder-fired weapons and even worse.\n  It is no coincidence that this important section of the FAA bill was \nomitted without any Democratic input or debate. The American people do \nnot want safety and security on the cheap. They want air traffic \ncontrol to remain essentially a Government safety function, as it was \nbefore President Bush signed that Executive order in 2002. That is why \nthe Senate voted on June 12 of this year--I remind my colleagues who \nare in the Chamber, talking about who should vote for what--I want \neverybody in this Chamber to feel like they can look in the mirror and \nanswer the question: What was the best thing I did for the safety and \nthe safeguarding of our airplanes and our passengers? That is to make \nsure this system stays intact.\n  The Senate voted on June 12, a vote of 56 to 41--we do not have 56 on \nthis side--to ban this privatization. I remind my colleagues that \nsafety and security are not partisan issues. Eleven of my Republican \ncolleagues voted for safety and security. This conference report on the \nFAA is not the first conference report produced on this bill. Conferees \nproduced an original conference report that was downright strange.\n  How much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen and a half minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. For starters, it exempted the State of Alaska. Of \ncourse, that has something to do with the fact the chairman of the \nHouse Transportation Committee is from Alaska. He did not want his \nairports privatized. He was very specific.\n  He said: Of course, the criticism of myself is that I exempted the \nState of Alaska, and here is the reason for that. One, he describes \nJuneau Field itself to be going under Capstone next year so it would \nnot be eligible to be contracted out. The Merrill Field is a real \ncomplex issue. He winds up saying that the airplanes take off right \ntoward my hotel room every morning. I look out and there is one coming \nright at me. It is an interesting experience and I want to make sure \neverything is done right in that field.\n  He does not want Acme air controllers to be there perhaps in the \nmiddle of a labor dispute or something like that. He wants to know that \nthe tried and trusted hand of the FAA as it is presently composed \ncontinues. If he thinks that exempting Alaska is a good idea, let the \nother States have an exemption, too. The other 49 should just as well \nbe exempt.\n  If the Chair would let me know when we have 10 minutes, I would like \nto turn that time over to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Privatizing the air traffic control system is a bad \nidea for many reasons. We should heed the lessons of other countries \nthat tried this already: Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. All \nof these attempts resulted in failures.\n  We should heed the lessons of the blackouts we experienced in the \nNortheast this summer that shut down six major airports. Our air \ntraffic control system guided stranded flights safely to the ground.\n  I do not think it can be any clearer that air traffic control is a \nvital Government safety and security function.\n  I sense my colleague from West Virginia would like to use his 10 \nminutes now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the sake of a flow back and forth, I \nyield 5 minutes of our remaining time to the chairman of the full \ncommittee.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the time with unanimous consent that I regain \nit and turn it over to my friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, when Air Force One takes the President down to his \nranch in Texas, guess what. Horrors, the plane lands at an airport with \na contract tower. When the Vice President travels to Jackson Hole, WY, \nhis plane lands at an airport with a contract tower. Perhaps the safety \nconcerns that always surrounds a President and Vice President have been \nwaived in this case.\n  One of the most respected men in Washington is Ken Mead. He is the \ninspector general of the Department of Transportation. He did a study \non the issue of contract towers. I ask unanimous consent that his \nletter and that of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers \nOrganization be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            U.S. Department of Transportation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Don Young,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         U.S. House of Representatives,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Young: We understand that the House and \n     Senate Conferees may be meeting this week to discuss the \n     Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Reauthorization. One \n     issue that will no doubt be included in those deliberations \n     is the provision of the legislation that prohibits FAA from \n     contracting out any Air Traffic Control functions. \n     Specifically, we are concerned that this restriction would \n     eliminate even the option of expanding FAA's Contract Tower \n     Program to the 71 visual flight rule (VFR) towers still \n     operated by the FAA, regardless of how safely and cost \n     efficiently towers in the existing Contract Tower Program are \n     operated.\n       Based on our work, we think the Conferees should take into \n     account the track record of the 218 VFR towers in the \n     Contract Tower Program. Since 1998, we have conducted audits \n     of various aspects of the Contract Tower Program and have \n     found consistently that the program works well. We found that \n     contract towers provide cost-effective services that are \n     comparable to the quality and safety of FAA-operated towers. \n     For example, last year the level of operational errors at \n     contract towers was comparable to the level of operational \n     errors at FAA VFR towers. The Contract Tower Program also \n     provides services at towers that FAA would otherwise not have \n     staffed because they were too expensive to operate. In 2002, \n     we estimated that contracting out the VFR tower still \n     operated by FAA could save the agency about $780,000 per \n     tower each year. That translates into about $55 million in \n     annual savings if all 71 towers were contracted out.\n       Our point here is not that the 71 VFR towers still operated \n     by FAA should be converted to the Contract Tower Program, but \n     that the option should remain open. We do not support \n     expanding this option beyond the remaining 71 VFR towers \n     still operated by FAA. But in light of the sharp decline in \n     Aviation Trust Fund revenues and the most recent projections \n     of the Federal deficit, we think FAA needs the flexibility to \n     evaluate alternatives for ensuring its operations at all VFR \n     towers are conducted in the safest and most cost-effective \n     manner possible.\n       We urge the Conferees to consider preserving at least the \n     option of expanding the Contract Tower Program to the 71 VFR \n     towers still operated by the FAA.\n       If I can answer any questions or be of further assistance \n     in this or any other matter, please feel free to call me at \n     (202) 366-1959, or my Deputy, Todd J. Zinser, at (202) 366-\n     6767.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kenneth M. Mead,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n[[Page S14944]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                          Professional Air Traffic\n\n\n                                     Controllers Organization,\n\n                               Douglasville, GA, November 6, 2003.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I am writing to urge you to support the \n     conference report accompanying H.R. 2115, Vision 100--The \n     Century of Aviation Reauthorization Bill. Please make no \n     mistake; Labor is divided on this issue.\n       I am the National Representative for the Professional Air \n     Traffic Controllers Organization, PATCO/AFL-CIO, and \n     represent the air traffic controllers in 50 FAA contract air \n     traffic visual flight rule (VFR) control towers (ATC) across \n     the United States. I take exception to the National Air \n     Traffic Controllers Association position that the FAA \n     contract controllers are unsafe. The DOT Inspector General's \n     report released on September 5th states unequivocally the \n     safety benefits to the aviation community and the cost \n     savings to the American taxpayers of the Federal Contract \n     Tower Program. The FAA contract controllers are all FAA \n     certified, most have 15-20 years of experience and the large \n     majority are retired military and former FAA controllers. FAA \n     also closely monitors and oversees all FAA contract tower \n     operations.\n       H.R. 2115 will enhance aviation safety, security and \n     supports the Airport Improvement Program. The important issue \n     of expanding capacity to aid congested airports is also \n     addressed by the building of new runways and other projects, \n     all of this resulting in the creation of new jobs.\n       There are those who oppose this bill because they believe \n     it mandates privatization. It does not. The measure, as you \n     know, is now silent on the issue of privatization, leaving \n     the FAA with the management flexibility they have held for \n     decades to evaluate staffing at individual facilities and to \n     make appropriate decisions with regard to safety, efficiency, \n     and fiscal responsibility. Please support the conference \n     report accompanying H.R. 2115 and encourage your colleagues \n     to pass this legislation as quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jerry Tuso,\n                                    PATCO National Representative.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. He says:\n\n       Since 1998, we have conducted audits of various aspects of \n     the Contract Tower Program and have found consistently that \n     the program works well. We found that contract towers provide \n     cost-effective services that are comparable in quality and \n     safety to FAA-operated towers.\n\n  The difference is it saves $170 million a year for the taxpayers. By \nthe way, I hope the Senator from New Jersey can get over the Alaska \nissue. This is a fairly big bill. In all deep sympathy, I hope he can \nget over two towers in Alaska as we consider this serious issue.\n  The process was not perfect. We probably should not have put this \nprovision in in conference. We did so at the urging of the \nadministration because there was the threat of a veto by the \nadministration. Ever since then, we have tried to reach some kind of an \nagreement. We have agreed to have it language neutral. We have agreed \nthere would be a year-long moratorium while GAO and other studies are \nconducted.\n  The Senator from Mississippi and I have spent literally hundreds of \nhours trying to reach some accommodation to avoid a veto by the \nPresident of the United States who flat out said that--guaranteed in \nwriting that we would have a veto--and at the same time try to satisfy \nthe legitimate concerns because of the position of Senator Lautenberg \nand others who voted for the measure to which Senator Lautenberg \nreferred.\n  It seems to me we should have been able to come to some kind of an \nagreement, including the commitment that we got from the \nadministration, or at least we would have held to, for an all-out \nmoratorium.\n  Now, if the Senator from New Jersey prevails on this vote, we have \nprevious authorization and privatization will go on. So the Senator \nfrom New Jersey may feel great about it but the fact is that with the \ncompromises we offered, he would have been far better off. Instead, we \nworry about two towers in Alaska.\n  The point is, we have tried. We have tried to address this issue, \nwhich is a very small part of very large legislation, that has to do \nwith aviation security; it has to do with airports; it has to do with \nall kinds of things. It is a massive bill and we are hung up on this \none aspect for which there is a refusal to compromise on the part of \nthe Senator from New Jersey, and I regret it. I deeply regret it \nbecause we may lose this vote, although I hope Members realize the \nconsequences of the loss of this vote. Believe me, we are not going to \nshut down aviation in the United States of America over this issue. We \nare not going to allow that to happen. It is far too important to all \nof America's citizens.\n  Again, I hope my colleagues will pay attention to the letter from Ken \nMead, the inspector general of the Department of Transportation, that \nsays clearly that the contract-operated towers are safe consistently, \nthey are cost effective, and their quality and safety is comparable to \nFAA-operated towers.\n  I reserve the remainder of Senator Lott's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this is all odd, perplexing.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am sorry, but there was a unanimous \nconsent that was agreed to that the time would be turned back, and I \njust want to make sure we divide it up properly. So I would like to be \nable to recover the time and then just make a decision to hear our \nchairman of the subcommittee. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve and a half minutes remain.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am grateful to my colleague from New Jersey for \nthat. But I am still perplexed. This is all kind of odd to me.\n  We could, I think, pass this whole thing, the entire authorization \nbill. The chairman of the full committee and Senator Hollings and \nSenator Lott, both of whom have spoken here, myself, the ranking member \non the Aviation Subcommittee, and Byron Dorgan--we wrote to FAA \nAdministrator Blakey and made a reasonable request, asking for an \nextension on a certain part of this for a period of a year. We might \nget that in the next 7 or 8. We might very well get it. The language \ndidn't appear to be quite proper at the time.\n  We do have the President's statement. As the Senator from New Jersey \npointed out, he specifically deleted ``an inherently governmental \nfunction'' when it referred to air traffic performance-based \norganizations.\n  I want to support the FAA conference report. I think virtually \neverybody in the Senate would want to do it. It includes a lot of \nthings that are very important to me for West Virginia. West Virginia \nis not at the center. We are not exactly a hub of jet aviation, but we \nare served by many good airlines that do their best to help us. We all \nknow the issue of privatizing the air traffic control system has held \nthis whole thing up for months. It is perplexing, because it does not \nseem to me to be that big an issue. Yet if we are simply to accede to \nit, in language which is potentially very vague, we have no idea what \nmight happen.\n  That is why we sent this letter--my good friend and chairman, and I, \nand the chairman of the full committee--to try to get this extended for \na year so we could look at it and go ahead and pass the rest of all \nthis.\n  But we have not gotten the letter. We still have 7\\1/2\\ minutes, if I \nread the clock correctly. It could come in. Then we could all vote for \nthe entire conference report. But short of getting that letter and that \ncommitment, which we all signed on a bipartisan basis, then I think we \nhave to vote against cloture because it is entirely a matter of \nemployees being accountable to the public who maintain the airplanes, \nwho are the service stations that send them from one place to another. \nThat is accountability to the public. It is not accountability to the \nbottom line. It is not a matter of contracting out. This is fundamental \nsafety.\n  If you ever go out to Herndon, VA, as I have, and you see the latest \ntechnology and you see all the airplanes in the air at any given moment \nin the United States of America, you can hardly see the country. There \nare airplanes everywhere and they are all traveling. They have to be \nguided. A lot of them are general aviation. Some of them are not, \nobviously.\n  The inability of Congress to resolve this issue has created a very \nsignificant uncertainty for our airports in particular. These are hard \ntimes for aviation. I don't think it is the right time to add more \ntrouble in their life, more uncertainty in their life, less \npredictability in their life, and the worry about less safety in their \nlife.\n\n[[Page S14945]]\n\n  Last week we did attempt to resolve the main issue that held this up. \nAs I indicated, Senators McCain, Hollings, Lott, Dorgan, and myself did \nsend the FAA Administrator a very straightforward, honest letter and we \nrequested the FAA impose a 1-year moratorium on the actual contracting \nout of any air traffic control functions, including flight \nservice stations, which provide enormously important information to \npilots. You can't do without them.\n\n  I have a little community in my State called Elkins, WV, which is \ncurrently not served by commercial aviation, but it does have a \ncritically important flight service station that handles traffic for a \nsignificant part of the Washington, DC metropolitan area that is at \nrisk of being contracted out--and will be.\n  Flight service stations such as these are absolutely vital security \nlinks in our Nation's air traffic control system and they have to be \nprotected from privatization.\n  I come from a private enterprise background, and that has been \npointed out to me humorously, or not, but you just can't fool around \nwith public safety. You can't do it. Police officers are not contracted \nout. I guess they are in Iraq, but they are not in this country. They \nare public servants. Or you hire a private guard if you want to, \nsomething of that sort, but basically, protection of public life and \npublic passage is in the hands of the Federal Government. And it should \nbe. It has always been there. People trust it. If you took it away, or \nparts of it away, people would be stunned. I think they would be \nstunned.\n  This Senator can only support cloture if the administration has made \na strong commitment to hold off any changes to the management of the \nair traffic control system for a year. And we have still 4 minutes to \nget that letter. Then we will vote for the conference report and I will \nhappily do so because I agree with the Senator from Mississippi, there \nare lots of good things in it. But safety, unfortunately, is one of \nthose things you cannot compromise.\n  The Senator from Arizona spoke about Air Force One and Air Force Two. \nI have never had any doubt they are well cared for. But there is a lot \nof other general aviation that may not be quite as well tended to, and \nwe have to worry about that.\n  I don't think the conference report is going to pass the Senate if \nthis letter doesn't arrive. It is not just a case of where the perfect \nis the enemy of the good but, rather, it is a fundamental debate over \nthe future of aviation and security. It is a huge subject. Aviation is \nan enormous employer, creating enormous economic activity in our \ncountry.\n  This is not the process we should have to use for the FAA conference \nreport. I would be the first to say that. It grieves me. This \nlegislation has always enjoyed bipartisan support.\n  I want to set the record straight for 1 second and then I will be \nfinished, on how this came about. When the Senate debated, as has been \nsaid by the Senator from New Jersey, we debated this important \nbipartisan bill. We had a bipartisan majority of Senators express \nserious concerns over the executive branch's future plans for the \nsafety management of the air traffic control system as a whole. As the \nSenator indicated, we voted 56 to 41 to impose restrictions on the \nadministration's proposal precisely to avoid the very outcome of the \nconference report we are now facing, which is allowing the \nadministration to privatize functions of the air traffic control \nsystem.\n  I will not get into the House of Representatives. They also had voted \nto impose these safety restrictions. In the end, the majority of \nconferees--we were never invited to be a part of, I was never invited \nbe a part of, but I have become accustomed to that because I was part \nof the Medicare conference and I wasn't part of that, so my threshold \nof expectations was low. But we had the will of both Chambers being \nexpressed. Unfortunately, the conferees bent to the desire of the \nadministration.\n  Congress has clearly spoken on its concerns over air traffic control \nprivatization. Let us use next year to develop policies and make the \nsystem more secure, more safe, and more efficient. I urge my colleagues \nto reject cloture unless we get a letter in the next minute and a half \nwhich commits to this protection which I think we all want.\n  This is an enormous subject. I deeply regret we have come to this \npoint. There is no reason we should have, but we have. Assuming that \nletter will not come, I will have to ask my colleagues to vote against \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before he leaves the Chamber, I thank the \nSenator from West Virginia for his work on the Commerce Committee, and \nspecifically for his work and his cooperation on the development of \nthis legislation, both at the subcommittee and full committee level and \nhere in the Chamber of the Senate, and also for the tone of his \nremarks. He wants to get this done and that is the attitude we should \nall have. In fact, that has been my goal. I am trying to find a way we \ncan get a bill completed that has $60 billion in it, billions of \ndollars for security for our airports and for the airline industry as a \nwhole and that the President will sign.\n  Is this about trying to win the point--the congressional position \nwill prevail and the President's position will prevail? How about \nfinding a position we can both live with? That is, fortunately or \nunfortunately, how it works sometimes in a legislative body. That has \nalways been my attitude. I am not interested in making statements. We \ncame here to get things done. We need to get this legislation \ncompleted. That is why we have been working feverishly to try to come \nto a conclusion.\n  With regard to contract towers, we have one in Tupelo, MS. It works \nfine.\n  I believe the record will show that the Senator from New Jersey has \nover the years supported the concept of contract towers. As a matter of \nfact, when he was chairman of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, in 1994, the number of contract towers grew from 14 in \n1987 to 59 at the end of 1994--an increase of 300 percent while he was \nsubcommittee chairman.\n  I repeat again something I said: This is not a Republican idea. I am \nnot even sure it is a Democrat idea. But it is an idea that was used \neffectively during Democratic administrations and Republican \nadministrations.\n  The 1994 Senate report says:\n\n       In light of the recent recommendations in the ``Report of \n     the National Performance Review'' which calls for converting \n     level I control towers to contract operations, the Committee \n     has provided an additional $1 million above the amount \n     requested for this program.\n\n  That was in the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee report in \n1994.\n  Here is the most important language from the subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Lautenberg.\n\n       The Committee believes this public/private sector program \n     (contract towers) has provided significant safety and \n     economic benefits to smaller communities at a reduced cost to \n     the Federal Government since its inception in 1982. The \n     Committee urges FAA to expand the programs where appropriate.\n\n  Now, all of a sudden, contract towers are something really heinous. \nWhat is the difference in 1994 and 2003? We have done a lot more--I \nthink over 200 of them. I think most of them work just fine.\n  I do not know. We are doing a little revisionist history here.\n  I emphasize this: There is no language in this conference report that \nwould identify contract towers for Alaska, in or out. We took that out. \nIt is not here.\n  We also had language in the conference report that said we would not \nhave privatization of the air traffic control system.\n  Declare victory? Oh, no. That was a problem because it didn't apply \nto all parts and all unions involved in FAA.\n  That is what this is really all about. It is about making sure that \nevery one of the unions that are involved in the Federal Aviation \nAdministration are excluded.\n  Again, we are, I guess, looking for the perfect here. All the talk is \nabout air traffic controllers, but as a matter of fact, it involves the \nFederal Flight Weather Service people, it involves maintenance, it \ninvolves everybody.\n  We can't have privatization of any part of the FAA, would be the \nattitude of some. I just do not understand that language here.\n  So it is very important that we realize what is actually in this \nconference\n\n[[Page S14946]]\n\nreport and what is not. My guess is, Can you accept victory? Can you \naccept victory? The administration has said they will put it in \nwriting; they would have supported it in legislation; no privatization \nof air traffic control systems.\n  I ask the Senator from New Jersey. He addressed a question to me. I \naddress a question to the Senator from New Jersey. Will he accept a \ncommitment of a 1-year moratorium of no privatization of the air \ntraffic controllers?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator from Mississippi would read that \ninfamous letter we are talking about, it says no actual privatization \nwill take place.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my point.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. My goodness, we couldn't privatize it within a year \nif we started today. That letter doesn't say what it is purported to \nsay.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, the FAA conference report before us this \nevening is critical because it provides funding for crucial safety, \nsecurity and capacity projects at airports across the country.\n  I strongly believe that all Senators should support this cloture \nvote--especially since it includes provisions to strengthen our \nNation's air service. However, a handful of Members on the other side \nof the aisle have held this measure up due to inaccurate claims that \nthe administration wants to privatize our air traffic control system. I \nwould like to take a few minutes to set the record straight.\n  The objective of the FAA contract tower program is to reduce costs to \nthe Federal Government by contracting out the operation of low-activity \ntowers while providing a safe and efficient service to users of the \nNational Airspace System. Without the contract tower program, many \nsmaller airports would be left with no air traffic control services.\n  Since 1982, the FAA has used the contract tower program to provide \nair traffic control services at low activity Visual Flight Rules towers \nacross the country.\n  In 1994, the Program was expanded to include the conversion of FAA \nLevel 1 Visual Flight Rule towers to contract operations. This \nexpansion was included in Vice President Gore's National Performance \nReview and supported by Congress. The Department of Transportation's \nInspector General has publicly stated how important the contract tower \nprogram is. This program makes sense because it allows the FAA to \nrealign its resources in a more efficient and effective manner; it has \na better safety rate than FAA towers; and, it saves taxpayer dollars.\n  All contract controllers are certified by FAA, and contract tower \nfacilities are monitored on a regular basis by the agency. \nAdditionally, the vast majority of contract controllers are former FAA \nand military controllers. All contract controllers are subject to the \nsame training requirements and operating rules and procedures.\n  Presently, the FAA is operating 219 contract towers at airports \nthroughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and \nPuerto Rico. The Contract Tower program cost for FY 2002 was $73.5 \nmillion. This program results in annual savings of over $54 million.\n  A recent audit by the Inspector General at the Department of \nTransportation validated the cost savings, and found that contract \ntowers operate as safely and efficiently as FAA towers. Contract tower \nlocations are evaluated by the FAA under the same requirements as FAA \nstaffed towers.\n  Contract towers are staffed at the levels required under current \ncontracts. Contracts are required to submit monthly staffing reports--\nwhich provides verification that they are in compliance with their FAA \napproved staffing plans.\n  Several audits have commended the FAA's Contract Tower program for \noversight of contractors and strict monitoring of controller staffing \nlevels.\n  According to Department of Transportation Inspector General Kenneth \nMead, the contract tower program provides ``cost-effective services \nthat are comparable to the quality and safety of FAA-operated towers.'' \nAdditionally, the National Transportation Safety Board--NTSB--supports \nthe contract tower program.\n  I find it hard to believe that a handful of Democrats know more than \nNTSB or the inspector general when it comes to aviation safety.\n  There are many aspects of our Nation's aviations system. Nothing in \nthe FAA Conference Report would allow for privitization. Simply put, \nunder this bill the FAA would continue to exercise the authority it has \nhad since 1982.\n  A number of my colleagues have implied that this bill is an attempt \nto contract out the job of Enroute Control Centers. Enroute controllers \nare responsible for directing traffic across the United States--the \nContract Tower Program has nothing to do with these positions.\n  At Congressional hearings this year, DOT's inspector general stated \nthat with the sharp decline in revenues to the aviation trust fund and \nthe most recent projections of the federal deficit, the FAA needs the \nflexibility to ensure VFR towers are conducted in the safest and most \ncost-effective manner possible.\n  Wyoming's busiest commercial airport--Jackson Hole--operates under a \ncontract tower. The Jackson Airport handles over 63 percent of \nWyoming's commercial air traffic.\n  For those who question the safety of contract towers, I would like to \npoint out that Vice President Cheney and President Bush both use \ncontract towers when they fly to their respective home States. If the \ncontract towers are safe enough for the President and Vice President--I \nbelieve they are safe enough for the American public.\n  I would like to quote Senator Lautenberg's floor statement during \nconsideration of the fiscal year 1994 Department of Transportation and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act on October 4, 1993. He said:\n\n       The use of contract towers is an example of how we can \n     reduce the costs of Government services and achieve savings \n     over the long run. FAA estimates that the use of a contract \n     control tower saves $200,000 annually because of the \n     flexibility available in scheduling controller working hours \n     around changes in air traffic activity levels.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Talon News article by Jeff Gannon \ndated September 23, 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Talon News Sept. 23, 2003]\n\n Daschle, Lautenberg Vow to Fight FAA Privatization They Supported in \n                                  1994\n\n                            (By Jeff Gannon)\n\n       Washington (Talon News).--New Jersey Democrat Sen. Frank \n     Lautenberg is promising to hold up the Federal Aviation \n     Administration reauthorization bill over the subcontracting \n     of some air traffic control jobs. He cited safety concerns as \n     the basis for his opposition to the outsourcing of air \n     traffic control functions.\n       President Bush has threatened to veto a bill that does not \n     include language to allow the privatization that his \n     administration says will result in increased savings with no \n     reduction in safety. Democrats are challenging competitive \n     sourcing of thousands of federal jobs through insertion of \n     amendments into departmental appropriations bills that would \n     prohibit the practice.\n       Some are characterizing Lautenberg's opposition to the \n     privatization as political, since he championed a similar \n     program in 1994.\n       Geoffrey Segal, the Director of Government Reform Policy \n     for the Reason Foundation, told Talon News, ``The change in \n     position clearly is pandering to special interests, in this \n     case NATCA (National Air Traffic Controllers Association), \n     who have aggressively stepped up their lobbying efforts to \n     fight competition in the FAA.''\n       Segal pointed out that, while serving as chairman of the \n     Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Lautenberg \n     supported the part of Vice President Al Gore's program for \n     ``reinventing government'' that included the changes now \n     being proposed by President Bush.\n       Segal continued his criticism of Lautenberg, saying, ``The \n     flip-flop in position is pure partisan politics--it's reform \n     when proposed by a Democrat, but it's trading safety and \n     security for profits when it's a Republican proposal.''\n       Lautenberg was quoted in the Washington Post in 1994, \n     saying, ``The [Clinton] administration's proposal to \n     privatize the air traffic control system is consistent with \n     the desire to bring more efficiency and reform to government \n     and should be reviewed seriously.''\n       On the Senate floor in 1993, the New Jersey Democrat \n     declared, ``I strongly endorse the FAA's contract tower \n     program for level 1 (the smallest) control towers. . . . The \n     use of contract towers is an example of how we can reduce the \n     costs of Government services and achieve savings over the \n     long run.''\n       Lautenberg justified his support of privatization by \n     saying, ``FAA estimates that the use of a contact tower saves \n     $200,000 annually because of the flexibility available in \n     scheduling controller working hours around changes in air \n     traffic activity levels.''\n\n[[Page S14947]]\n\n       At the time, South Dakota Sen. Tom Daschle (D-SD) praised \n     Lautenberg's efforts, saying, ``I would like to compliment \n     the Senator from New Jersey for once again doing a masterful \n     job in providing the Senate with an appropriations bill that \n     recognizes the importance of our transportation systems to \n     the health of our economy and fairly balances the competing \n     demands for improved transportation services throughout the \n     United States.''\n       Daschle continued his complimentary assessment of the \n     privatization provision, saying, ``I am grateful that report \n     directs the FAA to include the Aberdeen (South Dakota) \n     Airport in the FAA's contract tower program.''\n       Lind Hall Daschle, the senator's wife, was a deputy \n     administrator for the FAA from 1993 until 1997.\n       The Reason Foundation's Segal summarized his assessment of \n     the political motivation of the Senate Democrats by saying, \n     ``Of course, the larger picture is that both Sens. Lautenberg \n     and Daschle supported bringing competition to government, \n     however, as part of President Bush's plan to do the same, \n     both senators are outspoken opponents of the plan. It seems \n     that competition in Aberdeen is good for Sen. Daschle's \n     constituents but not for American taxpayers.''\n       FAA officials have suggested that unless action is taken by \n     the September 30 expiration of the current authorization, it \n     would begin to furlough non-essential personnel. Marion C. \n     Blakey, the agency's administrator, predicts more dire \n     consequences. The New York Times quotes her as saying, ``We \n     see ourselves on the brink of closing the doors.''\n       A temporary reauthorization measure is being proposed to \n     break the impasse and to avoid a shutdown of the FAA. Two \n     Republicans, Sens. Trent Lott (R-MS) and John McCain (R-AZ), \n     indicated they would oppose any short-term extension and \n     intend to continue work on the full four-year bill.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues and the American \npublic see that under the Clinton administration the Contract Tower \nProgram was okay but it's not today--under a Republican administration.\n  This conference report includes many important provisions for our \naviation system. It includes billions in funding for the Airport \nImprovement Program; provides continuation of the Essential Air Service \nand Small Community Air Service programs; funds FAA operations, air \ntraffic control facilities and equipment; extends War Risk Insurance to \nMarch 2008; and it provides streamlining for airport capacity, safety \nand security projects.\n  Secretary Norman Mineta has stated that ``passage of this legislation \noffers millions of American travelers the assurance that the Nation's \naviation system will remain the safest, most efficient and most \ncompetitive in the world.'' The facts speak for themselves. The \nContract Tower Program provides cost effective, quality and safe air \ntraffic control services to smaller airports.\n  I urge my colleagues to support cloture on this important bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the tragedy of September 11 has been \nseared into all our memories. We will never forget the sudden massive \nloss of lives, and the realization that our country was now extremely \nvulnerable to terrorist attack. We remember the extraordinary courage \nof the passengers on the fourth plane who prevented the terrorists from \ncompleting their murderous mission. We also remember the extraordinary \ncourage of the firefighters, police officers, and other rescue workers \nat the sites of the attacks, and millions of our fellow citizens who \nreached out to help the families of the victims.\n  We remember as well the extraordinary performance of the air traffic \ncontrollers, who took on the incredible challenge of protecting the \nwhole aviation network and ensuring the safety of the public on that \ntragic day and in the days that followed. Their professionalism and \npatriotism inspired us all.\n  So why in the world is the administration now attempting to undermine \nthose brave citizens? We must defend them instead, because the air \ntraffic controllers are defending us and defending the safety of the \nAmerican flying public.\n  Over and over again we see the problems in the administration's \nprivatization policy throughout the Federal Government. We have been \nfighting other battles to correct those policies and make them fair for \nFederal employees.\n  But we must be especially careful with these policies when they \naffect homeland security. We all know what a disaster it was when \nprivate companies screened bags at our airports. Now, Federal workers \nare doing the job better, and Americans are feeling safer.\n  Both the House and the Senate specifically voted to protect air \ntraffic controllers and keep these vital safety jobs as part of the \nFederal workforce. Yet now, because of a shameful veto threat from the \nWhite House, the House and Senate Republican leadership have yielded to \nand agreed to a privatization of these jobs. That change is \nunacceptable.\n  In fact, the Senate bill contained even stronger protections than the \nHouse bill. The Senate voted 56 to 41 to approve Senator Lautenberg's \namendment to protect not just air traffic controllers, but also systems \nspecialists and flight service station controllers from privatization. \nI commend my colleague from New Jersey for his continued leadership in \nthis important battle.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill now before us defies the will of the \nmajority in both the House and the Senate. It undermines the safety of \nour aviation system, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \ncloture.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the U.S. air traffic control system works \nmiraculously well. It is a public system that is admired around the \nworld. American air traffic controllers safely and efficiently guide 9 \nmillion flights a year with more than 600 million passengers.\n  When it comes to the safety of air travel, the American people demand \nperfection, and rightfully so. That is why the Federal Aviation \nAdministration has set a goal of reducing air traffic fatalities to \nnear zero. This challenge has become increasingly complex as flights \nhave increased to meet the growing needs of the traveling public. There \nisn't much room for error.\n  Unfortunately, the administration and House Republican leaders are \nbacking a plan that compromises passenger safety by privatizing the air \ntraffic control system. This flawed and misguided plan is contained in \nthe conference report on this FAA bill. It is opposed by 71 percent of \nAmericans.\n  Earlier this summer, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives \nboth voted in their respective FAA bills to maintain air traffic \ncontrol as a public function and prevent it from being privatized. That \nis the will of Congress.\n  Instead of affirming that the safety of air travelers is the \nresponsibility of the United States Government, members of the \nconference committee, at the urging of the administration, passed an \ninitial conference report that allowed for immediate privatization of \n69 air traffic control towers.\n  This brazen attempt at privatization was met with such opposition \nthat the House was forced to recommit the bill to conference. However, \nonce recommitted, the House simply stripped language in the conference \nreport dealing with privatization. No conference committee meetings \nwere held. The bill was passed along party lines. And our Republican \nfriends say this is the status quo.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. The House and Senate passed \nlanguage to prohibit privatization in response to an Executive order by \nthe administration to privatize the air traffic control system.\n  Put simply, the conference report allows the FAA to privatize any air \ntraffic control functions at its whim. This policy creates a puzzling \ncontradiction. Our Government has declared that your luggage is \nimportant enough to be screened by trained Federal workers, but once \nyou are up in the sky, with your life in the balance, the \nadministration apparently feels that your safety isn't as important as \nyour suitcase.\n\n  Any meaningful legislation must follow the mandate of the Senate and \nHouse bills and refrain from trying to privatize our air traffic \ncontrol system.\n  If the House attempts to force privatization of our Nation's air \ntraffic control system, it will only delay funding of essential airport \ninfrastructure and security programs. That would be irresponsible and \neven reckless.\n  We urge our colleagues to work with us to craft a revised FAA bill \nthat honors the overwhelming sentiment in Congress against \nprivatization of air traffic control operations and maintenance, that \nprotects the U.S. aviation industry from unfair foreign competition and \nmaintains Federal support of the essential air service, and a bill that \nensures that our Nation's flight attendants receive mandatory \nantiterrorism training.\n\n[[Page S14948]]\n\n  Let's move forward by passing a straight 6-month extension of all FAA \nprograms that will provide the necessary time to work through these \nissues. An extension bill, introduced by Senators Rockefeller, \nLautenberg, and Daschle, will provide a vehicle for the Congress to get \nthe process and substance of the FAA bill right.\n  I am confident that both Chambers of Congress will reassert their \nintent to block privatization, protect the integrity of essential air \nservice, continue the ban on cabotage, and train flight attendants as \nmandated under existing legislation.\n  Americans entrust their lives every day to our air traffic \ncontrollers. Now they are trusting us to protect their safety.\n\n\n                           faa privatization\n\n  Mr. REID. Our friends of the other side of the aisle suggest that \nPresident Bush has no plans to privatize the air traffic control \nsystem. They point out that the President hasn't privatized any towers \nin the past 3 years. Then why is the President threatening to veto this \nbill if it includes language to prohibit privatization? Why is the \nPresident delaying the funding for essential airport construction \nprojects? Does this make any sense to the Senator?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Unfortunately, certain Senate conferees to the FAA \nbill decided to remove all barriers to privatizing our national air \ntraffic control system. But both the Senate and the House voted to put \nthese barriers in the bill as a response to President Bush's actions, \nincluding the issuance of an Executive order, to move towards \nprivatizing air traffic control. And the President feels so strongly \nabout privatizing that he has forced conference leaders not to take any \nactions in the bill. And this is not agreeable to those of us concerned \nabout the safety impacts of the President's plan. To my dismay, this \nideological crusade by the White House has held up passage of the \nlegislation for over 3 months, and I am disappointed that some of my \ncolleagues are willing to sacrifice safety for this zeal to privatize.\n  Mr. REID. Our colleagues also point out that President Clinton \nprivatized 116 of the current 219 contract towers. Isn't it \ninconsistent for Democrats to argue privatization when it was a common \npractice under the Clinton administration?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Between 1994 and 2000, the FAA did contract out 130 \nsmall FAA towers. These were ``level I towers''--generally with less \nthan 25 operations per hour and operating under ``visual flight \nrules''--that is, without radar equipment. I also note that the current \nlist of 219 towers constitutes a small fraction of overall air traffic \nin the United States. While exploring ways to modernize air traffic \ncontrol equipment for the entire national system, the Clinton \nadministration proposed a Federal corporation to take over air traffic \noperations. While I initially was willing to consider this proposal, it \nwas rapidly determined to be a poor idea, and the President eventually \nmade the determination that air traffic control is an inherently \ngovernmental function. So during reauthorization of the FAA bill in \n1996 and 2000, we agreed to FAA management reforms, to give FAA the \nflexibility it needs to act as a better manager, not privatization. In \nthe end, the President and the Congress agreed that air traffic control \nis an inherently governmental function, and recognized that it was not \nwise to pursue privatization. Unfortunately, the Bush administration \nreversed the Clinton administration's executive order last year, \nreclassifying air traffic control functions so that privatization could \nproceed. And this was after September 11. In summary, the Clinton \nadministration did not support privatization, while the Bush \nadministration does support privatization.\n  Mr. REID. You mentioned that the Bush administration reversed the \nExecutive order issued by the Clinton administration establishing air \ntraffic control as an inherently governmental function. Did the Bush \nadministration have second thoughts about that after September 11, \n2001?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I say to Senator Reid, this may be hard to believe, \nbut the Bush administration issued their Executive order after \nSeptember 11. I find that especially troubling in light of the \nincredible and even heroic performance by the Federal employees of our \nNation's air traffic control system on September 11. The security of \nthe Nation's airlines became so important that we felt the need to \nfederalize baggage screening. But somehow, this administration still \nwants to privatize the air traffic control system.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about several \nprovisions found in the FAA reauthorization conference report. Before \nthe Senate passed S. 824, the FAA reauthorization bill, we expressly \nprohibited additional privatization of air traffic controllers. We also \neliminated a proposed cost-sharing requirement for local communities \nthat participate in the essential air service program. This requirement \nwould have placed an insurmountable burden on many remote communities \nstruggling to maintain commercial air service.\n  Our colleagues in the House responded similarly to these issues. When \nthe Senate and House bills went to conference, neither Chamber's \nlegislation permitted privatization of air traffic controllers, nor did \neither bill contain an essential air service cost-share requirement.\n  Therefore, I was surprised and disappointed to learn that the final \nconference report allows both.\n  I am also very concerned about the provisions in this bill affecting \nthe National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA. While not actually an \namendment to NEPA, these provisions are more likely to lead to extended \nconflict, litigation and confusion--far from a streamlined result. In \naddition, the Department of Transportation has neither the authority \nnor the expertise to determine the environmental impact of various \nalternatives to a project under environmental statutes such as the \nClean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. Other Federal entities, \nsuch as the Army Corps of Engineers or the Fish and Wildlife Service \nwho have specific statutory mandates, must evaluate alternatives under \nFederal law when their jurisdiction is invoked.\n  For example, regulations governing wetlands permits under section 404 \nof the Clean Water Act require the Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate \nseveral factors such as ``fish and wildlife values,'' ``water \nquality,'' ``conservation,'' and ``aesthetics'' in determining whether \na permit is in the public's interest. The Clean Water Act imposes \nspecific substantive standards on the Corps' decision and prohibits the \nCorps from issuing a permit to fill a wetland if there is a less \ndamaging practicable alternative. Under current law, the Corps has the \nauthority to supplement NEPA documents with additional information in \norder to fulfill its legal responsibility. The legal obligations of \nthese other agencies have not been repealed by the language in this \nbill, nor should they be.\n  There is ample authority contained in the existing NEPA statute and \nregulations for coordination among Federal agencies in performing \nrequired environmental reviews. The confusing statutory directions \ncontained in this bill are both unnecessary and counterproductive if \nthe desired result is efficient project completion.\n  Given its current content, I cannot support this conference report.\n  Just last year, Congress determined that, for security reasons, \nairport passenger screeners should be Federal employees. Why would we \ntreat air traffic controllers differently? They play an equally \nimportant role in ensuring the safety of our air travelers.\n  Our air traffic control network safely guides more than 700 million \npassengers a year. In addition, the ATC network provides a crucial \nnational security service by coordinating the national air space for \nmilitary aircraft as well as for commercial aircraft. As we saw \nimmediately following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the \nATC system must be prepared to respond quickly and efficiently in \nemergency situations.\n  In order to best ensure the safety of air travel in this country, our \nair traffic control network must remain a Federal responsibility. This \nbill permits privatization of air traffic control towers around the \ncountry.\n  I am also very concerned that the essential air service cost-share \nlanguage found its way back into this legislation. The EAS program was \ncreated in 1978, when Congress passed the Airline Deregulation Act, \nreflecting Congress's\n\n[[Page S14949]]\n\nbelief that deregulation should not result in the elimination of \nairport service in rural communities. In my home State of Vermont, the \nRutland State Airport depends on this program to maintain commercial \nservice in and out of the Rutland region.\n  For many cash-strapped EAS communities, the local match required by \nthe cost-share provision in this bill is insurmountable. Mandatory \ncost-shares will mean the end of commercial air service in many \neconomically depressed rural areas. If we adopt this provision, we have \nessentially defeated the goal of the EAS program.\n  Both the House and the Senate acted on these two provisions earlier \nthis year. The FAA conference report reverses the positions that a \nmajority of our Members agreed to on the House and Senate floors. \nRather than endorse the flaws found in this legislation, I urge my \ncolleagues to support S. 1618, Senator Rockefeller's short-term \nextension of the Federal Aviation Administration programs. This bill \nprovides the additional time we need to work out a long-term \nreauthorization package that represents the positions of a majority of \nMembers of both Houses of Congress.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like the record to reflect \nmy opposition to the Vision 100--Century of Flight conference report. \nThe final bill does not include any prohibition against privatizing the \nair traffic control system, an issue that has serious safety and \nnational security implications. I voted in favor of the Lautenberg \namendment in June and will oppose ending debate today because passage \nof this bill without language protecting ATC from privatization will \nmake our aviation system less secure and more vulnerable to terrorist \nattacks.\n  After the September 11 attacks it was obvious that the Federal \nGovernment needed to assume a greater role in aviation security. \nAlthough we passed legislation that made baggage and passenger \nscreening a federal responsibility--legislation that the administration \nsupported--the President signed an executive order that designated air \ntraffic control as a ``commercially competitive'' enterprise. This is a \nstrange dichotomy. The President seems to believe that, in the realm of \naviation security, airport security and air traffic control are \nmutually exclusive. I fail to see how these issues are mutually \nexclusive and am disturbed at the administration's efforts to undermine \nthe protections that were originally included in both the House and \nSenate bills.\n  Mr. President, if this bill passes without a prohibition on \nprivatization, the executive order signed by the President will stand \nand he will be able to contract out the Nation's ATC to the lowest \nbidder. I cannot imagine a worse policy for our Nation. This work \nshould only be performed by well trained and experienced Federal \nworkers. These men and women perform a valuable service to their \ncountry and their jobs should not be shipped out to a private entity. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I oppose the motion to close debate on \nthe FAA reauthorization bill.\n  While I strongly support the bill's authorized funding for \ninfrastructure and operations for our Nation's aviation system, I am \ntroubled that this bill still gives the Administration too much leeway \nto privatize our Nation's air traffic control, ATC, system.\n  We know this administration is eager to privatize government jobs \neven when it costs more money and does not improve productivity. We \nalso know that air traffic control involves special considerations like \nsafety, cost and flight delays.\n  That's why both the House and Senate passed amendments to the FAA \nbill to explicitly limit the administration's ability to privatize FAA-\ncontrolled towers. I voted for the Lautenberg Amendment in June, and it \npassed the Senate 56-41.\n  You would have thought that the White House would recognize that it \nwas on the wrong side of this bipartisan issue. But instead of \naccepting this reality, the White House pressured the members of the \nconference committee to remove the limiting language during the first \nconference. Regrettably, a majority on the conference committee \nfollowed the White House's request.\n  In its place, the conferees added new language that goes even further \nin supporting privatization. That new language would allow 69 of \ncurrent FAA controlled towers to be eligible for privatization. Eleven \nof those towers are among the 50 busiest in the nation, including \nBoeing Field in Seattle.\n  The conferees then presented that proposal, only to realize that it \nfaced strong opposition in both Houses of Congress.\n  The conferees were forced to take their first report back for further \ndeliberation. Their second conference report, which is before us today, \ndropped the expanded privatization provision. However, it did not \nreinstate the initial language that both chambers supported, which \nwould explicitly limit the administration's ability to privatize our \nair traffic control system.\n  Given the administration's disregard for congressional intent, I \nbelieve that this limiting language is critical.\n  As ranking Member of the Transportation, Treasury and General \nGovernment Appropriations Subcommittee, I have supported some \nprivatization of ATC, but only at low-traffic airports that would \notherwise not have a tower.\n  This is not just a process or philosophical issue but raises \nquestions about benefits, safety and cost. The countries that have \nprivatized their ATC systems--Canada, Australia and the U.K.--have seen \nincreased flight delays and--in the case of Great Britain--an increase \nin ``near misses'' that could result in accidents. In addition, this \nprivate control requires more resources than government-run systems.\n  It is important to note that the Lautenberg amendment would have \nallowed the government to continue to provide private air traffic \ncontrol to smaller airports.\n  Senator Rockefeller has offered a simple 6-month extension of AIR-21, \nwhich will allow us to reexamine this issue and put together a package \nthat reflects the will of Congress and the people.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this conference report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I discuss why I am voting against cloture \non the FAA Reauthorization bill.\n  This bill includes some very good provisions, including funding for \nour Nation's airports and two provisions that I was able to include in \nthis bill--certification of flight attendant anti-terrorism training \nand allowing trained cargo pilots to carry guns in the cockpit.\n  However, these good provisions do not make up for the threat to the \nsafety of air travel that this bill will cause.\n  On June 12, 2003, Senator Lautenberg's amendment to the FAA bill \npassed 56 to 41. His amendment, which I supported, would have prevented \nthe Administration from privatizing the U.S. air traffic control \nsystem. The House bill had a similar provision.\n  However, during the conference process the provisions in both bills \nwere ignored. This summer, Republican conference leaders filed a \nconference report that specifically sanctioned privatization at up to \n69 airports, some of which are the busiest in the country in terms of \nflight operations. For instance, Van Nuys airport in California is the \neighth busiest airport in the country in terms of flight operations.\n  When that clearly did not have the support of the Congress, the \nconference report was rewritten, and the privatization language was \ndropped. But, the language prohibiting privatization was not \nreinserted, and the administration has indicated it intends to go \nforward.\n  Privatizing the controllers is a bad idea. The system is not broken, \nand we should not try to ``fix'' it. Our air traffic controllers did a \nvaliant job after the terrorist attacks on September 11 by closing air \nspace and by landing all of the planes safely. We should not mess with \nsuccess.\n  Safety must be a top priority in air travel. Privatization puts that \nsafety at risk.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today the Federal Aviation \nAdministration reauthorization conference report comes before the full \nSenate. I plan to vote against cloture on the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 2115 because it would permit the contracting out of \ncertain air traffic controller positions currently filled by Federal \nGovernment employees.\n\n[[Page S14950]]\n\n  I do not support efforts to contract out air traffic controller \npositions because these positions are vital to our national security. I \nregret that the FAA conference report does not include language passed \nby both the Senate and the House--which I supported--that would have \nprohibited the administration from contracting out these important \npositions.\n  I support the funding for airports and airline industries in our \ncountry that this bill contains and it is not my intention to slow down \nfunding for airports or airlines. However, the safety of Americans must \noutweigh the possibility of airlines and airports being temporarily \ninconvenienced.\n  Supporters of this legislation will argue that airport construction \nprojects will be delayed if we do not pass this bill soon. However, how \ncan the lives of Americans be compared to the value of construction \nprojects? Airport projects are certainly important, but the lives of \nAmericans are worth a slight delay in the passage of this bill.\n  Safety is one of the most important elements of this bill for me and \nfor Wisconsin residents. I have been contacted by a number of \nconstituents from my home State of Wisconsin who stated their \nopposition to the contracting out of air traffic controller positions. \nI share their concerns and I am not prepared to vote for cloture on a \nbill that does not contain adequate safeguards to ensure passenger \nsafety.\n  The contracting out of air traffic controller positions would be a \nmajor mistake with potentially life-threatening consequences. In recent \nyears, other countries have attempted to privatize their air traffic \ncontrol systems only to encounter major problems, with increases in \n``near-misses'' of airplanes or actual airplane crashes. Furthermore, \nin attempting to privatize their air traffic control systems, other \ncountries have experienced increased delays and higher costs and fees \nfor passengers. With our economy in its current condition, higher costs \nand fees are the last thing that consumers want or deserve.\n  In Canada, where air traffic control privatization was established in \n1998, the Canadian Transportation Safety Board found that under-\nstaffing at some towers has been a major concern and may have \ncontributed to near mid-air collisions. According to the London Daily \nTelegraph in Great Britain, flight delays caused by air traffic control \nincreased by 20 percent since the system there was outsourced. More \nimportantly, the UK Airport Board found that ``near miss'' plane crash \nincidents had risen to their highest levels in a decade. We cannot and \nmust not take that risk here in the United States.\n  Those supporting this bill as it presently stands argue that the \nlegislation needs to be passed immediately and should not be held up \nbecause of the privatization debate. The safety of Americans is no \nminor issue. The bill as it currently stands puts many American lives \nat risk, as demonstrated by the increased danger of air collisions that \nwe have seen in other countries.\n  This conference report also fails to address an important issue \nregarding flight attendants. This issue is an important one following \nthe events of September 11, 2001. Since that tragic event in our \nNation's history, cockpit doors have been reinforced, some pilots have \nbeen trained and certified to carry firearms and marshals have been \nadded to some flights. Pilots have also been directed to remain in the \ncockpit during a highjacking, leaving flight attendants alone in the \ncabin with only minimal training on how to work with a marshal or \nrespond alone to such an event. The provision that was not included in \nthe legislation before us seeks to protect flight attendants by making \nit mandatory that the Transportation Security Administration issue \nminimum training standards for flight attendant self-defense training \nwithin one year.\n  The current legislation states that the Transportation Security \nAdministration ``may'' issue minimum training standards for flight \nattendant self-defense training. This is simply not enough to protect \nthe flight attendants or the flying public.\n  For the above reasons I regret that I cannot vote for cloture.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time is left on our side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 32 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. On the majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have listened, and if I were not \nexperienced I would be shocked at what is being said. Get over Alaska. \nWhat do you care about Alaska? I care about my family. I even care \nabout the other guy's family.\n  Why was FAA started in the first place?\n  June 30, 1956: TWA Flight 2 collided with United Flight 17 killing \n128 people. The record shows that one probable cause of the accident \nwas insufficiency of the en route traffic control advisory.\n  They can trivialize it on the other side all they want--smile and \nsmirk. But the fact is that Don Young was the smartest of them all. And \nwhy didn't we hear from the Republican side when the vote was taking \nplace in June? We had 11 Republicans vote with us. I did not hear the \ncry that: We are not going to be able to fund this. We are going to be \nable to fund it.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I proposed a compromise in S. 1618, which was \nan FAA temporary extension act. Let us get it all out there. But no, \nthe other side persists in getting this thing through by one hook or \nanother.\n  The fact is that by any sense of one's decency, don't throw FAA into \nthe same pot out of which we dug the baggage screeners. It is \nridiculous to have this kind of a debate.\n  Sure, we can prove Air Force One can land anyplace. We know the \nPresident lands it all over in fundraising, for goodness' sake. We see \nthat airplane going out there. But that is a different situation than \nthe one we are talking about when we have pilots who can occasionally \nmake mistakes even when aided by the guidance of the FAA controllers. \nThey know exactly what to do with the weather, they know what wind \nsheer looks like, and they know all of the conditions. And I am not the \npilot. Senator McCain is the pilot in this room.\n  The fact is it is safety; that is what I am concerned about. I am not \ninterested in protecting anybody's turf except the families who fly \nevery day across this country and the people who want to know they are \ngoing to get there in a timely and safe fashion. With the scares we \nsuddenly see coming out, and shoulder-fired missiles, and here--oh, no; \nwe don't have to talk about safety; let us talk about process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield whatever time remains to Senator \nMcCain who will wrap up. Any time he doesn't use I would like to \nretain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I will be brief.\n  The letter says:\n\n       Let me be absolutely clear. The administration has no plans \n     to privatize the Nation's air traffic control system.\n\n  I would resist and join in efforts to prevent that.\n  It is very interesting: Baggage screeners? Could the Senator from New \nJersey be talking about TSA talking about baggage screeners? That is an \ninteresting depiction. They are required to be make sure there is \nsecurity in our airports, I inform my colleague.\n  We are talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs here. We are \ntalking about safety. We are talking about improved security. We know \nwhat needs to be done to improve security at our airports. That is in \nthis bill. These come from the recommendations of the TSA and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. They are vital.\n  If the Senator from New Jersey is interested in safety, then he will \nsupport the passage of this bill because it enhances in a broad variety \nof ways the safety of the airports in America. It is vital we implement \nthese safety procedures.\n  If they were not interested, Vice President Gore's National \nPerformance Review in 1994, recommendation No. 9 for Department of \nTransportation, recommended converting 99 FAA staff control towers to \ncontract operations. I wonder if the Vice President had that in mind at \nthe time this process began.\n  The important point is we tried very hard to come to some agreement. \nI\n\n[[Page S14951]]\n\ndon't think this has been a good process, but we made offer after \noffer. We have pressured the administration to come up with other \noffers. But the reality we were faced with was the threat of a \nPresidential veto. So we tried to reach accommodation. Obviously, that \nhas not been enough.\n  But I assure my colleagues that if we don't pass this legislation, we \nwill be back to the status quo, and the status quo--because we are not \ngoing to let this authorization die--will be continued privatization of \ntowers in America, a program which has been a successful experiment.\n  I thank Senator Rockefeller for his hard work on this issue. I \nappreciate it. Especially, I thank Senator Lott for the many hours he \nput in trying to get this very important legislation passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which Senator \nMcCain referred a moment ago from administrator Marion C. Blakely be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation \n           Administration,\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2003.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I have received your November 13, 2003, \n     letter regarding the issue of contracting our functions \n     performed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees. \n     It is unfortunate that the recent debate on FAA's pending \n     reauthorization bill, Vision 100--The Century of Aviation \n     Reauthorization Act has led some to confuse maintaining the \n     status quo of the FAA's Contract Tower Program with \n     privatizing our nation's air traffic control system. Let me \n     be absolutely clear: the Administration has no plans to \n     privatize the nation's air traffic control system.\n       I welcome and respect the Committee's duty to perform \n     oversight of the FAA. I look forward to participating in the \n     hearings you described, as there are many misconceptions as \n     to the FAA's plans with respect to competitive sourcing that \n     I would like to correct. In the meantime, if the legislation \n     is enacted in its current form, you have my commitment that \n     during the current fiscal year the FAA will not contract out \n     any air traffic separation and control function currently \n     performed by the FAA. Further, during that period, the FAA \n     will not convert any Visual Flight Rule (VFR) tower to a \n     contract tower.\n       I look forward to working with the Committee on the \n     important challenges facing the Federal Aviation \n     Administration. The Conference Report contains many \n     provisions which will provide us with important tools to \n     enhance aviation safety, security, and capacity. I hope that \n     my assurances to the Committee will allow us to move forward \n     on this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marion C. Blakey,\n                                                    Administrator.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me read from part of that letter. She acknowledges the \nletter the bipartisan group sent her last week, dated November 13, \nregarding contracting out functions performed by the Federal Aviation \nAdministration employees.\n\n       It is unfortunate that the recent debate on FAA's pending \n     reauthorization bill, Vision 100--the Century of Aviation \n     Reauthorization Act has led to some confusing maintaining the \n     status quo of FAA's Contract Tower Program with privatizing \n     our nation's air traffic control system. Let me be absolutely \n     clear: The Administration has no plans to privatize the \n     nation's air traffic control system.\n       I welcome and respect the Committee's duty to perform \n     oversight of the FAA. I look forward to participating in the \n     hearings you describe, as there are many misconceptions as to \n     the FAA's plans with respect to competitive sourcing that I \n     would like to correct. In the meantime, if the legislation is \n     enacted in its current form, you have my commitment that \n     during the current fiscal year the FAA will not contract out \n     any air traffic separation and control function currently \n     performed by the FAA. Further, during that period, the FAA \n     will not convert any Visual Flight Rule (VFR) tower to a \n     contract tower.\n\n  What more can you ask? This is a letter from the Administrator, \nresponding to our letter assuring us of those things we have been \nasking. They are not going to contract the air traffic control system, \nand they are not going to convert the visual flight rule tower to a \ncontract tower.\n  I urge my colleagues, for the safety of the American people, for the \nimportance of jobs in the economy, to vote for cloture. Let's pass this \nlegislation and move it to the President for his signature.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be a \nperiod for morning business for up to 65 minutes, with the time divided \nas follows:\n  Senators Dorgan and Kyl be recognized first in this order for up to 1 \nminute each; the next 20 minutes be divided with the Democratic side in \ncontrol of the first 5 minutes, to be followed by 5 minutes under the \ncontrol of the Republican side, to be followed by an additional 5 \nminutes for the Republican side, with the final 5 minutes under \nDemocratic control.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the next period of time be \ndivided, as follows:\n  Each side be permitted to ask up to four questions for up to 1 minute \neach in an alternating fashion, to be followed by a response of up to 2 \nminutes to be controlled by the other side of the aisle; to be followed \nby an additional minute by the first side, with the Republicans to ask \nthe first question.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the next 8 minutes be allotted \nin 2-minute segments alternating with the Democrats first and the \nRepublicans concluding; further, that Senator Dorgan then be recognized \nto speak for up to 1 minute, to be followed by Senator Kyl for the \nfinal minute; that upon the yielding of the floor, any debate time \nremaining during that period of controlled time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me announce to my colleagues that this is \nthe second in a series of scheduled debates between the Republican and \nDemocratic sides of the Senate on subjects of importance to the \nAmerican people to be conducted in actual debate format. Rather than \nthe usual situation where we speak to an empty Chamber or talk across \neach other, we have actually set up a debate in which two Republicans \nand two Democrats will tackle a subject of interest today and respond \nto each other and engage in debate the way it was originally intended \nby our Founders and by the people who set up the rules of the Senate.\n  All of the speakers will go through the Chair, but they will be \naddressing this subject in prepared remarks and then in rebuttal and \nresponse to each other. Senator Dorgan and I, who chair our respective \npolicy committees, hope we can thus establish a precedent in this body \nthat at least once a month we will pick a topic and engage in debates \nthe way it was intended to be. We hope both our colleagues and the \nAmerican people will be edified by this process, not to mention the \nother Senators in the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, before we begin, let me say to my \ncolleague from Arizona that I think this is a good idea. We will engage \nnow for the second time today in a debate about a specific topic. We \nwill do it for 1 hour talking about something that is very important to \nthe country. In this circumstance, it is going to be jobs and economic \npolicies that create jobs.\n  This Senate is considered the greatest deliberative body in the world \nand, from time to time, people might tune in and wonder whether that \ndescription best suits the Senate these days. I think it does, however.\n  There are some extraordinary men and women who serve in this body, \nvery capable of debating the issues. So Senator Kyl and myself, as \nchairmen of the respective policy committees, have decided to establish \nthis 1-hour debate on important issues. I am going to participate in \nthe debate on our side at this time, and I believe Senator Kyl will \nparticipate in a future debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I look forward to this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats now have 5 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14952-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14952-S14960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JOBS AND THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again I join Senator Dorgan and my \ncolleagues on the other side in saying how pleased we are to be here \nthis evening to continue this process of having legitimate debates on \nthe Senate floor regarding topics of importance to the American people.\n  Tonight we will be talking about jobs and the economy. In my 5-minute \nopening statement, I am prepared to show that Democratic economic \npolicies are superior to Republican economic policies as it benefits \nthe American public.\n  How are Democratic policies better? Simply because we create more and \nbetter jobs.\n  We create a better standard of living and quality of life for the \nmajority of Americans who are working. We do this through worker and \nconsumer protections, equal opportunity for women and minorities with \nbasic measures such as the Family and Medical Leave Act, all historic \nsteps led by Democrats, with Republicans either trailing or opposing \noutright.\n  Now, another example: The last Democratic administration and our \neconomic plan, embodied in the 1993 budget, set us on a course of \nadding 6.4 million jobs in just 2 years. We eroded the annual deficits \nand eventually created the actual largest projected Federal budget \nsurpluses in history. Every Republican in the Congress voted against \nthat budget in 1993, with dire warnings about its effect.\n  We invested in people and family. We balanced the budget and we set \nthe conditions for the most successful economic recovery and expansion \never in the history of the United States. Our friends on the other side \ncannot match our record on jobs, and I point to this chart I have. If \nwe look at the average monthly change in jobs, Democratic versus \nRepublican Presidents, jobs gained or lost per month, going clear back \nto Lyndon Johnson, we can see that under Johnson, Carter, and Clinton, \nwe had tremendous job growth. Under Nixon, Reagan, Ford, and Bush 1, we \nhad job growth but not as much as under Democrats.\n  If we look to the far right, we will see some devastating things that \nhave happened since this President took office, not a job growth but an \nactual job loss, my point being that under Democrats we build better \njobs and more jobs.\n  In 3 years, this administration has lost 3 million private sector \njobs and their budget and tax policies have contributed to the largest \nand actual budget deficits in the history of the country.\n  The last quarter showed some improvement in our economy, and that is \ngood, but it is not nearly enough. This administration will be the \nfirst since Herbert Hoover's to preside over a net loss of jobs over a \n4-year period. We need to be creating about 150,000 jobs a month just \nto stay even. We are not doing that today. We are not even treading \nwater in terms of job creation.\n  If my colleagues think the economy is tough now, look at the economic \nfuture the Republicans are creating. This administration turned a \nprojected 10-year, $5.7 trillion surplus into a $4 trillion deficit \nover the coming 10 years. That debt imperils Social Security and \nMedicare, which might not bother some of my friends on that side who \nwould like to privatize Social Security or Medicare or end it as we \nknow it. That debt hurts our economy, it crowds our private sector \ninvestments we need for economic growth. It makes it difficult for us \nto make the investments in education, health, schools, roads, and our \ninfrastructure.\n  For the long term, the Federal Government will have to borrow $400 \nbillion a year, squeezing out private sector investment we need for a \ngrowing economy. The law of supply and demand which cannot be repealed \nmeans that borrowing will make investment dollars scarce and interest \nrates higher. Higher interest rates in the future will limit growth and \nlimit jobs.\n  Now, instead of massive tax cuts that benefit the wealthiest, the \nanswer should have been our approach: Fiscal responsibility, tax cuts \ntargeted to low- and middle-income working families, and good job-\ncreating, direct investments such as building roads and\n\n[[Page S14953]]\n\nschools, our economic infrastructure. That should be the path we should \nbe on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans are recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for joining with us \nin this debate on the most important issue we have facing us in the \nSenate and in our country. That is: How can we work to make sure we \nhave the best policies for more investment and more job creation?\n  The reality is, right now things are getting better. They need to get \nbetter, though, than they are currently. Nevertheless, the facts are \nclear. Job growth is up by 126,000 in October. When my colleagues talk \nabout the last 20 years, last month we had an annual growth rate of 7.2 \npercent. That is the best in 20 years.\n\n  The Republicans' point of view, I would say to my colleagues, is that \nwe want to make sure every American, regardless of their race, their \ngender, their ethnicity, or their religious beliefs, has the \nopportunity to compete and succeed. That means our tax policies have to \nbe conducive to investment. Regulations need to be based on sound \nscience, not political science.\n  We also need to make sure the people of our country, in our States, \nhave the capabilities and the knowledge to get the good jobs in the \nfuture. We also need to have security. When we see people in \ncommunities worried about crime or worried about terrorism, those are \nadverse impacts, on confidence and investment and therefore job \ncreation. We have seen the adverse impacts of 9/11, particularly in the \ntravel and tourism industry.\n  I know as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia what matters to \nbusinesses when they are looking to invest. They look at what is the \ncost of doing business, what is the tax rate, what is the cost of \nworkers compensation. Ours are low in Virginia because we keep lawyers \nout of workers compensation. We get the money to the person who is \ninjured so he or she can get back to work. Unemployment insurance taxes \nmatter. The fact that we have a right to work law, which gives \nindividuals the right, if they so desire, not to join a union as a \ncondition of work, that helps attract business. Health insurance \nmatters as well.\n  In a variety of areas, we have found Virginia ended up with much more \njob growth, more investment. It was called the Silicon Dominion because \nof the investment, because of having taxes competitively low, prompt \npermitting, reasonable regulations, and also investment in security and \nalso in the capabilities of our students for high academic standards.\n  The Democrats talk about all of these Presidents. Interesting. \nRichard Nixon was elected after President Johnson. If one wants to call \nJimmy Carter their second best President, with the malaise and the high \ninterest rates, the high unemployment, and the high inflation. People \nput in Ronald Reagan to help revive this economy and make us stronger \nas well as, of course, keep our peace through strength.\n  I find it interesting my good friend from Iowa talks about, oh, the \nRepublicans somehow want to imperil Social Security and gets off on \nthese tangents on privatization. Of course the Democrats care about \nSocial Security because in 1993 they not only taxed all families and \nall small businesses and every taxpayer, they even taxed Social \nSecurity benefits. When given the opportunity most recently on a \nmeasure introduced by Senator Bunning of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, \nvirtually every Democrat voted against that effort to repeal the tax on \nSocial Security benefits.\n  The fact is, we are making good progress. We need to keep moving \nforward. We have ideas, as Republicans, in a variety of ways that we \ncan make sure the American economy can compete internationally, can \nhelp create more jobs and greater opportunity. Indeed, we want to make \nhealth care costs more affordable and predictable, reduce the burden of \nlawsuits on our economy, whether it is asbestos reform or class action \nreform, make sure we have an affordable, reliable energy supply, \nstreamline regulations, open new markets for American products, and \nalso make sure there is confidence in investment in this country by \nmaking sure the tax reductions are permanent.\n  I will close with the words of Mr. Jefferson who said that the \nGovernment should restrain men from injuring one another but otherwise \nleave them free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and \nimprovement and shall not take from the mouths of labor the bread they \nhave earned.\n  That remains the sum of good government today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A Democrat is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am not someone who believes Democrats \nare all right and the Republicans are all wrong. I believe both \npolitical parties contribute to this process.\n  We do not have to debate theory today about jobs. Let's just debate \nwhat we know. Here is what we know. In the 8 years under the Presidency \nof President Clinton, 237,000 jobs a month were created. Since \nPresident Bush took over, we have lost 70,000 jobs a month. There were \n22.7 million jobs created during the 8 years of the Clinton \nadministration; since President Bush took office, 2.3 million jobs \nlost. On June 7, 2002, the White House said: The tax cut will help \ncreate 800,000 new jobs by the end of 2002. In fact, we lost 1.9 \nmillion jobs during that period.\n  Finally, take a look at the red line, and my colleagues will see \nwhere these jobs have gone, and my colleagues will see the improvement \nabout which my colleague just talked. They said, gosh, things are \nturning around. Here is the improvement; right here. All of us want \ngood jobs in this country. They come with three things in my judgment: \nFiscal policy that is responsible--no, not $500 billion deficits, which \nthis administration is proposing and running up but fiscal policy that \nis responsible, trade policies that are fair to this country, to its \nbusinesses and workers, and especially as a result of good policies in \nboth of those areas, confidence the American people would have in the \nfuture.\n\n  In 1993, we put a new economic plan in place by one vote in the \nHouse, one vote in the Senate, and we didn't get one vote for it on \nthat side of the aisle--not one, not even by accident. As a result: \n22.7 million jobs. On your side of the aisle they predicted \ncatastrophe--the economy is going to be in terrible trouble. We had the \nstrongest growth of any President, 22.7 million jobs.\n  Let me talk for just a moment about trade. We now have a trade \nambassador trying to negotiate trade agreements in every part of the \nworld. Let me talk just a moment about Huffy bicycles. Mr. President, \n850 people in Ohio lost their jobs. They used to put American flags on \nthe front of Huffy bicycles. They replaced that with a globe because \nthey now make them in China. Why? Because the folks in Ohio who make \nthem--who got fired, by the way--were making too much money, $11 an \nhour. So Huffy bicycles are now made in China for 33 cents an hour and \nsold at Wal-Mart, Target, and Sears. But they are not cheaper because \nthey pay 33 cents an hour; it is just that Americans lost their jobs. \nOur trade policy is bankrupt, and we have a trade ambassador right now \ntrying to do three more free trade agreements, more of the same. If you \nwant good jobs in this country, then you have to stand up for American \ninterests. You have to have a fiscal policy that adds up. This \nadministration's doesn't. We are running the biggest deficits in \nhistory.\n  You have to have a trade policy that stands for this country's \ninterest, and this trade policy doesn't. We have the highest trade \ndeficits in history, and we have jobs moving wholesale overseas, where \nyou can hire 12-year-old kids, work them 12 hours a day, and pay them \n12 cents an hour, and that simply is not fair.\n  As a result of trade and fiscal policies that do not add up, the \nAmerican people do not have the confidence in the future they ought to \nhave. Confidence, after all, is what relates to the expansion side of \nthe business cycle. When people are confident about the future, they \nbuy a home; they take a trip; they buy a car; they do the things that \nexpand the economy. When they are not confident, they do exactly the \nopposite.\n  We need to get to work and fix this country's fiscal policy, fix this \ncountry's trade policies, and not just go back right over the same old \nrecipe about regulation and taxes and all those sorts of things. We \nknow what\n\n[[Page S14954]]\n\ncreates jobs. We don't have to describe theory here. We can talk about \nthe facts.\n  The facts are we put in place a plan in 1993 that created 22.7 \nmillion jobs because it said to the American people we are serious \nabout fiscal responsibility. It said to the American people we are \ngoing to stop this sea of red ink, and we did. It was a hard vote, but \nit was the right vote. I have always been proud of it.\n  Now we have a sea of red ink, the largest budget surplus in this \ncountry's history when President Bush took office has been turned to \nthe largest budget deficit in our history, and that is not going to \nbreed confidence for the American people about the future. We need to \nput this country's economic house in order, and we need to do it soon.\n  Fiscal policy and trade policy that represents the long-term \ninterests of the American people will represent expansion and jobs and \nopportunity once again for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition on the Republican side? \nThe Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, before I arrived here, I read many times \nabout the Senate as the ``world's greatest deliberative body.'' Over my \nfirst 10 months, I would say that I have not experienced as much \ndeliberating as I'd hoped. And I am glad my colleague, Senator Allen \nand I are doing this today--and that we are doing it deliberately.\n  The subjects of jobs and the economy are very personal and important \nto every American family. With the lone exception of maintaining \nnational security at home and abroad, we have no greater responsibility \nas a government. I note to my colleague from North Dakota that, by the \nway, consumer spending is up 6.6 percent in the last quarter. \nConfidence is up. It must tell you something about the way the American \npeople are thinking.\n  I want to begin by making a general observation. It seems to me that \nas a country we are awakening to a set of stark realities after what \nI'd call a decade of unrealism in the 1990s.\n  In the 1990s we came to believe that somehow we had conquered the \nbusiness cycle--that we had ended the age old rise and inevitable fall \nof economic activity.\n  In the 1990s we came to believe that we are safe behind our borders \nfrom the violence and chaos that is a daily reality of many in the \nworld because of the scourge of terrorism.\n  We have had a rude awakening. The speculative bubble of dot com \nindustries burst. Revenues generated by our highly progressive tax \nsystem fell rapidly at the national and State level. We were attacked, \nat the very symbol of our commercial strength. How can you talk about \njob loss without once mentioning 9/11? Every conceivable threat to the \nconfidence of the American people was leveled at us. But like the \nresidents of the Massachusetts countryside in 1775, when Paul Revere \nrode by, we were awakened, and we are fighting a difficult war to \nrestore our safety and our prosperity.\n  On Minnesota's Lake Superior; huge ore boats ply the world's largest \nbody of fresh water. It literally takes miles and hours to turn around \none of their massive boats. So it is with the American economy. The \nbigger the object, the longer it takes to turn. As we look at the \nAmerican economy, we need to recognize a few critical facts.\n  First, the economic difficulty we are in began in 2000, the year \nbefore President Bush took office. In March 2000, the NASDAQ lost 44 \npercent of its value. In the year before the President took office, \neconomic growth in this country fell from 3.9 percent to .9 percent.\n  Second, we have not repealed the laws of economics. The aftermath of \na long expansion and a speculative economic bubble is recession, a slow \nrecovery and large Government deficits. Even it its peak, our \nunemployment rate is substantially below that of previous recessions. \nIn 1983 unemployment was over 10 percent and in 1992 it was almost 8 \npercent. And the difference between 6 percent and 8 percent or 10 \npercent represents millions of families back at work.\n  And third, the economy is now moving forward. The American economy \nhas been bent, but it did not break.\n  Historic growth in the GDP--a growth rate of 7.2 percent--is nothing \nto scoff at. Yet, my Democratic colleagues seem to be able to find \ngloom and doom even during the brightest days.\n  We've added 225,000 new jobs in the last 2 months. A jobless \nrecovery? I think not. Job growth is still a challenge, but a we have \nalways seen, employment gains are the lagging feature of recovery.\n  I have not been the White House as often as some of my colleagues. \nBut as far as I know there is not a brake pedal or a throttle for the \neconomy under the president's desk.\n  But the President has done good work with the tools at his disposal. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has lauded the 2001 tax cut, \nwhich the Treasury Department has reported saved some 1.5 million jobs. \nThe most recent tax cuts for both mom's and dad's and small businesses \nhave been key to the 7.2 percent growth in GDP in the last quarter.\n  More than a generation ago there was Nobel Prize winning economic \nresearch done at the University of Minnesota. It seems obvious to us \nnow, but the point of that research was that raw numbers and events are \nnot the only thing that moves the economy. An equal or greater affect \nis the way people perceive what is happening.\n  At this point, I am forced to point out there is a drag on the \neconomy from nine candidates for President constantly standing up and \nbad mouthing the economy. It seems they are living in that weird \npolitical world where good news is bad news and bad news is good news. \nI would like to remind these Democrats of something a hero of theirs \nand mine one said in a similar situation. ``We have nothing to fear,'' \nsaid FDR, ``but fear itself.'' Those who talk tough and breed fear and \ncynicism to get notice in a political environment bear some \nresponsibility for the fear they spread.\n  Tough times are not new to the American people. Each generation has \nits own new challenges. Ours is that we are asked to deal with \noverlapping threats to our national security and our economic security.\n  But almost all of the key economic indicators; job growth, business \ninvestment, consumer spending, have shown that we are making progress \non both fronts. We need to listen to the voices of hope and optimism at \nsuch times, or we can become our own enemy.\n  Today we face unparalleled challenges to our security--and concerns \nabout our economy.\n  We will only get through them if we say yes to the things Republicans \nare working on now, such as tax cuts, continuing our jobs agenda by \npassing an energy bill; stemming the costly litigation mentality, \nkeeping the lid on spending, and say no to those who would snatch \ndefeat from the jaw of victory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 1 minute to ask a \nquestion.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, contrary to specific evidence that shows \nthe economy is growing, Alan Greenspan's positive comment about the \n2001 tax cut, and most observers crediting the 2003 tax cut for \ncreating the recent 7.2 percent GDP figure, some of the leading \nDemocratic candidates for President, Dean and Gephardt, have said we \nshould repeal all the tax cuts, in effect raising taxes just as our \neconomy is beginning to grow. Senator Edwards has said that Governor \nDean misses the point. On that, I quote:\n\n       Unfortunately, instead of addressing the problem, he makes \n     it worse by raising taxes on the middle class and families \n     that work.\n\n  Senator Lieberman has said repealing all the Bush tax cuts, as Dean \nand Gephardt have proposed, would hurt the middle class. I wonder if my \ncolleagues will join me by rejecting the proposals by Dean and Gephardt \nto roll back the entire tax cut, which would raise the lowest tax \nbracket back up to 15 percent from 10 percent, reduce the child tax \ncredit from $1,000 to $500, and force 4 million working poor people to \npay taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes to respond from the \nDemocrat side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is an interesting question posed by my \ncolleague from Minnesota, and prior to him posing the question, he \ntalked\n\n[[Page S14955]]\n\nabout more tax cuts and a lid on spending. Frankly, he is proposing and \nhis party is proposing more defense spending, more homeland security \nspending, more spending in virtually every category, and then tax cuts \nin addition, which leaves us with very large deficits.\n  But he asked specifically about tax cuts, so let me describe the \ndifference in tax cuts relative to our party and their party. We \nbelieve in tax cuts and support tax cuts for working families. In fact, \nwe had a very significant tax cut plan that would have said to working \nfamilies in this country who bear a pretty significant tax, payroll tax \nand income tax, that we are going to give you a pretty good size tax \ncut. But the majority party said that is not what we want to do.\n  But the majority party said: That is not what we want to do. We want \nto say to the person who is making $1 million a year, you really need \nthe relief. We are going to give you a $93,000 tax cut because we \nbelieve the economy works better when you put something in at the top \nand somehow it trickles down. We happen to believe the percolate-up \napproach is what makes this economic engine of ours work. And we \nbelieve if you give working people something to work with, tax cuts \ntargeted to working people, we will have an economy that regains its \nfooting, provides economic growth, opportunity, and hope once again. \nThat is the way to engineer economic growth and new jobs and expansion \nof opportunity in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute for rebuttal on the \nRepublican side.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the comments of my colleague from North \nDakota indicate that they do reject the Dean-Gephardt proposal that \nwill roll back all the tax cuts.\n  Two observations: No. 1, spending. Goodness gracious, the Republican \nConference has rejected $1.3 trillion in additional spending proposals \nfrom my colleagues across the aisle since the beginning of January. \nThat is like the kid who kills his parents and throws himself on the \nmercy of the court and says: I need mercy. I am an orphan.\n  You are talking about spending and, in addition, talking about tax \ncuts. We always hear: Tax cuts for the rich, tax cuts for the rich. \nSeventy-nine percent of the tax cuts at the top bracket are small \nbusiness people. They are folks in Minnesota I deal with all of the \ntime who come to me and say: This makes a difference; this is important \nto us. Seventy-nine percent. We have to get away from the class warfare \nand recognize that we are growing jobs by helping small business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Democrats are recognized for 1 minute to ask a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Bush administration wants to eliminate \novertime pay for some 8 million Americans, including many policemen, \nfirefighters, and nurses. One big reason overtime pay was created in \n1938 was to create jobs by Franklin Roosevelt to give employers the \nincentive to hire new workers rather than paying time and a half to \ncurrent workers. By killing overtime for millions of workers, the \nadministration will also kill the incentive to create new jobs and hire \nnew workers.\n  At a time when we are struggling to create new jobs, why in the world \ndo so many Republicans want to give employers a new disincentive to \nbegin hiring again by taking away what we have had since 1938--overtime \npay protection for almost 8 million American workers? Why would we want \nto take that away and give employers more of an incentive to continue \nto hire people--or to work people longer in the day or the week without \npaying them any more money?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans are recognized for 2 minutes \nto respond.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, first, we can have a great debate about \novertime. I can tell you from talking to folks in Minnesota--I get \ncalls from the building trades and others--that the issue doesn't \naffect them.\n  The fact is what we are looking to do is make business more \nefficient. That is what it is about. We do not want to hurt workers. I \nthink it is about time we addressed the root causes. What is it that \nhelps business expand or not? I think that is what my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle at times just do not seem to get.\n  You talk to business people, and what do they tell you? Cut taxes, \ncut regulation, give them the opportunity. That is what is in the tax \ncut. Increasing depreciation, increasing expensing for small business, \nif we do those things, they will grow jobs.\n  There are a whole range of issues on which I hope we can find common \nground when it comes to protecting workers. I will work with you, but \nin the end, you have to have workers, and you can't have workers unless \nyou do those things that allow small business to grow. If you roll back \ntax cuts and roll back expanding accelerated depreciation, if you roll \nback the increased expensing, if you continue to short business and \nincrease regulation, in the end there will be no jobs for folks to work \novertime. That is what it is all about.\n  Let us address the root causes of things that grow jobs. That is what \nthis Republican agenda is doing. That is what the President's tax cuts \nare doing. Let us keep moving in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 1 minute for rebuttal.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I had some calls like that, too, from \nlabor groups and building trades on the overtime issue. I thought, \nwell, it doesn't affect you. With a union contract they get their \novertime pay. But check with their spouses. They will be told to stay \nanother 2 or 4 hours. Right now, sometimes in America almost 25 percent \nof a family's income comes from overtime pay. That is taking away \nfamily income. It is taking away time from ones family. And, it is \nreducing the need to hire additional workers. That is why we oppose the \nadministration's regulation to take away overtime pay protection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The \nRepublicans have 1 minute to pose a question.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I would like to pose a question to Mr. \nHarkin, the Senator from Iowa. This question gets into the issue we are \ntalking about, which is jobs.\n  Taxes cuts help create more jobs for small businesses, especially the \nmost recent tax cuts for accelerated depreciation. Regulations from the \nFederal Government also can reduce choice and cost jobs. For example, \nwe believe free people and families ought to be able to keep working. \nThe proposal would harm those choices and jobs.\n  For example, the proposal which has strong Democrat support would \nincrease the cost of purchasing pickup trucks, SUVs, and minivans. \nAmerica is dominant in the manufacturing of minivans, SUVs, and pickup \ntrucks. Many people are choosing to buy them for the safety of their \nfamilies.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa: How many SUV jobs would have been lost \nhad your side prevailed?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am trying to understand the question \nposed by my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. How many jobs would have been lost had your position \nprevailed?\n  Mr. HARKIN. On SUVs and pickup trucks?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I am talking about the CAFE standards.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I see.\n  First of all, as my friend from Virginia knows, I represent a rural \nState, as does my colleague from North Dakota. We have a particular use \nfor SUVs as pickup trucks and heavy vehicles in the country.\n  I happen to have a house out in the Senator's State, in Fairfax \nCounty. I drive back and forth to work 12 miles every day. There is \ntraffic congestion. I can't believe how many SUVs, pickup trucks, and \nbig trucks I see. I do not believe that we need to give high income \ndoctors a special $100,000 tax deduction if they buy an oversized SUV \nweighing more than what is the tax definition of a car so they can \ndrive around the suburbs. For legitimate business reasons, a farmer or \na rancher might need them out in the countryside for that kind of work, \nyou bet. They need that, but not the people who live in this city.\n  We are hemorrhaging debt and don't need to create that tax break.\n  CAFE standards: I have to say to my friend from Virginia, you can't \nhave\n\n[[Page S14956]]\n\nlong-term sustained economic growth in this country if you are \ndestroying the environment or if we continue to sharply increase our \noil supply. That makes us far more dependent on Mideast oil. There has \nto be a balance. We do have to have balance. But what I see from the \nother side is just to heck with any regulations, throw caution to the \nwind, pollute as much as you want and not to worry about the huge oil \nbills we are paying to the Mideast.\n  Our taxpayers today--the Senator's taxpayers and mine--are coughing \nup billions of dollars every year to clean up the toxic waste sites \nthat big corporations left and walked away from, and now our taxpayers \nhave to pay to clean it up. That is why it is important to have \nregulations to make sure that companies don't pollute and that they do \nthings in the best environmentally sound manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute is remaining for the Republicans.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I don't think SUVs, minivans, and pickup \ntrucks cause toxic waste sites. I will agree with one thing, and I \nthink most people in America will agree: The comments of the Senator \nabout all of these SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks driving around in \nnorthern Virginia are driving to nowhere; most people in America would \nprobably consider DC nowhere.\n  Cost in lives: 4,500 deaths would occur each year if they had \nincreased these standards. Vehicle costs would have gone up $2,500 for \ncars and $2,750 for SUVs and pickup trucks. The United Auto Workers \nsaid this proposal would have cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  We have a Ford assembly plant in Virginia. And I would hate to see a \n20-percent loss there and have to go to those 2,200 employees and say 1 \nout of every 10 of you is going to lose a job because the nannies up in \nWashington want to take away your choice to drive a vehicle that people \nwould want for their families and for their safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor the next question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the issue this evening is jobs. Let me ask \na question of my colleagues about the insidious and perverse incentives \nin our Tax Code that subsidize companies which move their United States \njobs overseas.\n  I mentioned Huffy Bicycles, gone from Ohio because they made $11 an \nhour. That is too much. They can produce bicycles where they pay 33 \ncents an hour. I am saying your party has included, and is at the \nmoment, coming from the Finance Committee, including more incentives to \nmove jobs overseas. I ask the question whether you are prepared to vote \nwith us to shut down the incentives in the Tax Code that tell people if \nyou move your United States jobs overseas and shut your U.S. plant \ndown, we will give you a benefit in the Tax Code. Where I come from, \nthat does not add up and it makes no sense. Are you prepared to join \nwith us and vote to end all of those subsidies now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I am not sure what the Senator from North Dakota is \nactually talking about. What we are talking about and what we are \ntrying to do is make sure the United States of America is a place that \nis conducive to do business. It is a shame and it is aggravating to all \nof us when a company goes overseas. It takes jobs away. One of the \nreasons they will move away is the cost of doing business. We are in \ncompetition with other countries. It is our view what we ought to be \ndoing is target assistance to businesses to invest in this country. \nThat is why we tripled the amount that could be expensed for small \nbusinesses, allowed also that if people buy new equipment, new \ntechnology, to be more productive and more competitive, they could \nwrite it off more quickly.\n  These initiatives, the depreciation, the writeoffs, have actually had \na beneficial impact on our economy, not only those businesses that are \ninvesting in this country, most of which are small businesses that \ncreate about 75 percent of the jobs, but those that fabricate or \nmanufacture whatever equipment or manufacturing efforts they have, \nwhoever is assembling it, whoever is transporting it, packaging it, or \nselling it. That is all beneficial.\n  Our point of view is we need to make sure America has tax laws and \nthe regulatory policies that allow America to compete so companies do \nnot have any incentives or need to move overseas. I will later bring up \na question which I think will be very helpful for getting those profits \nback into this country.\n  Republicans will join with Democrats saying we do not like to see \ncompanies go overseas, but we have positive, constructive solutions and \nideas to keep those jobs here, so companies do not feel they have to go \nto another country with less regulations and lower taxes for them to \nprovide for themselves and their shareholders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute for the minority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One of the issues of competition is wages. Companies now \nleave this country because they can find somewhere in the world where \nthey can hire a 12-year-old and pay them 12 cents an hour. Some think \nthat is global competition. That ignores that which we fought for, for \na century, about safe workplaces, environmental standards, child labor \nlaws, and fair compensation.\n  Let me also say there is a bill coming from the Finance Committee \nthat will give us a chance to vote on the question of whether we want \nto keep subsidizing the movement of jobs overseas. That bill will once \nagain say to companies, we will give you a break. Move your jobs \noverseas, you do not have to pay tax on your income until you \nrepatriate. And when you do, by the way, we will charge you 5 percent. \nWe will charge you a third or fourth the tax rate a receptionist is \npaid, the lowest in the office.\n  Is that fair? The answer is no. Once again, it is another incentive \nto say to people, if you move your jobs overseas, go find lower labor \nrates somewhere else, call yourself an American firm but hire foreign \nlabor, we will give you a benefit. That ought to be shut out of the Tax \nCode. Your party is opening it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. One minute for the next \nquestion from the majority.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, Democrats express concern of a loss of \nmanufacturing jobs and our country's ability to compete in the world; \nagain, a concern I share. But then Democrats turn around and oppose \neach and every policy objective the National Association of \nManufacturers says it needs to stay competitive.\n  That is what this is about. How do we stay competitive--including \nmedical malpractice reform, to rein in runaway health care costs \nkilling our small businesses, asbestos reform, class action reform, and \na myriad of other reforms.\n  In addition, there is talk of perhaps Democratic obstruction to an \nEnergy bill that will create 500,000 to 700,000 new jobs. Are the \nDemocrats prepared to come around on these issues and finally support \nthe thing our Nation's manufacturers say they need to stay alive?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not heard a description of my \ncolleagues riding Huffy bicycles or their desire to ride a Huffy \nbicycle in the future, but let me come back to that point. You are \ntalking about U.S. manufacturers and the conditions of competition. Do \nyou think Huffy bicycles decided to make bikes in China rather than \nOhio because of some bill we did or did not pass in the Senate? I am \nsorry, they went China because they could pay 33 cent an hour in China, \nthey could have people work 7 days a week, 15 hours a day, and they \ncould not do that in this country. That reduced the price and the cost \nof producing that bicycle.\n  I ask, if you have bought a bicycle for your child lately, whether \nyou saw a reduction in the price of Huffy bicycles just because they \nwent from $11 an hour to 33 cents an hour. I will answer for you. The \nanswer is no. It was about profits.\n  The question is, do you want to have a race to the bottom? Is that \nwhat you want for the American businesses and the American workers? Do \nyou want to have a race to the bottom on wages, on health standards? Is \nthat where we are? I don't think so.\n  We can compete anywhere in the world, but the competition has to be\n\n[[Page S14957]]\n\nfair. American companies and American workers ought not to have to \ncompete with 12 cents an hour or 33 cents an hour labor. That is not \nfair competition. That is why I raised the issue of trade.\n  We have the trade ambassador busy running around the world right now \ntrying to do more trade agreements. The last one, incidentally, which \nboth of you voted for, put in an immigration provision that had nothing \nto do with the trade agreement, so that we could have an enormous \nnumber of people come through Singapore to take jobs in this country. \nWe could not get it out. They will displace American workers, coming \ninto this country to take American jobs, and we had an amendment we \ncould not get out. Instead, they pass an amendment that says you better \nwatch it, but you cannot take something out of a trade bill because of \nfast track.\n  This issue of competition--you want to change the subject, let's talk \nabout what fair competition is for American businesses and American \nworkers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  One minute for rebuttal for the majority.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I deeply appreciate my colleague's concern for fair \ncompensation. I note Senator Dorgan has been one of the chief advocates \nfor trade with Cuba. I hope he would take that same philosophy about \nhuman rights and workers rights in dealing with Cuba.\n  I would also reflect a little bit on the comment about trade. NAFTA \nwas signed by President Clinton and the Uruguay Round after being \napproved by a Democrat House and Democrat Senate. I believe Senator \nHarkin supported both of those votes. On NTR trade with China, I \nbelieve both Senators Dorgan and Harkin supported that. The reality is, \nwe have a trade ambassador going there right now to push for some \ncontrols, push for expanded buying by China, cut down the deficit. But \nthe bottom line is, How do we make us competitive?\n  Going back to the National Association of Manufacturers, they say the \nU.S. industry is burdened by legal and regulatory systems that retard \ngrowth and destroy jobs. That is what we have to deal with. We have to \ndeal with the underlying things that make it impossible for businesses \nto grow in this country.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. One minute for \nthe minority to ask a question.\n  Members are reminded to direct their remarks through the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in less than 3 years time President Bush \nhas turned a projected surplus of $5.7 trillion into a projected \ndeficit of $4.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Now not even Congress \nis powerful enough to reverse the law of supply and demand. This vast \nnew debt will raise interest rates and damage the economy in the long \nrun. It is going to hurt the Federal Government's ability to cover the \nSocial Security and Medicare costs of baby boomers and the education of \nour kids.\n  The tax bill gave a $93,000 tax cut, on average, to those earning \nmore than $1 million a year. The majority of Americans, however, get \nless than $100.\n  Also, right now, more and more foreign countries are owning our debt \nand more and more will be owning that debt over the next 10 years.\n  My question is, are these tax cuts for wealthy Americans worth the \nlong-term damage they will cause our economy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator from Iowa for that great question. \nWhat we care about is fiscal discipline and we do care about fiscal \ndeficits, but what we care most about, as Republicans, is the job \ndeficit.\n  As my wonderful colleague from Minnesota, Senator Coleman, said, this \ncountry has been hit by something that is unprecedented, other than \nmaybe Pearl Harbor, with the attacks on September 11. That had a \ndevastating impact on the confidence and the capabilities of our \neconomy for a short while, but we are coming back, even in the midst of \na war on terrorism.\n\n  When our friends on the Democrat side of the aisle talk about fiscal \ndiscipline, what they are talking about is continuing to tax the \ntaxpayers. The bottom line is they think taxes ought to be higher on \nmarried people, on families, on individuals, on small businesses; even \non people who die.\n  When you discuss fiscal discipline, as shown on this chart, here is \nthe reality. As we were trying to cut taxes to help create more jobs \nand more investment in this country, Democrats proposed a variety of \ndifferent amendments on the floor, as shown on this chart, is how much \nit would have raised spending: Each year it would be about $87.9 \nbillion; over 10 years, $1.3 trillion--$1.3 trillion additionally \nspent.\n  Our view is, the best way to raise revenues for the Government, for \nkey priorities in research, in aeronautics, in education, for national \ndefense and homeland security is to have a vibrant economy where people \nare working and paying taxes, and businesses are prospering and paying \ntaxes, rather than going bankrupt or having people unemployed.\n  Shown on this chart is the cost of Democratic proposals in the \nSenate. Fortuitously, we have a majority, and we are able to include \nresponsible spending so that the taxpayers will get more of their money \nand not have added burdensome debt for the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). There is 1 minute for the \nminority to rebut.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am somewhat taken. I cannot believe it. \nThe Republicans are in charge of the White House, the Senate, and the \nHouse, and they are blaming the Democrats for this economic downturn \nand for the fact that we have these huge budget deficits. They are the \nones who are in charge.\n  They are the ones that produced an 8 percent increase in domestic \ndiscretionary spending last year, far more than the average increase in \nthe Clinton years. And, that excludes Iraq and Defense.\n  I would respond to my friend from Virginia, no, we do not believe in \nhigher taxes, but we do believe in fairer taxes--fairer taxes--for the \nAmerican people.\n  Right now, the corporate income tax rate is the lowest it has been \nsince the 1930s except for 1983--1.2 percent--yet payroll taxes, paid \nby every hard-working American, is at the highest level ever. That is \nwhat has been happening; not that the people ought to pay more taxes, \nwe ought to have fairer taxes.\n  Why is it fair that in the 2003 tax bill those making over a million \ndollars a year are getting, on average, $93,000 while half the \ntaxpayers got $100 or less. That is what we are opposed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute for the majority to ask a \nquestion.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, this question. It follows up on some of his questions to me, \nand that has to do with what we call the Invest in the USA Act, which \nthe Senate has passed, although there were dozens of Democrats who \nvoted against it.\n  Current tax policies in this country hinder and punish U.S. companies \nthat conduct business overseas. We would like them to do well and get \ninto other markets, but if they want to bring that money back into this \ncountry, they are taxed at 35 percent.\n  Now, Senator Dorgan and Senator Harkin oppose this investment in \nAmerica. Can Senator Dorgan share with us the positive economic impact \nif this were actually put into law?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is interesting that this behaves in \nexactly the opposite way as the Senator from Virginia understands it.\n  When you say to a company in this country, if you will simply invest \noverseas, heck, move a plant overseas, fire your workers in North \nDakota and Virginia and Ohio, and employ foreign workers, if you will \njust do that, we will give you a deal. You will never, ever have to pay \ntaxes on your earnings overseas. So get rid of that U.S. plant. Move it \noverseas. Earn your money there. And you simply do not have to pay \ntaxes on it. That is called deferral. And the only time you will ever \nhave to pay taxes is if you repatriate your income to this country. So \nthere is a built-in incentive to move your company overseas.\n\n  I am surprised the Senator from Virginia would ask a question about \nthat\n\n[[Page S14958]]\n\nbecause, in fact, the Finance Committee is now saying: I have an even \nbetter deal. We will keep deferral in the law--which is the perverse \nincentive--and we will allow you to repatriate that which you did earn, \nand we will charge you only a 5-percent income tax.\n  Any company that takes a look at that would say: Well, I can't have a \nbetter deal than this. They will continually support me to invest \noverseas. And there will now be precedent to allow me to repatriate the \nincome and pay--I don't know--a fourth of the tax of the lowest paid \nworkers in this country. What a deal, except that every company will \nnow understand that is the way this Congress works, and so there is a \nbig bonus for me to shut down my U.S. plant and invest overseas.\n  You talk about perversity, look, I am interested in jobs. I am \ninterested in companies to expand their job base. The way to do that is \nto encourage that expansion in this country, to hire American workers, \nand pay them well, and to give them good benefits, and then, through \nthem, earn good profits.\n  That is what I want for this country. But this country cannot any \nlonger ignore the perversity in the Tax Code. And one of them is \nexactly what the Senator from Virginia alleged, that subsidizes the \nflight of jobs overseas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute for the Republican side to \nrebut.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I would say, thank goodness the views of \nthe Senator from North Dakota are the minority view. The reality is, \nmost countries do not impose these 35 percent taxes. The current tax \nlaw prohibits businesses or impinges on their ability to bring profits \nback into this country to help create jobs.\n  A number of people, from Dr. Allen Sinai to Decision Economics to JP \nMorgan, have shown there would be 400,000 to 500,000 new U.S. jobs in \nthis country, $100 billion in increased investment in this country in \nequipment and research and development, and a reduction in corporate \ndebt if this legislation were enacted.\n  You can keep the laws the way they are without this provision, and \nwhat you will see is more jobs going overseas. But if you have this 1-\nyear benefit, you will find the benefit being in the hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs, with important investment here in America as \nopposed to overseas.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I ask a question, might I say, I don't \nknow about all these doctors and analysts, but I know about Americans \nwho lost their jobs because of this perverse incentive; and that is \nwhat I want to shut down.\n  But let me ask my colleagues a question about this record. Again, we \ndo not have to debate theory tonight. Let's just debate what has \nhappened.\n  The odds against this being a coincidence are highly unlikely. Every \nDemocratic administration has produced far more jobs than every \nRepublican administration. Does that mean one is good and one is bad? \nNo. It means different strategies produce different results.\n  Isn't it the case that, over many years, the strategy by which we \ninvest in working people and invest in small businesses, and giving \nthem something to work with, produces the robust economic opportunity \nand economic growth across this land? It is true with Clinton, Carter, \nJohnson, right on down the line. And the evidence does not lie.\n  As I said, might this be a coincidence? Mathematicians say the odds \nare highly unlikely against that being a coincidence. In the last 40 \nyears, every Democratic administration has done better than every \nRepublican administration in creating jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Thank you, Mr. President. I love that chart. Let's go \nback to Jimmy Carter: 18 percent inflation, 23 percent interest rates, \nlong lines at the gas pump. You talk about turning a sow's ear into a \nsilk purse, that chart does it.\n\n  But let's talk about reality and let's get away from the abstract. I \nagree with my colleague from North Dakota: Let's get away from what the \neconomists say. I want to quote Joan Thompson, executive vice president \nand CFO of Midwest Wire and Cable in St. Paul, Minnesota, a small \nbusiness. She says:\n\n       Our company will be stronger, continue to grow and provide \n     more jobs with these type of incentives [we have seen in the \n     tax cut].\n\n  She singled out the increase in small business expensing for new \ninvestment and increase in first year bonus depreciation as two keys in \nher company's resurgence.\n  Cirrus Manufacturing, one of the largest private employers in Duluth, \nMN, an area up north that suffered a lot of job loss right after the \ntax cut was passed--they sell private airplanes--talked about how they \ngot sales that all of a sudden happened, that had been on hold for \nages, because of the increase in depreciation.\n  I am not going to talk about charts. I am going to talk about \nreality.\n  I have to hit one other thing about reality; and that is, the reality \nis we were hit with September 11. We were hit with Enron and Worldcom. \nWe were hit with the burst of the dot.coms. And we have come back. And \nwhy? That is the choice here today. Do we come back with providing the \nopportunity for small business to invest and grow jobs or do we \ncontinue to tax? Do we continue to regulate? Do we continue to \noverspend and drive this economy further down?\n  We are moving forward. Business investment is up, consumer spending \nis up, GDP is up. Housing starts are up. Jobless claims are down. \nPayroll jobs are up. Productivity is increasing substantially. Total \ninvestment is up. The unemployment rate is down.\n  We are moving in the right direction with this President's and this \nRepublican Senate's vision. Let's keep moving in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute for the minority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we certainly agree. I hope very much that \nwe are moving in the right direction. We want economic expansion and \njobs. But the fact is, Jimmy Carter has come up several times here. I \nam not surprised it is Grover Cleveland. There are so many excuses.\n  We are choking on Federal budget deficits. We are choking on a trade \ndeficit that is the highest in history. The fact is, the American \npeople lack confidence in the future because we don't have our fiscal \nhouse in order. We can blame others but we are dramatically increasing \nspending on defense, on homeland security, and cutting taxes \nsubstantially, and we have a fiscal policy that does not add up.\n  I want one that adds up, that creates new jobs and new economic \nexpansion and hope for the American people. Most families just want a \ngood job that pays well, that gives them some security. Most small \nbusinesses want a chance to expand in order to create new employment. \nThat is all we want. The question is rooted in this chart. Where has \nthe performance been? We don't have to debate theory. Just debate the \nperformance of those who believe if you invest in working families, our \neconomy does just fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, each Member will have 2 minutes \nfor closing argument, beginning with a Member on the minority.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this has been a good debate. I wish we \ncould go for another hour.\n  Just a couple points. First, on job growth, that I have heard my \nfriends on the other side talk about here this evening and the last \nmonth. The fact is, manufacturing jobs are going down. The service \nsector has increased. Manufacturing jobs continue to lose. One in seven \nmanufacturing jobs were lost during the Bush administration. We are now \nat the lowest level of manufacturing jobs in our country since 1958, \nand it continues to go down. So when they talk about job growth, they \nare talking about the lowest kinds of jobs and the lowest paid kinds of \njobs in the service sector.\n  Again, what we ought to be talking about are jobs. Again, as my \ncolleague from North Dakota said, just look at the facts, the three \nmajor budget bills and job creation bills. In 1981, 1.4 million jobs \nwere lost in 2 years after the Republican budget bill past. Under the \nDemocratic budget bill passed in 1993, under our economic plan, 6.4 \nmillion jobs were created in 2 years. Of course, we know what is \nhappening under this President Bush: after his budget bill\n\n[[Page S14959]]\n\npassed in 2001, 2.1 million jobs were lost in the next two years. It is \nthe same old thing--Republican trickle-down economics was tried in 1981 \nand 2001. Put it in at the top, hope that it trickles down. That is the \nfundamental difference between Democratic and Republican economic \npolicies.\n  We have long believed--and the proof is what we did in the 1990s--\nthat if you put it in at the bottom, give it more to working families, \ninvest in education and health care, educational opportunities, make \nthe economy more efficient, it percolates up. It is percolate-up \neconomics that works versus trickle down.\n  The problem with trickle down is when you give it to those at the \ntop, they take too big a cut and it never quite trickles down. But when \nyou put it at the bottom, you put people to work and you get the \neconomy humming. We need to do it by expanding educational \nopportunities. Under this President, we have had the lowest request for \neducational funding in the last 30 years. That policy is going to mean \na less well trained work force in the long-term, an economy that will \nnot compete as well and larger deficits for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Again, I thank my Democratic colleagues for \nparticipating in this debate. Much of the reasoning I have heard this \nevening reminds me of the definition of an economist: Someone who sees \nsomething beginning to work in reality and tells you why it won't in \ntheory.\n  Simply put: The President's tax cuts have begun to stimulate the \neconomy and grow jobs. I will go out on a limb here and say as a fact \nthat the sky has not fallen, that we are not in the worst economy since \nHerbert Hoover, and the United States is not selling off the Grand \nCanyon to cover its debts.\n  Facts are facts. The business cycle lives. The economy started down \nlong before George Bush became President. After a relatively short time \nof negative growth, the economy began to recover. Despite serious \nsetbacks not of the President's making, such as 9/11, the economy is \ncoming back strong. Jobs and deficits are the remaining problems. In \nthe aftermath of recessions, they always are for a period. But we are \nheaded strongly in the right direction. What every person knows is what \nmatters is what we do here.\n  This is the question: Which do you think helps the economy and which \nhurts, raising taxes on everyone, especially on small business and job \ncreators and then increasing Federal spending, or leaving that money in \nthe pockets of consumers to consume or save or invest?\n  Tax increases would clearly hurt the economy more than increased \nspending would help. Today we need to look forward. To my Democratic \ncolleagues, I ask you to join your Republican colleagues to keep the \nwheels of economic progress turning. I ask you to join us in enacting \nclass-action reform, medical malpractice reform, asbestos reform, all \nof which the National Association of Manufacturers says is absolutely \ncritical to this country's ability to maintain domestic manufacturing \njobs. Help put an end to the perception that Democrats care about \nmanufacturing jobs, just not enough to offend the trial lawyers.\n  As for the deficit, talk about the kid who killed his folks and then \nthrew himself on the mercy of the court because he was an orphan. Here \nwe have Democrats offering $1.3 trillion in new spending above and \nbeyond what the budget will allow since January.\n  The question before us is whether Democrats will roll up their \nsleeves and help get the job done by passing an Energy bill or will \nmore obstruction be the order of the day?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My dad always told me never buy something from somebody \nwho is out of breath. There is kind of a breathless quality to this \ndebate from the other side. They want us to essentially ignore the fact \nthat we have lost more than 3 million jobs in a couple of years. Of the \nbiggest fiscal policy budget deficit in history, the biggest trade \ndeficit in history, just ignore that. Be happy. In fact, call for more \ntax cuts, preferably tax cuts for businesses that are moving jobs \noverseas and tax cuts for people at the top of the income ladder.\n  Let's talk about jobs, though. What is the menu that creates new \njobs? The Oscar Meyer Company had an opening for their Weinermobile \ndriver. Eight hundred college graduates showed up to apply to drive the \nWeinermobile. What does that tell you about jobs in this country? This \nis a sad commentary on our job situation.\n  This country needs new jobs. We don't need an economic strategy that \nshrinks. We need one that expands jobs. We will best serve the American \npeople if we decide these things matter. Deficits matter. Trade \npolicies matter. If we decide these things matter and start working on \nthem in a bipartisan way, in a thoughtful way, in a commonsense way, we \nwill best serve this country's interests.\n  But facts remain. This is the first administration since Herbert \nHoover that had a net loss of jobs, nearly 3 million jobs since it took \noffice. I take no pleasure in saying that. I wish it were not so. I \nhope a year from now I can say there are massive new jobs being created \nand our economy is growing.\n  But I tell you this: That won't happen if we ignore the fundamentals. \nLet's get back to the fundamentals: fiscal policy that adds up and \nworks; trade policy that adds up and supports this country's best \ninterests in a way that can give confidence to the American people \nabout the future. We won't provide confidence by putting our head in \nthe sand and saying: Be happy. Just call for more tax cuts.\n  I am for tax cuts, but I am also for a world-class educational \nsystem, protecting our environment, and creating more jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for joining in this \ndebate. I think we all do share the same goals for this country: a \nstrong national defense, homeland security; education, stronger \nnanotechnology, aeronautics and so forth. The question though is, How \ndo you get there? How do you achieve this goal? That is where the \ndifference lies.\n  We have been pushing for tax cuts because we trust free people and \nfree enterprise. We figure families who have children, when they got \nthat $400 check this summer, needed that money for their kids. You have \nseen the results. They spent it on shoes or clothes or electronics, and \nit increased retail selling, which is great for the retailers and \nmanufacturers of the products and the transporters and all the rest.\n  You see the job growth. Is it where we want to be? Of course not. \nWhat we are doing on the Republican side is putting forward a positive, \nconstructive agenda and solutions to move America forward and help \ncreate more jobs. The difference is, on the Democrat side, their view \nis more taxes. They opposed our efforts to reduce taxes on married \npeople. We wanted to get rid of the marriage penalty tax. We wanted to \nreduce taxes on families, on small businesses, entrepreneurs. They \nopposed us. But things are moving forward in the right direction.\n  We also disagree on their taxing of Social Security benefits. I know \nsome of them, my friend from North Dakota, even want to tax the \nInternet which I believe ought to be free from burdensome regulations.\n  The bottom line of our philosophy was best summed up by Ronald Reagan \nwho said in 1985: Every dollar the Government does not take from us, \nevery decision it does not make for us will make our economy stronger, \nour lives more abundant, and our future more free.\n  That sums up the Republican approach and, indeed, its current success \nshows that it is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, at this time the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, and the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. Kyl, will each be recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I have enjoyed the \nopportunity to exchange views with my colleagues. They are very able \nlegislators. I thank my colleague from Iowa and my colleagues from \nVirginia and Minnesota and also my colleague from Arizona, chairman of \nthe Republican Policy Committee.\n  I must, however, correct one little misstatement at the end. My good\n\n[[Page S14960]]\n\nfriend from Virginia just raised this little issue about the Internet \ntax, and nobody is suggesting we tax the Internet. We will save that \nfor another day. We can have another date--just the two of us--on that \nsubject. We need to do that based on facts.\n  I will say that I think this is a good exchange of views. My \ncolleague from Arizona and I, with our caucuses, have created an \nopportunity--and we will try to do this each month--which allows us to \nexchange views on specific subjects. I think it merits additional \nopportunities in the Senate, and I will be pleased in the coming months \nwhen we are in session to work with my friend, Senator Kyl, to find \nadditional topics and debaters and to further advance discussions on \npublic policy in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, too, thank our four debaters this evening, \nand especially my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. He and I \nchair the policy committees of our respective conferences. We decided \nthat too much of our debate in this body wasn't very civil or very much \nin the way of debate because we were frequently talking to an empty \nChamber. We basically were talking past each other rather than engaging \nwith each other.\n  The best way for the American people to understand our different \nphilosophies and actually test ideas was to see us in a situation in \nwhich, like tonight, you saw questions being asked of each other and \nthe responses being given at that same period, the rebuttals and the \nreplies in proximity to each other, so that these ideas could be \nevaluated in a context of real meaning, rather than the way the debate \nfrequently occurs here. That is not to denigrate our colleagues in the \nway we conduct other debates, but we think that by having this kind of \nan opportunity, we will not only elucidate particular issues, as was \ndone this past week, but we can work together as friends and colleagues \nand bring out the best ideas and participate in debate of the kind that \nwas originally contemplated in this Chamber.\n  Again, I thank the debaters. As was indicated, we intend to do this \nabout once a month, and we hope everybody will tune in again. With \nthat, I think we have a wrap-up request.\n  For the time being, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14960-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REAL MEDICARE REFORM IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT OBSTRUCTIONISM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for 3 continuous days last week we \nfocused on the obstructions imposed over the past year against \nPresident Bush's circuit court nominees by the Democratic minority in \nthe Senate. The Senate obstructionism has claimed victims, and unless \nwe break their holds, more highly qualified legal scholars will be lost \ndue to their ongoing obstructionism.\n  Obstructionism is not just for judges anymore. It has been used also \nagainst the Healthy Forests Act, a bill that was approved while the \nsouthern California fires raged on but was subjected to obstructionism \nby a minority when it was time to go to conference.\n  Now our seniors are on the verge of receiving a new Medicare \nprescription drug benefit unless the Senate chooses to obstruct it. \nAfter 38 years of broken promises, a real Medicare drug benefit is \nright around the corner. Opponents claim that reforms in the Medicare \nconference are too great and the spending too little. I disagree. \nSeniors have waited too long and this bill does too much for it to be \nsubjected to obstructionism.\n  As I indicated a moment ago, after 38 years of broken promises our \nseniors will finally get a Medicare drug benefit unless the Senate \nobstructs it. After 38 years of delay, help can begin in as soon as 6 \nmonths unless the Senate obstructs it.\n  Looking at the second chart, this Medicare bill will provide \nunprecedented resources for seniors' prescription drug benefits, almost \none and a half times what President Clinton proposed and a third more \nthan Senate Democrats wanted just 2 years ago, and we will have all of \nthis unless the Senate obstructs it.\n  Looking at the third chart, the Medicare bill will cover nearly all \nprescription drug costs for low-income seniors--nearly all prescription \ndrug costs for low-income seniors. This is a terrific deal for our low-\nincome elderly in America. We will have this unless the Senate \nobstructs it.\n  This Medicare bill will cover nearly all catastrophic drug costs for \nseniors with high drug bills--nearly all catastrophic costs for seniors \nwith high prescription drug bills. Let me say that again. This Medicare \nbill will cover 95 percent of catastrophic costs for seniors with high \nprescription drug bills. This is a good deal for America's seniors and \nwe will have this unless the Senate obstructs it.\n  The Medicare bill will give seniors unprecedented choices. All of \nthese new choices in yellow on this chart are choices that are not \navailable to seniors today. Senior will have all of these new choices, \nboth the drug plan as well as comprehensive health plans with choices \nthat Federal workers currently enjoy, unless the Senate obstructs it.\n  The Medicare bill will use competition to stop waste and abuse and \ngive seniors group purchasing power. A specialty cane that Medicare \npays $44 for is purchased by the VA for $15. That waste of Medicare and \nretirees' money will stop unless the Senate obstructs it.\n  This is a picture of that cane, for which Medicare currently \noverpays, that the VA can get for a mere $15. Medicare pays $44. All of \nthis kind of waste will stop unless the Senate obstructs this bill.\n  The Medicare bill will protect seniors by keeping the drug benefits \nboth available and voluntary. Let me just say that again. This Medicare \nbill will keep seniors' drug benefits both voluntary and available. \nRetirees can keep what they have or get help to maintain their \nemployer-based plans, can get a drug benefit through traditional \nMedicare, will get new choices in improved Medicare, will be protected \nby a Government backup plan and substantial resources to make sure the \nchoices are really there, not just on paper but choices that are really \nthere. Seniors get all of this protection unless the Senate obstructs \nit.\n  This Medicare bill will protect Medicare for tomorrow's seniors by \ncontrolling costs and preserving the system. While the bill provides an \nunprecedented amount of resources--again, almost one and a half times \nwhat President Clinton proposed and a third more than Senate Democrats \nwanted just 2 years ago--the bill requires that costs be monitored to \ncontrol spending in excess of $400 billion. The bill adds competitive \nforces to drive down costs, reward efficiency, eliminate waste and \nabuse, and weed out fraud so that Medicare will be preserved for our \nchildren. All of this will happen unless the Senate obstructs this \nmeasure.\n  Finally, looking at chart 9, the Medicare bill provides real \nresources, real benefits, real health, real choice, real protections, \nreal competition, and real cost control. All of those items are in this \nmeasure, and we will have a chance to approve it later this week.\n  After 38 years, seniors will finally get a good prescription drug \nbenefit unless the Senate obstructs it. I think it is the poorest and \nfrailest seniors who will suffer enormously from more obstructionism \nthis time against this Medicare prescription drug bill.\n  So that is where we are. This is a great new plan that will be before \nthe Senate later this week, an opportunity to really help seniors with \nprescription drugs for the first time, after years of conversation. Let \nus not miss that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14960-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14960-S14961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECENT BROADCAST FLAG REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Federal \nCommunications Commission for its continuing work on the important \nbroadcast flag regulations. Over-the air-television remains a critical \npart of the distribution of American television, and these regulations \nhelp to promote and improve over-the-air broadcasting of high quality \ndigital programming. They do this by giving broadcasters the tools they \nneed to protect their digital\n\n[[Page S14961]]\n\nbroadcasts against piracy. Without this protection, broadcasters would \nsimply not broadcast their high value content over the air, and we \nwould be left with two classes of American consumers: those who can \nafford, and live somewhere where they can receive, cable television \nwith its high-value content, and those who receive only low-value over-\nthe-air television. We must not allow this to happen.\n  While I am encouraged by the FCC's progress, and in particular \npleased to see that they have taken steps to keep the setting of \ntechnical criteria for protective technologies open and transparent, \nthe FCC's recent notice of proposed rulemaking raises some concerns. \nFirst, the FCC should make the process inclusive of all parties with an \ninterest in the outcome, especially consumers. Second, a sound final \nregulation should address the effect of a broadcast flag on fair use \nrights and works that are already in the public domain. Third, the \nfinal regulation should address the broadcast flag's effect on privacy. \nWhat is intended as a technological measure to ensure the security of \nover-the-air broadcasts should not turn into an ability to track viewer \nbehavior. Last, the final regulation must continue to ensure that no \none player becomes dominant in this industry, and that the American \nconsumer continues to reap the benefits of innovative new technologies. \nMost of all, the FCC should not lose sight of the most important goal \nof these regulations: to provide the highest quality content possible \nthrough over-the-air television. I am confident that it will do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14961-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JAMES COMEY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe one such crime today. In protest of a \nwedding between two men in Seattle, WA, several young men and one adult \nwho call themselves ``Deliverance Unlimited'' refused to leave a local \nChristian Church. In the October 25, 2003 incident, the co-pastor of \nthe church asked the protestors to leave, and the group then began \nverbally assaulting the church staff. One of the protestors, \nChristopher Dudley, entered the sanctuary and began yelling that the \nchurch needed to be cleansed of sin. He then vandalized the church by \nspraying and wiping oil on the walls and furniture. The co-pastor told \npolice that he was afraid for his own life and the lives of his staff.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14961-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO BOB STILLER OF GREEN MOUNTAIN COFFEE ROASTERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Burlington Free Press recently ran a \nstory about expansion plans by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in \nWaterbury, VT. The company has begun work on a 52,000-square-foot \nwarehouse and distribution center that will significantly expand \nmanufacturing capacity. Under the leadership of Bob Stiller, Green \nMountain Coffee has consistently been rated one of the fastest growing \nand best managed small public companies in the United States.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of Vermont's economy, and Green \nMountain Coffee has been an outstanding corporate partner in our State \nfor over 20 years. Started in a small cafe in Waitsfield, VT, in 1981, \ngrowing into a publicly traded company in 1993, and now announcing this \n$8.4 million expansion in Waterbury, Green Mountain has been a national \nleader in the specialty coffee market and an international leader in \npromoting fair trade coffee.\n  I commend Bob and all the employees at Green Mountain Coffee for \ntheir success at not only selling great coffee but also promoting \nsustainable farming throughout the world. I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of the article that appeared in the Burlington Free Press be \nprinted in the Record so that all Senators can read about the success \nof this company.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Nov. 6, 2003]\n\n                       GMC Has Expansion Brewing\n\n       Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. plans to begin \n     construction this month on a 52,000-square-foot warehouse and \n     distribution center in Waterbury in an $8.4 million project \n     that's intended to also expand the specialty coffee company's \n     manufacturing capacity, the company said Wednesday.\n       ``We are impressed with Waterbury's support, which enables \n     us to expand our facilities in the downtown Waterbury \n     location contiguous to our manufacturing and roasting \n     operations,'' Green Mountain Coffee Chairman and CEO Robert \n     Stiller said.\n       Green Mountain Coffee said the company expects to save \n     money over the long term thanks to new automation equipment \n     to be installed in the new building. The additional warehouse \n     space also will allow for more product diversity and \n     eliminate outside storage expenses.\n       This expansion will mean the company's packaging, \n     warehousing and distribution capacities will match its \n     current coffee roasting capacity of about 40 million to 50 \n     million pounds.\n       Moving functions into the new building will allow Green \n     Mountain Coffee to increase its packaging capacity in its \n     65,000-square-foot plant that houses its roasting, warehouse \n     and distribution operations, the company said.\n       The company expects the building to be finished by fall \n     2004, and the transfer of distribution and warehousing \n     functions completed by the spring 2005.\n       ``This expansion is critical to our success in executing \n     our long-term growth plans to be the leader in roasting and \n     selling specialty coffee to a broad array of customers,'' \n     Stiller said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14961-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14961-S14962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MORTIMER CAPLIN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nremarkable man, Mr. Mortimer M. Caplin, on his outstanding legal career \nas an academic, public servant and distinguished practitioner. Through \nthe years, Mr. Caplin, has been an inspiration to us all and a shining \nexample of what hard work, dedication and perseverance can accomplish.\n  I feel a special connection with Mr. Caplin as we both graduated from \nUniversity of Virginia School of Law and both served our country \nproudly during World War II in the United States Navy. As a \nundergraduate and law student at the University of Virginia, Mr. Caplin \nearned a reputation as a hard working student who always had time to \nlend a helping hand. During his undergraduate career at Mr. Jefferson's \nUniversity, Mr. Caplin was elected to Phi Beta Kappa while becoming a \nstandout on Johnny LaRowe's great boxing teams of the mid'30's.\n  After earning his Bachelor of Science degree, Mr. Caplin went on to \nthe University's law school where he continued his excellent academic \ncareer and his affiliation with the University's boxing team. As coach \nof the First Year team, Mr Caplin instilled in the newly arrived First \nYears the value of a well rounded education. He also managed to find \nthe time to be selected and serve as Editor-in-Chief of the Virginia \nLaw Review in 1940.\n  Upon graduation in 1940, Mr. Caplin clerked for Judge Armistead M. \nDobie\n\n[[Page S14962]]\n\non the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in \nRichmond. Upon completing his clerkship, he joined the New York law \nfirm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison as an associate but, like \nso many of us during this era, interrupted his career to defend this \ncountry and the freedom we all enjoy. Mr. Caplin joined the Navy and on \nJune 6, 1944, came ashore on Omaha Beach as a member of the initial \nlanding force where he served as U.S. Navy beachmaster.\n  After the war, Caplin returned to the legal profession and eventually \nmade his way back to the University of Virginia in 1950 where he became \na law professor concentrating on tax and corporate law. From 1950 \nto1962, he taught countless students the value of a legal education \nuntil he was again called into public service by President John F. \nKennedy to head the Internal Revenue Service.\n  After retiring from the post in 1964, Mr. Caplin received the \nAlexander Hamilton Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Treasury \nDepartment. Thereafter, he founded Caplin & Drysdale which became, and \nremains today, one of the leading tax firms in the United States. Mr. \nCaplin was the 2001 recipient of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal \nin Law which is awarded to individuals that exemplify the Jeffersonian \nideal of the lawyer as public citizen. He truly embodies this ideal and \nit is right to honor his accomplishments.\n  On May 18, 2003, Mr. Caplin was invited to address the University of \nVirginia's 2003 graduating class. His words about the importance of \npublic service are an inspiration to us all. As a tribute to his \nachievements and his contributions, I ask that his remarks be entered \ninto the Record at this time.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n                           A Debt of Service\n\n       I must confess, in trying to recall who spoke and what was \n     said at my own college graduation--``The Great Class of \n     1937''--my mind remains a blank.\n       The one commencement I do remember was here at my law \n     graduation in 1940. The speaker was the president of the \n     United States--Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He came to the \n     University to attend the law graduation of his son, Franklin \n     Jr., one of our classmates.\n       The Nazi armies of Adolph Hitler were then overrunning \n     Europe and threatening the freedom of the entire world. On \n     that very morning, Mussolini's fascist forces--joining \n     Hitler--had invaded their neighbor France. Soon, every member \n     of our class would be required to register under the \n     vigorously debated Selective Service Act, the first peacetime \n     military draft in our nation's history.\n       In Memorial Gymnasium, the president delivered a historic \n     speech--the most sensitive part inserted by him during his \n     train ride from Washington, contrary to the State \n     Department's specific pleas that America's neutrality would \n     be compromised.\n       FDR dramatically declared: ``On this tenth day of June \n     1940, the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the \n     back of its neighbor. On this tenth day of June 1940, in this \n     University founded by the first great American teacher of \n     democracy, we send forth our prayers and our hopes to those \n     beyond the seas who are maintaining with magnificent valor \n     their battle for freedom.''\n       Remember, in 1940 there was no television, no cell phones, \n     no Internet. Until then, we heard President Roosevelt only on \n     the radio. To have the president of the United States before \n     us in person, delivering to the world his famous ``dagger-in-\n     the-back'' speech, is a moment I will never forget.\n       That day, he also gave us a glimpse into what lay before us \n     when he solemnly committed, for the first time and without \n     congressional approval, to ``extend . . . the material \n     resources of this nation'' to the embattled democracies.\n       First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt later said: ``Franklin's \n     address was not just a commencement address, it was a speech \n     to the nation . . . that brought us one step nearer to total \n     war.''\n       For us, World War II had begun. It was not at all what we \n     graduates had been planning.\n       As a law student, I spent many hours thinking about my \n     postgraduation career and dreams. I had already accepted a \n     legal clerkship with Judge Armistead Mason Dobie, our former \n     Law School dean and, at that time, a U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals judge. Next, I would go to New York to begin the \n     practice of law. With two U.Va. degrees in hand, I felt \n     prepared to face and perhaps conquer the world. But on Dec. \n     7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and all our lives \n     changed.\n       I had hardly begun my Wall Street law practice, when I \n     found myself in uniform, commissioned an ensign. U.S. Naval \n     Reserve. When my training was completed, I said goodbye to \n     Ruth, my wife of just one year, and set sail for duty as a \n     beachmaster on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, for the D-Day \n     landing on the Normandy coast of France.\n       World War II and the Navy did teach me a number of \n     important life skills--many still of help in my private \n     career. Two, in particular, are worth remembering. First, \n     avoid fixed and rigid plans. Instead, allow for \n     flexibility, innovation and possible change--but always \n     hold true to your personal values. Second, be willing to \n     accept risk when necessary as you move forward toward your \n     goals.\n       Philosopher William James acutely observed: ``It is only by \n     risking our persons from one hour to another that we live at \n     all. And often enough our faith beforehand in an uncertified \n     result is the only thing that makes the result come true.''\n       Simply put, have faith in your choices, and be at the ready \n     to risk challenge as well as change. You will grow in \n     strength as you do.\n       We've heard a great deal of late about those involved in \n     what has been dubbed ``The Greatest Generation''--glorifying \n     our ordinary citizens who, through hard work, courage and \n     sacrifice, successfully confronted the Great Depression and \n     World War II. Let me confess, though--as a duly designated \n     member of that body--I find the anointment somewhat overdone. \n     Countless generations, both before and after--including \n     today--have also faced challenging times and national crises. \n     And, in each case, everyday Americans have always \n     demonstrated equal patriotism, equal devotion, equal \n     courage--all inherently part of our national culture, \n     traditions and training.\n       What may we expect of your generation? A former U. Va. Law \n     School student of mine--who later became attorney general of \n     the United States--Robert F. Kennedy, offered an answer in \n     his 1966 Capetown University speech: ``Few will have the \n     greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change \n     a small portion of events, and in the total of all these acts \n     will be written the history of this generation.''\n       Mr. Jefferson consistently laid stress on, not just the \n     rights of citizens of this country, but also on the \n     responsibilities. Writing in 1796--shortly before he assumed \n     the unhappy post of vice president--he stated strongly: \n     ``There is a debt of service due from every man to his \n     country, proportioned to the bounties which nature and \n     fortune have measured to him.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14962-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF JAMES J.

Jones Award, which Jim will formally receive next \nmonth, recognizes Pennsylvanians who ``have demonstrated exemplary \ncivic leadership in support of free enterprise and democratic \nprocesses'' and focuses on a lifetime of achievement rather than a \nsingle effort.\n  Jim Gillin certainly qualifies. He was president of the Philadelphia-\nbased Petroleum Heat and Power Company, a major fuel distributor \nthroughout the Delaware Valley. He was also a member of the Executive \nBoard of Continental Bank of New Jersey, president of Transport \nEmployers, Inc., and chairman of the Philadelphia Parking Authority.\n  Jim was also active politically, serving as treasurer of the \nPhiladelphia County Democratic Executive Committee and as a member of \nthe Democratic House and Senate Council in Washington, DC. He has \nalways been bipartisan, willing to reach across the aisle to support \npolitical leaders who support business.\n  Jim has helped shape PEG for a quarter century, serving as chairman \nfrom 1985 through 1989 and on its board since 1979. He also played \nmajor roles at the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry during \nthe late 1980s.\n  PEG has made a superb choice in presenting its important new award to \nJim Gillin. I join them in their tribute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14962-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14962-S14963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNITION OF BING JUDD\n\n Mr. GREGG.

Located well \nnorth of\n\n[[Page S14963]]\n\nthe notches through New Hampshire's White Mountains, Pittsburg contains \nthe majestic Connecticut Lakes and Lake Francis, headwaters of the \nConnecticut River, and areas of unparalleled scenic and wild beauty.

An avid and skillful sportsman, knowledgeable in the woods and \nwith an uncanny knack of always knowing where the fish are, his vast \nexperience includes a varied and accomplished record of service to the \npublic: A Pittsburg road agent in the 1960s, a New Hampshire State \nRepresentative in 1974, 17 years of service as a forest ranger for the \nState of New Hampshire from 1975 to 1992, a New Hampshire fish and game \ncommissioner for 10 years, on the Pittsburg Police and Fire Departments \nfor many years and service continuing to this day as Pittsburg health \nofficer, as a Coos County commissioner since 1997 and on the State of \nNew Hampshire's Water Resources Council and New Hampshire Wetlands \nBoard. In addition, as chairman of the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters \nCitizens Advisory Committee, Bing has been, and continues to be, \ninstrumental in assisting to guide policy for preserving and protecting \nthe vital water and woodland resources of this important region, \nespecially in the recent successful effort to preserve for future \ngenerations and traditional uses over 170,000 acres of area woodlands.\n  In my time of service to New Hampshire as Second District \nCongressman, Governor and U.S. Senator, I have had no higher privilege \nthan to count on Bing Judd for his sound judgement, sage advice and \nfriendship. I know of no individual more dedicated to his community and \nhis region or more able in its governance. The Town of Pittsburg, Coos \nCounty, and the State of New Hampshire have been fortunate he has been \nwilling to share his wisdom and experience on our behalf for so well \nand for so long. While he will continue to serve his town, region, and \nState in many roles, it is important his longevity of quality service \nto his town as selectman be recognized and honored. It is because of \nthe outstanding community service performed by citizens like Bing Judd \nthat civil needs are met, our communities prosper, and our Nation hands \nto future generations a landscape and a society better off for his \nselfless and committed participation.\n  I thank Bing Judd on behalf of his many constituents and neighbors of \nPittsburg, NH, who he has served and helped throughout the \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14963-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14963-S14964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY OF FAIRFAX \n                                   VT\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n100th anniversary of the founding of Bellows Free Academy in Fairfax, \nVT.\n  Bellows Free Academy is one of the last schools in Vermont that \nserves student from kindergarten through 12th grade. As such, many \nfamilies in Fairfax enjoy the advantage of having their children attend \nthe facility from their first day of school through high school \ngraduation.\n  And it is a very nice facility. The original 1903 building, which \nburned down in January 1941, was replaced and dedicated in 1942. \nAdditions in 1960, 1973, 1990, and 1999 have kept the school up to date \nwith modern space, equipment and facilities. Located in the heart of \none of Vermont's fastest growing towns, BFA is a venerable school whose \nplaygrounds and athletic fields are framed by woods and meadows, with a \nnew land acquisition providing access to the nearby Lamoille River. \nSeveral vantage points reveal majestic views of Mount Mansfield, \nVermont's tallest mountain.\n  In discussing BFA, a point of clarity is in order, as there are two \nschools in Vermont named Bellows Free Academy, and both are in Franklin \nCounty. Each school owes its founding to the same benefactor, but \npeople in Fairfax are quick to point out that theirs is the original \nBFA, even if it is smaller, in terms of student enrollment, to its \nnamesake in St. Albans.\n  BFA, Fairfax, was established through the generous provisions of the \n1876 will of Hiram Bellows, who was born in Fairfax in 1798.\n  As a young person, Hiram Bellows lived at the farm of his birth and \nattended grammar school at a nearby schoolhouse. He advanced to the \nsmall graded school in town when good fortune brought a college \ngraduate to Fairfax to teach for a short period of time. Hiram was \nunable to progress further in formal education, however, because his \nparents could not afford the academy fees to attend the high school \nequivalent of his day.\n  Hiram Bellows was an industrious man and an able judge of character. \nFor some time, he made his living operating a general store and \n`tinkering' in real estate. It is said that he liked to bargain, and \ninvariably whittled on a piece of wood while studying the face of the \nman with whom a deal was being contemplated.\n  He served as State senator from Franklin County; was a charter member \nof the Vermont and Canada Railroad Company; founding associate of the \nParish of Christ Church, Episcopal; and first president of the First \nNational Bank of St. Albans.\n  In regard to his nature and character, a niece once recalled that he \nwas ``a kind, delightful gentleman, whose house was always open.''\n  Upon his death, Hiram Bellows' will included provisions for the \nestablishment of a free academy in Fairfax. Here follows several terms \nof his will:\n\n       I give, and bequeath in trust to my native town of Fairfax, \n     two hundred and fifty shares in the Chicago, Rock Island and \n     Pacific Railroad Company, the par value, one hundred dollars \n     each.\n       The dividends thereon as far as practical, to be invested \n     in said stock, until the same shall amount to two hundred and \n     fifty thousand dollars, for the purpose of establishing a \n     free school in said town of Fairfax. Said school to be \n     located upon the premises hereinafter mentioned and \n     described.\n       Said school to be known and called `the Bellows Free \n     Academy of Fairfax, Vermont'. In which Academy the primary \n     and higher branches of learning shall be taught. Said Academy \n     shall be conducted in all respects in such a manner as to \n     further the education of children and young men, so as to fit \n     them for usefulness, and so as is practical, it is my wish \n     that children of indigent parents receive and advantage of \n     said school in preference to those who have ample means of \n     support of their children . . .\n\n  And so, in the same year that Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved \nhuman flight from a sand dune in Kitty Hawk, NC, Hiram Bellows' estate \nof railroad stock founded a free academy on a village lot in Fairfax, \nVT.\n  Generations of Hiram Bellows family have attended and graduated from \nthe school he so generously established. I am old his descendants \nattend BFA to this day. And with the generations of Bellows', so have \nbeen graduated generation after generation of other familiar Fairfax \nfamilies.\n  A school of course, does not exist and cannot thrive in and of \nitself. In this regard, Fairfax has a strong tradition of community \nsupport for its school, and that tradition is reflected in the quality \nof students, teachers, administrators, directors, and staff at BFA over \nthe century of its existence.\n  The list of those responsible for the continued growth and success of \nthe academy goes on and on. There are specific individuals who, I am \nsure, are worthy of specific praise. But perhaps even more importantly, \nthere are the countless people who contribute immeasurable hours in \ninnumerable ways to endless projects. They are the backbone of the \ncommunity; they comprise the sustaining force of the school.\n  So the Bellows Free Academy of Fairfax owes its beginnings to a \nremarkable man named Hiram Bellows. It does its proud history to its \nadministration, teachers, students, and above all, its community.\n  Its future depends on sustaining all of the above. And while there \nare indeed numerous families who count generations of graduates from \nBellows Free Academy, judging by its rate of growth, Fairfax also \nbenefits greatly from contributions of newer residents, many drawn to \nthis community, I suspect, precisely because of the strong reputation \nof its school system.\n  So, it is with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to all \nthose, past and present, involved with the Bellows Free Academy of \nFairfax, VT.\n  Moreover, I am pleased to recognize the generosity and foresight of \nits founder, Hiram Bellows.\n\n[[Page S14964]]\n\n  Happy 100th birthday, BFA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14964-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14964-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty, \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14964-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 1875.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \n``Call Center Consumer's Right to Know Act.'' This legislation is in \nresponse to the mounting evidence showing that U.S. corporations are \nrapidly shifting hundreds of thousands high-tech and service sector \njobs abroad. Labor officials, business leaders, economists, elected \nofficials and ordinary Americans are concerned that this bleeding\n\n[[Page S14966]]\n\nof American jobs will further slow our economy. In addition to the more \nthan 2 million manufacturing jobs that have been lost since 2000, some \nhave indicated that we may also be witnessing the largest out-sourcing \nof non-manufacturing jobs in the history of the U.S. economy. The \nstatistics are staggering. In the month of July 2003 alone, between \n25,000 and 30,000 jobs were outsourced to India. According to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, roughly one in ten jobs held by Americans \nin 2001 are now at risk to be outsourced abroad.\n  These jobs are not specific to one sector or a select few companies, \nbut span a broad array of services, including customer call service \ncenters, payroll and other back-office related activities, stock market \nresearch for financial firms, medical transcription services, legal \nonline database research and data analysis for consulting firms. In \naddition, firms involved with software services and business process \noutsourcing are rapidly expanding to a host of different countries, \nincluding India, the Philippines, Malaysia, China, Russia, Israel, and \nIreland.\n  In addition to rapid service sector job losses, consumers are \nconcerned with the growing threat of identity theft. So far, efforts to \nstem this tide and keep up with the technological advancements that \nenable these crimes have done little to allay concerns. This trend \nbecomes all the more alarming when millions of calls involving personal \nfinancial transactions are routed beyond our borders, where they are \nnot protected by our laws and law enforcement. Aside from the very \nserious concerns related to identify theft, there is also a consumer \nawareness element of this problem, as very few Americans are aware that \nthe person on the other end of the telephone line is in another \ncountry. Americans should have full information about the outsourcing \nof call center jobs when they decide who they will purchase their \nproducts and services from.\n  The ``Call Center Consumer's Right to Know Act'' is a simple and \nstraightforward answer to the challenges posed by these unprecedented \nservice sector job losses and growing risks of identity theft. The bill \nsimply requires call center representatives to disclose their physical \nlocation at the beginning of each phone call. Consumers will therefore \nhave important information about who is providing the services in \nquestion and the level of risk involved in proceeding with their \ntransaction by phone. This legislation will help American consumers \nmake informed choices about who is providing the services they \npurchase, and at the same time, addresses the growing problem of U.S. \ncorporations moving hundreds of thousands of service sector jobs \nabroad. Furthermore, my bill will go a long way to restoring consumer \nconfidence in the booming call center market and help provide a measure \nof security for telephone and Internet consumer transactions.\n  There can be no doubt that the outsourcing of these important \nAmerican service sector jobs abroad has played a part in the jobless, \nor what some call the ``job-loss'' economic recovery of 2003. It is \npredicted that future outsourcing of service sector jobs may provide \nmore costly to the US. economy than the loss of American manufacturing \njobs we are witnessing today. Unfortunately, the economics that \nproduced this trend are unlikely to change without a concerted effort \nto both provide companies with an incentive to keep their jobs in \nAmerican and promote consumer awareness of the services they \nunknowingly purchase from other countries. This is precisely what the \nCall Center Consumer's Right to Know Act seeks to accomplish.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1873\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Call Center Consumer's Right \n     to Know Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CALL CENTER REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A United States corporation or its \n     subsidiaries that utilizes a call center to initiate \n     telephone calls to, or receive telephone calls from, \n     individuals located in the United States, shall require each \n     employee in the call center to disclose the physical location \n     of such employee at the beginning of each telephone call so \n     initiated or received.\n       (b) Certification Requirement.--A corporation or subsidiary \n     described in subsection (a) shall annually certify to the \n     Federal Trade Commission whether or not the corporation or \n     subsidiary, and the employees of the corporation or \n     subsidiary at its call centers, have complied with that \n     subsection.\n       (c) Noncompliance.--A corporation or subsidiary that \n     violates subsection (a) shall be subject to such civil \n     penalties as the Federal Trade Commission prescribes under \n     section 3.\n       (d) Call Center Defined.--In this section, the term ``call \n     center'' means a location that provides customer-based \n     service and sales assistance or technical assistance and \n     expertise to individuals located in the United States via \n     telephone, the Internet, or other telecommunications and \n     information technology.\n\n     SEC. 3. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION RULES.\n\n       Not later than 9 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall prescribe rules to \n     provide for effective monitoring and compliance with this \n     Act. The Federal Trade Commission's rulemaking shall include \n     appropriate civil penalties for noncompliance with this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1874. A bill to require Senate candidates to file designations, \nstatements, and reports in electronic form; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will introduce with the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, a bill to bring Senate campaigns into the \n21st century by requiring that Senate candidates file their campaign \nfinance disclosure reports electronically and that those reports be \npromptly made available to the public. This step is long overdue, and I \nhope the Senate will act quickly on this legislation.\n  A recent report by the Campaign Finance Institute highlighted the \nanomaly in the election laws that makes it nearly impossible for the \npublic to get access to Senate campaign finance reports while most \nother reports are available on the Internet within 24 hours of their \nfiling with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The Campaign Finance \nInstitute report opened with a rhetorical question: ``What makes the \nSenate so special that it exempts itself from a key requirement of \ncampaign finance disclosure that applies to everyone else, including \ncandidates for the House of Representatives and Political Action \nCommittees?''\n  The answer, of course, is nothing. The United States Senate is \nspecial in many ways. I am proud to serve here. But there is no \njustification for not making our campaign finance information as \nreadily accessible to the public as the information filed by House \ncandidates or others.\n  My bill amends the section of the election laws dealing with \nelectronic filing to require reports filed with the Secretary of the \nSenate to be filed electronically and forwarded to the FEC within 24 \nhours. The FEC is required to make available on the Internet within 24 \nhours any filing it receives electronically. So if this bill is \nenacted, electronic versions of Senate reports should be available to \nthe public within 48 hours of their filing. That will be a vast \nimprovement over the current situation, which, according to CFI, \nrequires journalists and interested members of the public to review \ncomputer images of paper-filed copies of reports, and involves a \ncompletely wasteful expenditure of hundreds of thousands of dollars to \nre-enter information into databases that almost every campaign has \navailable in electronic format.\n  The current filing system also means that the detailed coding that \nthe FEC does, which allows for more sophisticated searches and \nanalysis, is completed over a week later for Senate reports than for \nHouse reports. This means that the final disclosure reports covering \nthe first 2 weeks of October are not susceptible to detailed scrutiny \nbefore the election.\n  It is time for the Senate to relinquish its Luddite attitude toward \ncampaign finance disclosure. I urge the enactment of this simple bill \nthat will make our reports subject to the same prompt, public scrutiny \nas those filed by PACs and candidates for the other body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S14967]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1874\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senate Campaign Disclosure \n     Parity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENATE CANDIDATES REQUIRED TO FILE ELECTION REPORTS \n                   IN ELECTRONIC FORM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 304(a)(11)(D) of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 434(a)(11)(D)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(D) As used in this paragraph, the terms `designation', \n     `statement', or `report' mean a designation, statement or \n     report, respectively, which--\n       ``(i) is required by this Act to be filed with the \n     Commission, or\n       ``(ii) is required under section 302(g) to be filed with \n     the Secretary of the Senate and forwarded by the Secretary to \n     the Commission.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 302(g)(2) of such Act (2 U.S.C. 432(g)(2)) is \n     amended by inserting ``or 1 working day in the case of a \n     designation, statement, or report filed electronically'' \n     after ``2 working days''.\n       (2) Section 304(a)(11)(B) of such Act (2 U.S.C. \n     434(a)(11)(B)) is amended by inserting ``or filed with the \n     Secretary of the Senate under section 302(g)(1) and forwarded \n     to the Commission'' after ``Act''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to any designation, statement, or report required \n     to be filed after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Russ Feingold \nas a co-sponsor of legislation that will require Senate candidates to \nfile campaign finance reports in electronic form. This bill will \nfinally remove the exemption the Senate has given itself from an \nimportant requirement of campaign finance disclosure laws that apply to \neveryone else, including candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and Political Action Committees, PACs.\n  Political committees active in federal elections must submit their \nquarterly financial reports for disclosure by the Federal Election \nCommission, FEC. Anyone interested can nearly instantaneously download \nthe reports from the FEC website and conduct computer searches to learn \nabout the contributions and expenditures of individual candidates for \nthe House, non-Senate national party committees and PACs. The current \nproblem is that they cannot do the same for Senate candidates and \nparties because of the Senate's insistence on paper rather than \nelectronic filing. The FEC must do more processing of Senate paper \nreports than of House electronic ones. This involves printing or \ncopying the Senate reports, up to 10,000 pages a day at times, hand-\ncoding transactions that cannot be automatically processed, and \nkeypunching the data into the electronic database. House electronic \nreports do not need the same treatment. The end result is that in \ncontrast to the House, information from the Senate paper reports are \noften available well after the election has occurred.\n  Due to this problem, voters are not well-informed about the campaign \nfinance information of their Senators and Senate candidates. For voters \nwho want to consider the nature of the campaign finance support \nreceived by a Senate candidate and its relationship to Senate \nlegislative votes as a factor in deciding for whom they will cast a \nvote, they clearly cannot.\n  To address this problem, our legislation requires Senate candidates \nto file their campaign finance reports electronically with the \nSecretary of the Senate. Within 24 hours of receipt of those reports, \nthe Secretary is required to forward those reports to the FEC. The FEC, \nin turn is required to make those reports available on the Internet \nwithin 24 hours as they do other reports. Therefore, electronic \nversions of Senate reports will be available to the public within 48 \nhours of their filing.\n  Electronic reports are not only transmitted instantly but are more \naccurate than paper submissions because software can easily correct \nmistakes. On the other hand, hand entering of data is always prone to \nerror. Furthermore, the data in electronic reports can be rapidly \nsearched via the Internet for answers to specific questions. Voters \nwill no longer have to go through the time consuming process of reading \npages and pages filed by Senate candidates or Senate party committees \nto figure out the major donors and their employers, and the major \nrecipients of campaign spending. Instead, they can download a filed \nreport from the FEC website onto their personal computers and quickly \nlocate the information they need. This creates effective public \ndisclosure.\n  The Senate's current failure to provide its constituents with \nelectronically disclosed, timely information is unconscionable. Senate \nfilings should follow the same criteria as other campaign finance \nreports. There must not be a separate standard for the Senate. \nIronically, while they do not currently file electronically, Senators \nand Senate candidates already use electronic software in compiling \ntheir paper reports. If Senators and Senate candidates can use \ntechnology to run their offices and websites, why can't they use it to \nbetter inform their own constituents about how their campaigns are \nfunded? Their constituents have earned a right to that information. The \npublic interest will be better served and voters' faith in their \nelected leaders will be restored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/17/senate-section/article/S14967-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2191.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on November 17, 2003, by the President \nof the United States:\n\n     Cybercrime Convention (Treaty Document 108-11).\n\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Council of Europe Convention on \nCybercrime (the ``Cybercrime Convention'' or the ``Convention''), which \nwas signed by the United States on November 23, 2001. In addition, for \nthe information of the Senate, I transmit the report of the Department \nof State with respect to the Convention and the Convention's official \nExplanatory Report.\n  The United States, in its capacity as an observer at the Council of \nEurope, participated actively in the elaboration of the Convention, \nwhich is the only multilateral treaty to address the problems of \ncomputer-related crime and electronic evidence gathering. An overview \nof the Convention's provisions is provided in the report of the \nDepartment of State. The report also sets forth proposed reservations \nand declarations that would be deposited by the United States with its \ninstrument of ratification. With these reservations and declarations, \nthe Convention would not require implementing legislation for the \nUnited States.\n  The Convention promises to be an effective tool in the global effort \nto combat computer-related crime. It requires Parties to criminalize, \nif they have not already done so, certain conduct that is committed \nthrough, against, or related to computer systems. Such substantive \ncrimes include offenses against the ``confidentiality, integrity and \navailability'' of computer data and systems, as well as using computer \nsystems to engage in conduct that would be criminal if committed \noutside the cyber-realm, i.e., forgery, fraud, child pornography, and \ncertain copyright-related offenses. The Convention also requires \nParties to have the ability to investigate computer-related crime \neffectively and to obtain electronic evidence in all types of criminal \ninvestigations and proceedings.\n  By providing for broad international cooperation in the form of \nextradition and mutual legal assistance, the Cybercrime Convention \nwould remove or minimize legal obstacles to international cooperation \nthat delay or endanger U.S. investigations and prosecutions of \ncomputer-related crime. As such, it would help deny ``safe havens'' to \ncriminals, including terrorists, who can cause damage to U.S. interests \nfrom abroad using computer systems. At the same time, the Convention \ncontains safeguards that protect civil liberties and other legitimate \ninterests.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Cybercrime Convention, and that it give its advice and consent to \nratification, subject to the reservations, declarations, and \nunderstanding described in the accompanying report of the Department of \nState.\n                                                      George W.
