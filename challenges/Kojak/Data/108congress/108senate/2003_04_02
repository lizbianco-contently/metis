Mr. President, I take a couple of moments to comment on \nthe actions in support of our troops in Iraq. First, our condolences, \nas always, go out to the families of those who have lost loved ones. \nBeing from Tennessee, I particularly express my sympathies to the \nfamily of Marine LCpl Patrick Nixon from Gallatin, TN, who was killed \nwhile attempting to secure a critical bridge across the Euphrates River \nin Nasiriyah.\n  I also offer our prayers and condolences for those who have lost \nloved ones, and also offer prayers to those in the field fighting for \nus.\n  I commend the tremendous performance of our Armed Forces and continue \nto be amazed by their degree of professionalism, their boldness, and \nthe courage they represent each and every day. There will be tough days \nahead, as we all know, but we all feel the steady progress being made.\n  I take a moment to commend the Navy SEALs and Army rangers who \nrescued PFC Jessica Lynch from a hospital in Nasiriyah where she was \nbeing held. Most people had the opportunity to see the very dramatic \nfootage a few hours ago of her being rescued by those special forces. \nWe join with her family and friends in Palestine, WV, in celebrating \nher recovery. This is one more example of the outstanding flexibility, \ntraining, and performance of America's military men and women.\n  I should mention, because it relates to a trip I took this weekend in \nvisiting the base at the 101st Airborne in Tennessee, I had the \nopportunity to visit with Major General Petraeus's wife, Holly \nPetraeus, whom I first met 11 years ago when they previously had been \nstationed at Fort Campbell. I got to know her at that point in time and \nsaw her when General Petraeus and I had the opportunity to start the \nArmy 10-miler together a few months ago. I say ``start'' because I am a \nslow runner; when we started the race, he took out ahead of me after \nthe first 20 yards.\n\n  General Petraeus now is on the front page of the Washington Post. The \nopening paragraph:\n\n       U.S. Army troops seized the southern edge of this key \n     Euphrates River city today as Iraqi militia fighters appeared \n     to retreat in the face of overwhelming firepower. . . .\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\n       Shortly before 2 p.m., Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus, \n     commander of the 101st Airborne, drove in an armed convoy up \n     a rocky escarpment into Najaf, urged on by clapping Iraqis \n     who gestured impatiently for the Americans to press deeper \n     into the city center.\n\n  It gives me a great deal of pride for the 101st Airborne to be able \nto hear these real-life stories of the bravery and boldness of General \nPetraeus. I was with Holly Petraeus this past Sunday at the 101st \nAirborne. She hosted Karen, my wife, and me to lunch and attending a \nchurch service. She is doing a tremendous job of keeping up the spirit \nof all the families there and has become a real focal point for the \ncommunity efforts in Hawesville, KY, Clarksville, TN, and on the base \nto support our troops. We have a lot to be proud of, with tough days \nahead.\n  Meanwhile, the Senate will be addressing the supplemental emergency \nspending in order to support our troops, as well as the underlying \nbudget, which I hope to complete--which we will complete by April 11.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4652-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the troops. \nI am totally amazed when I watch the television reports at the bravery \ndisplayed by those who are serving our Nation in harm's way.\n  There is a saying from the Scriptures that:\n\n       A man can have no greater love than to lay down his life \n     for his friends.\n\n  The motto of my home State of Nevada is: All for our country. Nevada \nhas a long and proud history of patriotism and contributing to this \nNation's defense in times of peace and in times of conflict. Many brave \nNevadans have proudly donned the uniform of our armed services. \nUnfortunately, some of our finest have lost their lives in service to \nour Nation.\n  Nevada has lost several servicemen during the ongoing war on \nterrorism, and last week we learned of our first casualty in Operation \nIraqi Freedom. LT Fred Pokorney was killed during a cowardly ambush on \nour marines near An Nasiriyah, Iraq. His death has brought the reality \nof war to families across Nevada. His life and dedication have touched \nand inspired me.\n  I wish I had known Fred when he played for the Tonopah High School \nbasketball and football teams. I only had the opportunity to learn \nabout this gentle giant, for that is what he was, since he made the \nultimate sacrifice for me, my family, for all Nevadans, and all \nAmericans.\n  It should not come as a surprise, but when I learn about these brave \nmen and women who risk their lives and sacrifice so much to defend our \nfreedom, I am awed by the caliber of their character, integrity, and \ndedication. Fred Pokorney is the perfect example.\n  Nothing was handed to Fred. He overcame challenges that would have \nbeen an excuse for others to quit. He was incredibly well liked for his \npositive attitude and competitive spirit. He joined the Marines right \nout of high school and graduated with a degree in military science from \nOregon State University, also my alma mater. He loved being a marine.\n  A tremendous void is being felt by those who knew Fred best. Just as \nit is inspiring to hear about the character of men and women who serve \nin our military, it is heartening to speak to those left behind and \nhear the pride they somehow find the strength to share. When I spoke to \nFred's wife--she goes by Chelle--it was obvious her husband is a hero \nto her as he is to us all. She is comforted by the knowledge that she \nknew what it was to have peace and love.\n  Now she is charged with raising their 2\\1/2\\ year old daughter \nTaylor--and passing Fred's legacy on to her, and Fred's love for \ncountry on to us all.\n  On the telephone last week, Chelle read me the last letter Fred wrote \nto her and to his daughter Taylor. I would have brought those letters \nto the floor but, frankly, I could not have read those letters without \nbreaking down because of the emotions that were communicated from one \nof our soldiers on the battlefield to his family.\n  Chelle told me Fred's death, though, gave her hope. She feels a \nresponsibility to take Fred's pride, strength, and deep patriotism, and \ninstill it in other Americans. So long as freedom thrives and she can \nhelp other Marine families heal, Chelle knows Fred's death will not \nhave been in vain.\n  What Chelle does not realize is that she, too, is a hero. The \nfamilies who support our military wait anxiously for word from their \nloved ones and continue the motions of life while their loved ones are \naway. They are heroes also. Without their strength and support, our \ntroops could not be the best in the world. I stand here today, grateful \nfor the bravery of Fred Pokorney and inspired by the courage of Chelle \nPokorney and others like them.\n\n  For Taylor, I pray she grows up to know that her father's death on \nthe battlefield of freedom was not in vain. I pray when she is older, \nTaylor will know the gratitude of this Nation for her father's \nsacrifice, and for her sacrifice.\n  God bless LT Fred Pokorney and God bless his family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while I know there are some who may have \ndifferent views about what is happening in Iraq and our country's role \nin it, I think there is really no disagreement in our country about \nwhat our sons and daughters do for America when they are sent to fight \nfor freedom. There should be no disagreement about our support for the \ntroops that are in harm's way halfway across the world.\n  My colleague from Nevada and others have spoken eloquently about the \ncommitment these young men and women have made to their country. They \nleave home, they leave the comforts of their community, they leave \ntheir family, and they march in the face of danger.\n  This morning I went to Bethesda Naval Hospital to visit a young man \nwhom I had appointed to the Naval Academy some 12 years ago. His name \nis Jason Frei from Hazen, ND. A wonderful young man, he has kept in \ntouch with me each year since he graduated from the Naval Academy, \nsending me Christmas cards, telling me how he is doing and what he is \ndoing.\n  He left his wife and two children to go to Iraq with his Marine unit. \nJason was wounded last week and is now back at Bethesda Naval Hospital. \nHe has lost a part of his arm. His eardrum was punctured. He was \ninjured by a rocket-propelled grenade when it hit his vehicle.\n  He is a remarkable man. This morning he was very positive. He was in \ngood spirits and he told me about the men and women with whom he \nserved. This morning in the hospital he was most concerned about his \nunit, which is still in Iraq--how they were doing, what they were \ndoing. He is, I think, symbolic of those brave men and women who always \nanswer the call for our country.\n  This is a young man from a small town in North Dakota, but he could \nbe a young man or woman from a town anywhere in America who, when his \ncountry needs him, answers the call.\n  In North Dakota, we have the highest percentage of callups in the \nGuard and Reserve of any State in the Nation. More than one-third of \nour National Guard and Reserve have been called to active duty.\n  A young woman on my staff in Bismarck has been called to active duty \nwith the National Guard, a young lieutenant. They go and serve because \nthey are called to serve our country.\n  I recall one day at a veterans' hospital in Fargo, ND, pinning the \nmedals on the pajama tops of a Native American named Edmund Young Eagle \nwho served during World War II. He had never gotten his medals. His \nsisters asked if I could help get the medals for him, whom I didn't \nknow just a week from death. He had lung cancer. We got his medals and \non a Sunday morning\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nwe went to the VA hospital, and his sisters came and the doctors and \nnurses came in the room, and I pinned the medals he won during World \nWar II on his pajama tops.\n  This very sick man, with lung cancer, who had answered the call from \nhis Indian reservation to go to Africa and Europe and fight for this \ncountry, came back from the war and lived a life that was pretty \nspartan. He didn't ever have very much. But this man, with the medals \nnow pinned on his pajama tops, told me it was one of the proudest days \nof his life because he had served his country and his country was \nsaying to him: Thank you.\n  There are so many young men and women today who are serving their \ncountry. This Congress and the American people need to say to them, in \nevery way, every day: Thank you.\n  An author once wrote:\n\n       When the night is full of knives, the lightning is seen, \n     and the drums are heard, the patriots always step forward, \n     ready to fight and die if necessary to preserve freedom.\n\n  This country should have enormous gratitude for having such men and \nwomen, such patriots who always step forward. One of those patriots is \nJason Frei, who, I am proud to say this morning, is doing well at the \nBethesda Naval Hospital and who, we hope, will be released in a matter \nof days but who, again, worries a great deal about the troops with whom \nhe served. He cares a great deal about this country and about their \nfate.\n  Let us all hope very much that this war is over soon, that its result \nis decisive, that Saddam Hussein is replaced, that the people of Iraq \nare no longer the victims of his tyranny, and that our sons and \ndaughters come back to our country and return to their loved ones.\n  When they do, let America again say thank you, thank you for serving \nthis great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about joy and \nalso apprehension. In Palestine, WV, they are celebrating the rescue \nyesterday of PFC Jessica Lynch from an Iraqi hospital. I am sure most \npeople who watch C-SPAN have also seen the incredible pictures of that \noperation, seeing our Navy SEALs, our Army special forces, our Marines \nteaming up to go in and take a hospital because they had information \nthat some of our prisoners of war might be there. It was a great act of \ncourage on their part.\n  We are all celebrating the return of Jessica Lynch. In her Army \nhometown of El Paso, TX, they are celebrating. Her rescue has given \nhope and comfort to the families of the other missing or captured \nmembers of Fort Bliss's 507th Maintenance Company that they, too, might \nbe returned to their homes and families.\n  Retired MSgt Claude Johnson, father of prisoner of war SP Shoshana \nJohnson, was thrilled to learn PFC Jessica Lynch had been found. I \nquote:\n\n       I am very, very, very glad that Jessica has been returned \n     and that she is safe. As I have said previously, it is not \n     just about Shoshana. It's about all the prisoners who are \n     over there, and I hope and pray that each and every one of \n     them can come home safe, just like Jessica did. The rescue of \n     Lynch gives everybody hope that the rest of [those missing or \n     captured] will be returned.\n\n  I talked to Mr. Johnson early on after Shoshana was taken captive and \nwas shown on Iraqi television. She is a former Army personnel person. I \nwas able to share with him the great attention that all of us are \ngiving to all of those prisoners of war and missing in action. I told \nhim that everything would be done to find them and to rescue them if \npossible. We hope this is the first of good news. But we also know that \nour forces are doing everything possible to determine if there are \nothers there and also to try to get them home if they are.\n  We commend the brave marines and special ops forces and the SEALs who \nwere involved in this dramatic rescue. As details come out, I know we \nwill be even more proud of what they have achieved. Now we hope that in \nthe days ahead there will be other good news for those families of \nsoldiers from Fort Bliss and Fort Hood; that they, too, will be \nreunited with their families.\n  All of America is riveted on that wonderful story, but we also know \nthere is more news to come, and we will wait anxiously to hear about \nothers.\n  I also want to take time to discuss personal stories we get from the \nfield because the press over there is seeing the individual sacrifices \nour young men and women in the military are making that show so much \nabout our values. I want to share one of those vignettes. Then I want \nto ask my friend and colleague from Idaho to also do the same because \nhe, too, has troops from Idaho in the field.\n  This morning I start by talking about CPT Chris Carter. This comes \nfrom Chris Tomlinson, the Associated Press, from Hindiyah, Iraq. I want \nto show this picture because it illustrates exactly what these forces \nare doing. This is a story that goes with this picture. You see in this \npicture a woman in a black veil sitting on a bridge. Here are the \nAmerican troops who are trying to take this bridge.\n\n       ``We've got to get her off that bridge,'' he said.\n       Capt. Chris Carter winced at the risks his men would have \n     to take. Engaged in a raid on this Euphrates River town, they \n     were battling for a bridge when, through the smoke, they saw \n     the elderly woman. She had tried to race across the bridge \n     when the U.S. soldiers arrived, but was caught in crossfire.\n       At first they thought she was dead, like the man sprawled \n     in the dust nearby. But during breaks in the gunfire that \n     whizzed over her head, she sat up and waved for help.\n       Carter, a 32-year old Army Ranger, ordered his Bradley \n     Fighting Vehicle to move forward while he and two other men \n     ran behind it. They took cover behind the bridges' iron \n     beams. Carter tossed a smoke grenade for more cover and \n     approached the woman, who was crying and pointing at a wound \n     on her hip.\n       She wore a black abayah, a robe common among older women in \n     the countryside. Blood soaked through the fabric onto the \n     pavement around her.\n       Medics put the woman on a stretcher and into an ambulance; \n     Carter stood by, providing cover with his M-16 automatic \n     rifle. Then she was gone, and the battle raged on for the \n     town of 80,000 about 50 mile south of Baghdad.\n       By the end of the day, the Army unit would fight street to \n     street, capture or kill scores of Iraqui soldiers, blow up a \n     Baath Party headquarters and destroy heaps of ammunition and \n     mortars. No US. soldiers were killed, but from the beginning \n     officers in the 4th Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment described \n     the mission as ``hairy.''\n       ``Yeah, hold a strategic bridge with one infantry company \n     that has only two platoons--a hell of a mission,'' Lt. Col. \n     Philip DeCamp, the battalion commander, said with a smile.\n\n  I yield to my colleague from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address the \nSenate today with my colleague from Texas and others who have joined us \nand will in the future to take the time set aside by our leadership to \ntalk about our troops and to give them the thanks of a grateful Nation \nas they fight in Iraq to protect our freedom.\n  Today I want to begin by sharing another vignette, this one is from \nthe Army Times written by Robert Hodierne and Jane McHugh. It is about \na heroic act that occurred in Iraq during some of the early days of the \nfighting. This is a picture with the wrong name on it. I will explain. \nWhen it was first reported, it said ``Joseph DeWitt.'' But after \nfurther evaluation--this picture made it on the front page of a number \nof newspapers around the country, and people started checking into it.\n  It was actually Joseph P. Dwyer, age 26, who is still in the field in \nIraq. A few days ago, when this report I will discuss was written, he \nwas still 80 miles outside of Baghdad with his division, the 3rd \nInfantry. What we see is obvious. It is one of our soldiers carrying a \nyoung Iraqi boy to safety. But there is a story behind this picture \nthat illustrates the bravery and commitment of our troops in Iraq, not \njust to cause a regime change and to overthrow Saddam Hussein and \nrestore peace and freedom in Iraq and peace and freedom in the world, \nbut also to do so in a way that causes the least amount of collateral \ndamage.\n\n  I will stop before I go into this vignette to make a point. There are\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\nmany nations in the world that, when war begins, would not pay \nattention to the collateral damage, the injuries of innocent civilians. \nSaddam Hussein, as we know, has killed tens of thousands of innocent \npeople just for the accomplishment of an objective of war.\n  But our Nation, as we conduct this battle, is conducting it in a way \nthat literally puts our men and women in the military at greater risk \nbecause of the decision to try to reduce the risk presented by the war \nto those who are innocent. I think it is important for us to note that \nour men and women in the armed services are incurring this greater risk \nbecause of our commitment and theirs to make sure that we do not injure \none unnecessary person as we conduct this war.\n  You can see here a young grimy soldier in full battle gear. You can \nsee the level of concern on his face as he carries this wounded young \nIraqi boy to safety. What is the story behind this picture? As I have \nindicated, Joseph Dwyer is 26, and he is still with the 3rd Infantry \nDivision in Iraq. Until just a few days ago, he didn't really have a \nclue how famous he was. His name was misidentified in the first prints \nof the picture. By the time he was identified, his picture was one that \npeople around the world had seen. When he was told about it, his \nreaction was that he laughed out loud. For a few moments, he could not \nstop laughing. He said afterward that he was both amused and \nembarrassed at the notoriety he had achieved. ``Really, I was just one \nof a group of guys. I wasn't standing out more than anyone else,'' he \nsaid during this telephone conversation during some rare down time.\n  Dwyer has lived for the past 6 years in Wagram, NC, where his parents \nmoved after his father retired as a New York transit policeman. This \nyoung man's family has been in law enforcement. His father is a retired \npoliceman. He grew up in Mt. Sinai on New York's Long Island. His three \nolder brothers are New York City policemen. If you think about that and \nremember 9/11, he had three brothers who were New York City policemen \nwhen he found out the news about what was happening on 9/11. None of \nhis brothers was lost on 9/11, but one of them lost a partner on 9/11. \nThat is how close the casualties came to his personal family.\n  He said: ``I mean everybody lost someone, a lot of good people.'' He \nsaid he was sure for a long time that he had lost someone too. He \nbelieved one of his brothers had probably been killed. He said: ``I \nthought he was gone.'' But when he talked to his brother on the night \nof September 11 and learned he was safe, Dwyer said: ``I knew I had to \ndo something.'' So 2 days later he enlisted in the Army and became a \nmedic. He said: ``It was just what I could do at the time.''\n  People from across America jumped in and did what they could after 9/\n11. This young man joined the Army to help protect and defend the \nUnited States interests and is now doing that in Iraq. On Tuesday \nmorning, when the now-famous image of Dwyer was taken, his unit, the \n3rd Squadron of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, had been ambushed repeatedly \nthe night before as they worked their way along the north side of the \nEuphrates River. Just as the Sun was rising, they were ambushed again \nby Iraqi troops firing from tree lines on both sides of the road. The \nAmericans fired back with everything they had and called in airstrikes \nto help them. In the middle of this firefight, an Iraqi family was \ncaught in the crossfire. When the fighting stopped, the father of the \nfamily came running out screaming that his family needed help. Dwyer \nsays: ``It came over that there was a family that had some injuries. We \nwent down there. It was kind of hectic at first. . . . We didn't know \nwhat was going on. Who was friendly and who wasn't.''\n\n  Here is an example of how our troops are putting themselves in harm's \nway because of their interest in making sure that we reduce the \ncasualties to innocent people.\n  ``We didn't want to get too close to the village, knowing that there \ncould be possible enemy there,'' he went on. ``We saw him with the \nchild. He came running out to where we had the hospital set up.''\n  Then he and some other soldiers, guns at the ready, bolted from their \ncover to help. Dwyer reached the father and grabbed his son from him, \ncradling the young boy in a protective embrace as he raced back to \nsafer ground. That is when Army Times photographer Warren Zinn snapped \nthis picture.\n  The boy, who is about 4 years old, ``grabbed right onto me, that was \nthe weird thing,'' Dwyer said. ``The kid was doing all right. I could \nfeel him breathing real hard, and I was just carrying him and he didn't \ncry one bit and you know he was a cute little kid. He was scared, \nthough, you could tell. You know, for the father to trust us to take \nhis child over and know that we would take care of him, maybe it's just \nme being optimistic, but I think it was a good feeling knowing he \ntrusted us to take his child. It was a little kid. I have little nieces \nand nephews back home. . . . It was just a kid, it wasn't an enemy. \nThis is what I signed up to do, to help people.''\n  That day was the first time Dwyer treated any wounded. The little boy \nhad a broken left leg, but Dwyer says he is going to make a quick \nrecovery. Though gratifying as the encounter may have been, it left him \nwith lingering concerns. He wishes he could talk to the family.\n  ``I wonder how they felt about us,'' he said. ``I mean, if I was in \ntheir position and this was going on, I'd be mad at me, you know, for \nbeing here. I don't know. I wouldn't mind being able to talk to him, \nthat's for sure.''\n  Dwyer nevertheless is glad to be in Iraq. ``I know that people are \ngoing to be better for it. The whole world will be. I hope being here \nis positive because we are a caring group of people out here. If they \nfind out, that would be great. Maybe they'd stop shooting.''\n  Mr. President, here we have one more specific example of an act of \nbravery, heroism, which is happening time and time again in Iraq. As we \nsee the scenes on TV of the bombs exploding and the troops moving, we \nthink about our troops being engaged in battle, but we don't think \nabout the fact that, as they are engaged in battle, they are also doing \neverything they can to help those who are innocent, who didn't start or \ncause this war, to be protected from harm's way.\n  I conclude my remarks by again expressing on my behalf, and I believe \non behalf of the entire Senate and the Congress, and, frankly, the \nUnited States people, our thanks to our men and women in the armed \nservices for the service they are giving.\n  I spoke in the Chamber a few days ago about an Idahoan who has given \nthe extreme sacrifice. He lost his life in this battle. We will have, \nunfortunately, more stories like that. As a nation, we give our \nthoughts and our prayers and our grateful thanks to the men and women \nin our Armed Forces who are putting their lives on the line for our \nfreedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for \nsharing that story with us. It reminds us of what is being done that we \nmight not see over here, but it is those one-on-one things that that \nIraqi father is going to remember.\n  I want to do another story from the field. This one is written by \nJulian Barnes of U.S. News and World Report. He is with the 101st \nAirmobile Division Apache Pilots. Here we have the picture of an Apache \nhelicopter firing an antimissile flare. This was taken April 7. The \nstory:\n\n       Chief Warrant Officer Ted Hazen has been flying attack \n     helicopters for years. Last week, he finally flew one into \n     combat. ``It was everything I expected,'' he says, ``and not \n     anything like I expected.'' It was the first deep-strike \n     attack by the 101st Airborne Division, and Hazen was at the \n     controls of the command chopper, helping direct the fleet of \n     Apache Longbows into battle some 50 miles south of Baghdad. \n     In front of him, the other pilots locked on the Republican \n     Guard tanks and armored vehicles and let loose their hellfire \n     missiles. ``I saw that first shot go out and bang, hit,'' he \n     says. ``Then there was a hellacious secondary explosion. \n     Flames went 100 feet into the air.''\n       After engaging the first tank, the Apaches' fuel began \n     running low. A squadron of British Harrier jets continued the \n     attack as the Apaches turned south, back to base. But heading \n     home is almost as tough as attacking. Powerful tailwinds can \n     cause blinding brownouts. The first two of the 101st's \n     Apaches crashed while trying to land. Hazen is philosophical. \n     After all, it's tricky business trying to land a big chopper \n     totally blind. How tricky? ``The best thing to say,'' Hazen \n     mused, ``is open your garage door,\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\n     turn your lights off, line yourself up, go 20 miles per hour \n     and hit your brakes and see if you stop in time.''\n\n  That sort of thing brings it home.\n  I wish to read an article about the 173rd Airborne Brigade. This is a \npicture of the paratroopers who took the airfield in northern Iraq. A \nU.S. soldier stands guard next to his colleagues digging in near the \nHarir airstrip. They are excavating earth into trucks northeast of \nArbil in northern Iraq. Harir airfield is in Kurdish-controlled \nnorthern Iraq where U.S. soldiers from the 173rd Airborne unit \nparachuted into position.\n  The article is by Bay Fang, U.S. News & World Report. He is with the \n173rd Airborne Brigade:\n\n       The man is covered in mud. ``I landed in a puddle,'' he \n     says sheepishly. ``It was a great landing, other than where I \n     landed.'' He and the other members of the 173rd Airborne \n     Brigade dropped into northern Iraq the night before, but they \n     still have not had a chance to clean up. They are fanned out \n     across the airstrip here, dun-colored figures dotting the \n     lush green fields, diggings foxholes, setting up their guns.\n       Another paratrooper checks a jeep-mounted machine gun and \n     gestures at the fields and mountains shrouded in mist. ``I \n     have total sympathy for the men in Vietnam, walking through \n     the rice paddies,'' he says. ``I don't see how they did it. \n     This isn't half as bad. And it's tough, this terrain out \n     here.''\n       Up the road, a special forces officer haggles over a \n     truckload of wood his men need for heat. They chose to send \n     the troops in by parachute rather than plane, he says, for \n     reasons of both efficiency and psychological impact. ``It \n     sends a dramatic message to the whole region that U.S. forces \n     are here,'' he says. ``I think we can say that the northern \n     front is already underway.''\n       The north has indeed begun to move. Late that afternoon, I \n     hear that Iraqi forces have pulled back from the ridge \n     overlooking Chamchamal, the frontline town where I have been \n     staying, to positions just outside Kirkuk. Kurdish fighters, \n     known as peshmerga--\n\n  Described as ``those who face death''--\n\n     and curious townspeople have rushed up the mountainside. Some \n     are here to inspect the area inhabited by their enemy for the \n     past 12 years. Some have come to loot. But most are simply \n     tourists, hoping to visit places once forbidden to them.\n       Arivan Ahmed stands on the remains of a hilltop bunker. He \n     used to pass through this place every day on his smuggling \n     run from Kirkuk to Chamchamal and bribe the soldiers at what \n     was called the Challenger checkpoint. ``They sometimes took \n     my shoes from me, so I would have to go back barefoot to \n     Chamchamal,'' he says. That was before the American bombing \n     started and all traffic stopped. ``I used to be very afraid \n     every time I came through here. Now I am just happy to stand \n     here on this ground.'' He holds a rusty hammerhead in his \n     fist that he scrounged from the rubble, and says that is \n     enough of a memento for him.\n       The road is now open 12 miles deep into what was Iraqi \n     territory. All along it, I see scenes of defiance and \n     celebration. A man drives a bulldozer into a cement plaque in \n     the middle of the road. It bears pictures of Saddam Hussein--\n     wearing a western-style suit on one side, and Kurdish dress \n     on the other. It takes him 15 minutes to topple the plaque, \n     and he wipes the sweat off his forehead with a laugh. ``It is \n     very strong--he spent all of Iraq's money on plaques like \n     these!'' he says. I just wish I could go to Baghdad and do \n     the same to the man himself.''\n       The peshmerga express the same impatience with beginning \n     the drive down south. But their commanders, sensitive \n     about being seen to cooperate with America, make sure we \n     understand that their forces will not move in \n     unilaterally. It is not the peshmerga taking the newly \n     vacated regions, they say, it is the people themselves. \n     ``These areas we are moving into, they belong to us,'' \n     says Gen. Rostam Hamid Rahim, the top peshmerga commander \n     from Kirkuk. ``The citizens have moved back to the \n     liberated area, and we are just protecting them.''\n       At the end of the newly opened road, Kirkuk shimmers like a \n     mirage on the horizon, still about 12 miles away. ``It is the \n     Jerusalem of Kurdistan, and we would like to be free,'' says \n     the mayor of Chamchamal, walking briskly toward it as the sun \n     sets. He and everyone else here want to return soon, fighting \n     their way through if necessary. But they have a new phrase \n     for their suppressed hopes: Instead of inshallah, meaning \n     ``God willing,'' it is Insha-Bush.''\n\n  This is the picture taken that first day after the paratroopers \nlanded in the north of Iraq.\n  I will show a few more pictures because I do believe that pictures \nsay a thousand words. A lot of people have seen the pictures from the \nfield of our troops in combat doing everyday activities. I want to show \nsome pictures about what life is like over there for our soldiers.\n  Here our soldiers are sleeping next to their tanks on a highway that \nthey have taken. They just laid down on the cement, covered their \nheads, and are taking what I am sure is a long hoped for respite right \nin the middle of the day because they have been moving at night. They \nare taking the rest when they can get it. We see a couple of soldiers \njust cannot sleep. They are awake and talking. But some of them are \nsleeping with their rifles on and their boots on the ground.\n  This is another picture showing soldiers sleeping. This was during \nthat sandstorm that many of us saw. These soldiers are wrapped up, \ntrying to protect their faces, their noses from inhaling that dust and \nsand. We see one soldier sleeping sitting up with a rifle on his lap, \nand we see another soldier laying down also with a face mask on trying \nto protect from that dust. Clearly, they are so tired that they will \nsleep anywhere.\n  These are troops digging trenches, trying to set up for potential \nwarfare. They, too, are trying to rest before the battle that might \nensue. We see them sleeping in their trenches, standing in their \ntrenches that they just worked so hard to dig. We see the trucks that \nare lined up to protect them in case there is an enemy out there.\n  That is a fitting end to showing what our troops are enduring every \nday as they are on the front lines fighting for every one of us, \nfighting for our way of life, fighting for our right to speak on the \nSenate floor, the right to be in the Galleries listening, the right to \nwatch C-SPAN2 cover the Senate every day. They are fighting for the \nright of each of us to kiss our babies in the morning as we go off to \nour jobs or as we give them the chance to play with some of their \nfriends. Every one of the activities we are doing every day is being \nprotected by those men and women in the field as we speak today.\n  We are starting the Senate every morning with 1 hour of tribute to \nour troops, talking about something that has happened that shows \nAmerican values shining through to the people of the world. We are \ndoing this to honor our troops, to let their families know we will not \nforget them for 1 minute, and that we appreciate what they are doing \nevery single minute of the day.\n  We will do this every day our troops are in the field in Iraq, until \nthis war is over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the miraculous \nrescue of a young West Virginian. Today, a community in West Virginia \nis celebrating amazing news. For many days, the people of the small \ntown of Palestine--very appropriate--in Wirt County, WV, have been \ngripped with concern for PFC Jessica Lynch. She is part of the Army's \n507th Maintenance Company convoy that was ambushed near the southern \nIraqi town of Nasiriyah on March 23. Since that day, no word had been \nheard from PFC Jessica Lynch. The Army did not know where she was. The \nDefense Department did not know where she was. Her family did not know \nwhere she was. Her family could only be told that she was missing.\n  For each painstaking hour, over each nerve-racking day, the family \nand friends of Jessica Lynch awaited word. They held on to each other, \nthey prayed together, they grasped for hope, and they held on to faith.\n  Then last night, in the afternoon late, the telephone rang. Good \nnews. Amazing news. A miracle had happened: PFC Jessica Lynch has been \nfound in a hospital in Iraq. She was rescued in a daring effort by the \nbrave Army Rangers and Navy SEALS. Today, she is safe--safe once again.\n  Her State of West Virginia is relieved. Her community is exuberant. \nHer family is overjoyed. I spoke with Jessica Lynch's father last \nevening and shared with him our thoughts. The news of Jessica's rescue \nspread through the county and throughout the State like wildfire. Wirt \nCounty has fewer than 6,000 residents, and it appeared as though every \none of those people were out honking horns and hugging neighbors last \nnight. Jessica Lynch's parents and siblings were not alone. Jessica has \nbecome a part of everyone's family.\n  As a nation, while we celebrate this rescue, we remain steadfast in \nour concern for the other members of the armed services who are listed \nas missing or captured. We look forward to\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\none day celebrating their safe rescue and return.\n  We also pray for those families whose loved ones will not be coming \nhome. When we say we pray for them, that is what we mean. Jessica Lynch \nwas found and is safe today. She was preserved. She lived because of \nthe prayers that went up to Heaven from the people of the community and \nfrom people all over the Nation.\n  Hundreds of people gathered yesterday for the funeral service of West \nHamlim, WV, native Therrel Shane Childers, a U.S. marine who became the \nfirst American combat casualty in the war in Iraq. The Chaplain at the \nservice yesterday noted that First Lieutenant Childers ``emanated a \ncourageous sense about him, that nothing scared him.''\n  We must continue to wrap our arms around the hundreds of thousands of \nfamilies of those men and women engaged in military action. Each day, \neach hour they struggle with worry and concern. They do not struggle \nalone. To those families, know that the Nation is with you at each step \nand at every turn. May God have mercy on your loved ones and may He \nbring them safely home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I want to recognize Oklahoma's first \nloss in the fight for our country's security and our country's freedom \nand future.\n  LCpl Thomas ``Tommy'' Alan Blair from Broken Arrow, OK, was killed in \nthe line of duty on or about March 23. Lance Corporal Blair was \ndescribed as a born leader, an enthusiastic student, and a confident \nyoung man who loved Oklahoma and his country.\n  I remember him well when I went out and talked to him and some of the \nothers before their deployment. All of them were enthusiastic, all of \nthem were courageous, but all of them knew they were risking their \nlives.\n  He was killed when an enemy rocket-propelled grenade hit and \ndestroyed his amphibious assault vehicle as it was traveling near \nNasiriyah, Iraq.\n  This battle was described as the sharpest battle in the war to date, \nand Lance Corporal Blair paid the ultimate price--his life. Let me say \nagain, he gave his life. Why would a person pay this price? Why would a \nperson risk facing this fear and die in combat? Lance Corporal Blair \nfought and died because he was an American, he was a marine, and he \nknew what freedom really means--the freedom most Iraqis have never \nknown, and a freedom most Americans take for granted.\n  He fought for Americans who have already forgotten our freedoms were \nattacked on 9/11. He fought for the pundits who think this war is about \noil. He fought for the protesters who have always had the freedom to \nexpress their opinions but never considered what it requires to protect \nand secure these freedoms for the future.\n  Expressing your opinion in Iraq may cost your tongue being cut out of \nyour mouth, it may cost your wife being raped in front of your \nchildren, or your family may just disappear. If you are lucky, it may \nonly cost a bullet in your head without the suffering.\n  How could such a place void of these fundamental freedoms exist on \nGod's green Earth? This place does exist. It is Iraq under the rule of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  Does the average American consider life without these freedoms? Does \nthe average American consider the life of an Iraqi? Does the average \nAmerican know the bravery Lance Corporal Blair felt in the last seconds \nof his life? I would say not.\n  Lance Corporal Blair considered these freedoms and he considered them \nimportant enough to join the Marine Corps, serve his country, and \neventually sacrifice his life. He gave his life for the continued \nfreedom and security of the American people. He gave his life for the \nnew freedom the Iraqi people will enjoy.\n  I do remember talking to his group. Many of the people at that time \nwere saying: Why are we so concerned about Iraq? Why not go after Osama \nbin Laden or some of the other areas? They forget what we are going \nthrough now is not a war, it is a battle in Iraq. The war was declared \nby the President of the United States at 8:30 in the evening on \nSeptember 11, that fateful day. This is the No. 1 terrorist out there, \nby any measure. How many people has he tortured? How many people has he \nmurdered? He is the premier terrorist of our time and has to be \neradicated.\n  I ask us and all Americans to think about the freedoms we take for \ngranted, to think about the fear the Iraqi people feel every day, and \nthink about the sacrifice LCpl Thomas Blair and his fellow countrymen \nhave made to ensure we will always enjoy these fundamental freedoms.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family as they deal with the \ntragic loss of their son, LCpl Thomas Alan Blair.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, last night, an extraordinary event \nhappened in Iraq: The extraction and rescue of PFC Jessica Lynch of \nWest Virginia who comes from the small town of Palestine in Wirt County \nwith a population of about 5,800. She was in a hospital in Nasiriyah, \nwith others, where she had been held captive.\n  Through superb coordination of the Navy SEALs, Marines, and Army \nRangers, U.S. forces went in, created diversions, rescued her, and \nbrought her to safety. She is now on a C-17 on her way to Ramstein Air \nForce Base where she will receive treatment. She has many broken bones \nand other injuries, but none of them are life threatening.\n  She was part of the Army's 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company and was \nmoving with the 3rd Infantry Division north toward Baghdad. It was that \nclassic case where the group made a right turn instead of going \nstraight ahead, and they were captured. Not all of her fellow soldiers \nwere so lucky, but she is known to be in very good spirits. I have seen \npictures of her, as I think we all have, and I have spoken with her \nparents to express my thoughts of her being rescued.\n  I have to say that in a time of great stress, worry, and loss in this \ncountry, there do come high points and this is one of them. This \nprivate is 19 years old. She wants to be a teacher. She was rescued by \npeople who showed the most extraordinary skill and heroism.\n  What is interesting is her desire to be a teacher. Even when she went \noverseas, she told a kindergarten class in her hometown of Palestine, \nWV, that she wanted to have a pen pal relationship with them from the \nfield. By having this communication, she believed they could get a \nbetter sense of what war was like rather than just watching TV, reading \nthe newspapers, or listening to the radio.\n  As my senior colleague, Senator Byrd, knows well, Palestine is a very \nfriendly, very proud place where people struggle hard in a rural county \nto give the best possible life for their daughters and sons. I think \nJessica Lynch has already started her role as a teacher. She has taught \nall of us. The Nation took her to heart because of the innocence and \nthe beauty of her young face. The Nation prayed over her, worried over \nher, as we all did. She was rescued. She was delivered back to us, so \nto speak. So I think her career, in being inspiring to all of us, has \nalready begun as a teacher. She has taught us enormously. Then again, \nso did those who rescued her teach us, because they took extraordinary \nskill and courage and used the proper techniques. They were under fire \nand brought her home safely to an ambulance.\n  There are still others who are missing, of course, and we worry about \nthem. I know she does, even as she hurts with her wounds. For now, for \nthis moment, and in West Virginia for a long time to come, we can \nrejoice about this extraordinary miracle of Jessica Lynch. She would \nlike to know and surely can know that all Members of the Senate join \ntheir colleagues in other bodies of Government, and Americans in \ngeneral, in offering our warmest congratulations to her as a person, to \nher family, and to her neighbors who, in fact, became her family and \nalways had been her family.\n  Jessica Lynch's story has lifted our hearts, and I think her rescue \nis a cause for rejoicing throughout our land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a brave \nNew Jersey resident, 31 year old Sgt. James Riley, one of the prisoners \nof war now being held in Iraq. On behalf of the Senate, I would like to \nexpress my support for his family and for the families of the other \nAmerican POWs being held in Iraq.\n  On March 23, 12 members of the 507th Maintenance Co, part of the \n111th Air\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\nDefense Artillery Brigade stationed in Fort Bliss, Texas, took a wrong \nturn near An Nasiriyah, a key battle ground city on the Euphrates River \nin southern Iraq. Iraqi forces ambushed their unit. Five soldiers, \nincluding Riley, were taken prisoner of war. The remainder were most \nlikely killed, although their deaths have not been confirmed. \nSubsequently, Iraqi state-run television aired a gruesome videotape of \ninterviews with Sgt. Riley and the other POWs, and displayed chilling \nshots of four murdered American servicemen and women. This videotape \nwas then broadcast by television networks all over the world, including \nthe influential Qatar-based Al Jazeera.\n  Sgt. Riley's family, including his parents Athol and Jane Riley, are \nwaiting anxiously for information on their son's condition. The Rileys \nhave experienced a tremendous loss this week; their daughter, age 29, \ndied last Friday after suffering from a rare neurological illness that \nhad left her in a coma since late January. My heart goes out to the \nRileys and their friends and family during this painful time.\n  James Riley moved to New Jersey from New Zealand when he was 10 years \nold. He attended West Field Friends Grade School and he graduated from \nthe Pennsauken High School in 1990. According to his parents, he had \nalways dreamed of serving in the Army and he enlisted immediately after \nhe graduated from high school.\n  I am confident that our superior military will find and rescue the \nAmerican POWs. In the meantime, I pledge my support for all service men \nand women serving in the Persian Gulf and for their anxious families at \nhome.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a moving story \nabout James Riley printed in the New York Times on April 2, 2003. This \nstory illuminates the quiet courage displayed by the Rileys as they \nwait for news of their son, as well as the communal support extended to \nthem by their neighbors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 2, 2003]\n\n                   A.P.O.W. Brings War Close to Home\n\n                           (By Matthew Purdy)\n\n       Pennsauken, N.J.--In the 10 days since he was taken \n     prisoner in Iraq, Sgt. James Riley has become something of a \n     symbol in this working-class town where he grew up--a \n     homegrown argument for or against the war, depending upon who \n     is talking.\n       Joseph McCollum, a maintenance worker who lives next to the \n     Rileys, said that when he heard the news, ``I said `Maybe we \n     should go over there and drop the bomb and suffer the \n     consequences.' ''\n       ``Since 9/11, I think we needed the war,'' Mr. McCollum \n     said. ``This makes me feel like we really have to get them.''\n       Around the corner, Charlene Walls, a school aide, said the \n     capture of Sergeant Riley, 31, perfectly illustrated why she \n     opposed invading Iraq: ``It's just people losing people.''\n       ``We've already lost too many people for something no one \n     can tell you why we're in there,'' Ms. Walls said.\n       If people are being made to think twice by the war's \n     unexpected difficulties, they seem to be coming down even \n     more firmly where they were already standing.\n       Antiwar protests are growing in vigor, while polls show the \n     country supports the war as much as ever. Everyone is \n     rallying around the flag, or a banner.\n       When Sergeant Riley's maintenance company was ambushed \n     outside Nasiriya, yellow ribbons blossomed amid the red, \n     white and blue in this South Jersey town. Even the giant \n     water tower that rises behind the houses has a yellow bow on \n     it.\n       There's also a big yellow bow outside the local tavern \n     Bryson's Pub. Inside, Tom McVeigh, a landscaper, said that \n     Sergeant Riley's capture only brought home the cost of the \n     war in people and world opinion. ``We look like a bully,'' he \n     said.\n       But few people in the neighborhood appear to question the \n     war.\n       Ed Russell, who works in finance for I.B.M., trusts what \n     the Bush administration says about Saddam Hussein. ``I don't \n     think it's in the nature of the American people to go out and \n     start a war,'' he said. ``They must have critical evidence \n     that something bad was about to happen and they needed to \n     stop this guy.''\n       Mr. Russell said he hardly knew the Rileys, but Pat Dimter, \n     who grew up down the street from James Riley, sees her \n     friend's capture as more justification to fight. The United \n     States treated the Iraqis ``like they're our own people,'' \n     she said. ``And it's not fair what they're doing to us \n     with 9/11 and how they're treating our P.O.W.'s.''\n       Greg Sassone, an eighth grader, was walking through the \n     neighborhood park on Monday when he picked up a piece of \n     yellow ribbon from the ground and tied it to a tree. One of \n     Sergeant Riley's sisters was his baby sitter, and the ordeal \n     has hit too close to home.\n       Greg's father is in the Air Force Reserves. ``If my dad \n     gets called, he could get captured,'' he said. And his 20-\n     year-old brother could get called if there were a draft, he \n     said. ``My mom says she would move him to Canada.''\n       At school, students fear another terrorist attack, Greg \n     said. That's why, despite Sergeant Riley's capture, he \n     supports the war against Saddam. ``We have to get rid of him \n     before it's too late,'' he said.\n       It's hard to find someone without an angle on Sergeant \n     Riley's capture.\n       Monday night, at the close of a stirring vigil detected to \n     Sergeant Riley, the Rev. Guenther Fritsch pulled out a Bible \n     to show what the enemy ``is all about.'' He read a passage \n     about Ishmael, from whom Arabs are said to be descended: ``He \n     will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against \n     everyone.''\n       The only people who seemed to find no larger significance \n     in Sergeant Riley's capture were his parents.\n       Athol Riley, a building inspector, was calm and simple when \n     he addressed the crowd. He said that in addition to his son's \n     being captured, a daughter had died on Friday after a long \n     illness. Mr. Riley thanked the township that employs him, the \n     publishing company where his wife works, the store where his \n     surviving daughter works, and the family that runs the \n     McDonald's where his deceased daughter had worked. ``I would \n     like to thank everyone for the show of support,'' he said.\n       Afterward, mobbed by television cameras and reporters, he \n     was asked how he felt about the course of the war. Mr. Riley \n     expressed no thoughts about Saddam Hussein or George Bush.\n       A stout man in a dark coat, Mr. Riley obliged the cameras \n     only when he was asked if he had a message for his son. A sad \n     smile on his face, Mr. Riley had no angle, only words from \n     the heart: ``Hang in there, and hurry home.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of the arrival of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. First, I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for \nher comments and recognition of the valor of our troops. There was very \ngood news yesterday concerning the rescue of a female soldier. There \nwas great pursuit by her fellow comrades to bring her back. I think it \nis very important, as the war proceeds, to put the Iraqis on special \nnotice that war crimes will be prosecuted and that when the war ends, \nit will not be over for those who have violated the requirements of the \nHague and Geneva Conventions.\n  Last Saturday, when four U.S. soldiers were murdered with a car bomb \nby an Iraqi soldier masquerading as a civilian, that constituted a war \ncrime. Then Tariq Aziz, the Deputy Prime Minister, appeared on \ninternational television boasting about the incident and saying there \nwould be many more who would come forward, with reports of some 4,000 \nvolunteers willing to engage in such suicide bombing. It is important \nto put Tariq Aziz on notice that such conduct is a violation of \ninternational law, and it will be prosecuted. Similarly, it is \nimportant to put Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan on notice that \nthis is a violation of international law.\n  Today in the Hague the former President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan \nMilosevic, is on trial. In an international jail, the former leader of \nRwanda is serving a life sentence for violation of international law. \nOn Monday, I filed a resolution at the first available date to put the \nIraqi leaders, as well as the Iraqi followers, on notice they will be \nliable for prosecution as war criminals. It is not a defense for the \nfollowers to say they have been operating under orders.\n  I see the distinguished President pro tempore, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, is in the Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4657-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 762, which the clerk will report by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\n\n       A bill (S. 762) making supplemental appropriations to \n     support Department of Defense operations in Iraq, Department \n     of Homeland Security, and Related Efforts for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2003, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, before we start this supplemental, these \nare difficult times so I will take this opportunity to recognize all of \nthose in uniform who are serving our country both at home and abroad \nduring these wars, the war against terrorism, the war in Afghanistan, \nand the war in Iraq. I especially want to ask the Senate to keep in \nmind those who have given their lives in the defense of our country and \nin our opposition to these terrible scourges that beset us now.\n  We do have a war going on, and the President, as our Commander in \nChief, has asked for our help to provide vitally needed funds in the \nmost expeditious manner possible. I have spoken to each of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and they tell me that their money will start running \nout. For most of them, that will start in May. For the Navy, it will \nstart in June. In any event, the only way to ensure these funds will be \navailable and get to the services in time to meet their needs is to \nsend this bill to the President before we leave Washington for the \nusual Easter recess. If we do not have it done before then, I am going \nto do my best to insist we stay here and forego the recess until we get \nthis bill done. I believe that will not be necessary, and so far I have \nseen good bipartisan support to meet the objective of getting this bill \nto the President so that funds will be available to our troops. I hope \nthat attitude will continue on the floor.\n  The House Appropriations Committee completed its work on the version \nof this bill yesterday. They will begin consideration on the floor very \nsoon. We all know that they act first on a bill of this type so we will \nhave to wait. It is my hope I can ask the Senate to get this bill to \nthird reading by no later than tomorrow evening so it will be ready and \nour staffs can work over this next weekend to get ready for a \nconference. I will propose that the Senate actually take this bill to \nthe point where it is actually sent to conference as soon as the House \nhas passed its bill so we can go to conference early next week. It is \nmy sincere hope the Senate and the House will act together to get this \nbill, as I said, to the President as quickly as possible.\n  The President of the United States asked for $74.7 billion in new \nbudget authority in the supplemental request he sent to us. The bill \nbefore us provides $76.7 billion in new authority. It also contains an \naviation relief portion that will provide both new budget authority and \nother benefits. The budget authority is $2.025 billion, and other \nbenefits are $1.475 billion. The total for this bill, including the \nairline relief portion, in both new budget authority and other benefits \nthen totals $78.7 billion.\n  This supplemental responds to the immediate needs of the troops in \nthe field, provides important international assistance to our allies, \nand tries to deal with the most vital homeland security and defense \nneeds facing our Nation.\n  We fully funded the President's request of $62.6 billion for defense \nefforts in prosecuting the war with Iraq. These funds will be used to \nconduct military operations in Iraq, support our coalition partners, \nand replenish crucial munition and other vital military procurement \nfunds that have already been consumed in getting our troops to the war \nzones. The President's request included $30.3 billion for costs that \nwere already committed or incurred. The sealift, the airlift, and \nequipping our combat forces has come at great expense.\n  Last week in our hearing with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, Senator \nByrd and others raised concerns with respect to the Department's \nrequest that these funds be appropriated to what we call the Defense \nEmergency Response Fund.\n  We will hear the acronym DERF on the floor. That means Defense \nEmergency Response Fund. In developing the bill before the Senate, \nSenator Byrd, Senator Inouye, and I have tried to strike a proper \nbalance between congressional oversight and providing the Department \nwith the necessary flexibility to prosecute the ongoing war in Iraq. \nSenator Byrd, I am sure, will speak for himself with regard to the \nflexibility in this bill. There is some flexibility for the President.\n  In this bill we provided $11 billion to the Defense Department in the \nDefense Emergency Response Fund. It can be spent in response to the \nCommander in Chief's directions. It is an account to give them the \nenhanced flexibility they need to manage the conduct of the war. The \nHouse has provided a larger amount. I am sure we will meet in \nconference to decide what is the proper amount of flexibility necessary \nfor the present Department of Defense.\n  We also are proposing that the great majority of the defense funds, \ntotaling nearly $51.5 billion, be appropriated into specific accounts \nfor the services so that wherever possible they meet the needs \ndirectly. We have provided $35 billion for operation and maintenance \nactivities; $13.7 billion for military personnel to maintain critical \noperation capability and readiness; and $3.7 billion to replenish \nmunitions expended in combat operations.\n  We have also included $500 million for the Defense Health Program to \nprovide adequate care for both Active and military Reserve personnel \nand their families.\n  There is another $550 million for fuel costs and $489 million for the \nDepartment's efforts to combat the oil well fires started by the Iraqi \nforces so far.\n  This bill appropriates $1.7 billion to cover costs associated with \nclassified activities undertaken in Iraq and in the global war on \nterrorism.\n  We have also responded to the President's full request for $7.8 \nbillion for international relief and recovery efforts in Iraq, \ninternational support for allies in the region, and other critical \nneeds to continue the fight on global terrorism. The committee's \nrecommendation includes $2.4 billion for the Iraqi relief and \nreconstruction fund. That is over $2 billion for the Foreign Military \nFinancing Program, which we call FMF. The bill also provides up to $9 \nbillion in loan guarantees to Israel, $300 million in assistance to \nEgypt, and $1 billion in assistance for Turkey. It includes the request \nfor $150 million for the U.S. emergency fund for complex foreign \ncrises, a new account that enables a quick response to unforeseen \nglobal challenges.\n  Finally, the bill reimburses fiscal year 2003 foreign assistance \naccounts that Congress authorized the President to borrow from to pre-\nposition humanitarian assistance for Iraq.\n  The bill also reflects the commitment of Congress to address homeland \ndefense requirements by providing $4.6 billion, roughly $400 million \nabove the President's request, for key homeland security requirements.\n  We have provided the President's request of $2 billion for the Office \nof Domestic Preparedness to assist State and local governments in \nfederally coordinated terrorism readiness and other security \nenhancements during this time of heightened threats.\n  The committee recommendation also included $1.1 billion for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for counterterrorist activities. \nSecretary Ridge has given the flexibility in this account to allocate \nfunds both within and outside the Department of Homeland Security for \nterrorism preparedness and response.\n\n  The bill also includes $580 million for the Coast Guard operations to \nenhance the protection of our ports and borders and in support of the \nDepartment of Defense activities in Operation Iraqi Freedom and \nOperation Liberty Shield. We have also supported the recommendation of \n$34 million to provide compensation to individuals who have sustained \ninjuries due to our smallpox vaccination program.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the bill includes a package of targeted \nrelief to address the dire situation facing the aviation industry.\n  I highlight the main provision in that package and I will speak at \ngreater length later. In this bill is a total of\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\n$2.9 billion in relief for air carriers, the airlines. Specifically, \nthe bill suspends the fee that both passengers and carriers pay for the \n6 months of the balance of this current fiscal year. It will suspend \nthis fee that is currently charged on the ticket taxes, but it is \nactually currently being borne by the industry because the cost of \nflying is so low due to competitive factors of the economy. It also \nprovides $1 billion to reimburse the carriers for the costs incurred \nwith the new security mandates of the Transportation Security \nAdministration imposed following the terrorist attacks on September 11. \nThese were unfunded mandates, and in this bill we fund those that have \nbeen completed since September 11 until the end of this fiscal year.\n  The bill extends for 1 year the war risk provisions included in our \nbill in previous years. Specifically, we passed last November a bill to \nestablish the Department of Homeland Security or specific insurance \nprovisions for war risk in that bill. The result of this provision in \nthis bill is we anticipate will save the airlines about $800 million.\n  The package also includes $375 million to address security-related \ncosts at our airports. I congratulate my colleague from Washington for \nbringing up this issue. Those are also unfunded mandates. They were \nfunds expended by the airports to meet the requirements of the \nTransportation Security Administration, and the funds in this bill \nshould reimburse airports for security readiness operating expenses and \nprovide additional funding for the modification of airports necessary \nto the installation of bomb detection equipment for the balance of the \nfiscal year.\n  Finally, this bill also extends unemployment benefits for an \nadditional 26 weeks for qualifying aviation workers who have lost their \njobs because of the downturn in the economy that affected the airlines.\n  I see my friend is here. I don't want to speak too long, but I \nbelieve this bill is very important. There is no question we need the \nfunds to sustain our vital military operations around the world. There \nare really three wars still going on: The war against terrorism, the \nwar in Afghanistan, and the war in Iraq. This is a very serious problem \nfor those overseas and for those who manage our Department of Defense. \nI think the worry over where funds are coming from to meet the \nincreasing demands in the three different wars is pressing upon our \nmilitary commanders and civilians in charge of the Department of \nDefense.\n  It is my hope the Senate will be considerate in the number of \namendments that are offered and the issues before the Senate.\n  I thank the former chairman from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for the \ninsight and advice he has given to me. I do not represent that this \nbill reflects entirely his point of view, but he has been a partner, \nonce again, in working with me as I tried to work with him. I do think \nhe has been very instrumental in seeing to it that this bill is before \nthe Senate at this time.\n  I have stated to others, and I say it again publicly, one of the \nreasons I am trying to get through this bill tomorrow night is I hope \nto be with my good friend from Hawaii when he receives the recognition \nhe deserves in his home State on Saturday.\n  I recommend the bill to the full Senate. I urge Senators to come \nforward and identify their amendments so we can see what we can work \nout, if there are subjects that can be worked out. I admit readily \nthere may be some items we have not addressed in this bill so far. I \nwould very much like to do that.\n  I do hope as the Senate proceeds with this bill, we keep in mind the \nfact that within instantaneous communication, I am informed that some \nof the forces that are overseas in both Afghanistan and in the Iraqi \nwar watch us almost as much as we watch them. This is one bill they are \ngoing to watch. They are very astute young people. They understand this \ncountry. They understand the risks they are taking. They understand in \nparticular they want this country's economy to be healthy when they \ncome back.\n  We must keep in mind what we are doing, continuing the expenditures \nthat are extraordinary expenses brought upon this country by the events \nof September 11. During this period, I will recite some of those \namounts that we put forward already.\n  There has been a tremendous strain on our economy because of these \nthree different types of wars, but they are wars that I personally \nbelieve we must fight. We must provide those who are fighting those \nwars everything they need to be successful and to be safe.\n  I recommend this bill to the full Senate and hope we will finish it \nby tomorrow night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I consider it an honor, I consider it a \ngreat honor to be able to work with the very distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, the senior Senator, the President pro tempore of the Senate, in \nbringing this bill to its present status.\n  I laud the distinguished chairman of the committee for his \nextraordinary knowledge of the subject matter here that we are going to \ndiscuss. He has been on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense for \na long time, where he has worked arm in arm and hand in hand with our \nvery distinguished senior Senator from Hawaii, Danny Inouye, who is my \nhero. Together, these men have brought their wisdom, their dedication, \ntheir knowledge to great usefulness, and I thank Senator Stevens for \nhis work. He also is a hero of mine. I am proud to serve with him.\n  The Senator has stated that we are fighting three wars: the war in \nAfghanistan, the war on terrorism here at home, and the war in Iraq. I \nsupport the appropriations that we are going to recommend for all three \nwars. I do not support the policy that brought us where we are today in \nIraq. I have no hesitancy in saying that. I can defend that position \nany time, anywhere. I am sure not everybody will agree with me, but I \nhave reasons for my position. So, although I do not support the policy \nthat puts our men and women in Iraq, I do support the appropriations \nfor those, for the support of and the safety of those men and women in \nIraq, and I do so wholeheartedly.\n  In a short time I will speak of one young West Virginian by the name \nof Jessica Lynch. I will have more to say about her shortly.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee, under the very able leadership \nof the chairman, the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate, \nMr. Stevens, has unanimously reported the fiscal year 2003 supplemental \nappropriations bill. The Senate committee-reported bill totals \n$78,736,600,000 in benefits and appropriations; $4,011,600,000 more \nthan the President's request. In that proposal, the President sought an \nunprecedented level of flexibility in the use of these funds. I was \nastounded at the request that the President put forth with respect to \nthese ``flexibilities.'' While I understand the unique circumstance in \nwhich the Nation finds itself, the situation is not unprecedented--not \nunprecedented. We have been at war before many times.\n\n  I served in this Senate and in the House in several of these wars, so \nwe have been at war before. This isn't something new, the matter of \nbeing at war. But these ``flexibilities,'' so-called, have startled me, \nin a way. But I am not so startled either, keeping in mind the whole of \nour experience with this administration. Yes, we have been at war \nbefore, but the Nation never wandered--never sought to wander away from \nthe Constitution, never sought to impinge upon the congressional power \nof the purse as we have seen in this instance.\n  In World War II, for example, Congress passed eight supplemental \nbills to respond to the needs of our Armed Forces. This is what I said \nthe other day during the appropriations hearing, the Appropriations \nCommittee hearing on this bill, when Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was \nbefore the committee. I said: Why all these flexibilities?\n  I called them ``flexibilities'' because the Secretary of Defense, in \nhis opening statement, used the word ``flexibility'' seven times.\n  I said: We fought previous wars. Why do we need these \n``flexibilities'' now? I said: Congress can pass additional \nsupplementals. That has been done before.\n  In World War II, for example, Congress passed eight supplemental \nbills to respond to the needs of our Armed Forces and there is little \nreason, in my\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nview, why this war in Iraq should require more flexibility for the \nadministration than was granted during World War II to administrations.\n  This Republic rests on a system of checks and balances: three \nbranches, two legislative Houses, and separate powers--shared powers, \nmixed powers. Our system reflects the hundreds of years of history \nbehind it.\n  I said hundreds--yes. Yes, Mr. President, you didn't hear me wrongly. \nOur system reflects the hundreds of years behind it, going back to the \nRevolutionary War; going back to colonial days; going back to the \nhistory of the Englishmen who fought and bled and gave their lives in \nthe struggle against tyranny, in the struggle against a monarchy that \nsought to gather all power unto itself.\n  The roots of our Constitution go back even to the Magna Carta, 1215. \nThis is not a Constitution that came about just in 1787. Its roots go \nback 1000 years--and the blood of Englishmen is on it, as is the blood \nof our forefathers here in this, our country.\n\n  In our Madisonian system, divided power may not be as expedient as \nsome would like. That is stating it well: not as expedient as some \nwould like. I say it again. I will state it more loudly: In our \nMadisonian system, divided power may not be as expedient--hear me now \ndown at the White House--may not be as expedient as some would like, \nbut it guarantees the American people's liberties. Quite simply, our \nrepresentative form of democracy depends upon power divided and power \nshared.\n  The Constitution grants to the Congress the authority to appropriate \nfunds and the solemn responsibility to exercise that authority wisely. \nAnd for us to agree to the many sweeping grants of new, so-called \n``flexible'' authority sought by this administration would be to \nabdicate--to abdicate--that heavy constitutional responsibility. We \nhave a duty to the American people to exercise the authorities granted \nto Congress in our Constitution, and we have a duty to those Framers, \nthose men who wrote the Constitution, to keep faith with them and to \nhonor and respect and uphold and support and defend that Constitution \nagainst all enemies foreign and domestic.\n  In the case of this bill, and for the many years ahead, it will take \nmaximum effort to preserve the prerogatives of the legislative branch. \nI hope my colleagues will understand that. I hope they will hear that. \nAnd the Record will be there for those of our future colleagues to \nread.\n  Let me say that again. I say it to my colleagues. I hope my \ncolleagues will remember: In the case of this bill, and for the many \nyears ahead, it will take maximum effort on the part of our colleagues \ntoday, and those who will serve in this Chamber in the future, to \npreserve the prerogatives of the legislative branch.\n  Now, when it comes to the executive branch, we will always find those \nin the executive branch who will uphold, who will extol, and who will \nseek to add to the powers of the executive branch. The same can be said \nfor the judicial branch. The judicial branch will always speak out for \nthe protection of the constitutional authorities given to it.\n  But what about the legislative branch? This is the one branch in the \nthree in which we will find increasingly--I might say, based on my 50 \nyears in Congress--we will find increasingly those in the legislative \nbranch who are always ready to stand up for the executive branch for \nwhatever power grabs it may have in mind, and they will seek to defend \nthat executive branch and to push its desires. I am sorry to say, it is \nusually about half of the legislative branch that is willing to do \nthat, depending on what party is in power and what party controls the \ntwo Houses of the legislative branch. And I regret this.\n  As I look back over my 50 years here, I have seen great, great \nchanges in the way the Members of the legislative branch view their \nrole under the Constitution. Sometimes I wonder if they have read the \nConstitution lately. I am sorry to say I don't think our Constitution \nmeans a great deal to some of those who have served in this branch. \nThey seem to think this is a monarchy and that we have a king. I look \nat the future with grave concerns, as I think about the changes I have \nseen sweep over this branch of Government.\n  Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days every 3 years, 366 days the 4th \nyear, out there always is the executive branch. And it is awake. It \nseeks power. It seeks to aggrandize the authorities to itself. It is \nalways awake. It is never sleeping.\n\n  Members of the legislative branch are here, they recess, they go to \nthe four points of the compass. They are not always here. They are not \nalways alert to the protection of the authorities of this branch of \nGovernment. And at this time, and under this administration, I have to \nsay, I have seen more of that than ever before.\n  Members must understand their institutional role. Citizens must \nunderstand their Constitution and value the congressional role in \nprotecting their freedoms. This is another thing that gives me \nconcern--sorrow in many ways. All too few citizens think about the role \nthey play and the responsibilities that are theirs under the \nConstitution.\n  Leaders in the Congress itself must guard its prerogatives. I have \nbeen a leader in this body. I have been majority leader. I have been \nminority leader. I have been President pro tempore and chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. And I have never lost sight of the fact I \nmust help to guard the prerogatives, the authorities, the powers that \nare enumerated in the Constitution, the powers that devolve upon this \nbody, its duties, its responsibilities.\n  So leaders in the Congress itself must guard its prerogatives and \nresist succumbing to expediency, to political expediency, and to \npartisanship.\n  While I fully support the funding in this legislation for the men and \nthe women engaged in battle in Iraq, I do not support additional grants \nof authority to this administration, or to any other administration, \nthat would infringe upon the congressional power of the purse. That is \nthe greatest power. The power of the purse is the greatest power in \nexistence under this constitutional system.\n  As Cicero, that great Roman Senator, said: ``There is no fortress so \nstrong that money cannot take it.'' ``There is no fortress so strong \nthat money cannot take it''--the power of the purse.\n  Senator Stevens and I, together with the subcommittee chairmen and \nranking members, have worked, in most cases, to improve the President's \nsupplemental budget request.\n  We have eliminated or significantly reduced most of the sweeping \ngrants of new authority requested by this administration while still \nproviding very limited flexibility where appropriate.\n  More specifically, for defense the bill includes $62.6 billion, the \nfull amount of the budget request, to cover the costs related to \nmilitary operations against Iraq and to sustain the continuing global \nwar on terrorism. The budget request proposes that $59,863,200,000 of \nthe amount for national defense would be included in the unallocated \nDefense Emergency Response Fund. The Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, the full Appropriations Committee, and the Congress \nrejected this type of transfer account in the fiscal year 2002 \nsupplemental, rejected it in the fiscal year 2003 Defense \nappropriations bill, and rejected it in the defense chapter of the \nfiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill.\n  In this supplemental, the amount allocated to the Defense Emergency \nResponse Fund has been reduced from the request of approximately $59.9 \nbillion to $11,019,000,000. The remainder of the funds, some $49 \nbillion, have been allocated to the specific appropriations accounts. \nThis is an improvement over the budget request, but I call the \nattention of my colleagues to the fact that on an annualized basis, it \namounts to a blank check for more than $20 billion--on an annual basis. \nBecause the taxpayer has a right to know how this $11 billion will be \nused, this so-called flexibility gives me great concern. I hope we will \nget away from these DERFs. I am concerned about them.\n  The administration's supplemental request sought $1.4 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense to allow the Secretary of Defense to allocate \nfunds to reimburse and otherwise pay nations that have provided support \nprimarily for the global war on terrorism. Most of the funding is \nanticipated to be for Pakistan. In the past, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has taken a position that such reimbursement could take place \nonly in response to\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\nvouchers presented to the Department of Defense for reimbursement for \nactivities conducted on behalf of the global war on terrorism. This \nsupplemental bill again includes this provision. In addition, we \nrequire 15-day advance notification prior to obligation.\n  The President sought $150 million to be paid at the discretion of the \nSecretary of Defense to indigenous forces abroad. We have one Secretary \nof State; we don't need two. A similar proposal was rejected by \nCongress last year. It has been rejected again in this legislation.\n  The administration wanted to increase the Department of Defense \nreprogramming authority from an annual amount of $2 billion to 2.5 \npercent of its total budget, a staggering sum which would exceed $9 \nbillion. I expressed opposition to this large new grant of authority to \nthe Department of Defense. I expressed my appreciation and compliments \nto the chairman, Senator Stevens, for the fact that he has brought us a \nbill that reins in the administration, tightens up the limitation so \nthat rather than provide an unprecedented $9 billion transfer \nauthority, the legislation before us includes a $3.5 billion transfer \nauthority.\n  The administration also sought authority to expend any funds from the \ndefense cooperation account that may be received from other countries \nfor the prosecution of the war against Iraq or the reconstruction of \nIraq without first having these funds appropriated by Congress. The \nadministration wanted to get away from that. They wanted a free hand \nwith no strings attached.\n\n  During the first gulf war, Congress appropriated those funds after \nthey were received. Let me repeat that. During the first gulf war, \nCongress appropriated those funds after they were received. The \nlegislation before us takes the same approach and preserves the \nprerogatives of the Congress and of the people. No new authority is \ngranted. Any funds collected from foreign countries for reconstruction \nof Iraq or for any other purposes will remain in the Treasury under \nthis bill, unless appropriated by law. That is the way it should be.\n  The administration requested similar extraordinary grants of \nauthority for the Secretary of Homeland Security, for the Attorney \nGeneral, and for the Office of the President. More specifically, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security would receive $1.5 billion for a new \ncounterterrorism fund for transfer to any Department of Homeland \nSecurity agency. The Attorney General would receive $500 million for \ntransfer to any Justice Department organization for terrorism-related \nactivities. The President would receive $2,443,300,000 for Iraq \nreconstruction and relief, without even as much as a reporting \nrequirement. So they not only want no strings attached, they don't want \nto have to make any report--an absolutely free hand in expending the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  We must all remember, we are having to borrow all this money. The \ntaxpayers are going to have to pay interest on all this money. When our \nsoldiers and sailors and airmen and marines get home, they are going to \nbe paying interest on the money that has been borrowed to send them \nacross the ocean. Each proposal, if the administration had its way, \nwould leave the Congress out of the decisionmaking process in the \nallocation of the funds--no details, no explanation.\n  In the case of the Iraq reconstruction funds, the President proposes \nto spend the money ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.''\n  With regard to the funds to be provided to the President for the \nreconstruction of Iraq, the supplemental before the Senate stipulates \nthat funds may not be transferred to the Department of Defense, and \nthat all funds available under this appropriation shall be subject to \nthe regular prior notification procedures of at least 5 days in advance \nof the obligation of the funds. The funds will be used for feeding and \nfood distribution, water and sanitation infrastructure, electricity, \ntransportation, telecommunications, and other such humanitarian \nactivities.\n  With regard to the $500 million for the Attorney General, the \nlegislation has been improved to require that these funds be subject to \nthe regular reprogramming process. Likewise, the funds provided to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security also require prior approval notification \nof the committee under the usual reprogramming procedures, which are \nlong-established and long-respected by the Congress and the executive \nbranch.\n  Overall, the President requested over $9 billion for aid to foreign \ncountries and for the State Department. Yet his request for homeland \nsecurity programs is only $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion for homeland \nsecurity he requested; while, on the other hand, he requested over $9 \nbillion for aid to foreign countries and for the State Department. The \nSecretary of Homeland Security has said that another terrorist attack \nin America is inevitable. He has said attacks, such as the attacks of \nSeptember 11, are long-term threats that will not go away. If there is \none lesson we should learn from 9/11, it is that terrorist attacks on \nour Nation can no longer be viewed as distant threats from across the \noceans. The enemy may attack our troops or citizens overseas or it may \nattack civilians here at home. So we must provide all of the necessary \nresources to support our troops overseas. But we must also provide \nsignificant homeland security resources now to meet the real needs that \nhave been overwhelmingly authorized by Congress and signed into law by \nthe President for port security, airport security, border security, and \nnuclear security.\n\n  When it comes to funding homeland security initiatives, partisan \npolitics has no place. Protecting a vulnerable nation is a duty that we \nall must shoulder together. Congress knows the needs at the local \nlevel, and Congress has tried time and time again to address those \nneeds. The administration's request takes a step in the right \ndirection, but at this time, when the Nation is acutely aware of the \nincreased threat of terror attacks at home, one step is not enough. We \nmust do more to address the critical vulnerabilities all across the \ncountry. We live under an orange alert, a heightened concern for \nterrorist attack. The American people are nervous about safety at home. \nI know I am nervous about safety here at home. That apprehension \nripples through our economy. We read about it every day in the Wall \nStreet Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post. We should all \nhave an interest in doing what we can to secure obvious vulnerabilities \nand allay citizen concerns.\n  To that end, I hope to work on a bipartisan effort, as this bill \nmoves forward, to responsibly invest in first responders, in \nprotections at our airports and seaports, and in other areas to better \nensure the safety of Americans at home.\n  Let me again congratulate the chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished President pro tempore, and let me thank all the members \nof the Appropriations Committee, especially the ranking member of the \nDefense Subcommittee, Mr. Inouye, for their cooperation in bringing \nthis bipartisan legislation to the floor of the Senate. I expect its \nspeedy passage, and I hope for its speedy passage. I join with the \nchairman in hoping to complete this bill in the Senate by tomorrow \nevening, or sometime tomorrow.\n  I congratulate the excellent staff we have for their hard work, \nespecially Jim Morhard, the newly appointed staff director for the \nmajority. Let me also thank my own two excellent staff persons, Terry \nSauvain, and Charles Kieffer, for their dedication, hard work, and the \nlong hours.\n  For certain, this legislation is not perfect and it is susceptible to \nimprovement. I expect and hope to assist in such improvement over the \nnext few days as the Senate proceeds to work its will on this important \nlegislation, as it goes to and returns from conference. I thank all \nSenators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MURKOWSKI). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 435\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I want the Senate to be on notice--this \nis an issue we have to face. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 435.\n       Sec.  Section 3101 of title 31, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\n       ``(d) The National Debt Ceiling of the United States shall \n     be increased by the total amount of funds appropriated by Act \n     of Congress for the Department of Defense, Department of \n     Homeland Security or any other Agency of government to \n     prosecute the war against terrorism, the war in Afghanistan, \n     the war in Iraq, since September 11, 2001.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 436\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be temporarily set aside. I will discuss it soon. I have \nanother amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 436.\n       At the end of chapter 3 of title I, add the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Increase in Imminent Danger Special Pay.--\n     Section 310(a) of title 37, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``$150'' and inserting ``$225''.\n       (b) Increase in Family Separation Allowance.--Section \n     427(a)(1) of title 37, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``$100'' and inserting ``$200''.\n       (c) Expiration.--(1) The amendments made by subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall expire on September 30, 2003.\n       (2) Effective on September 30, 2003, sections 310(a) of \n     title 37, United States Code, and 427(a)(1) of title 37, \n     United States Code, as in effect on the day before the date \n     of the enactment of this Act are hereby revived.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 436\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, there is a typing error in the first \nline of amendment No. 436. It should be ``chapter 3,'' and it appears \n``chapter 2.'' I ask that the typing error be amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I raise this subject of combat pay, or \npay for imminent danger. Having received such combat pay in World War \nII, I have been interested in this issue. During the gulf war in 1991, \nwhen combat pay was $110 a month, we raised that to $150 a month. Right \nafter that war, the imminent danger pay was made permanent at $150. It \nhas gone up 40 percent since 1991. We suggest it go up 50 percent to \n$225 a month. With regard to family separation and allowance, it is \ncurrently $100. We recommend it go up 100 percent to $200.\n  That is an expensive proposition. The cost of this for the balance of \nthe year is $375 million, and the cost for a full year will be $650 \nmillion. This is a reachback amendment. It covers everyone from the \ntime they were exposed to imminent danger. For family separation, it is \nthe same, from the time they were separated.\n  I know there is a controversy, and I have had a little discussion \nwith the Senator from Illinois. As I told the Senator, there are \nprobably--I believe this is the case--more families in Alaska connected \nwith the military than any other State in the Union, as the current \noccupant of the chair knows.\n  On the other hand, the moneys we have to have for modernization, for \nmunitions, and for many other items come out of the same account. This \nis the operations and maintenance account. This bill already contains a \nmassive amount, $30.3 billion, to replace in that account what has \nalready been spent in mobilizing the military, including, by the way, \nthe amount that has been spent so far for paying imminent danger pay at \nthe rate of $150 a month. It is an issue we should address, but we \nought to keep in mind that what is going to happen after this war is \nthis will become permanent. It is a new base and it is a staggering \nincrease in cost for personnel. I fully support it. As a matter of \nfact, I wish I could say we have nothing but billionaires in this \ncountry, and we could pay these people what they really deserve for \nbeing overseas, what their families really deserve when one or both \nparents are overseas.\n\n  As a practical matter, there has to be a reasonable balance in what \nwe are doing. This subject can be reviewed by the Armed Services \nCommittee later. We have the 2004 bill coming, and we can have this \ndiscussion again. I believe we ought to take this action and be as \nreasonable as possible in doing it.\n  I know there is a difference of opinion. I hope the Senate will agree \nto this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Warner be added as an original \ncosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask the distinguished Senator of the \nArmed Services Committee to review it. I raised this at one of the \nfirst hearings we had before the Appropriations Committee. I raised the \nquestion of what to do about imminent danger special pay. The \nDepartment has not given us a recommendation yet. I think they have \nother things in mind right now, but we have in mind the families in \nparticular.\n  I spent some time with families in Alaska this last weekend, an \nenormous number of military families. Not one of them raised the \nquestion of imminent danger pay. Not one of them raised the question of \ntheir family separation pay. I was with literally 200 or 300 members of \nthe armed services over the weekend at a special recognition in \nFairbanks, AK, for the members who serve in the armed services.\n  I think this is the right thing to do, and I think this is the right \ntime to do it, but I hope the Senate will do it right and not just have \na figure that is pulled out of the air. These are figures that \nrepresent an increase, again, of 50 percent for imminent danger pay and \na 100-percent increase for the family allowances on a monthly basis. I \nthink that is very reasonable under the circumstances.\n  If there are additional amounts that should be provided, I welcome \nthe Department of Defense so informing me. I do believe the Senate \nought to agree with it without debate. As I said, if the Armed Services \nCommittee and our Appropriations Committee believe more is needed as we \ngo on, if this war goes on, God forbid, into fiscal year 2004, then we \nshould address it.\n  Again, I say, in all sincerity, we are doing a lot of things for our \nmilitary families, and I think they are all wonderful. When I was \noverseas, I did not talk to my family for over 18 months. Now a \nmilitary person can call his or her family every day, thanks to Senator \nMcCain. They have absolute assurance of instant communication whenever \nthey can get to a phone.\n  I remember seeing one young man who was wounded, and the embedded \njournalist had a satellite phone. He asked: Would you like to call home \nand tell them you are all right? And we all watched him call his \nfamily. That is the wonder of technology.\n  These are the realities of money, and our job is to manage the money \nof the United States. The first amendment I put in was to raise the \ndebt ceiling of the United States because of what we have had to do \nsince September 11. I want people to think about--and Senators should \nthink about--the hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money we \nhave spent so far because of September 11.\n  Let's stay reasonable as we continue to increase that spending. We \nhave to pass that amendment. We are going to have to raise the debt \nceiling of the United States. Other people want to pick a figure out of \nthe air. I say let's raise it by the amount of what we have already \nauthorized to be spent in these three wars and homeland security. That \nseems to me to be reasonable. I will debate that one later, but right \nnow I think this is a reasonable request in the Senate: Increase the \nimminent danger pay by 50 percent, increase the overseas allowance for \nfamilies and the family separation allowance by 100 percent. I hope the \nSenate will support this move. It is a reasonable thing to do.\n  I call on the Department of Defense to come up with some basic \nstudies as to what is necessary. It may be that portions of that family \nseparation allowance should be bifurcated. These are all volunteers \nnow. In the past, we went to war with draftees. Most of us did not have \nfamilies. During World War II, it was a rare thing to meet somebody who \nwas a married person. Now, practically all of them are married. As a \nmatter of fact, in some instances, such as the families I visited over \nthe weekend, I remember distinctly talking to three different couples \nwho are both in the armed services. When they go overseas, they get two \nfamily separation allowances, and necessarily so. This may not be \nenough in some of these circumstances, but I think it is the duty of \nthe Department of Defense to come up with a recommendation for a \npermanent solution to this problem. There is no question that the $150 \nwe had in place has not been adjusted now since 1997, and it\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nshould be. This is the time to adjust it. I think this is a reasonable \nadjustment, 50 percent for the imminent danger pay, $100 for the family \nseparation allowance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4663-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4663-S4666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 437 to Amendment No. 436\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 437 to amendment No. 436.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In the amendment strike all after the first word and insert \n     the following:\n       (a) Increase in Imminent Danger Special Pay.--Section \n     310(a) of title 37, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``$150'' and inserting ``$250''.\n       (b) Increase in Family Separation Allowance.--Section \n     427(a)(1) of title 37, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``$100'' and inserting ``$250''.\n       (c) Expiration.--(1) The amendments made by subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall expire on September 30, 2003.\n       (2) Effective on September 30, 2003, sections 310(a) of \n     title 37, United States Code, and 427(a)(1) of title 37, \n     United States Code, as in effect on the day before the date \n     of the enactment of this Act are hereby revived.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as copies of the amendment are being \nmade, I say to my colleagues that my amendment raises the combat pay, \nimminent danger pay for the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and \ncoast-guardsmen presently in combat from the figure of $225 a month \nsuggested by Senator Stevens to $250 a month, and the family separation \nallowance from $200 a month to $250 a month.\n  I have spoken to my colleagues, whom I respect very much and whom I \nacknowledge to be certainly doing the very best they can with an \nextraordinary bill at an extraordinary time, and urge them to consider \nthis new figure. I have not pursued my original request, which was $500 \na month for both, nor a modification of it of $400 a month. I have come \ndown to what I consider to be a reasonable increase in light of the \nreality of the circumstances.\n  I do not know that any person in the Senate will stand before us and \nargue that he is going to find complaints from military families about \nthis family separation allowance or even about combat pay. Thank God we \nhave the very best people in America serving in our military. Their \nfamilies are at home keeping the families together, praying for their \nsafe return. They are not importuning and begging this Congress for \nmore money. That has not happened. God bless them for not putting \npressure on us to deal with that. But let us accept the reality of our \nresponsibility. We have a responsibility not just to pass resolutions \nin support of the troops. We have a responsibility beyond the kind \nwords which we offer in debate in this Senate. We have a specific \nresponsibility to these men and women in uniform and their families.\n  Look at what they are facing. They are facing the separation of \nfamilies, which undoubtedly has to be traumatic and difficult. They are \ntrying to raise their children in a circumstance that may be more \nchallenging than ever because of the need for child care costs, which \ncertainly are extraordinarily large even under the best circumstances. \nThey are dealing sometimes with activated reservists and guardsmen who \nhave left a good paying job and are now on military pay, taking a \nsubstantial economic cut. That is why I have started this debate. That \nis why I offered the amendment on the budget resolution. And that is \nwhy I bring this issue up today.\n  I hope when my colleagues consider what I am offering today, they \nwill remember the vote we cast last week. Last week, I asked my \ncolleagues, with the support of Senator Warner, Senator Chambliss, and \nSenator Landrieu, to entertain an increase in combat pay and an \nincrease in family separation allowance. I asked that $2 billion be set \naside for that purpose in the budget resolution, and the record vote in \nthis Senate was 100 to 0. That is a rare unanimous vote of the Senate \nin support of something that everyone agreed needed to be done.\n  Now let's look at what I am offering today. The cost of $250 a month \nin combat pay and the cost of $250 a month in family separation \nallowance comes to barely $500 million for the remainder of this year. \nThat shows that I am really coming with a request that is a little more \nthan one-fourth of what the Senate approved by a 100-to-0 vote last \nweek.\n  So why would we stand here and say unanimously, by a 100-to-0 vote, \nthat we are willing to spend four times as much in support of military \npersonnel and now a week later, when the bill comes before us, we are \nsaying, no, we will not?\n  I say to my friend from Alaska, I thank him for acknowledging the \nneed for an increase but I want him to seriously consider the second-\ndegree amendment which I have offered. This amendment does not reach my \noriginal goal of $500 or a compromise of $400 a month but comes to $250 \na month, which we are offering the families of servicemen who are \nstruggling with childcare costs, additional medical expenses, the need \nto deal with additional family pressures. That is not too much for us \nto give. The current reimbursement of $100 is inadequate. Going to $250 \nis not extravagant at all. It is important that we do it.\n\n  For combat pay, let me quickly add, there is no amount of money we \ncould pay our men and women in uniform that would compensate them for \nputting their lives on the line for our country, but I hope what we do \ntoday will be an important message and symbol to them that we not only \nstand with them when it comes to holding our flag and saying kind words \non the Senate floor but we stand with them when it comes to combat pay \nand imminent danger pay.\n  When we look at the images of men and women on the television risking \ntheir lives, the prisoners of war, and all the horrors they face, $250 \na month in combat pay seems like something this Senate should approve \nwithout controversy, and $250 a month for their family back home should \nnot be controversial. It is, in fact, an effort to accept the reality \nof family obligations.\n  Senator Danny Inouye, one of my heroes in the Senate, last year gave \na speech which I recall today as we stand and talk about this issue. He \nreminded us that back in World War II, when he served with such great \ndistinction, over 80 percent of the men and women in uniform were not \nmarried, they were single. Today, we know that 60 percent of those \nserving in the Iraqi war, Afghanistan, and in combat zones have \nfamilies back home. The face of the military has changed. Where family \nseparation allowance used to apply to a very small group for very \nlimited expenses, families today have additional expenses.\n  A year or two ago, I had a detailee in my office from the U.S. Army, \nMAJ Pat Sargeant, who works with medical evacuation now and is \ncurrently serving our country with his wife. He recently sent an e-mail \nto my office. He noted an article in the Army Times, which said: \n``Legislators set out to boost war pays.''\n  The article stated I had sponsored an amendment to include an \nincrease in monthly imminent danger pay from $150 to $250 and family \nseparation allowance from $100 to $250.\n  Pat Sargeant--wherever you are--sent me the greatest note and said: \nYou cannot believe what it did to morale for us to hear that the \nMembers of Congress were going to try to help our families and try to \nhelp the individuals involved.\n  Let's stand together today on a bipartisan basis for all the States, \nas we did last week; 100 to 0 should be the vote in favor of $250 a \nmonth for combat pay, $250 a month for family separation allowance. \nThat is a reasonable amount. It is not an exorbitant amount.\n\n  Some have argued that is just for the remainder of this fiscal year; \nwe may have to face this expense in the future. I say, so be it. So be \nit. If we are going to activate guardsmen and reservists, if we are \ngoing to ask the men and women in uniform in this country to risk their \nlives, the first obligation we have is to them and their families \nbefore we discuss the myriad of other issues that will come before the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\n  In this supplemental appropriations bill, there is a substantial \namount of money to pursue this war in Iraq. I believe it will receive a \nunanimous vote in the Senate. There is also $9 billion in this bill for \nforeign aid, which I will support.\n  Put in perspective what we are asking for: $500 million first and \nforemost to the men and women in uniform and to their families. That is \nnot an unreasonable request in a bill that may total $80 billion; $500 \nmillion for the men and women in uniform so that $250 a month in combat \npay will be there for them, $250 a month will be there to help their \nfamilies get through this very difficult time.\n  I hope the Senators who have considered this issue will consider my \nsecond-degree amendment in friendly terms and accept it so we can vote \nfor this on a bipartisan basis. The Senate should stand together. I \nurge my colleagues to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I must state my surprise at the \ndistinguished chairman having offered an amendment that would provide \nfor an open-ended increase in the national debt. I didn't even know \nthis was going to happen. No one spoke to me about this. Yet this is \nopen ended.\n  I had hoped to finish this bill tomorrow night, by tomorrow night. I \ndon't think that I would ever offer an amendment of this nature without \nconsulting with my colleague.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sorry. It is my memory we discussed that ceiling \nproblem and the Senator said he did not want to take it up.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't have that memory.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We don't have the same memory, as a practical matter.\n  I understand the Senator's position. I did introduce it and set it \naside because I wanted people to understand I believe it is my duty to \nsee to it that this subject is addressed during the consideration of \nthis bill. I am informed we will reach this problem sometime in June, \nJuly, or August, unless we do lift the debt ceiling. I do not think we \ncan go through this period of war and have that hanging out there and \nbe a subject that might constrain defense spending.\n  What I have done is introduced an amendment to this bill that says we \nwill increase the debt ceiling by the amount we have spent since \nSeptember 11 to meet the interests of our Department of Defense, \nhomeland security, and reaction to September 11. If the Senator says \nthat is open ended, I don't think it is open ended. I can figure it out \nfast and we will be glad to put the number in there if that will \nsatisfy the Senator's objection. I do think it will be an interesting \ndebate. We, undoubtedly, will have to raise the question, but based on \nour long friendship, I sincerely apologize if my memory is incorrect.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, ours has been a long friendship. It is \ngoing to continue. But I expect to be a partner in this fight. I expect \nto be told at least by the chairman that he anticipates calling up an \namendment of this nature.\n  A point of order would lie against this amendment. That would have \nbeen the very reaction I would have had if he had mentioned such an \namendment to me. I would say a point of order might lie against it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Unless it is perfected as the Senator suggests in terms \nof a problem with regard to the money.\n  Mr. BYRD. That constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The whole bill is legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I know.\n  I hope in the future I will not be taken by this kind of surprise.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I repeat my apology. My memory is we discussed whether \nwe should address it, the debt ceiling.\n  Mr. BYRD. When did we discuss it; I ask where did we discuss it?\n  Mr. STEVENS. In my office, sir.\n  I apologize. I have addressed this with several other Senators. I \napologize and I have taken it upon myself to say it is my error, but \nthe amendment is there and it is my duty to raise the subject of the \ndebt ceiling.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, that is quite all right, but I would at least like to \nknow in advance that it is being done, that is No. 1.\n  No. 2, this is an open-ended increase in the debt ceiling.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is the reason I introduced it and had it set aside \nso we could address the question of whether we should make it a closed \nsubject. We can calculate that amount right now. But it may be changed \nbefore this bill is over. The bill keeps going up. It is already up \nmore than the President asked for, and I believe it to be another $5 or \n$6 billion before we get the bill to conference.\n  In any event, the problem is, what are we going to do? Do we proceed \nwith the three wars we have going up on, and then, my God, we may not \nbe able to do that because if we do that we will exceed the debt \nceiling.\n  The President has the power--under food and forage--to start spending \nmoney. We have a program for other purposes, for the conduct of these \nthree wars. I take the position he should not be constrained at all by \na debt ceiling. It is my duty to raise that debt ceiling.\n  Again, I apologize to my friend. I would like to address, when the \nSenator is finished, Senator Durbin's comment about the pending \namendment. This is not the pending amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken to the manager of the bill \nand the ranking member, Senator Byrd, and I am going to speak on an \namendment I will offer at some subsequent time. Senator Stevens has \nindicated the amendment that is the first one that was offered here \ntoday will not be discussed until after we have the cloture vote on the \nEstrada nomination. That will be at around 2 o'clock. After that time, \nwe will again discuss that, if necessary.\n  Madam President, as I indicated, at some subsequent time, I will \noffer an amendment. The Democratic leader has indicated he wants just a \nfew amendments offered. He has gone over the amendments he feels would \nbe appropriate, and this is one of them.\n  So I would just simply say, if you watch television--as we all do \nevery night--you see the explosions going off in Baghdad and other \nplaces in Iraq. Lights coming up, flashes--they go away very quickly. \nThese violent occurrences we see on television are tiny, little babies \ncompared to what this amendment is all about.\n  A nuclear explosion makes everything that has happened in Iraq appear \nas if it is nothing. For everything that has happened in Iraq to this \npoint, one nuclear explosion would be far more devastating than \neverything that has taken place throughout the country of Iraq these \npast 2 weeks.\n  We have some knowledge in Nevada of the violence of a nuclear \nexplosion. For those who have been to the Nevada test site, as you \ndrive through the very remote area, you see holes in the ground that \nare bigger than the United States Capitol, where a nuclear explosion \nhas taken place--bigger than the United States Capitol.\n  You see where they have done aboveground tests. They still have the \nremnants of a small town that was destroyed. There are parts of it \nleft, but not much.\n  And then throughout the desert, where you do not see the large holes \nbigger than the United States Capitol, there are almost 1,000 \nindentations in the land where shafts have been sunk and these nuclear \ndevices set off far in the ground, thousands of feet into the ground--\nnot hundreds, thousands of feet in the ground--but yet the ground \nsettles. And as you drive through it, it is like the landscape of the \nmoon.\n  And then, things you cannot see are the tunnels. There are tunnels \nall over those mountains in the Nevada test site, where scores of \nnuclear explosions have been set off. We cannot see the devastation \nthat takes place inside the earth, but it has taken place.\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\n  We were concerned here in the Capitol when Senator Daschle's office \nwas anthraxed. Somebody sent him some poisonous material, and it took \nmillions of dollars to clean up the building the anthrax was in, the \nHart Office Building--millions of dollars. It took several months to \nclean that up.\n  We hear so much about dirty bombs. The explosion in most dirty bombs \nwould not be real big. It would be plenty big, but not as big as what I \nhave described at the Nevada test site. But one dirty bomb would so \ncontaminate a building, a neighborhood, a community, that it would be \nbasically useless for scores of years.\n  The amendment I am going to offer provides $400 million to the \nDepartment of Energy to safeguard nuclear weapons and nuclear material \nin the United States and throughout the world.\n\n  I want to make sure that Members in the Senate understand what I am \ndoing, what this amendment is attempting to do. The amendment provides \n$300 million for the Nuclear Nonproliferation Program and $100 million \nin additional funding to the Department of Energy to fund enhanced \nsafeguards and security programs at the Nation's nuclear weapons \nlaboratories and plants, at environmental management cleanup sites \nthroughout the Nation, and at DOE Office of Science laboratories. All \nof these sites are home to nuclear material which needs to be \nprotected.\n  There are large amounts of money in the supplemental appropriations \npackage for the Department of Homeland Security. And I supported that. \nIt is for first responder training and chem-bio detection and related \nactivities. It is a good thing. There will be efforts made to increase \nthat.\n  However, most of our Nation's nonproliferation activities and nuclear \ndetection activities are not housed within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. These activities are funded under the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, a semiautonomous organization within the \nDepartment of Energy. The administration request for nonproliferation \nand nuclear security was zero--nothing.\n  The broad authority to transfer funds to meet homeland security needs \nwould placate me a little bit if it were not for the fact that the \ntransfer authority is only available within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and the Department of Homeland Security is not in a position \nto transfer funds to the National Nuclear Security Administration for \nnuclear nonproliferation or security activities.\n  This is really a big concern. The GAO issued a Weapons of Mass \nDestruction report last week concerning the faltering cooperation the \nUnited States is receiving from Russia in terms of securing fissile \nnuclear material, and other weapons of mass destruction, in the former \nSoviet Republics. After years of effort, the United States is still \nstruggling to get access to most locations where nuclear material is \nstored. The ramifications of this report should frighten everyone. More \nimportantly, it is time for Congress to get moving on doing something \nabout this problem.\n  We have not even talked much about it, let alone done anything about \nit. It is incumbent upon this and all future administrations to get the \nmaterial secured as quickly as possible just as it is critical to \nensure that we do a better job protecting nuclear material in the \ncountry. However, since September 11, it has been like pulling teeth, \nfor lack of a better description, to get this administration to request \nsupplemental funding to better secure nuclear material at our weapons \nlabs and plants, DOE sites, and other laboratories run by the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  The administration has paid little heed to calls from within the \nDepartment to do a better job of transporting this stuff safely. Last \nyear, the Department requested hundreds of millions of dollars but OMB \nsimply wouldn't approve anything other than $26 million. In response, \nCongress appropriated $300 million in contingent emergency funding. The \nPresident refused to release this.\n  These moneys go to making a safer world. The reason we are doing this \nis to try to make sure that homeland security really means something \nand we have a program to do something about nuclear materials.\n  The neglect we have shown as a country is frightening. I am grateful \nto my colleagues and good friends, Senators Domenici and Stevens, for \nadding almost $100 million to this supplemental for many activities \nabout which I have spoken. They also added $54 million in additional \nsafeguards for Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation \nfacilities. That was important. My amendment seeks to build on that \nbase. This amendment pays for everything in the underlying amendment \nSenator Domenici worked to put in this and then funds many additional \nactivities that are crucial to our Nation's efforts to keep nuclear \nmaterials safe and secure.\n  The $400 million in this amendment is spread out as follows: The \nlargest proportion of this money goes to nuclear detectors at mega-\nseaports around the world, not here in the United States necessarily. \nThe global shipping system can deliver a containerized weapon of mass \ndestruction more accurately than a missile from the Soviet Union, \naccording to the Department of Energy. This isn't something I am making \nup. Vessels move 90 percent of our warfare fighting material and the \nbulk of goods our Nation purchases from abroad. Current U.S.-based \nsystems for protecting radioactive weapons are not oriented toward when \na port itself is a target of a weapon of mass destruction.\n  The Department of Energy has performed an analysis of shipping in the \nUnited States and has identified 60 foreign mega-seaports overseas \nwhere goods/containers from many nations first go before they are \nshipped to the United States. DOE indicates that, for example, about 10 \npercent of all containers shipping to the United States go through Hong \nKong and about 6 percent go through Shanghai and Singapore.\n  DOE has developed nuclear detectors that can be given to port \nauthorities in such mega-seaports in conjunction with U.S. Customs \nwhich provide port-wide alert of nuclear material. Detecting and \nimpounding illicit nuclear material before it is even sent to the \nUnited States provides the best protection we can get.\n  We have the technology; it is just expensive. This amendment would \npay for our going to Shanghai, to Singapore, to Hong Kong, these mega-\nports where we get so much of our material, and determine if any of \nthose shipments are nuclear in nature before they get here.\n  DOE is in the process of deploying the first radiological detection \nsystem to a foreign mega-seaport, but it has no funds appropriated in \nthe 2003 fiscal year or even budgeted for 2004 to do this. They are in \nthe process of deploying, but you can't deploy if you have no money. \nThis additional $135 million would provide protection for nine mega-\nseaports. It would not get all of them, but it would get the big ones. \nThis would be for a total of 10--the 1 they are trying to work out and \nthe 9. This additional money would allow screening of approximately \nhalf of all containerized shipping entering the United States. Right \nnow, we basically check none of it. This amendment would allow us to \ncheck 50 percent of it. This is something that is vitally important.\n  I talked about dirty bombs; radiological dispersal devices is the \ntechnical name. On March 11, Secretary Abraham addressed an \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency meeting, which he initiated to \ndiscuss the menace of radiological dispersal devices, with over 600 \npeople from 100 nations in attendance. It was our meeting, the United \nStates of America. The use of radioactive sources for peaceful purposes \nis widespread. They have many beneficial industrial, agricultural, \nresearch, and medical applications, but terrorists also may seek such \ndevices for their radiological content to construct dirty bombs and \ncause panic and economic disruption by spreading radioactive material \nover a wide area and detonating high explosives. I repeat, what \nhappened in the Hart Building with anthrax is nothing compared to any \ndirty bomb.\n  The Secretary said at that international gathering:\n\n       ``It is our critically important job to deny terrorists the \n     radioactive sources they need to construct such weapons. The \n     threat requires a determined and comprehensive international \n     response. Our governments must act, individually and \n     collectively, to\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\n     identify all the high-risk radioactive sources that are being \n     used and have been abandoned.'' The Secretary told the \n     conference ``We are ready to assist other interested \n     countries to speed the needed improvements, and we want to \n     begin immediately.''\n\n  I am sure his heart was in the right place, but he had no ability to \ndeliver on the statement he made to this conference.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We are prepared to work with other countries to locate, \n     consolidate, secure, and dispose of high risk radiological \n     sources by developing a system of national regional \n     repositories to consolidate and securely store these sources.\n\n  The administration has never requested a penny for this purpose. It \nseems now that this supplemental appropriations bill is where we should \nmake the Secretary's offer of assistance to the international community \ncredible.\n  This bill calls for $20 million for nonproliferation assistance to \nnations other than the former Soviet Union. The Materials, Protection, \nControls, and Accounting Agency nuclear nonproliferation programs to \ndate have only targeted nations of the former Soviet Union. There is no \nmoney to do anything about it, to assist countries all over the world, \nespecially in Southeast Asia--no money. Obviously, the point is made \nthere.\n  We have $20 million in this bill for funds that are needed to develop \nthe analytical capability to determine the nature and origin of a \nstolen nuclear weapon or captured improvised nuclear device or what \nhappened and who did it in the event of nuclear detonation on U.S. \nsoil.\n  We need research and development. If a nuclear device is found, we \nneed to be able to determine what kind of a device it is, how it will \ndetonate, how to defuse it. We have $20 million, a relatively small \namount, the Department needs to improve material and radiochemical \nanalysis methods, the sampling and modeling of nuclear explosion \ndebris, and the implications of nuclear weapons design.\n  Our weapons labs around this country have the best scientists in the \nworld. I have been to the weapons labs: Livermore, Sandia, Los Alamos. \nThey have the best and the brightest. But they can't do anything to \nhelp us unless they have money to do the research. That is what this \nwill do.\n  In this amendment, we have $15 million for nuclear nonproliferation \nverification, $12 million for nonproliferation assistance to Russian \nstrategic rocket forces. What is this amount? Certain elements of the \nRussian military prefer to deal with our Department of Energy rather \nthan the Department of Defense. For example, all work by the United \nStates to secure Russian Navy warheads has been done by DOE. The fiscal \nyear 2004 budget proposes for the first time for DOE to assist the \nRussian strategic rocket force ICBMs to secure its weapons. It contains \nfunds to secure 2 of the first 10 most viable sites. Additional funds \nin the supplemental would start the program much earlier and increase \nthe number of sites to be protected.\n  I have worked with Senator Domenici for many years, as the ranking \nmember and chairman--going back and forth--of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee on Appropriations. We have the responsibility to take care \nof our nuclear weapons. Large amounts of money are appropriated every \nyear. We in the United States appropriate large sums of money to make \nsure our nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. A nuclear stockpile is \nnot like storing a car. It is not like storing canned goods. These \nweapons have elements that go bad, and you need to constantly review, \nexamine these weapons to find if they are safe and reliable. The \nRussians know this. But they have not had the resources to help. It is \nin our best interest to work with them, with Nunn-Lugar and other such \nmethods, to try to help them make their stockpile safe and reliable. \nHere is $12 million for additional funds that, as I have indicated, \nwould help the ICBMs in Russia be safe and reliable.\n  When the war with Iraq ends and we find weapons of mass destruction \nin with nuclear material, we need to make sure we will have some way of \ndisposing of them. We have provided in this bill for that. We want to \nmake sure there is money for nuclear material detection regarding \nmaterials and devices.\n  Funds are also needed to help develop advanced materials that will \nenable the fielding of room-temperature, high-resolution, hand-held and \nportable radiation detection and identification equipment. Our labs can \ndo that with the scientific community, many of which are in the private \nsector.\n  We have another problem. We need to be able to detect any nuclear \nexplosion from proliferant countries that have very low yield. We don't \nhave the equipment to do that. We need $10 million to do that. What we \nhave in this amendment is a number of efforts to simply make our \ncountry safer, to make homeland security apply also to things nuclear.\n  I am going to offer this amendment when we get the parliamentary \nproblem worked out. The threat of loose nukes worldwide scares me as \nmuch as anything that I am afraid of. We have to do something about it. \nWe have not talked about it. It is like the perennial ostrich sticking \nhis head underground so he cannot see what is going on. I see what is \ngoing on, and the Senate must see what is going on. This bill, which is \nextremely important--as important as anything we do for homeland \nsecurity--contains $400 million, directed totally to things nuclear.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4666-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4666-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4666-S4676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n MIGUEL A. ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                    THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 1:30 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now go into executive session and \nresume consideration of Executive Calendar No. 21, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished chairman is \non his way over. As we have evenly divided time and time is running, I \nwill begin and will yield when he arrives.\n  We have another in a series of cloture votes on this divisive \nnomination today. Actually, nothing has changed significantly since the \nleadership forced the three previous cloture votes.\n  I did read in the New York Times over the weekend that Mr. Estrada \nspoke about the memos he wrote as being perhaps somewhat divisive. \nMaybe that is why the White House does not want us to see them. The \nonly reason we are having these problems is the administration has \nrefused to bring forward the writings on which one could form an idea \nwhether he should have a lifetime appointment to the second highest \ncourt in the country.\n  The White House has had access to all these writings and they eagerly \ncommitted the political capital to go forward. But they don't want us \nto see them. The administration remains insistent that the Senate \nrubberstamp nominees without fulfilling the Senate's constitutional \nadvise and consent role in this most important process.\n  Everyone has known for a long time how to solve the impasse in the \nMiguel Estrada nomination. The Democratic leader's letter pointed the \nway back in early February. Some say that the administration is \nproceeding this way because they do not care whether he goes through or \nnot. They think somehow it is a political issue. That is the problem if \nthis administration continues in its efforts to politicize the Federal \ncourts.\n  There has been too much politicizing. The Federal courts are not a \nbranch that belongs to either the Republican or Democratic party. They \nare not a branch of whoever is in the White House or in control of the \nCongress. They are the one independent branch of Government. They are \nsupposed to be above politics, outside of politics, and\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\nyet in this case the White House could easily move forward with this \nnomination but is choosing to keep it in limbo. Unfortunately, too many \nMembers are willing to dance to that tune.\n\n  Remember, it says advise and consent not advise and rubberstamp. The \nadministration and Mr. Estrada do not want to show Members his \nwritings. This is part of the work and experience that made the White \nHouse such an eager supporter of him. The American people and their \nrepresentative ought to know how he thinks and have the best basis to \npredict how he would act as a judge, whether as an ideologue or as an \nimpartial judge.\n  Past administrations--and I have been here with President Ford, \nPresident Carter, President Reagan, former President Bush, and \nPresident Clinton--they have all shown similar type writings to the \nSenate. We had nominations of Robert Bork, William Rehnquist, Brad \nReynold, Ben Civiletti, and others. Even this administration did so for \na nominee to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  We have had senior members in the Republican Party say they wish the \nWhite House would show some cooperation, as past White Houses have, to \nget forward on this. Instead, we continue being blocked by the \nadministration's position when we should be going forward.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his service as ranking Democrat \non the Senate Judiciary Committee. I would like to put the Senator from \nVermont on the spot with a question.\n  If the White House will allow these writings that are in controversy \nhere by Miguel Estrada to be released to the Congress for review, and \nif we are then given a chance to review them, to bring Mr. Estrada for \na hearing, if necessary, so we can ask questions, some of which he has \nnot answered completely before, at that point would the Senator from \nVermont personally urge the Democrats in committee to allow this \nprocess to move forward in an orderly fashion to consideration in \ncommittee, to a vote in the committee, and to a vote on the floor?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend from Illinois, of course I would. I \nhave said this right along. I may or may not vote for Mr. Estrada based \non what is in the writings, but I will never give a blank check to any \nPresident--I have not--Democrat or Republican. I want to know what is \nin there. After all, there have been statements by this person's \nsupervisor that he did not fairly state the law in the course of his \nwork. We should have the basis to determine the quality of his work.\n  As the Senator from Illinois knows, when I was chairman of the \ncommittee, in 17 months we certainly moved far more of President Bush's \nnominees than the Republicans did when they were in the chair the \nprevious 17 months for President Clinton. I believe that we actually \nmoved more than the previous 30-month period under them. I did not \nallow the secret holds they had used extensively to block President \nClinton's nominees. At times, they actually required 100 Senators to be \nfor somebody before they would go through it.\n  A former Republican leader accepted part of the blame for how the \nSenate came to this, and I appreciate him doing that. He acknowledged \nyou filibuster a lot of different ways. The Republican majority often \ndefeated nominees by making sure they were never given a hearing or a \nvote. I don't believe in that.\n  If a nominee will go through the normal process, if the White House \nwill stop playing games, if they will stop stonewalling, I am perfectly \nwilling to go forward.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Vermont, if he will yield \nfurther, in my experience in trial practice before I was elected to \nCongress, one's curiosity was always raised when the party on the other \nside refused to disclose a document. You had to go to court and have a \ndecision made by the judge in discovery as to whether they would be \nrequired to produce the document. You naturally believed, if they were \nholding back a document, then certainly it might be a document that \nwould compromise their position or jeopardize their position.\n\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont, is it not a fact now \nthat because of this long delay and because of this intransigence by \nthe White House to release these documents, there is more and more \ncuriosity as to what is contained in them? Here we have a nominee who, \ndespite an excellent academic resume, really has little to show in \nterms of legal writings or things that give us an insight into why he \nshould be selected for a lifetime appointment to the DC Circuit Court.\n  I ask the Senator from Vermont, isn't it fairly obvious at this point \nthat, if the White House will release these documents and start the \norderly process, then we can have a final disposition of Mr. Estrada, \njust as soon as they respond?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would think so, I say to my friend from Illinois. Again, \nthe point is the White House has had access to these papers. Surely \nthey did a thorough review of this nomination. Surely someone in the \nadministration must know what these documents contain if they are \nrefusing to provide them and Republican Senators are asserting that \nthey are ``privileged''. I would hope that no one, and certainly no one \nwith legal training, would assert a privilege without knowing whether \nit applies. My recollection is that the administration took several \nweeks to respond to our request for the documents. Surely they were not \nsimply ignoring our request for those weeks. I would have assumed they \nwere using that time to review the documents and determine what could \nbe produced immediately and what might require further discussion. They \nwant to put this young man, at 41 years old, on the second highest \ncourt in the land. But they don't want us to know about his legal work \nand judgment when he was working for the government. They are saying: \nWe'll nominate; you rubberstamp. I am saying it is advice and consent. \nThat has worked in the Constitution for all the history of this country \nand will continue to work.\n  We had an example of internal Justice Department documents that were \nthe work on another of the President's controversial nominees that have \npreviously been produced to the Senate. At least the papers came forth. \nWe find that she, working for a previous Republican administration, had \nstrongly organized, in fact, went out of her way to help support a tax \nexemption for a college that discriminated against African Americans, \ndiscriminated against Catholics, discriminated against Mormons, took \nthe most radical position, but was a darling of the Republican Party. \nHer nomination to a major court of appeals position by this \nadministration is now pending. But at least we knew of her work and at \nleast she could be questioned on it.\n  I would say to my friend from Illinois that we began this because we \nwere waiting for the distinguished chairman. He is here. I suggest I \nreserve the remainder of my time and yield to the distinguished \nchairman as I had agreed when we called off the quorum at the request \nof the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 15 minutes \nremaining. The other side has 6 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is the first true filibuster in \nhistory of a circuit court of appeals nominee--the first one in \nhistory. It just has never happened before, no matter how controversial \nthe nominee--and this one certainly is not controversial. They just \nhaven't found anything to criticize him with, and that is the problem.\n  The distinguished Senator from Vermont says he is not going to \nrubberstamp anybody. Don't anybody worry about that. The Democrats have \nnot rubberstamped one of these judicial nominations of President Bush \nso far. In fact, they voted against a high percentage of President \nBush's nominees.\n  Frankly--ask all those who have gone through this process--it is an \narduous, difficult, and in many ways a demeaning process as a result of \nthe way my colleagues on the other side seem to be attacking these \nnominees.\n  The White House has been accused of political games in putting Miguel \nEstrada up, and in not allowing fishing expeditions into the most \nsensitive documents in the Justice Department. Those documents are the \nappeal, certiorari, and amicus recommendations\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nmade by people such as Mr. Estrada while they are there.\n  Seven living former Solicitors General have all said there is no way \nthat any administration should give those documents to the Senate. I \nmight add, four of those are Democrats, three of whom were Democratic \nSolicitors General with whom Miguel Estrada worked and for whom they \nhad great affection. Seth Waxman, who is a great lawyer here in this \ntown and a partisan Democrat, basically said Estrada has every \nqualification a person should have for the bench and basically said he \ndid a good job while at the Department.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Illinois say he has little to \nshow in legal writings. What about the 15 briefs he has written for the \nU.S. Supreme Court? That is a lot of legal writings, more than almost \nany nominee we have had here in the history of my 27 years on the \nJudiciary Committee. What about all the appeal briefs he has written \nand the reply briefs he has written, not only on the Supreme Court but \nin the circuit courts of appeals? They have access to every one of \nthose. What about all the written questions they have given him? Only \ntwo asked for them after the hearing, and then we agreed to provide him \nto answer more written questions, and only one or two have asked \nfurther written questions.\n  There is no desire on the part of my Democratic colleagues to learn \nmore about Miguel Estrada. There is a desire to find something they can \nhang their hat on to stop him because he is on the fast track to the \nSupreme Court, they believe. The best way they can show President Bush \nthey are not going to have a conservative Hispanic on the court is by \nattacking Miguel Estrada, and that is what is behind this matter.\n  Today we are debating a historic fourth cloture vote on the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada. No other Executive Calendar nominee, \njudicial or nonjudicial, has ever been subjected to four cloture votes \nin this body.\n  Let me state that a clear majority of this body supports this \nnomination, as has been determined by the past three cloture votes. So \nit is regrettable that a minority of Senators have followed their \nscript of obstructionism to prevent the Senate from concluding this \ndebate on this nomination and allowing the Senate to proceed to a final \nvote. However, it is not surprising they have stalled this nomination. \nIn September of last year, a Democratic staffer on the Judiciary \nCommittee is quoted in The Nation magazine as saying:\n\n       Estrada is 40, and if he makes it to the circuit then he \n     will be Bush's first Supreme Court nominee. He could be on \n     the Supreme Court for 30 years and do a lot of damage. We \n     have to stop him now.\n\n  That, by the way, is a Democratic staffer on the Senate side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield? Do you have the name?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not going to name names on the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is this one of those unnamed sources?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. It appears the real reason for the filibuster--I suggest \nto the distinguished Senator, just read The Nation magazine and you can \nfind out for yourself. Why should I provide information to you anymore?\n  It appears that the real reason for this filibuster is the threat of \na Justice Estrada on the Supreme Court. Of course, I take issue with \nthe assertion that Mr. Estrada would do any so-called damage on any \ncourt. In fact, I am confident that he would be a fair and unbiased \njudge who would follow the law. He would not be an activist, which is \nprobably what this staffer meant when he said that Mr. Estrada would do \na lot of damage. But I find it ironic that this staffer knew enough \nabout Miguel Estrada last September to proclaim that he must be stopped \nat all costs, when some of my Democratic friends insist on continuing \nthis filibuster because they allegedly do not know enough about his \nviews. Read the Nation magazine. I think the real reason for this \nfilibuster lies in the rest of the staffer's quote: That Mr. Estrada is \na Supreme Court caliber attorney whose ascension to the Federal bench \nmust be stopped now.\n  This unparalleled filibuster is one of many weapons of obstruction \ndesigned to prevent the President from having his nominees fairly \nconsidered and voted upon by the Senate. This is according to a \npartisan game plan, developed and coordinated as early as April 2001, \nwhen, according to the New York Times, Senate Democrats met in a \nprivate retreat to forge a unified party strategy to combat the White \nHouse on judicial nominees. I would like them to deny this. I would \nlike them to tell me The New York Times misquoted and didn't tell the \ntruth here. They can't deny it. As one participant in the meeting \nstated, according to that press account, it was ``important for the \nSenate to change the ground rules'' on judicial nominations.\n  One of the three noted liberals who coached Senate Democrats on \nchanging the ground rules on judicial nominations was University of \nChicago law professor Cass Sunstein. Just the other day I came across a \nYale Law Review article that Professor Sunstein co-authored in 1992 \nentitled The Senate, the Constitution, and the Confirmation Process. \nThis article advocates a confirmation process in which the Senate plays \na more aggressive and high-profile role. I found surprisingly familiar \nmany of the principles he propounds in that article because I have \nheard a number of my Democratic colleagues also arguing for their \nadoption time and again in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate \nfloor.\n  For example, Professor Sunstein says:\n\n       [T]he criticisms of the current process are telling. \n     Supporters of the administration object that members of the \n     Senate, and private groups generally critical of the \n     Administration, expend enormous energy not in \n     disinterested inquiry but in trying to `catch' the \n     nominee: to find some statement in her record that reveals \n     a belief so extreme as to be `out of the mainstream.'\n\n  When I read this statement, I thought it sounded familiar, so I took \na look at the remarks of my colleague from New York Senator Schumer, \nwhen he chaired a hearing in June 2001 at which he argued that a \njudicial nominee's ideology should play a role in the confirmation \nprocess.\n  Sure enough, here is what my good friend said:\n\n       [T]his unwillingness to openly examine ideology has \n     sometimes led Senators who oppose a nominee to seek out non-\n     ideological disqualifying factors, like small financial \n     improprieties from long ago, to justify their opposition. \n     This, in turn, has led to an escalating war of ``gotcha'' \n     politics that, in my judgment, has warped the Senate's \n     confirmation process and harmed the Senate's reputation.\n\n  Professor Sunstein also argues that:\n\n     [t]he senate should place the burden of proof--with respect \n     to character, excellence, and point of view--on the nominee.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       In exercising its consent power, the Senate is entitled to \n     reject nominees simply because they have not established that \n     they have the requisite qualities, even if there is \n     considerable uncertainly on that point.\n\n  Well, as we all know, after Senator Schumer's hearing on ideology in \nthe confirmation process, he held a second hearing arguing Professor \nSunstein's precise point: That the burden of proving worthiness for \nconfirmation should be on the nominee. In fact, this is one of the \nfactors sustaining this filibuster: The ill-formed perception that \nMiguel Estrada has not proven that he deserves to be confirmed to the \nDC Circuit.\n  Back to Professor Sunstein. He also says:\n\n       The President, his opponents say, chooses `stealth' \n     nominees whom he has reason to believe are deeply \n     conservative, but whose views the Senate will not be able to \n     uncover.\n\n  This, of course, is precisely how Senator Schumer characterized Mr. \nEstrada in The Nation magazine last fall. He said:\n\n       Estrada is like a Stealth missile--with a nose cone--coming \n     out of the right wing's deepest silo.\n\n  I have heard a number of my other Democratic colleagues join in the \nchorus of labeling Mr. Estrada a stealth nominee.\n  Mr. President, I think I have made my point. This 1992 article \nwritten by Cass Sunstein provided the basis for the model that some of \nmy Democratic colleagues are using to stall up or down votes on \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees, including Miguel Estrada. This \nfilibuster is part of a coordinated attack designed to deny President \nBush's circuit nominees a seat on the Federal bench.\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\n  Don't get me wrong--Professor Sunstein is an unabashedly liberal law \nprofessor, and as such it can be argued that he has carte blanche, or \neven an obligation, to push the far-left envelope, which he regularly \ndoes. But this does not mean that my Democratic colleagues have an \nobligation to blindly follow him into the far-left. Some of them have \nrefused to do so, and I commend them for that.\n  For the others, I will repeat my sentiments which I stated here on \nthe Senate floor just a few weeks ago. This historic cloture vote \nrepresents another opportunity for my Democratic colleagues to reverse \ncourse. This is the time to end their dangerous obstructionist tactics \nand grant Mr. Estrada the up or down vote any judicial nominee \ndeserves. They are free to vote against confirming him if they truly \nbelieve that he has not answered their questions, or that his record is \nincomplete without examining the Solicitor General memoranda. But they \nshould not continue to obstruct the will of the majority of this body \nthat desires to give this nominee a vote.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 6 minutes 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. To date, there have been at least 77 editorials and op-eds \nin support of the position of Democratic Senators on the nominations of \nMr. Miguel Estrada's nomination to the Court of the Appeals for D.C. \nCircuit. On March 6, 2003, I placed in the Congressional Record \nexcerpts of the editorials and op-eds that had been published by that \ndate, because Republicans had been asserting that there were only a \nhandful of editorials or op-eds in support of our concerns. Here are \nsome excerpts from 24 additional editorials and op-eds expressing \nconcerns about Mr. Estrada's nomination, bringing the total to at least \n77. This controversial nomination continues to divide, rather than to \nunite, the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record excerpts of 24 recent \neditorials or op-eds, in addition to those printed last month.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 13, 2003]\n\n                          Hold Firm on Estrada\n\n       [Supporters] argued that handing over Mr. Estrada's \n     memorandums would be a violation of privacy, although other \n     nominees, including Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Judge \n     Robert Bork, did so in their own confirmation hearings. \n     Supporters have also contended, shamefully, that opposition \n     to Mr. Estrada is anti-Latino, even though his nomination is \n     opposed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Mexican \n     American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and other leading \n     Latino groups. Now Republicans are attacking Democratic \n     senators for using a filibuster. The criticism rings hollow, \n     given that some Republicans making it, including the majority \n     leader, Bill Frist, voted to filibuster when President \n     Clinton nominated Richard Paez, a Mexican-American, to an \n     appeals court. Rather than demonizing Democratic senators, \n     the White House should look for common ground. In the case of \n     Mr. Estrada, it should respect the Senate's role in the \n     process by making his full record available. And going \n     forward, it should choose judicial nominees from the \n     ideological mainstream, who do not prompt the sort of bitter \n     partisan divisions that Mr. Estrada has.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Connecticut Law Tribune, Mar. 24, 2003]\n\n                           Nomination Battles\n\n       Because federal judgeships are for life, what is at stake \n     is what the law of the land will be for the next two or three \n     decades.

Estrada would be such a \n     judge. At least that is a fair assumption based on the record \n     of the Senate committee hearing on his confirmation. He \n     wasn't willing to offer his views on many of the most \n     pertinent and controversial constitutional questions of \n     concern to courts, Congress and the public. He declined to \n     make available memoranda he wrote for the office of solicitor \n     general when he worked there.

Period. This adamantine posture, in the eyes of some \n     in Senate GOP leadership circles, handcuffed Frist. ``There's \n     some frustration,'' said a top GOP leadership aide. ``From \n     the very beginning we told them that was the only way out and \n     a face-saver for everyone. But it came down to the fact \n     that no one on the White House or Justice team wanted to \n     walk into the Oval Office and say to the president, ``You \n     might have to give up these memos.'' The administration's \n     position on the memos reflects its deeply held ethic of \n     aggressively defending executive branch prerogatives. \n     Though the White House has never characterized the Estrada \n     matter as one of executive privilege ... it falls into the \n     broad category of executive branch muscularity. And while \n     most Republicans generally support this posture, some Bush \n     allies on and off Capitol Hill have come to question the \n     administration's fastidiousness in the Estrada fight.\n\n  In addition, there have been dozens and dozens and dozens of letters \nto the editor published in opposition to editorials supporting the \nRepublican position on this nomination. Here is just one sample of \nthose many letters from citizens across the country:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 2003]\n\n                     Behind the Estrada Filibuster\n\n       The depth of Mr. Estrada's sentiments on issues facing the \n     federal courts seems to be known only to the far-right \n     members of the legal community who support him and to the \n     Bush administration. The question is whether the Senate, \n     which has an equal say in whether Mr. Estrada will sit on the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, has an equal \n     right to the information, including Justice Department \n     memorandums, that is available to the administration. It is \n     far from extortionate that senators not be forced to vote \n     without the information the administration holds.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I try to keep a straight face when I hear \nmy good friend, the distinguished Senator from Utah, speaking, but it \nis hard. He has been able to master the ability to look stern and self-\nrighteous, as he has throughout a recitation of the revisionist history \nhere.\n  The question of precedent? The Republicans joined the filibusters of \nStephen Breyer to the First Circuit, Judge Rosemary Barkett to the \nEleventh Circuit, Judge H. Lee Sarokin to the Third Circuit, Judge \nRichard Paez to the Ninth Circuit, and Judge Marsha Berzon to the Ninth \nCircuit. We had to have cloture votes on all but one of these and on \nseveral others.\n  But as the former Republican leader admitted--and I commend him for \nthis--they did not have to go to filibusters on most of these because \nthey never brought them up at all. They never had a hearing on them. \nThey never had a vote on them in committee or anywhere else. In effect, \nthey had a filibuster of one. If any one Republican Senator objected to \nany one of President Clinton's nominees, or just a few, the caucus \nwould make the determination they would never get a hearing. The \ndistinguished chairman at that time would not give them a hearing. They \nwould not get a vote. It was only if the caucus decided that they would \nbe allowed to go forward would they even get a vote.\n  So it begs credulity to hear this kind of sophistry on the Senate \nfloor and the nature of a ``filibuster'' being constantly redefined. \nThey would not allow them to come to a vote at all.\n  During the 17 months when we controlled the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees. We had \nhearings on 103. We voted down 2. We confirmed 100. There was no \nsimilar period of time when President Clinton was in office and the \nRepublicans were in control that they passed anywhere near as many \njudges for President Clinton.\n  I wonder if I could have order just for the sake of precedent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We moved them through. And we got rid of the anonymous \nholds. We got rid of the secret holds. I will explain in greater \ndetail.\n  Mr. President, the Republican leadership in the Senate has chosen \ntoday for another in a series of cloture votes on this divisive \nnomination. Nothing has significantly changed since it forced the three \nprevious cloture votes. The administration's obstinacy continues to \nimpede progress to resolve this matter. The administration remains \nintent on packing the Federal circuit courts and on insisting that the \nSenate rubber stamp its nominees without fulfilling the Senate's \nconstitutional advise and consent role in this most important process. \nThe White House could have long ago helped solve the impasse on the \nEstrada nomination by honoring the Senate's role in the appointment \nprocess and providing the Senate with access to Mr. Estrada's legal \nwork. Past administrations have provided such legal memoranda in \nconnection with the nominations of Robert Bork, William Rehnquist, Brad \nReynolds, Stephen Trott and Ben Civiletti, and even this administration \ndid so with a nominee to the Environmental Protection Agency. In my \nstatement in connection with the last cloture vote I outlined \nadditional precedent for sharing the requested materials with the \nSenate as did Senator Kennedy.\n  We have the statement of Attorney General Robert H. Jackson, who \nlater became one of our finest Supreme Court Justices, when he wrote an \nAttorney General Opinion in 1941 acknowledging that among the occasions \nwhen exceptions should be made and Executive department files would be \nproduced to the Congress would be confirmations. As Attorney General \nJackson noted:\n\n       Of course, where the public interest has seemed to justify \n     it, information as to particular situations has been supplied \n     to congressional committees by me and by former Attorneys \n     General. For example, I have taken the position that \n     committees called upon to pass on the confirmation of persons \n     recommended for appointment by the Attorney General would be \n     afforded confidential access to any information that we \n     have--because no candidate's name is submitted without his \n     knowledge and the Department does not intend to submit the \n     name of any person whose entire history will not stand light.\n\n  I mentioned the additional example of similar materials that were \nprovided to Congress in 1982 by the Reagan administration when the \nSenate Finance Committee held a hearing to consider legislation to deny \nfederal tax-exempt status to private schools practicing racial \ndiscrimination. A number of Justice Department memoranda, as well as \ncommunications between high-level officials, were turned over by the \nReagan administration to the Senate Finance Committee in connection \nwith the hearing, just months after the documents were first written. \nThe issues at that hearing reveal that some of the documents turned \nover were much more sensitive than those requested of Mr. Estrada, but \nthey were still provided to Congress by the Reagan administration.\n  The documents turned over to the Senate included:\n  Letters from Representative Trent Lott to Secretary Regan, IRS \nCommissioner Egger, and Solicitor General Lee, urging change in the \nadministration's position on Bob Jones; memorandum from Associate \nDeputy Attorney General Bruce Fein to Deputy Attorney General Edward \nSchmults, advising Schmults on private schools; memorandum from Carolyn \nKuhl, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, to Ken Starr, noting \nReagan/Bush campaign statements on private schools; memorandum from \nPeter Wallison, Treasury General Counsel, to Secretary Regan briefing \nhim on meeting with Representative Lott; memorandum from Treasury \nGeneral Counsel Wallison to Deputy Secretary McNamar and Secretary \nRegan on Government's position in Bob Jones case; memorandum from Civil \nRights Division Head, William Bradford Reynolds, to Attorney General \nSmith justifying changes in administration's position on Bob Jones; \nmemorandum from Treasury Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, Ann \nMcLaughlin, to Deputy Secretary McNamar on ``press strategy'' for \nreleasing Bob Jones decision; memorandum from IRS Chief Counsel Gideon \nto Treasury Deputy General Counsel Government's statement in\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\nBob Jones; letter from IRS Chief Counsel Gideon to Civil Rights \nDivision Head Reynolds on formulation of Government's statement in Bob \nJones; and memorandum from Assistant Attorney General Theodore Olson, \nOffice of Legal Counsel, to Attorney General Smith and Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Schmults responding to the analysis in Reynolds' memo on Bob \nJones.\n  In 1982, the Republican administration at that time released to the \nSenate documents that included internal memoranda among high-level \nJustice Department officials, inter-agency communications, and \ndocuments relating to the government's position in an important Supreme \nCourt case. They also included letters to the Solicitor General.\n  Moreover, the Reagan administration turned over these documents \nwithin months after being written, and no harm was done to the workings \nof the Justice Department or the administration. The Bush \nadministration is claiming that it is unprecedented to turn over such \ndocuments--and that the release of documents written by Mr. Estrada 6 \nto 10 years earlier would irreparably harm the government. I urge the \nadministration and Republican Senators to consider this additional \nprecedent.\n\n  I also noted how in 2001, this White House agreed to give access to \nmemoranda written by Jeffrey Holmstead, nominated to be an Assistant \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works requested memoranda from \nHolmstead's years of service in the White House counsel's office under \nformer President Bush. In particular, the Committee was interested in \nmaterials related to Holmstead's handling of an amendment to the Clean \nAir Act and other environmental issues. In the summer of 2001, the Bush \nadministration resolved an impasse with the Committee over the \nnomination by permitting Committee staffers to review memoranda that \nHolmstead wrote while in the White House counsel's office. In sum, the \nadministration allowed access to documents from the White House \ncounsel's office--a more sensitive post than the one Mr. Estrada held \nwhen he was in the Department of Justice.\n  So, despite this administration's continued insistence on \nconfidentiality, it has turned over, allowed access or worked to reach \nan accommodation on access to documents similar to those requested in \nconnection with the Estrada nomination in other cases and for other \ncommittees. In the matter of the Estrada nomination, the question \nbefore the Senate concerns a lifetime appointment to the second-highest \ncourt in the land.\n  The former Republican leader accepted ``part of the blame'' for how \nthe Senate has come to consider judicial nominations. I appreciate that \nbecause it is one of the few times a Republican Senator has accepted \nresponsibility for what happened during the years in which the \nRepublican majority in the Senate blocked and delayed so many of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees. The Senator from Mississippi \nalso acknowledged that ``you filibuster a lot of different ways.'' I \nthank the Senator from Mississippi for trying to be constructive and \nfor suggesting that ``something can be worked out'' on the request for \nMr. Estrada's work papers from the Department of Justice.\n  A recent edition of The Weekly Standard, a report suggests that other \nSenate Republicans, ``several veteran GOP Senate staffers'' and ``a top \nGOP leadership aide'' asked the White House to show some flexibility \nand to share the legal memoranda with the Senate to resolve this \nmatter, but they were rebuffed. It is regrettable that the White House \nwill not listen to reason from Senate Democrats or Senate Republicans. \nIf they had, there would be no need for this cloture vote. The White \nHouse is less interested in making progress on the Estrada nomination \nthan in trying to score political points and to divide the Hispanic \ncommunity.\n  The real ``double standard'' here is that the President selected Mr. \nEstrada based in large part on his work for four and a half years in \nthe Solicitor General's Office as well as for his ideological views, \nbut the Administration says that the Senate may not examine his written \nwork from the office that would shed the most light on his views. The \nWhite House says that the Senate should not consider the very ideology \nthe White House took into account in selecting a 41-year-old for a \nlifetime seat on the country's second-highest court. Another double \nstandard at work here is that this is a nominee who is well known for \nhaving very passionate views about judicial decisions and legal policy \nand is well known for being outspoken, and yet he has refused to share \nhis views with the very people charged with evaluating his nomination. \nIt seems to be a perversion of the constitutional process to require \nthe Senate to stumble in the dark about his views, when he shares his \nviews quite freely with others and when this Administration has \nselected him for the privilege of this high office, and for life, based \non those views.\n  Just this past weekend, a story in The New York Times reported that \nduring his nomination hearing which I scheduled and Senator Schumer \nchaired last September, ``Mr. Estrada took what is often called `the \njudicial fifth,' declining to answer many questions by saying that he \ncould not comment on issues that might come before him should he be \nconfirmed.'' The report correctly continued: ``It is a common approach \nfor judicial nominees, but Mr. Estrada was more reticent than most.'' \nThe report also notes that: ``Mr. Estrada gave a hint that what the \nmemorandums might disclose was his impatient manner when he told the \ncommittee he might have harshly dismissed some arguments by junior \nlawyers.'' Our review of the requested documents would end the mystery \nand speculation.\n  One of the most disconcerting aspects of the manner in which the \nSenate is approaching these divisive judicial nominations is what \nappears to be the Republican majority's willingness to sacrifice the \nconstitutional authority of the Senate as a check on the power of the \nPresident in the area of lifetime appointments to our federal courts. \nIt should concern all of us and the American people that the Republican \nmajority's efforts to re-write Senate history in order to rubber stamp \nthis White House's federal judicial nominees will cause long-term \ndamage to this institution, to our courts, to our constitutional form \nof government, to the rights and protections of the American people and \nto generations to come.\n  Republicans are now willing to breach the 24-year-old rule of the \nJudiciary Committee that had always protected the right of the minority \nto debate a matter. Republicans have now established a double standard \nwith respect to the opposition of home-state Senators. If the \nopposition to a judicial nominee is that of a Republican home State \nSenator to a nominee of a Democratic President, it is honored and no \nhearing may go forward. But if the opposition is to a judicial nominee \nof a Republican President by a Democratic home State Senator, well that \nis too bad and the Republican majority does not choose to defer or care \nor honor that objection.\n  The White House is using ideology to select its judicial nominees but \nis trying to prevent the Senate from knowing the ideology of these \nnominees when it evaluates them. It was not so long ago when then-\nSenator Ashcroft was chairing a series of Judiciary Committee hearings \nat which Edwin Meese III testified:\n\n       I think that very extensive investigations of each \n     nominee--and I don't worry about the delay that this might \n     cause because, remember, those judges are going to be on the \n     bench for their professional lifetime, so they have got \n     plenty of time ahead once they are confirmed, and there is \n     very little opportunity to pull them out of those benches \n     once they have been confirmed--I think a careful \n     investigation of the background of each judge, including \n     their writings, if they have previously been judges or in \n     public positions, the actions that they have taken, the \n     decisions that they have written, so that we can to the \n     extent possible eliminate people who would turn out to be \n     activist judges from being confirmed.\n\n  Timothy E. Flanigan, an official from the administration of the \nPresident's father, and who more recently served as Deputy White House \nCounsel, helping the current President select his judicial nominees, \ntestified strongly in favor of ``the need for the Judiciary Committee \nand the full Senate to be extraordinarily diligent in examining the \njudicial philosophy of potential nominees.'' He continued:\n\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\n\n       In evaluating judicial nominees, the Senate has often been \n     stymied by its inability to obtain evidence of a nominee's \n     judicial philosophy. In the absence of such evidence, the \n     Senate has often confirmed a nominee on the theory that it \n     could find no fault with the nominee.\n       I would reverse the presumption and place the burden \n     squarely on the shoulders of the judicial nominee to prove \n     that he or she has a well-thought-out judicial philosophy, \n     one that recognizes the limited role for Federal judges. Such \n     a burden is appropriately borne by one seeking life tenure to \n     wield the awesome judicial power of the United States.\n\n  Now that the occupant of the White House no longer is a popularly-\nelected Democrat but a Republican, these principles seem no longer to \nhave any support within the White House or the Senate Republican \nmajority. Fortunately, our constitutional principles and our Senate \ntraditions, practices and governing rules do not change with the \npolitical party that occupies the White House or with a shift in \nmajority in the Senate.\n  The White House, in conjunction with the new Republican majority in \nthe Senate, is purposeful in choosing these battles over judicial \nnominations. Dividing rather than uniting has become their modus \noperandi. The decision by the Republican Senate majority to focus on \ncontroversial nominations says much about their mistaken priorities. \nThe Republican majority sets the agenda and they schedule the debate, \njust as they have again here today.\n  I have served in the Senate for 29 years, and until recently I have \nnever seen such stridency on the part of an administration or such \nwillingness on the part of a Senate majority to cast aside tradition \nand upset the balances embedded in our Constitution, in order to expand \npresidential power. What I find unprecedented are the excesses that the \nRepublican majority and this White House are willing to indulge to \noverride the constitutional division of power over appointments and \nlongstanding Senate practices and history. It strikes me that some \nRepublicans seem to think that they are writing on a blank slate and \nthat they have been given a blank check to pack the courts.\n  They show a disturbing penchant for reading the Constitution to suit \ntheir purposes of the moment rather than as it has functioned for more \nthan 200 years to protect all Americans through its checks and \nbalances.\n  The Democratic Leader pointed the way out of this impasse again in \nhis letter to the President on February 11. It is regrettable that the \nPresident did not respond to that reasonable effort to resolve this \nmatter. Indeed, the letter he sent last week to Senator Frist was not a \nresponse to Senator Daschle's reasonable and realistic approach, but a \nfurther effort to minimize the Senate's role in this process by \nproposing radical changes in Senate rules and practices to the great \nbenefit of this Administration.\n  A distinguished senior Republican Senator saw the reasonableness of \nthe suggestions that the Democratic leader and assistant leader have \nconsistently made during this debate when he agreed on February 14 that \nthey pointed the way out of the impasse. Regrettably, his efforts and \njudgment were also rejected by the administration.\n  The Supreme Court, in an opinion authored last year by none other \nthan Justice Scalia, one of this President's judicial role models, \ninstructs that judicial ethics do not prevent candidates for judicial \noffice or judicial nominees from sharing their judicial philosophy and \nviews.\n  With respect to ``precedent,'' Republicans not only joined in the \nfilibuster of the nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court, they joined in the filibuster of Stephen \nBreyer to the First Circuit, Judge Rosemary Barkett to the Eleventh \nCircuit, Judge H. Lee Sarokin to the Third Circuit, and Judge Richard \nPaez and Judge Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit. The truth is that \nfilibusters on nominations and legislative matters and extended debate \non judicial nominations, including circuit court nominations, have \nbecome more and more common through Republicans' own actions.\n  Of course, when they are in the majority Republicans have more \nsuccessfully defeated nominees by refusing to proceed on them and have \nnot publicly explained their actions, preferring to act in secret under \nthe cloak of anonymity. From 1995 through 2001, when Republicans \npreviously controlled the Senate majority, Republican efforts to defeat \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees most often took place through \ninaction and anonymous holds for which no Republican Senator could be \nheld accountable. In effect, these were anonymous ``filibusters.''\n  Republicans held up almost 80 judicial nominees who were not acted \nupon during the Congress in which President Clinton first nominated \nthem, and they eventually defeated more than 50 judicial nominees \nwithout a recorded Senate vote of any kind, just by refusing to proceed \nwith hearings and committee votes.\n  Beyond judicial nominees, Republicans also filibustered the \nnomination of executive branch nominees. They successfully filibustered \nthe nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to become Surgeon General of the \nUnited States in spite of two cloture votes in 1995. Dr. David \nSatcher's subsequent nomination to be Surgeon General also required \ncloture but he was successfully confirmed.\n\n  Other executive branch nominees who were filibustered by Republicans \ninclude Walter Dellinger's nomination to be Assistant Attorney General, \nand two cloture petitions were required to be filed and both were \nrejected by Republicans. In this case we were able finally to obtain a \nconfirmation vote after an elaborate effort, and Mr. Dellinger was \nconfirmed to that position with 34 votes against him. He was never \nconfirmed to his position as Solicitor General because Republicans had \nmade clear their opposition to him. In addition, in 1993, Republicans \nobjected to a number of State Department nominations and even the \nnomination of Janet Napolitano to serve as the U.S. Attorney for \nArizona, resulting in cloture petitions.\n  In 1994, Republicans successfully filibustered the nomination of Sam \nBrown to be an Ambassador. After three cloture petitions were filed, \nhis nomination was returned to President Clinton without Senate action. \nAlso in 1994, two cloture petitions were required to get a vote on the \nnomination of Derek Shearer to be an Ambassador. And it likewise took \ntwo cloture petitions to get a vote on the nomination of Ricki Tigert \nto chair the FDIC. So when Republican Senators now talk about the \nSenate Executive Calendar and presidential nominees, they must be \nreminded that they recently filibustered many, many qualified nominees.\n  Nonetheless, in spite of all the intransigence of the White House and \nall of the doublespeak by some of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, I can report that the Senate has moved forward to confirm \n115 of President Bush's judicial nominations since July 2001. That \ntotal includes 15 judges confirmed so far this year, including two \ncontroversial nominees to the circuit courts.\n  Those observing these matters might contrast this progress with the \nstart of the 106th Congress in which the Republican majority in the \nSenate was delaying consideration of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees. In 1999, the first hearing on a judicial nominee was not \nuntil mid-June. The Senate did not reach 15 confirmations until \nSeptember of that year. Accordingly, the facts show that Democratic \nSenators are being extraordinarily cooperative with a Senate majority \nand a White House that refuses to cooperate with us. We have made \nprogress in spite of that lack of comity and cooperation.\n  We worked hard to reduce federal judicial vacancies to the lowest \nlevel it has been in more than seven years. That is an extremely low \nvacancy number based on recent history and well below the 67 vacancies \nthat Senator Hatch termed ``full employment'' on the federal bench \nduring the Clinton administration.\n  It is unfortunate that the White House and some Republicans have \ninsisted on this confrontation rather than working with us to provide \nthe needed information so that we could proceed to an up-or-down vote. \nSome on the Republican side seem to prefer political game playing, \nseeking to pack our courts with ideologues and leveling baseless \ncharges of bigotry, rather than to work with us to resolve the impasse \nover this nomination by providing information and proceeding to a fair \nvote.\n  I was disappointed that Senator Bennett's straightforward colloquy \nwith\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\nSenator Reid and me on February 14, which pointed to a solution, was \nnever allowed by hard-liners on the other side to yield results. I am \ndisappointed that all my efforts and those of Senator Daschle and \nSenator Reid have been rejected by the White House. The letter that \nSenator Daschle sent to the President on February 11 pointed the way to \nresolving this matter reasonably and fairly. Republicans would \napparently rather engage in politics.\n  Republican talking points will undoubtedly claim that this is \n``unprecedented''. They will ignore their own recent filibusters \nagainst President Clinton's executive and judicial nominees in so \ndoing. The only thing unprecedented about this matter is that the \nadministration and Republican leadership have shown no willingness to \nbe reasonable and accommodate Democratic Senators' request for \ninformation traditionally shared with the Senate by past \nadministrations. That this is the fourth cloture vote on this matter is \nan indictment of Republican intransigence on this matter, nothing more. \nWhat is unprecedented is that there has been no effort on the \nRepublican side to work this matter out as these matters have always \nbeen worked out in the past. What is unprecedented is the Republican \ninsistence to schedule cloture vote after cloture vote without first \nresolving the underlying problem caused by the administration's \ninflexibility.\n  I urge the White House and Senate Republicans to end the political \nwarfare and join with us in good faith to make sure the information \nthat is needed to review this nomination is provided so that the Senate \nmay conclude its consideration of this nomination. I urge the White \nHouse, as I have for more than two years, to work with us and, quoting \nfrom a recent column by Thomas Mann of The Brookings Institute, to \nsubmit ``a more balanced ticket of judicial nominees and engag[e] in \ngenuine negotiations and compromise with both parties in Congress.''\n  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has \ncontinued to send us judicial nominees that divide our nation and, in \nthis case, he has even managed to divide Hispanics across the country. \nThe nomination and confirmation process begins with the President, and \nI urge him to work with us to find a way forward to unite, instead of \ndivide, the nation on these issues.\n  Mr. President, does the Senator from Massachusetts wish the remainder \nof my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont for making \nvery plain for the record and to the American people exactly what has \nhappened over the last period of time. As he has pointed out, there \nhave been more than 100 judges who have been recommended by President \nBush, many of them pro-life, which have been favorably considered by \nthis body.\n  It was not the Members on this side who have changed the rules. The \nfact is, it has been this administration's attempt to shape the Federal \njudiciary. And as the constitutional debates showed so clearly, there \nwas to be a balance.\n  Initially, during the Constitutional Convention, the Senate of the \nUnited States was to be the sole namer of Federal judges. It was only \nat the end that that was to be a shared responsibility.\n  There are some who just want us to rubberstamp whatever the President \nrecommends. We do not believe that is what our Founding Fathers \nintended us to do, as bearing responsibility for the Federal judiciary.\n  The fact remains, this nominee is known only to the administration, \nbut not to the Judiciary Committee or the American people. They know \nhow he stands. They have understandings of all of his positions. But \nthe Judiciary Committee and the American people do not. That is what is \nbeing asked of now.\n  There have been other times in our history where we have had nominees \nwho did not respond to questions, but they had written documents, and \nthey had articles, speeches, and other decisions that reflected their \njudicial philosophy. This does not exist here. This is a unique, \nspecial situation. And the Senator from Vermont has stated time in and \ntime out over the course of the debate the reasons for it. He should be \nsupported on it. I stand with him. I stand with the institution, the \nSenate, that says to be able to exercise our responsibility in advice \nand consent, we ought to be exercising balanced judgment based on the \nviews of the nominee and his views of the Constitution of the United \nStates. We have not received his views on it. And he refused to give \nit. Nor do we understand from past writings, statements, or other \npositions what his views are. And the American people are entitled to \nit.\n  Mr. President, we must be very clear about what is at stake in this \ndebate over the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the second highest \ncourt in the land. Confirming Mr. Estrada to the DC Circuit would give \na major victory to the Republican drive to pack the Federal courts with \njudges who are hostile to civil rights, workers' rights, and many other \nbasic guarantees that define the rights and liberties of all our \ncitizens.\n  Confirming him would also deal a blow to the Senate's advice and \nconsent role in the selection of federal judges. This role is among the \nmost important of the checks and balances that make our government \nwork. It has ensured that whoever is in the White House cannot use \ntheir short term in power to pack the courts by giving lifetime \nappointments to judges who will decide cases for years in a biased way.\n  As we all know, the debates at the constitutional convention make \nclear that the Senate has a very important role in the selection of \njudges. In fact, the power initially was to rest solely with the \nSenate. Although now the power to nominate rests with the President, it \nis clear that the Senate's advice and consent role is a substantive \nrole, and a critical role. As Alexander Hamilton said in Federalist No. \n77:\n\n       If by influencing the President meant restraining him, this \n     is precisely what must have been intended.\n\n  The role of the Senate is vital to ensuring a strong and independent \njudiciary that will protect citizens' rights. When Republicans try to \nforce the Senate to confirm Mr. Estrada without any significant \ninformation about him, they are attacking the role of the Senate and \nundermining this important constitutional provision.\n  Despite a growing and disturbing trend during this administration, of \ngiving the Senate less and less information about judges, the Senate \nhas made clear our position that we need this information to fulfill \nour constitutional role. We have had many nominees who were not \nparticularly forthcoming in their committee hearing about their views \non certain topics. But we typically had a large written record to help \nus understand those nominees' approach to judging. Often, the Senate \nattempted in good faith to accommodate the President and review the \nrecord as it was given to us. In other cases, if a nominee had only \nvery little record to examine, we could rely on their answers at their \nhearing to give meaningful advice and consent.\n  Mr. Estrada represents the extreme of this trend. At his hearing, he \nwas silent on important issues that would help us determine what kind \nof judge he would be. He does not have a written record to review. The \none thing that would help us is the body of work by Mr. Estrada at the \nJustice Department. But the White House will not turn these documents \nover, despite the fact that they have turned over similar documents for \nother nominees in the past.\n  Confirming Miguel Estrada on this record would not only undermine the \nSenate's important advice and consent role, it would also threaten the \nrights of millions of Americans who are affected by the judges of the \nDC Circuit.\n  Unless we preserve this important role, the independence of the \nFederal courts will be lost. And it is this independence of the \njudicial branch from the executive and legislative branches that gives \nthe Federal courts an indispensable role in protecting and upholding \nthe basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\n  In defending the role of the Senate in confirming judicial nominees, \nwe are also protecting the role of the Federal courts in our \nconstitutional form of government. It is our responsibility to defend \nboth of these important aspects of our democracy, and we intend to \ncontinue to do so. I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture today.\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 6 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 1 minute 22 seconds.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think the Senator is correct to say that \nopponents have a right to feel the way they do, but they do not have a \nright constitutionally to filibuster a judicial nominee, in my opinion. \nAnd they can vote against this nominee if they want to. If they feel \nthat deeply about their points of view, they ought to vote against the \nnominee, but they should not use some phony fishing expedition request, \nknowing that no administration can give up these documents because they \nare the most privileged documents in the Justice Department. And the \nformer Democrat Solicitors General who are alive say that.\n  I talked to the current Solicitor General, and he said there is no \nway they can give those documents up. It would ruin the work of the \npeople's attorney, the Solicitor General. And they know that. So that \nis just a phony excuse to be able to try and stop this nominee.\n  By the way, with regard to what the distinguished Senator from \nVermont said--he brought up that certain nominees Stephen Breyer, \nRosemary Barkett, Richard Paez, and Marsha Berzon were filibustered. \nNot one of them was filibustered. He brought up they were not \nconfirmed, but they were all confirmed. There has never been a judicial \nnominee to the circuit court of appeals in this country stopped by a \nfilibuster--never--until this one. And, as far as I am concerned, this \none is not going to be stopped either, if we do what is right.\n  And, of course, a cloture vote does not always signify a filibuster. \nA lot of these cloture votes we have had in the past--that is why I \ntalk in terms of true filibusters versus time management devices used \nby the majority leader, whoever that may be. In some cases, our own \nmajority leader moved for cloture. So don't give me the argument that \nthis is not the first filibuster. This is the first filibuster, first \ntrue filibuster of a circuit court of appeals nominee in history.\n  Now, no Republican has claimed that Lavenski Smith or Julia Smith \nGibbons were filibustered, but both of these Bush circuit nominees were \nsubjected to cloture votes last year. So that is just a phony argument.\n  Now, they have so much information on this man there is little or no \nexcuse for not proceeding to a vote. The problem is, they cannot find \nanything wrong with him. There is so much that is right about Miguel \nEstrada. And I just cannot quite see some of the arguments that have \nbeen given.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to be interrupted at the end \nof 1 minute so I can give 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Let me say something about the memoranda that my Democratic \ncolleagues demand the White House release. These are appeal, \ncertiorari, and amicus recommendations that Mr. Estrada authored while \na career lawyer at the Justice Department. Let's be clear on that.\n  I keep hearing my Democratic colleagues say there is all this \nprecedent for the release of documents by the White House. Well, of \ncourse, the White House releases documents to the Senate every day. But \nthey are not appeal, certiorari, and amicus recommendations, and there \nis absolutely no precedent for the large-scale fishing expedition they \nseek on Mr. Estrada--not any.\n  I agree with the seven former living Solicitors General, four of whom \nare Democrats, who say that the White House is right not to release Mr. \nEstrada's memoranda.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 2 minutes 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding time to \nme.\n  When you strip this argument down, it boils down to an effort by the \nother side of the aisle to rewrite the advice and consent clause of the \nConstitution. For more than 200 years, the President has had discretion \nin the nomination of Federal judges. And unless there is some reason \nnot to confirm them, they then are confirmed.\n  Miguel Estrada has an extraordinary record, Phi Beta Kappa, Columbia; \nmagna cum laude, magna at Harvard, Harvard Law Review, 15 cases in the \nSupreme Court. The issue of wanting to see some of his writings is a \nred herring. The issue of wanting further amplification of his views on \nthe Constitution is another red herring. This is simply an effort, when \n41 Members from the other side of the aisle decide to oppose cloture, \nto continue this filibuster.\n  It is my view that we are not going to resolve this matter until we \nhave a real, live, honest to goodness filibuster, and that where the \nother side of the aisle has to talk. We haven't had one since 1987. The \nAmerican people do not know what is going on inside the beltway and are \nlikely not to find out until this issue is raised in the conscious \nlevel of the American people. Then I think we will find more than four \nMembers of the other side of the aisle joining 51 on this side of the \naisle to invoke cloture and to confirm this worthy nominee.\n  I do believe there is going to have to be some dramatic action taken \nso that Americans understand the travesty going on in the Senate \nChamber today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. DOLE). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as my statement indicated, the Senate did \nhave filibusters on Judge Stephen Breyer, Judge Rosemary Barkett, Judge \nH. Lee Sarokin, Judge Richard Paez, and Judge Marsha Berzon, contrary \nto the implication of my good friend from Utah.\n  I actually have sympathy for my friend from Utah. He has been put in \nan untenable position. He is seeking to uphold an unreasonable position \ntaken by the White House. The White House is trying to tell the Senate \nwhat to do. He is being a good soldier and I commend him for that.\n  The fact is, if the Senate was allowed to be the Senate and make its \nown decisions and not let the White House dictate what to do, this \nmatter would have been settled a long time ago. We would have followed \nthe tradition and logic set forth by former Supreme Court Justice \nRobert Jackson when he was Attorney General. He indicated that such \nmaterial should be provided to the Senate. He wrote:\n\n     . . . I have taken the position that committees called upon \n     to pass on the confirmation of persons recommended for \n     appointment by the Attorney General would be afforded \n     confidential access to any information that we have--because \n     no candidate's name is submitted without his knowledge and \n     the Department does not intend to submit the name of any \n     person whose entire history will not stand light.\n\n  The White House has access to Mr. Estrada's papers. It is hard to \nbelieve that they have not reviewed these papers. They are part of the \ninformation that the administration has about one of its nominees. All \nprevious administrations followed the path of working with the Senate \nand making sure that the entire history of the person would stand the \nlight of scrutiny. This administration does not want us to know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Secretary Rumsfeld will be here at 2:30. I \nspoke briefly to the manager of the bill, Senator Stevens. He indicated \nto me he would have no problem with a recess. I checked with our \nleader. He said he would have no problem with it either. During this \nbreak, the two leaders will have to determine whether there is going to \nbe a recess for Secretary Rumsfeld. I wanted to say this to alert \nMembers that there may be a break after this vote to go listen to the \nSecretary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 21, the nomination of Miguel A.

I \nparticularly thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, who has acted \nas good counsel to both the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what this amendment does because I think \nthe Senate can be proud of the outcome. What we are going to do is to \nincrease combat pay for the men and women in uniform by 50 percent from \n$150 a month to $225 a month, and we are going to increase the family \nseparation allowance by 150 percent from $100 month to $250 a month. \nOur action in this fiscal year will be retroactive to October 1. So it \ncovers the entire fiscal year. It is going to mean a helping hand \nthrough a difficult time for the men and women in uniform, and their \nfamilies.\n  As I have said, and I am sure the Senator from Alaska will agree, \nthere is no amount of money that we can give these men and women, nor \ntheir families, to compensate them for what they are giving to our \ncountry, but this effort on the Senate floor, in a bipartisan fashion, \nshows we are dedicated to work together to express our gratitude not \njust in speeches but by giving a helping hand to these families who are \nstruggling.\n  I send a modification of the amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Stevens, Inouye, Warner, Chambliss, Mikulski, Dole, \nDaschle, Landrieu, Clinton, and Pryor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I now ask that this be deemed the \noriginal amendment before the Senate, that it be the Stevens-Durbin \namendment, plus any other Senators who wish to add their name to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that the Senate cast a unanimous vote in support \nof this raise of combat pay and family allowances for our men and women \nwho are in harm's way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 436, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 436), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       In the amendment strike are after the first word and insert \n     the following:\n       (a) Increase in Imminent Danger Special Pay.--Section \n     310(a) of title 37, United States Code is amended by striking \n     ``S150'' and inserting ``S225''.\n       (b) Increase in Family Separation Allowance.--Section \n     427(a)(1) of title 37, United States code, is amended by \n     striking ``S100'' and inserting ``S250''.\n       (c) Expiration.--(1) The amendments made by subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall expire on September 30, 2003.\n       (2) Effective on September 30, 2003, sections 310(a) of \n     title 37, United States Code, and 427(a)(1) of title 37, \n     United States Code, as in effect on the day before the date \n     of the enactment of this Act are hereby revived.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall take effect on Oct. 1, 2002 and shall apply \n     with respect to months beginning on or after that date.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I would like to make sure we show this \nwas a unanimous vote. Beyond that, I have a letter I received from the \nBoeing Company which is relevant to what we have just done, because \nsome of the people who are covered by this amendment are men and women \nof the National Guard and Reserve. The Boeing Company has notified me \nit has 2,000 valued employees who serve our Nation in the military as \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve. They state:\n\n       Over the last 3 years, some 950 men and women have proudly \n     stepped forward for differing periods of military duty in \n     support of the September 11-related operation. To date,\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\n     371 Boeing teammates have been activated for Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom, with many more receiving notice of impending call-\n     up. To stress our commitment, Boeing has extended the \n     benefits we provide these citizen soldiers because we want \n     them to be able to focus on their military mission--with no \n     worry that their families are provided for in the interim. \n     For a period of up to 60 calendar months, we will make up the \n     difference between their military and Boeing pay, plus \n     maintain their medical, dental and life insurance benefits. \n     We have also extended reemployment rights to these talented \n     teammates for up to five years of military service. Boeing's \n     long-standing policy provides these benefits for 90 days.\n\n  I am not doing this to blow up Boeing, although I think it is a \ntremendous gesture. I ask unanimous consent that the letter, in full, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Boeing Company,\n\n                                                    Arlington, VA.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: The Boeing Company is honored to have \n     more than 2,000 valued employees who also serve our Nation in \n     the military as members of the National Guard and Reserve. \n     Over the last three years, some 950 Boeing men and women have \n     proudly stepped forward for differing periods of military \n     duty in support of September 11th-related operations. And to \n     date, 371 Boeing teammates have been activated for Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom--with many more receiving notice of impending \n     call-up.\n       To stress our commitment, Boeing has extended the benefits \n     we provide these citizen soldiers because we want them to be \n     able to focus on their military mission--with no worry that \n     their families are provided for in the interim. For a period \n     of up to 60 calendar months, we will make up the difference \n     between their military and Boeing pay, plus maintain their \n     medical, dental and life insurance benefits. We have also \n     extended reemployment rights to these talented teammates for \n     up to five years of military service. Boeing's long-standing \n     policy provides these benefits for 90 days, with reviews for \n     adjustments depending upon circumstances.\n       The Boeing Guard and Reserve Network was created to help \n     focus support to these men and women. With membership from \n     employees and senior staff, this network was instrumental in \n     President Bush naming Boeing a winner of the prestigious \n     Employer Support Freedom Award in 2001 for continued support \n     to National Guard and Reserve employees.\n       Boeing is proud of this leadership role and firmly \n     committed to all our talented men and women called to serve \n     the Nation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Rudy F. de Leon,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                        Washington, DC Operations.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. This shows much of the problem that the Senator from \nIllinois has been trying to handle, the problem of people who have been \ncalled up who are not regulars. Theirs is a problem that is more acute \nthan those who are in the military and are called up and they have \ntheir full military pay continue. The civilian pay of those who have \nbeen called up is many times quite a bit in excess of what they get in \nthe military.\n  We have very complicated problems in a period of the callup cycle we \nare in right now because our country has called up people for the war \non terrorism, called up people for the war in Afghanistan, and are now \ncalling up people for the war in Iraq. Sometimes there have been \nmultiple callups in the same calendar year. It is a very difficult \nproblem to deal with, and I urge the Armed Services Committee to work \non it and give us a comprehensive package so we do not have to deal \nwith it in regard to appropriations bills.\n  That is my point I make now. I prefer that not be the case.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4677-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Under the previous order, the amendment is set \naside.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 445\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, port security is much like the \nweather: Everybody talks about it, but we haven't done anything about \nit. The fact is, we are in a crisis, in an emergency. If anything would \nrespond to an emergency supplemental, port security would.\n  I just had a word with the distinguished chairman. The chairman \nbelieves there are pots of money. I wanted to make sure I wasn't \nduplicating everything. I have in my hand the particular reported \nemergency supplemental. On page 20, what we find is the Department of \nHomeland Security; you have the various items, as you can see, listed \nbeginning at that second paragraph, where they get $1.135 billion. I \nsaid: Well, we have $1.135 billion we can get for port security.\n  Then I looked at the breakdown. The $580 million for the Coast Guard \nhas been spent. The Coast Guard has been waiting on this money. They \nare deployed in the Gulf. The distinguished Commander in Chief only 2 \ndays ago, in Philadelphia, emphasized what a magnificent job the Coast \nGuard was doing in the gulf, around the clock, doubling up their \neffort. So this is for reimbursement of that $580 million.\n  We have the rest of the year to deal with, and we have an \nauthorization bill trying to deal with it. But that is not the \nappropriation. I do not think we can wait for an authorization \nappropriation and then go through the rest of the spring and summer \nwith the Coast Guard unfunded. So that $580 million is not for the \nCoast Guard for the rest of the year but that is to reimburse it.\n  Otherwise, the $215 million you see under the $1.135 billion is for \nterrorism; the $120 million goes to the Transportation Security \nAdministration. That is for aviation, that is the overtime for \nscreeners and everything else of that kind; $65 million of that is for \novertime of the Customs and Border Patrol; $10 million is for the \nSecret Service; $10 million for the vulnerability assessment; and $15 \nmillion for emergency support teams. That is just a little over a \nbillion some-odd million, which takes up the amount on page 20 of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  There are not any pots of money that we can take from. That has been \na concern of the Senator from South Carolina. In the past, we spoke \nwith one voice. This is not a partisan amendment whatsoever; 100 \nSenators, all Republicans and all Democrats, voted for port security. \nThis is only $1 billion of the $2.8 billion that we authorized. We have \nonly had, of that authorized and appropriated, some $93 million that \nhas been released. They are now trying to complete this and compete for \n$105 million, but then they will run out of money.\n  Right to the point, we have to join forces together and take care of \none of the finest entities you have ever seen.\n  Let me divert for a second and talk about the ports of America. There \nare some 365 ports; 55 of those are major ports. We didn't want to rush \nin last year and just start throwing money at the problem. They have to \nget a concerted plan for each of the ports, particularly those that \nhave been designated major ports and are subject to serious terrorist \naction.\n  We have put the money up. They have completed five ports. They will \nonly complete some six or seven additional, so it will be about nine by \nthe end of the fiscal year under the present circumstance.\n  That is totally unacceptable. We can't be running around waiting to \nget through by 2009, planning for port security with al-Qaida, with the \nterrorists, with the most vulnerable target you could possibly imagine.\n  Let's go to Philadelphia. Osama bin Laden has 10 vessels, according \nto Lloyd's of London, and he controls 10 more. He easily knows \nterrorists who can crew those vessels. It was his ship that went into \nMombasa, the port in Kenya, and blew up the embassy at Nairobi and the \none at Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. So he knows about ship operations. He \nis intimate with it. He could easily put his crew in. He could get a \nshift on a particular ship of Exxon, let's say, going up the Delaware \nRiver to the port in Philadelphia, and just before they get there, they \ncan take the crew and captain, throw them overboard, kill them, or \nwhatever, just as they did in New York and at the Pentagon. Then they \ncan blow that ship up at that tank farm in Philadelphia.\n  We have studied this. The eastern seaboard would close down. I have \nseen port security war games--there has been a lot of work done on \nthis. This is not just an amendment of the moment. On the contrary, we \nfind out from Booz Allen Hamilton in their particular study--it is too \nvoluminous to have printed in the Record at this point--that the \neastern seaboard could close down. And what would happen if they would \nhave to close down the stock market and everything else? There would be \ntotal chaos just from one particular incident of that kind.\n  So we know the jeopardy that we experience here. We have to take care \nof these ports. We also have to take care of the waterway systems such \nas the Golden Gate Bridge and those other things.\n  We tried to get $2 billion for 2 years and in the supplemental and \nbudget we just passed, we passed unanimously, $1 billion. This is just \nwhat we voted on a week before last, $1 billion.\n  I know my distinguished chairman is going to say we don't have any \nmoney. We have money, come on. Here we are already $232 billion in the \nred that we borrowed, and that stopped the first week in March. So for \nthe month we have just been saying it is $232 billion public debt to \nthe penny that the Secretary of Treasury puts out. That will go up, up, \nand away. We will get a kicker here in 14 days with the April 15 tax \nreturns, but then just as we had in 2001, we were in the black on June \n1, we passed a tax cut on June 8, and on June 28 we were $50 billion in \nthe red. And by September 10, 2001, it was $99 billion in the red.\n\n  Everyone says: Well, 9/11 caused the deficit. No. It is the fact that \nwe have been having voodoo tax cuts that caused the deficit to balloon. \nThe distinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate knows what voodoo is \nbecause that is what Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush called \nPresident Reagan's tax cuts that were supposed to grow and grow the \neconomy.\n  You only have to turn to this morning's paper and look at the cartoon \nto see that with so-called growth, the only thing growing are these \ndeficits. And they are going up, up, and away.\n  So let's not start getting frugal and careful. Let's do get \nresponsible and vote for the money that gives our ports\n\n[[Page S4679]]\n\na start at security. You have the Coast Guard. You have the Drug \nEnforcement Administration. You have the Customs. You have the various \nother entities of the State port administrations. You have the FBI.\n  We are trying to coordinate them all under the particular plan. It \nhas to be approved by the Transportation Security Administration before \nany money is disbursed. This is not just sending back grants and that \nkind of thing--unless and until we can get this money here to help out \nthese local folks.\n  When I talk about security at the port, let me talk about the actual \npractice before 9/11. Operators of ports were not concerned with \nsecurity. It was about No. 10 or 20 on their list of concerns. As a \nresult, the FBI has found that between $12 and $24 billion in theft is \ngoing through the ports of America every year. They just added that \ninto the cost of doing business.\n  The name of the game in port operation is swiftness, speed, \nexpedition; get the cargo in, get it out, don't let it stay on the \ndock. It costs those ships at the dock $15,000 to $20,000 a day. So \nthey try to compete with each other on speed, and it is a healthy \ncompetition.\n  But now they have to change their attitude--and I don't have any \nlobbyists looking out for port security. I wish they would hire the \nairline lobbyists. We gave out $1 billion--just gave the money--$1 \nbillion for airlines. We gave them another $1 billion just for the cost \nof security. But $1 billion was just because they did not know how to \nrun the airlines.\n  And now we are going to talk about $1 billion for all the ports of \nAmerica. I hope I can get the help of the distinguished Senator from \nTexas. She has a very dangerous situation in Houston. You can come 50 \nmiles up that river, and those gas plants on either side--propane \nplants and otherwise--you could blow it. And according to these studies \nby Booz Allen, it blows down the economy for a year. We are playing \naround with the airlines not having enough business so we give them $1 \nbillion. And we give them another $1 billion for the security.\n  This particular amendment--which should be bipartisan because this is \nwhat we all voted for last year--is just exactly what is needed.\n  Go to the expenditure of that $1 billion, and it calls for $93 \nmillion to remain available until December 31 for the Coast Guard. That \nis $50 million for port vulnerability. That is the boarding equipment \nand everything else of that kind with respect to those assessments.\n  There is $7 million for the purchase of radiation detection \nequipment. And there is some $36 million for the maritime safety and \nsecurity teams.\n  We know every plane that approaches the United States of America. We \nhave alerts, and they respond. But we do not know with respect to the \nships themselves.\n  So we need not only a transponder arrangement, but we have to have at \nleast, at the 12 major ports, the equipment to receive the message. We \ndon't have that. Even if they all had transponders like the aircraft in \nAmerica, we don't have the equipment within the Coast Guard to identify \nthem.\n  So this $57 million is for radar coverage of two-thirds of the United \nStates with positioning systems to pick up that broadcast. A third, of \ncourse, goes into the internal river system, such as the Mississippi \nRiver and everything else for which the Coast Guard is responsible. \nThat is exactly what is needed in the Coast Guard.\n  I felt bad two days ago when I was watching the President on TV, and \nthe nearest thing we have to port security at the Port of Philadelphia \nwas his Coast Guard jacket. He had all the Coasties standing behind \nhim, but they didn't have any money in their pockets. They were dead \nbroke, I can tell you that right now. If you don't believe it, just \nread the headline in this morning's Washington Post: ``Traditional \nCoast Guard Duties Suffer, Study Says.''\n\n       [Admiral] Collins said President Bush's $6.8 billion budget \n     request for the Coast Guard represents a $1.6 billion \n     increase over the agency's initial fiscal 2002 budget. He \n     said that by fiscal 2004, the Coast Guard will have increased \n     its workforce by 4,100 people since Sept. 11, 2001. . . .\n\n  But he said:\n\n       I assure you that nothing is more important to the United \n     States Coast Guard than to be ready to perform all of these \n     missions with distinction and with excellence.\n\n  I quote from the this particular article:\n\n       After questioning from lawmakers, [Admiral] Collins \n     conceded the 42,000-person Coast Guard has more challenges \n     than resources to meet them. He said some equipment and \n     personnel will have to be diverted from more traditional \n     roles to homeland security efforts, although partnerships \n     with the Navy and foreign governments could help take up the \n     slack.\n\n  And they are working on those.\n  We have had hearings with Admiral Loy, and now with Admiral Collins, \nand with Commissioner Bonner of the Customs Service. We have gone \noverseas to try to streamline this issue so that we can actually \ninspect the cargo and facilitate it when it comes to port here in the \nUnited States. And he has worked that out with some 17 ports; that is, \nCommissioner Bonner. You have to give him credit. We have all been \nworking. We have not just sat around pouting and sucking our thumbs \nwaiting for the money. But here it says:\n\n       Do we have more business than we have resources?\n\n  The answer is:\n\n       Yes, Collins said. We are challenged like never before to \n     do all that America wants us to do.\n       The GAO cataloged a 60 percent decline in Coast Guard hours \n     spent on drug interdiction. . . . [They got] a 38 percent \n     decline in fisheries enforcement. . . .\n\n  And I could go on. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nthe entire article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington (DC) Post, Apr. 2, 2003]\n\n           Traditional Coast Guard Duties Suffer, Study Says\n\n                          (By Christopher Lee)\n\n       Coast Guard efforts to capture drug traffickers and patrol \n     commercial fisheries have suffered as it has turned its focus \n     to homeland security since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks, according to a study released yesterday.\n       The declines uncovered by the General Accounting Office, \n     the congressional watchdog agency, stoked concerns among some \n     lawmakers that the Coast Guard might neglect its old missions \n     as it trains its energy on securing the nation's ports, \n     waterways and coastal areas.\n       At a hearing yesterday on the Coast Guard's transition to \n     the Department of Homeland Security, which it joined March 1, \n     Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.), chairman of a House \n     subcommittee on Coast Guard and maritime transportation, \n     called the GAO report ``thorough and eye-opening.''\n       ``The Coast Guard's traditional missions such as search and \n     rescue, drug and migrant interdiction, pollution prevention, \n     boater safety and fisheries law enforcement must be \n     preserved.'' LoBiondo said.\n       Adm. Thomas H. Collins, head of the Coast Guard, tried to \n     assure lawmakers that his agency could meet all of its old \n     obligations while ramping up its counterterrorism efforts, \n     such as conducting vulnerability assessments at all of the \n     nation's ports and, more recently, supporting military \n     operations in the Middle East.\n       ``I assure you that nothing is more important to the United \n     States Coast Guard than to be ready to perform all of these \n     missions with distinction and with excellence,'' he testified \n     yesterday.\n       Collins said President Bush's $6.8 billion budget request \n     for the Coast Guard represents a $1.6 billion increase over \n     the agency's initial fiscal 2002 budget. He said that by \n     fiscal 2004, the Coast Guard will have increased its \n     workforce by 4,100 people since Sept. 11, 2001, and mobilized \n     thousands of reservists. He said Bush has asked for an \n     additional $580 million for the agency in his 2003 \n     supplemental funding request.\n       After questioning from lawmakers, Collins conceded the \n     42,000-person Coast Guard has more challenges than resources \n     to meet them. He said some equipment and personnel will have \n     to be diverted from more traditional roles to homeland \n     security efforts, although partnerships with the Navy and \n     foreign governments could help take up the slack.\n       He also conceded that the Coast Guard is behind schedule in \n     completing its vulnerability assessments of 55 ports.\n       ``Do we have more business than we have resources? Yes, \n     ``Collins said. ``We are challenged like never before to do \n     all that America wants us to do.''\n       The GAO catalogued a 60 percent decline in Coast Guard \n     hours spent on drug interdiction in the past three months of \n     2002, compared with the same period in 1998. It also found a \n     38 percent decline in fisheries enforcement--protecting \n     fishing grounds from foreign encroachment and enforcing \n     domestic fishing laws.\n       At the same time, the Coast Guard dramatically shifted \n     resources to protect the nation's ports and waterways, \n     including redeployments of search-and-rescue boats for harbor \n     patrols. The Coast Guard devoted 91,000 ``resource hours''--a \n     measurement of\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\n     equipment used on missions--to coastal security in the first \n     quarter of fiscal 2002. That was up from 2,400 hours during a \n     similar period in fiscal 1999. The number fell to 37,000 \n     hours during the beginning of fiscal year 2003.\n       Other areas, such as search-and-rescue efforts and \n     maintaining navigation aids, remained at more or less the \n     same levels as before Sept. 11, 2001, the GAO said.\n       JayEtta Z. Hecker, the GAO analyst who presented the \n     report, told lawmakers the Coast Guard ``cannot be all things \n     to all people.''\n       ``Even if you give them more money,'' she said, ``the \n     challenge of absorbing more money is such that you cannot \n     naturally solve this.''\n       Collins agreed with the GAO figures, but said they account \n     for only resource allocation, not results. He noted, for \n     instance that the Coast Guard seized 72.2 tons of cocaine in \n     fiscal 2002, its third-highest yearly total.\n       ``We're getting outcomes and high productivity,'' he said. \n     ``That's efficiency.''\n       Committee members told Collins they recognized that \n     Congress has heaped new responsibilities on the Coast Guard.\n       ``We're yelling about security and we're saying, `Keep your \n     traditional roles' at the same time,'' said Rep. Bob Filner \n     (D-Calif.). ``We've put you in a very difficult position.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. So, Madam President, we are not just for ports, and are \ngoing to come and get a lot of money, and ride in on an emergency \nsupplemental. We begin with this fact: this is an emergency. We have \nthese folks working around the clock.\n  And let me continue, before I yield, to make sure that we have \noutlined exactly what we need the amount for.\n  Now, there is an additional amount for customs and border protection \nof $160 million. That is broken down with $110 million for the \ndeployment and installation of port screening equipment. We have $110 \nmillion for the radiation detection equipment at U.S. ports. Already, \nthe railroads at the tunnels have that particular radiation equipment. \nSo when it goes into the tunnel, they know, bam, that train has to \nstop, there is radiation there. We do not have that equipment at ports.\n  And we get the poor Coast Guard captains at the port, or these young \nlieutenants in their twenties, with all of this responsibility. If \nsomething went awry in one of the ports of America this afternoon, the \ncaptain of the port, some 20-year-old lieutenant, would be in charge \nand be the responsible one. And he has not been given the resources.\n  Congress has outlined his responsibility in law, but by way of \nappropriation, they have not given him the help. And he is trying to \nget the Customs and the DEA, the Ports Authority, the Immigration \nService, the sheriff's department, the FBI--he is trying to get them \nall together.\n  We have done that, for example. I can show where it has been done in \nour own backyard. I won't include the entire report in the Record, but \nyou can see the particular work involved and the deliberateness now. It \nis not just to put money in. It is detailed. That is $50 million of the \n$160 million for the evaluation, implementation, and coordination by \nthe Transportation Security Administration to secure the systems of \ntransportation such as the container security initiative. That \ncontainer security initiative is exactly what I was talking about. The \nCommissioner of Customs is already overseas and making arrangements \nwith 17 different ports so far. But then you have for the cargo and \nemployees, the standards, the good conduct, the inspection equipment, \nthe computers and everything else. That fleshes out that particular \n$160 million. What I just referred to was under the Customs and border \nprotection.\n  Now to the Transportation Security Administration. For an additional \namount of salaries and expenses, it is $680 million, but that is one \nhalf of what we authorized. The $600 million will be available for port \nsecurity grants. It is just like during the Walter Mondale campaign, \nwhen he asked, Where is the beef? Well, where is the beef in your port \nsecurity measure, Senator? I say this is the beef. This is the one \nthing the ports are really interested in so they can finance the \ndifferent endeavors going on.\n  The weekend before last we raised the alert to orange. At that \nparticular time, we had everybody fighting over the same personnel. \nSecretary Rumsfeld wanted them in Iraq, and my National Guard and my \nReserves are gone. My Reserves are in the C-17 field in my own \nbackyard. They have been going since September 12, 2001, around the \nclock, 8-hour shifts. There are three teams. I have been there to the \nhangar and visited with them. They have been doing a magnificent job. \nBut they are concerned because some of them are mechanics, security \nofficers, that kind of thing. So the Governor of South Carolina, on \nthis orange alert the week before last, had to get patrol officers to \nplace around the port of Charleston. I saw it myself. That is the kind \nof strain and stress from the emergency we are in.\n  But $30 million is for the worker identification card. That was a \ntough one for us. We worked with the unions on the background checks, \nand they are ready to move quickly. Now the unions said, you put that \nin law. You know how it is when they recommend somebody for a judge, \nthen sit another 3 months before the FBI gets around to them. That is \nthe situation here with all of these security personnel. Anybody who \nenters that secure area has to have a criminal background check. That \nis the money that is needed there. It is not in the emergency bill.\n  Otherwise, there is $50 million for the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection to flesh out their Operation Safe Commerce which is the \nCoast Guard assessment in the Register. The Coast Guard submitted into \nthe Federal Register exactly what it would cost to get these \nassessments and things going. I ask unanimous consent to print that in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Based on this analysis, the first year cost would be \n     approximately $1.4 billion, with costs of approximately \n     Present Value (PV) $6.0 billion over the next 10 years (2003-\n     2012, 7 percent discount rate). The preliminary cost analysis \n     in Appendix C presents the costs in three sections: vessel \n     security, facility security, and port security. The following \n     is a summary of the preliminary cost analysis.\n       Vessel Security. The first-year cost of purchasing \n     equipment, hiring security officers, and preparing paperwork \n     is approximately $188 million. Following initial \n     implementation, the annual cost is approximately $144 \n     million. Over the next 10 years, the cost would be PV $1.1 \n     billion approximately. The paperwork burden associated with \n     planning would be approximately 140,000 hours in the first \n     year and 7,000 hours in subsequent years.\n       Facility Security. The first-year cost of purchasing \n     equipment, hiring security officers, and preparing paperwork \n     is an estimated $963 million. Following initial \n     implementation, the annual cost is approximately $535 \n     million. Over the next 10 years, the cost would be PV $4.4 \n     billion approximately. The paperwork burden associated with \n     planning would be approximately 465,000 hours in the first \n     year and 17,000 hours in subsequent years.\n       Port Security. The first-year cost of establishing Port \n     Security Committees and creating Port Security Plans for all \n     port areas is an estimated $120 million. The second-year cost \n     is approximately $106 million. In subsequent years, the \n     annual cost is approximately $46 million. Over the next 10 \n     years, the cost would be PV $477 million approximately. The \n     paperwork burden associated with planning would be \n     approximately 1,090,000 hours in 2003, 1,278,000 hours in \n     2004, and 827,000 hours in subsequent years.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You can see this is not going to solve the problem, but \nit shows an awareness of the Congress of what they have mandated in \nlaw. We have required these local communities to do lots of things, and \nthey haven't done anything about it. And we need this money. It is an \nemergency.\n  The Senate and the House last year said it would cost $2.8 billion. \nThe Senate just the week before last in the budget resolution said $1 \nbillion at least for this year. And we are trying our best to do that \nwith this particular amendment, just put the money to where the mouth \nis.\n  I yield to our distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to send his amendment to \nthe desk.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thought the amendment was called up by Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 445.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n                    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n                       United States Coast Guard\n\n\n                           operating expenses\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Operating Expenses'', \n     $93,000,000, to remain available until December 31, 2003, of \n     which not less than $50,000,000 shall be for port \n     vulnerability assessments and the port vulnerability \n     assessment program, and not less than $7,000,000 shall be for \n     the purchase of radiation detection equipment, and not less \n     then $36,000,000 shall be for the establishment of Maritime \n     Safety and Security Teams.\n\n\n               acquisition, construction and Improvements\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Acquisition, Construction \n     and Improvements'', $57,000,000, to remain available until \n     December 31, 2003, to implement the Automated Identification \n     System and other tracking systems designed to actively track \n     and monitor vessels operating in United States waters.\n\n                   Border and Transportation Security\n\n\n                     customs and border protection\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Customs and Border \n     Protection'', $160,000,000, to remain available until \n     December 31, 2003, of which not less than $110,000,000 shall \n     be for the deployment and installation of portal screening \n     equipment at our Nation's seaports, and of which not less \n     than $50,000,000 shall be for the evaluation and \n     implementation, in coordination with the Transportation \n     Security Administration, to secure systems of transportation \n     such as the Container Security Initiative and the Customs-\n     Trade Partnership Against Terrorism.\n\n                 Transportation Security Administration\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $680,000,000, to remain available until December 31, 2003, of \n     which not less than $600,000,000 shall be available for port \n     security grants for the purpose of implementing the \n     provisions of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, not \n     less than $30,000,000 shall be for continued development and \n     implementation of the Transportation Worker Identification \n     Card as well as for background checks of transportation \n     workers who work in secure areas or who work with sensitive \n     cargo or information, and not less than $50,000,000 shall be \n     for the evaluation and implementation, in coordination with \n     the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, of secure system \n     of transportation such as Operations Safe Commerce.\n\n                Federal Law Enforcement Training Center\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $10,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2004, \n     for the development of seaport security training programs, \n     and for equipment and personnel to provide training to \n     Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies and, \n     notwithstanding any provision of law, private security \n     personnel performing seaport security functions.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate addresses \nwhat many experts view as the largest vulnerability in the Nation's \ndefenses here at home. This amendment would direct critical funds to \nthe Nation's seaports.\n  During the Senate Appropriations Committee's homeland security \nhearings last year, one witness, Stephen Flynn, noted that the Nation's \nseaports ``are the only part of an international boundary that the \nFederal Government invests no money in terms of security. . . . Most \nports, the best you get is a chain link fence with maybe some barbed \nwire.''\n  Is that comforting?\n  Consider that U.S. ports receive 16,000 cargo containers per day and \n6 million containers per year that U.S. ports are home to oil \nrefineries and chemical plants that process noxious, volatile \nchemicals; that there are 68 nuclear power plants located along U.S. \nwaterways; that the average shipping container measures 8 feet by 40 \nfeet and can hold 60,000 pounds; and that a ship or tanker transporting \ncargo can hold more explosives and dangerous materials than could ever \nbe smuggled in an airplane or a truck crossing a land border.\n  Yet, despite the clear danger, the best port protection the American \npeople have is a chain link fence? It is unfathomable why we have not \ninsisted that this amendment be signed into law months ago.\n  Last November, the President signed the Maritime Transportation \nSafety Act. This amendment provides $1 billion to begin addressing \nthese Federal requirements.\n  Specifically, this amendment provides $600 million in port security \ngrants to begin to assist our seaports in hardening their physical \nsecurity to comply with the Federal law. Additionally, the authorizing \nlegislation requires that all vessels operating in U.S. waters carry \nequipment which will allow the Coast Guard to actively track and \nmonitor their movements. This amendment provides $57 million so the \nCoast Guard can establish a system to track these vessels.\n  The amendment also addresses other critical port security needs such \nas providing additional cargo screening equipment for our seaports and \nfunds to expedite the port security assessment program. Funds are also \nincluded to establish three additional Coast Guard Maritime Safety and \nSecurity Teams for domestic port security needs.\n  Funding is providing to improve secure systems of cargo transport \nfrom the port of departure overseas to the port of arrival in the \nUnited States.\n  The Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, each in \nCalifornia, account for 35 percent of the international trade moving \ninto and out of the United States. Port officials estimate that they \nneed $10 million to build a container inspection facility where \nsuspicious packages and freight can be opened and inspected. Similar \nrealities face ports up and down the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards. \nLast December, the U.S. Coast Guard issued a report stating that the \nfirst year cost to implement port security authorizing legislation that \nthe President signed in November would total $1.3 billion and that \ntotal costs for the next decade would be $6 billion. But despite the \nclear danger, and despite the overwhelming vote of approval by Congress \nto authorize security improvements at our seaports, the dollars have \nnot been forthcoming.\n  International authorities have linked 20 merchant vessels to Osama \nbin Laden. Some of the vessels are thought to be owned outright by bin \nLaden business interests, while others are on long-term charter. The \nTimes of London reported in October 2001 that bin Laden used his ships \nto import into Kenya the explosives used to destroy the U.S. embassies \nin Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.\n  This amendment would make sure that more than a chain link fence is \nprotecting the nation's ports. Children learn to hop a fence at an \nearly age. How hard would it be for a terrorist?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the port \nsecurity amendment offered by Senator Hollings.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, ports are \nstruggling with an entirely new set of challenges to protect ports, \ncitizens and the economy from the possible threat of terrorism. This is \na huge task.\n  I was fortunate to be named as a conferee on the port security bill \nlast year. The bill that became law was a good bill.\n  It will greatly improve security at our Nation's port in light of the \nchallenge following September 11. But only if we provide the money. And \nso far, we have failed to do so.\n  I feared this would happen. Many potential funding options were \nsuggested during the conference. But, all of them were rejected by the \nother body. So, we had no funding source. We had to rely on \nappropriations. And, we are not providing enough funding for our local \nports.\n  Let me explain why this law is so crucial and why we must fund it \nwith this amendment.\n  The law creates national and regional maritime transportation/port \nsecurity plans to be approved by the Coast Guard, including better \ncoordination of Federal, State, local, and private enforcement \nagencies.\n  The law mandates the development of regulations to determine secure \nareas in ports and to limit access to these areas through background \nchecks that will result in a transportation security identification \ncard.\n  The bill also establishes a grant program for local ports, waterfront \nfacilities operators, and State and local agencies to provide security \ninfrastructure improvements.\n  But again, there's no money.\n  Port Security must be a priority.\n  The Hart-Rudman report was released last October. Their report, \n``America Still Unprepared--America Still in Danger,'' discusses the \nshortcomings in port security. This report\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\nrecommends making ``trade security a global priority.''\n  According to the report, 43 percent of all maritime containers that \narrived in the United States in 2001 came through the ports of Los \nAngeles and Long Beach.\n  The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach requested $70 million in \npost-September 11 security grants. To date, they have received only \n$6.175 million.\n  That's just one port. The American Association of Port Authorities \nestimates the costs of adequate physical security at the Nation's \ncommercial seaports to be $2 billion. Only $92.3 million in Federal \ngrants have been authorized and approved.\n  We know that last year with the closing of the West Coast ports \nbecause of a lockout, the cost to the economy was $1 billion per day \nfor the first five days. Then, the costs increased exponentially. This \nshows how vital it is for our economy to keep the ports operating.\n  If there was an incident at any port in the country, all the ports \nwould be closed. This would cost billions and billions per day.\n  The Hart-Rudman report also says we need to be proactive. We have \nidentified the threat, but we haven't done enough to protect our ports.\n  This amendment provides $1 billion for port security, including $600 \nmillion in grants for local ports.\n  We cannot leave our homeland unprotected against terrorism. This is \nwhy I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to add more \nfunding for port security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am grateful to my friend from South \nCarolina for the way he has put this amendment. Unfortunately, it is \npart of a large stream of amendments. If this were the only amendment \noffered for Coast Guard expenses and to homeland security in addition \nto this bill, as manager of the bill, I would have no difficulty in \ndealing with it. But we expect a whole series of amendments during this \nperiod.\n  I want to point out this bill came to us as a defense supplemental \nfor the purpose of meeting the needs of the conduct of three separate \nwar operations. We have a war on terrorism, a war in Afghanistan, and a \nwar going on in Iraq. Of the total that we have coming out on the \ncommittee bill, we have $78.7 plus billion. It is really \n$78,736,600,000. Even Everett Dirksen thought that was a lot of money. \nBut when you look at this, what was asked for, for the total for \nhomeland defense, $4,676,000,000, that is on top of what has already \nbeen appropriated for the Department of Homeland Security in the \nomnibus bill we just passed and what will be appropriated in the fiscal \nyear 2004 that is coming.\n  I know many people, including myself, believe there should be more \nmoney allocated to homeland security. But what should we do? If I were \nto say I would accept the Senator's amendment, but behind it there is a \ntotal of $6.5 billion that I have been told so far dealing with \nhomeland security amendments, another $6.5 billion will lead this bill \nto being assaulted in the House and severely questioned by the \nPresident. We don't have the emergency procedure available. We don't \nhave a budget. So this can't be dubbed an emergency under the Budget \nAct and just sent downtown and ignored by the President, which is \nsomething we have done in the past. This either has to be in the bill \nor it is not going to be in the bill.\n  I want the Senator to know, as I have said, we believe there is money \nhere. Requests are going to come at us for purchasing of community-\noriented policing policies, interoperable equipment problems, the \nproblem of firefighters and emergency medical service teams in terms of \ntheir equipment that is currently not interoperable. We have money I \ncertainly think is needed in terms of the screening equipment and new \ntechnology screening at ports. That is another $110 million.\n  Once you start down this line, you have to ask yourself, why aren't \nthese being raised in the 2004 bill. None of them are going to be spent \nthis year. This isn't money for the immediate emergency. This is money \nthat should be addressed in the 2004 bills. They are still pending out \nthere. We will have this same debate on the 2004 bills. These same \namendments will be offered then.\n  Why don't we wait until then? That is my advice to the Senate. Let's \nwait. We know these are pending requests. We know many of them are very \nimportant, and some of them I shall join in urging we try to get money. \nBut right now we are trying to get money for the President so he can \nhandle these wars. This is not port security. It is not \ninteroperability of equipment. It is not money for Guard and Reserve \nequipment. It is not money that is going to be spent next year.\n  (Mr. CORNYN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is money for this year--not only this year, but \nwithin the next 8 weeks it has to be to the armed services. I say to my \nfriend, very respectfully, when the time comes, I am going to have to \nmove to table this amendment, although I hate to do it because I agree \nwith it in many ways. But it is not the only thing coming at us. Every \none of these, like another straw on the camel's back, will take more \ntime to deal with in conference with the House and with the President, \nand meanwhile we don't get the money out there for the troops.\n  I hope the Senate will stay with us. Let's restrict this bill to the \nemergencies related to the war effort, and the homeland security money \nin here is related to the war effort. It is nuclear security, it is a \ntransfer of treasury for homeland security. One of the items is a \nsmallpox amendment which is already in the bill. Those moneys can and \nwill be spent before September 30 of this year. They must be. We don't \nhave an extension on them. They are all money to be spent this year.\n  This money the Senator seeks is money that could be spent over the \nnext 2, 3 years. Who knows how long it will be before we identify the \ntracking systems that can track and monitor vessels in U.S. waters that \nare better equipment than we have now. We have some, but it is not \ngood. We know that. It is not up to date. In particular, I seek to join \nin trying to check the backgrounds of transportation workers. I would \nvery much like to be involved in finding ways to finance the screening \nequipment that deals with containers coming into our ports. But this \nisn't the place to do it.\n  I told the Senate before this morning--I have asked the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs and the individual service chiefs when this money is \nneeded. They started in early May and continued through June, so this \nmoney has to be there. It cannot be there if we get items to continue \nthis bill and carry us into a period beyond the recess we intend to \ntake for Easter. I say respectfully to my friend, it is just not \nsomething we can handle.\n  The administration takes the position that the 2003 bill and 2003 \nsupplemental and the 2004--those are all fiscal years--appropriations \nbills have started the process of providing money for port security, \ncustoms, transportation, law enforcement, domestic preparedness, and \nother items.\n  The bill we have in place--the 2003 Appropriations Act--contains the \nlargest increase for Coast Guard in the history of the United States, \nover $1 billion more than 2002. The Senator from South Carolina and I \nwere partially responsible in that. We joined together in that fight on \nthe omnibus bill. At 2004, the discretionary funding of the Coast Guard \nwill be increased by another billion and a half, another 36 percent \nover 2002. That will add to the Coast Guard in excess of $2.5 billion \nfor the period of 2004.\n  Now, we are moving toward these things, but we cannot do them all in \nthis bill, which is designed to be a supplemental for 2003.\n  By the way, I am very concerned about the container security \ninitiative. The Senator from New York and I have worked on that. We are \ncontinuing to try to push and push and push to identify the type of \ntechnology that could give us the ability to increase the surveillance \non containers as they are placed on ships destined for the U.S. We want \nto reach out and put them on the foreign ports. We don't have to wait \nuntil they are in our ports before we discover things dangerous to us.\n  I commend the Senator from New York and the Senator from South \nCarolina for working on this, but we don't need more money now. We need \nsome results, as far as the basic investments in technology. The \nPresident's\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\nbudget has $375 million in the 2004 budget for just that--initiatives \nand technology investments, radiation detection, x-ray machines for \ncargo containers. That is not even available yet. We don't have the \nstate-of-the-art equipment to do what some of these amendments insist \nwe must do--and things I want to do in the long run.\n  This Senator still represents more than half of the coastline in the \nUnited States. Everything we eat and consume and put on our backs comes \nto us from outside of our State. We are the one State totally dependent \nupon transportation, particularly marine transportation. I will work \nnight and day with my friend to see we can get there when we develop \nthe technology that we can approve. But we cannot put the money out in \nfront of the technology. I think we have to have more money for \nassessments, portal monitors, maritime safety, and response teams--I \nsupport those--automated identification system, long-term security \nprograms, transportation worker IDs. But these are not wartime-related \ncosts.\n  We are in three wars at one time. Please, let me ask the Senate to \nremember that. That is what my job is--to try to get the bill passed as \nquickly as possible to address wartime-related costs at the request of \nthe President of the United States. That is what I intend to do.\n  This amendment should not be included in wartime supplemental \nfunding. I regret that when the time comes I shall move to table my \nfriend's amendment. I don't know whether he wants to respond or not. I \ndon't know whether we want to vote at this time or not. A lot of things \nare going on in the building. I will rely on the leadership. I ask my \nfriend if he wishes me to allow him to respond.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I want to respond.\n  Right to the point, the distinguished chairman says that, yes, he \ngenerally agrees, and he talks knowingly of the importance of the ports \nand the need for security. He knows because Alaska has coastlines. We \nhave ANWR that we have all been debating. I wish they would read the \nbook on John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller made his money not on oil, but \non the delivery of oil. This is the delivery of ANWR and oil out of \nAlaska at the Port of Valdez, which has no security whatever. It is a \ntypical port, just like in my hometown, that wasn't interested in port \nsecurity. But after 9/11 things changed, and we are just bringing them \nin now and getting those plans promulgated.\n  Let me emphasize that this was done totally in conjunction with \nSecretary Mineta and the Transportation Security Administration. \nSpecifically, Admiral Loy was then head of the Coast Guard when he \nfound those needs out. He reaffirms those needs as the Administrator of \nthe Transportation Security Administration.\n  Now, my distinguished friend talks about things ``wartime related.'' \nOh, yes, Iraq is a war, Afghanistan is a war, but here at home is \nterrorism not a war? What is he talking about? We are responsible for \nthe security and we ran around and did just that--we passed the port \nsecurity measure 100 to 0 through here, but we didn't put the money \nbehind it. So they haven't had but $93 million distributed out of $29.8 \nbillion that we authorized.\n  I have served on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense for over \n30 years. I know about wartime-related expenses. We would not deny in a \nsecond the troops in uniform, but the troops out on the line at the \nports, at the airports, and different other places in America, we say, \nwell, that is pork, or there just wasn't money back home.\n  I told you about our Governor. He had to put parole officers around \nthe Port of Charleston last week. That is the way it continues with all \nthese particular ports over America.\n  This is not a measure to be tabled and say we have other amendments \ncoming. I cannot defend or talk for or against the other amendments \ncoming. I know this particular need. I can tell you here and now, it \nhas been justified by the administration and by Senators, both \nRepublican and Democrat.\n  We did not say we have all these amendments for the airlines. We just \ngave them a billion dollars because they did not know how to run an \nairline. Their troubles were long before 9/11. Many have gone into \nbankruptcy.\n  Then we gave them another billion dollars for security, and then we \ngave them $1.5 billion more to make sure they had $3.5 billion all \ntogether, but we will not give money for port security.\n  Yes, this is going to be spent not in 8 weeks, but in 5\\1/2\\ months. \nWe have the rest of April, May, June, July, August, and September--5\\1/\n2\\ months. It is not just that the money is not going to be spent. The \nports have been waiting for the money. They have been holding on \nendeavors. This is not just the amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina, this is the amendment that should be supported by all for \nports in America, but the ports have not learned what the airlines have \nlearned. I am going to try to get them on the line and see if they \ncan't hire the airline lobbyists where they get $3.5 billion for not \nknowing how to run an airline, and yet when I come forward with this \namendment, the Senator says: We have some other amendments coming and, \ntherefore, I do not want to approve this amendment. He says he is going \nto have to table this one. In other words, we are on a course to table \nall amendments.\n  The Senator says this bill is for wartime-related items. The war \nstarted on 9/11, the terrorism war, and that is just as serious a war \nas anything going on in Afghanistan or in Iraq. We just do not have \nuniforms, and we have taken those frontline troops and have sent them \nto Iraq. The policemen, the firemen, the Reserve officers, the National \nGuard--we have drained them all for Iraq, and then all of a sudden act \nlike there is not a terrorism war.\n  The Senator says this is a wartime-related Defense supplemental. That \nis what I am talking about: Money to be expended on defense, on home \nsecurity defense, that we are all worried about, and we act like it is \nnot important at all; that it is just some domestic program we can get \nto later on. I wish I had a ship. I would run it up some river and blow \nit up and wake this crowd up, and then the money would come. But right \nnow we have a system where the chairman--I can't even get anybody on \nthe floor, the chairman has told them to stay off the floor--but this \nchairman is going to table all these amendments.\n  Since I have the floor, let me talk about paying for these expenses. \nIn January, I offered an amendment to pay for the war. I did not think \nback in April we were going to be debating and appropriating some $75 \nbillion for the war. We are not paying for the war. We are going to \nborrow for the war. The distinguished chairman is saying, I am just not \ngoing to borrow anymore, like there is some restriction against \nborrowing in America.\n  What we have is not a stimulus, and I am going to bring it in to \nfocus. Everybody runs around here cutting taxes. Why? To get reelected. \nThat is Carl Rove's tax cut. That is all it is. It is a Carl Rove tax \ncut to get reelected. He told the President: To get reelected next \nyear, you have to have a tax cut.\n  That is outrageous nonsense. We do not have any taxes to cut. We ran \na $428 billion last year. We have under the President's budget a $554 \nbillion deficit this year. I say to the distinguished Presiding Officer \nthat does not include the cost of Iraq, which the President says is $75 \nbillion, just for 6 months. God knows what it is for a year. Next year, \nthe deficit will be $569 billion without the cost of the war and the \noccupation, by that time, I take it, of Baghdad.\n\n  What we will have is a $600 billion to $700 billion deficit in the \nelection next year. Tell Carl Rove that. The interest cost, instead of \n$350 billion, is going to be $400 billion to $500 billion. We are in a \nmeltdown because there is no responsibility.\n  I resent the idea of my distinguished friend from Alaska acting like \n``I am not going to spend the money; I am just trying to get money that \ncould not be spent in the next few months and is not needed'' when we \nvetted this issue, Republicans and Democrats. We need this money. We \nneed this kind of security, but, oh, no, they will pass $3.5 billion \nfor the airlines, and they will pass nothing for port security. They \nwill pass a tax cut to get reelected next year.\n  We have a country that will be worse than we inherited. This will be \nthe first time in history that one generation is going to leave the \ncountry worse off for the next generation. We always received a better \ncountry.\n  We have to go through these gymnastics up here of playing games for\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\ntax cuts, playing games for the lobbyists and the airlines, and then \nwhen they do not have the lobbyists, they act as if this is a casual \none and I will just move to table the amendment.\n  We aren't going to table right now because I have the floor. We are \ngoing to talk some more about paying for the war.\n  I think it is a disgrace that we would send our GIs to Iraq and say: \nWe hope you don't get killed, and the reason we hope you don't get \nkilled is because we want you to hurry back so we can give you the \nbill. We aren't going to pay for it. We have to have a tax cut so we \ncan get reelected.\n  We look out for No. 1, not for the fellow on the battlefield. Oh, \nyes, we have the Flag in the lapel. We recite the Pledge of Allegiance \nto the American Flag. We have a moment of silence before we meet in \nsubcommittee and other hearings. We stand up. We are very reverent. \nThere are millions and millions for tribute, but not one red cent for \ndefense. This is homeland defense. That is what it is.\n  I am sure the distinguished chairman of the party of Lincoln \nremembers well that Lincoln, to pay for the Civil War, put a tax on \ndividends; to pay for the Civil War, he put a tax on estates.\n  Now this party of Lincoln wants to take the tax off dividends and off \nestates and lecture about the port security that somehow the money is \nnot needed; that we could not spend it; that we have other measures \ncoming along the line and we are going to move to table all the \namendments; we have already met in caucus, so we are going to table all \nthe amendments and say: We got this money for the war effort; we did \nnot get it for the terrorism war. That is what the Senator from South \nCarolina is talking about. We do not have any idea what is happening on \nthe floor of the Senate. It is all politics. It is all applesauce, as \nWill Rogers said, and we are not paying attention to the real needs.\n  Here we have a real need, and we have to get the security around the \nports of America.\n  As I said, there are some 55 important ports that terrorists could \nblow up and close down the economy for 1 year to 2 years. We all know \nthat, but we pass it over because we have a system: We are going to \nleave this weekend, and we want to make sure we get rid of this bill \nbefore the weekend; what he wants to do is move to table these kinds of \namendments.\n  Let me speak about this port security. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint the details of my port security amendment to the supplemental \nappropriations bill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Hollings' Port Security Amendment to the Appropriations Supplemental\n\n       Sen. Hollings amendment to the ``Iraqi Freedom/Liberty \n     Shield'' supplemental appropriations bill would add $1 \n     billion for seaport security needs through the Department of \n     Homeland Security. Sen. Hollings recommends that the money be \n     spent consistent with the Maritime Transportation Security \n     Act of 2002, as follows:\n\n\n   The Border and Transportation Security Directorate ($840 million)\n\n       $110 million to Customs for the installation of screening \n     equipment, and to be used to help develop new technologies to \n     help develop and prototype screening and detection equipment \n     at US ports.\n       $100 million to TSA and Customs; $50 million each, to \n     evaluate and implement cargo security programs.\n       $30 million for the Transportation Security Administration \n     (TSA) to develop and implement the Transportation Worker ID \n     Card, and to conduct criminal background checks of \n     transportation workers who work in secure areas or who work \n     with sensitive cargo or information.\n       $600 million for grants to states, local municipalities, \n     ports and waterfront facilities for port security contingency \n     response and to help ensure compliance with federally \n     approved security plans.\n\n\n                       Coast Guard ($150 million)\n\n       $50 million for port security assessments.\n       $57 million to help implement the Automated Identification \n     System (AIS) and other tracking systems designed to actively \n     track and monitor vessels operating in US waters.\n       $36 million for Maritime Safety and Security Teams (MSST's) \n     to increase the number of teams and provide capital \n     equipment.\n       $7 million for radiation equipment development and \n     implementation at cargo portals.\n\n\n         Federal Law Enforcement Training Center ($10 million)\n\n       $10 million to develop a seaport security training \n     curriculum, in conjunction with the Maritime Administration, \n     for the certification of federal and state law enforcement \n     officers and private security personnel working at seaports.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print on page \n20 and 21 of the supplemental appropriations report, under chapter 5, \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the itemizations for the sections \nlisted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  OTHER BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE\n\n                  Funds Appropriated to the President\n\n\n                  iraqi relief and reconstruction fund\n\n                     (including transfers of funds)\n\n2003 appropriation to date.............................................\n2003 supplemental estimate...............................$2,443,300,000\nCommittee recommendation..................................2,468,300,000\n\n       The Committee provides $2,468,300,000 for the Iraq Relief \n     and Reconstruction Fund for humanitarian assistance in and \n     around Iraq and for rehabilitation and reconstruction in \n     Iraq. The Committee expects that the transfer authority \n     provided by this provision will not be used to transfer funds \n     to the Department of Defense. Prior to the initial transfer \n     of funds, the Secretary of State shall consult with the \n     Committee on Appropriations on plans for the use of the funds \n     appropriated under this heading.\n       The Committee provides that funds appropriated under this \n     heading shall be used to fully reimburse accounts \n     administered by the Department of State, the Department of \n     the Treasury, and the United States Agency for International \n     Development for expenses relating to the pre-positioning of \n     relief and reconstruction assistance for Iraq prior to the \n     enactment of this Act. The Committee notes that the following \n     accounts should be reimbursed from funds appropriated under \n     this heading: $157,000,000 for ``Development Assistance''; \n     $3,900,000 for ``Transition Initiatives''; and $100,000,000 \n     for ``Economic Support Fund''. The Committee requests to be \n     notified when reimbursements have been requested and \n     fulfilled.\n       The Committee notes that funds appropriated under this \n     heading are subject to the regular notification procedures of \n     the Committee on Appropriations, except that notifications \n     shall be transmitted at least 5 days in advance of the \n     obligation of funds.\n\n                    GENERAL PROVISIONS, THIS CHAPTER\n\n       Sec. 501. The Committee includes transfer authority between \n     certain accounts, and requests to be consulted before this \n     authority is exercised.\n       Sec. 502. The Committee provides the request for authority \n     to provide assistance or other financing in this chapter for \n     relief and reconstruction efforts in Iraq notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law. Funds made available pursuant to this \n     authority shall be subject to the regular notification \n     procedures of the Committees on Appropriations, except that \n     notification shall be transmitted at least 5 days in advance \n     of the obligation of funds.\n       Sec. 503. The Committee provides the request for the repeal \n     of the Iraqi Sanctions Act of 1990, and other limitations on \n     assistance for Iraq.\n       Sec. 504. The Committee provides the request for the \n     authority to export to Iraq any item subject to the Export \n     Administration Regulations or controlled under the \n     International Trafficking in Arms Regulations on the United \n     States Munitions List, if the President determines that to do \n     so in the national interests of the United States. The \n     Committee requests the President, after consulting with all \n     relevant departments and agencies, to report to the \n     appropriate congressional committees on a semiannual basis on \n     all Commerce and Control Munitions List items transferred to \n     Iraq, and the person or entity to which each item has been \n     transferred. The Committee requests that the first report be \n     submitted to Congress no later than 90 days after enactment \n     of this Act.\n       Sec. 505. The Committee provides $10,000,000 in ``Economic \n     Support Fund'' assistance for the establishment of a tribunal \n     for the prosecution of Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi war \n     criminals.\n       Sec. 506. The Committee includes the Sense of Congress \n     providing that, to the maximum extent practicable, contracts \n     and grants for relief and reconstruction in Iraq should be \n     awarded to United States companies and organizations, those \n     located in the Near East region, and those from countries who \n     have provided assistance to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The \n     Committee believes that reconstruction efforts should include \n     employment and other opportunities for the Iraqi people.\n       Sec. 508. The Committee provides the Secretary of State \n     with a national security interest waiver for certain \n     restrictions on assistance for Ukraine contained in Public \n     Law 108-7.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is a total sum of $1.135 billion, not a thing of \nwhat the Senator's amendment encompasses. We have $12 billion to $20 \nbillion that is stolen from the ports, and we are trying our best to \nchange the culture there. We have had good success with respect to the \nbackground checks. That was a big holdup on the Senate side.\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\nWe worked with the unions and they agreed that we should have \nbackground security checks for the workers. So in checking that out, \nthey now are anxious because they said now you have it in law that we \nhave to have the cards, but they are not coming through with the cards \nin the system. So how can we comply? That is in this Senator's \nprovision for port security. The distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. \nOlympia Snowe, was asking questions at the hearings and Admiral Collins \nsaid he was hopeful by the end of fiscal year 2003 we will have 17 of \nthe 55 port plans done.\n  Here is Admiral Collins's answer:\n\n       We have an $11 million recurring base to do port-security \n     assessments. Part of the feature of the 2004 budget was that \n     $11 million was moved to the Department, Under Secretary for \n     Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. The same \n     approach taken with TSA, Transportation Security \n     Administration also has money to do assessments in other \n     modes of transportation. They have been centralized. The \n     funds--as part of the President's budget, those funds have \n     been centralized in the Under Secretary for Information \n     Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. Although we remain \n     the executive agent, if you will, of that Under Secretary to \n     perform in the maritime.\n\n  So we have not gotten the money.\n\n       It is an $11 million issue. As that new Under Secretary, \n     who is still filling empty chairs as we speak matures, we \n     will develop the working relationship, a very collaborative, \n     congenial relation to date on the issue, no contention. And \n     we will continue to pursue our assessments.\n\n  But then we are only going to have by the end of the year some 17 of \nthe 55 done.\n  This is an emergency. I implore my colleague from Alaska, the \nchairman of our Appropriations Committee, get some money into this \nendeavor. I do not know about these other amendments that are coming \nalong. He knows this better than any Senator in the Senate because I \nknow Alaska, and I know the Senator's record. We do not have that \nmoney. That is why I went down and itemized. I knew that I was not \ngoing to ask for money that the Senator knew more about than I did, so \nI had to rehearse myself and break down every particular item in the \nsupplemental appropriation. I did not have the money, so that is why I \npointed out where in the billion it comes from.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nHollings amendment to this supplemental appropriations bill, which \nwould provide $1 billion to this Nation's seaport security programs.\n  Seaports are one our Nation's greatest assets, serving as the \nlifeline for economy and trade, for the fishing and cruise ship \nindustries, and to military operations. But they remain one of our \ngreatest vulnerabilities.\n  Our ports are susceptible to misuse by a terrorist organization. When \na cargo container arrives on our shores, it is quickly loaded onto a \ntruck or a train, and is transported to any of our cities, leaving all \nAmericans vulnerable to a security lapse.\n  Right now, the Federal Government is not completely fulfilling its \nresponsibility to protect our seaports. I am very pleased that the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act was signed into law last year. But \nfor this legislation to be effective, it must have a predictable and \nsustained funding source for the agencies tasked with maintaining the \nsecurity of our maritime borders.\n  We will never have enough law enforcement personnel or the perfect \nintelligence to detect and deter all potential threats. Technology is a \npromising approach to closing this gap--it may aid in container \ntracking, security, anti-tampering, and examination. These systems may \nalso eventually have the ability to detect the presence of chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons at our Nation's ports.\n  I agree with Senator Hollings that an attack on our seaports would be \ndevasting. Compounded by the reality of our economic dependence on \nports and the available intelligence on threats, it is inexcusable that \nwe have not done more. Senator Hollings' amendment would provide \nfunding for industry and port security grants, State and local \nentities, the Maritime Administration, the Coast Guard, the Customs \nService, and the Transportation Security Administration.\n  Since the tragedy of September 11, 2001, the threat and impact of \nterrorism has become real to many Americans. The global war on \nterrorism must be waged with equal intensity and commitment, both \noverseas and--here in our own Nation including at our seaports.\n  My colleagues may argue that this amendment is not war related, but I \ndisagree. Our war effort depends on access to our 13 strategic military \nseaports, which support our operations in Iraq. These ports, like the \nrest of our 361 ports, are insufficiently vulnerable. If a terrorist \nthreat were to affect one of our ports, our military operations could \nbe negatively impacted.\n  The security of our borders is a national responsibility. Investing \nin maritime security is as vital as investing in our intelligence \ncapabilities or investing in our Nation's airports.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Hollings amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret the problem we have with regard \nto the funding for these items. I call attention to the fact that we \nare trying to get a supplemental appropriations bill to deal with the \ncosts of the war primarily, not just one war but the war against \nterrorism, the war in Iraq, and the war in Afghanistan.\n  I know of no other way to do it than to say we have reached a limit \nas far as what we are going to do. This thought just came to my mind. \nWe have gone beyond the President's request to deal with the most \npressing need, and that is the aviation industry relief. We have some \nbenefits for that industry, almost $4 billion, that deal with trying to \ngive that industry the ability to rejuvenate the economy. If they come \nback, the whole economy comes back, in my judgment.\n  In any event, the more we put in the supplemental, the more we will \nhave a situation where we will not get that either. The aviation \nindustry relief, I am told, needs to be finished almost immediately. \nSome of these companies are going into chapter 11 right now. Others are \nindicating that they may cease operation.\n  I really believe the major factors in this bill are defense, homeland \ndefense and aviation industry relief. I urge the Senate to think about \nit and confine it to that.\n  I move to table the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, and \nI ask that the vote on that amendment take place following the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. I further ask \nthat prior to Ms. Landrieu, the Senator from Colorado and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas share 15 minutes on the amendment they have, which it is \nmy understanding we are in the position now where we will adopt that \namendment. I do not know the final status of the amendment of the \nSenator from Louisiana so I will not move to adopt it, obviously, since \nit is not before us yet. But that will be my intention when we finish.\n  My friend from Nevada and I are trying to estimate when these votes \nwould take place. I want 5 minutes to respond to the Senator from \nLouisiana after she offers her amendment. So it would be 5:15 that we \nwould be voting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If the distinguished Senator will yield, I ask that the \nmatter proceed as the Senator from Alaska has outlined: that there \nwould be no second-degree amendments in order, and following the \noffering of the amendment by the Senator from Louisiana and the \nstatements of the two Senators from Arkansas and Colorado, we would \nproceed to vote on the motion to table; and then following that, the \nLandrieu amendment, whatever the Senator decides to do on that.\n  On our side, Senator Corzine is ready to offer his amendment. \nFollowing that, Senator Byrd is ready to offer his amendment. That is \nnot a UC. That is just for the information of Senators. The rest of the \nunanimous consent agreement, I ask be adopted.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, I think we should go back \nand forth.\n  Mr. REID. That is not part of the deal.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I certainly have no objection to the Senator's unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the staff had some question about the time \non\n\n[[Page S4686]]\n\nLandrieu. The time was 15 minutes for the Senator from Louisiana and 5 \nminutes for the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding that there will be no second-\ndegree amendments to the Landrieu amendment or to the amendment of the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That does not apply to subsequent amendments.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. No. I want to ask for a clarification. Will I introduce \nmy amendment following the Landrieu amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Colorado is first. He and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas share 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the \nSenator from Colorado will be first.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask that the pending amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 451\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. McCain, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. \n     Graham of South Carolina, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Cornyn, and Mrs. Clinton, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 451.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a panel to determine responsibility for an \natmosphere at the United States Air Force Academy that was conducive to \n  the recent acts of sexual misconduct at the United States Air Force \n                                Academy)\n\n       On page 89, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\nTITLE V--PANEL TO REVIEW SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AT UNITED STATES \n                           AIR FORCE ACADEMY\n\n     SEC. 501.

Mr. President, I thank the chairman for giving me an \nopportunity to offer this amendment. Twice this past week, the \nSecretary of the Air Force, James Roche, and the Air Force Chief of \nStaff, GEN John Jumpers, testified before congressional committees on \nthe progress of the Air Force's investigation into the allegation of \nsexual misconduct at the U.S. Air Force Academy.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I was stunned to hear these officials \nexonerate the leadership of the Academy. The Air Force investigation \nhas not been completed, yet Secretary Roche and General Jumper have \nalready determined that these officials were not responsible. To make \nthis determination before the investigation is completed is \nirresponsible and inappropriate, in my view.\n  Mr. President, 42 former and current cadets who allegedly were \nsexually assaulted or raped have contacted my office. Some of these \ncases are between 5 and 10 years old. Most, however, took place within \nthe last 5 years; 20 have occurred within the last 2 years. Let me \nrepeat that: 20 cadets say they were sexually assaulted or raped in the \nlast 2 years at the U.S. Air Force Academy.\n  The Air Force said the current leadership did not know about this \nproblem. I disagree. I believe they chose to ignore it. Since 1998, the \nAcademy Office for Character Development has been conducting student \nsurveys on sexual assaults. The surveys, which were reviewed by the \nAcademy's leadership, clearly indicated a pervasive problem with sexual \nassaults at the Academy.\n  Here are some of the results from these surveys. In 1998, 22 cadets \nsaid they had been sexually assaulted at the Academy. In 2000, 17 \ncadets say they had been sexually assaulted at the Academy. In 2001, \n167 cadets indicated they had been sexually assaulted--167. In 2002, 80 \ncadets said they had been sexually assaulted at the academy. These \nsurveys were, at the very least, a warning that the Academy leadership \nchose to ignore.\n  I served on the Academy's Board of Visitors for 4 years, and never \nduring that time did the Air Force leadership or Academy officials \nbring up this issue. The first time problems of sexual misconduct at \nthe Academy were discussed was last week. I issued repeatedly over the \nlast year at Board of Visitors meetings a concern about sexual \nmisconduct. Last June, for example, I urged Academy officials to \ninvestigate a highly sexual drama competition put on by cadets. I was \nassured that the Academy would review sexual misconduct at the Academy.\n  Last September, I again brought up a number of concerns raised by \nparents of cadets about sexual assaults at the Academy. Again I was \nassured the Academy would look into it.\n  Enough is enough. It is time to take action. I appreciate the fact \nthat the Air Force moved so quickly on its investigation. I am also \npleased the Air Force has issued a number of directives. But clearly, \ngiven the history involved and the lack of action in the past, an \nexternal review is necessary.\n  Therefore, Senator Warner, Senator Pryor, Senator McCain, Senator\n\n[[Page S4687]]\n\nGraham, and I, along with several others, will offer an amendment to \nthe legislation currently before the Senate. This amendment will create \nan independent panel that will review the Air Force's directives and \ndetermine those who were responsible for the atmosphere that was \nconducive to recent acts of sexual misconduct at the Air Force Academy. \nThe panel will begin its work by May 1, 2003, and submit a report to \nthe President, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, and \nCongress within 90 days.\n  I still believe in the Air Force Academy. It is a fine institution. \nIt has trained and equipped thousands of Air Force officers. Yet this \ncurrent crisis has tarnished the reputation of the school and cast \ndoubt on its graduates. It is time for us to take action. I urge my \ncolleagues to support our amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Arkansas, the prime \ncosponsor, along with the Senator from Colorado. I will briefly make a \ncomment to thank them for producing this amendment. I thank Senator \nWarner, as well as Senator Chambliss and others on both sides of the \naisle who are responsible for this amendment. It is much needed.\n  We had a hearing on this issue yesterday. It was one of the most \nremarkable evasions of responsibility I have ever seen. Basically, in \nsummary, testimony by the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff \nof the Air Force said, really, no one is responsible.\n  We know people are responsible and people are held responsible, \nincluding the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Secretary of the \nAir Force. The Secretary of the Air Force has proven, to our \nsatisfaction, that he cannot and will not address this situation, this \ncrisis, at the Air Force Academy in a mature and efficient fashion. \nThat is what triggered this amendment by Senators Allard and Pryor. I \nstrongly support it. Clearly, the quicker this panel will act and send \nits recommendations, the sooner we will implement changes in policy \nthat will prevent a recurrence.\n  I might add, the situation apparently has been going on for 10 years. \nThat is clearly an unacceptable situation at one of our finest \ninstitutions.\n  I thank the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from Colorado, and \nothers involved in this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I concur and join in the comments of my \nesteemed colleague from Arizona and my colleague from Colorado on this \nvery important amendment the Senate is now considering. I believe the \nSenate needs to send a very strong signal that we will not tolerate \nsexual misconduct at our military academies. It is not only important \nfor the cadets and their families but also for the Nation.\n  Yesterday I received notice that a young woman in Arkansas has now \nbeen accepted to the Air Force Academy. I called her on the phone. She \nis excited, eager, ready to go. We talked about the situation at the \nU.S. Air Force Academy. I have no doubt it will be a great experience \nfor her, it will be a great education, and she will excel and achieve \ngreat things in her military career.\n  As I continue to recommend that young men and women go to our \nmilitary academies, I want to proceed with confidence and know they are \ngoing into a healthy environment. These institutions are institutions \nof honor. There have been dozens of allegations of sexual misconduct at \nthe U.S. Air Force Academy. It is time we stop and honor these victims, \nthat we listen to them.\n  One thing that became very clear the other day in the hearing we had \nwas that there were a lot of facts we did not know. There is a lot of \nevidence we still need to uncover. We need a clear picture of the \natmosphere at our military academies. We need to ensure this Nation, \nthe Air Force, the cadets, and the families that when we send young men \nand women to the Air Force Academy, they are going to a constructive \nenvironment, they are going into a culture that will not tolerate \nsexual impropriety.\n  This is not about a witch hunt. It is not about pointing fingers. It \nis about admitting to a problem, identifying the problem, and making \nsure it never happens again.\n  I thank my colleague from Colorado for all of his hard work. The \nchairman of the committee also had a hand in this and is a cosponsor. \nWe are honored to have him. I thank the Members of this body for their \ntime and patience, especially Senator Stevens of Alaska, who has worked \nthis in on short notice, along with Senator Byrd of West Virginia, who \nhas been very kind with the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I add an additional cosponsor to the \namendment, Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I join my colleague from Arkansas in thanking Senators \nand thanking Senator McCain personally for his efforts on this \namendment. It has been a delight to work in a bipartisan manner with \nthe Senator from Arkansas. I also thank Senator Warner and his staff. \nAll our staffs have worked hard, as this has been a last-minute \namendment.\n  We are happy to yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. The only addition I would like to make is Senator Corzine \nwould like to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 452\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 452.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To appropriate $1,047,000,000 for procurement for the \n                      National Guard and Reserves)\n\n       In chapter 3 of title I, under the heading ``PRO-\n     CUREMENT'', insert the after the matter relating to ``Pro-\n     curement, Defense-Wide'' the following:\n\n     NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE EQUIPMENT.\n\n       For an additional amount for ``National Guard and Reserve \n     Equipment'', $1,047,000,000.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that is before us because it is a bill \nthat supports our troops, it strengthens our Nation, and it sends a \nvery positive and I hope united signal that we are unified in support \nof our men and women on the battlefield and our men and women who are \nsupporting our warriors on the battlefield.\n  We are acting as quickly and as deliberately as we can to debate and \ndelve in some detail into a bill that is fairly significant in size, \nalmost $75 billion. I support that effort.\n  I also say I support the course of this administration. I supported \nthe use of force. I support the course of action we are on, a tough and \naggressive action toward this rogue regime. I believe, as the political \nleadership of this Nation, leading the world in this effort, we need to \ncontinue our support, morally, spiritually, and politically as \nrepresented by the bills we pass in Congress.\n  Last week, Senator Durbin and I offered an amendment in a bipartisan \npartnership with Senator Warner and Senator Chambliss from Georgia. We \nreceived 100 votes for an amendment that would steer or direct some of \nthe funding--a very small portion of the funding but funding very much \nneeded by the Guard and Reserve--to the Guard and Reserve, which are \npicking up a larger share of the burden of this war, this campaign.\n  I am here today to offer another amendment that will support the 100-\nto-0 vote of last week to actually fund a portion of that amendment.\n  Last week, we said we wanted to raise the combat pay for Guard and \nReserve and for Active military. I am pleased the Senator from Alaska \nhas\n\n[[Page S4688]]\n\nworked out an arrangement that is going to actually make that possible. \nWe have, I think, agreed on a doubling of the amount and have fit that \nwithin the framework of this bill. I know that is going to be received \nwith gratitude and happiness on the part of the families who have their \nloved ones right there on the battlefront.\n  In addition to increasing the combat pay and the separation pay for \nall our Guard and Reserve units, I also think we need to do everything \nwe can possibly do to send our Guard and Reserve on the battlefield \nwith the equipment they need to win the war and to protect themselves, \nto stand up the American flag and be victorious in this effort. I am \nvery concerned, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, as a \nformer member of the Armed Services Committee, that our budgets do not \nreflect the commitment to our Guard and Reserve that their actions and \ntheir contributions warrant.\n  Let me quote the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Mr. Charles \nCragin:\n\n       The nature and purpose of reserve service has changed since \n     the end of the cold war. They are no longer weekend warriors. \n     They represent almost 50 percent of the total force.\n\n  If we are not members of the Reserve ourselves or do not have family \nmembers in the Reserve, I am not sure we recognize the significant \nchange that has occurred in the last 20 years in the makeup of our \narmed services. Mr. President, 45 percent of the total force is made up \nby our National Guard and National Reserve; 1.2 million men and women \nwho serve as reservists today are being called up to an unprecedented \nextent.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We are currently calling reservists to duty involuntarily \n     under three separate Presidential orders: For Bosnia, \n     Kosovo, Southwest Asia. Thousands of reservists have \n     served with great distinction around the globe, including \n     more than 5,000 who recently deployed to Europe in support \n     of the air campaign over Kosovo.\n\n  Of course, this was several years ago. The bottom line is they are a \nsignificant part of the total force; weekend warriors no more.\n  Let me state for the Record the Center For Strategic and Budgetary \nAssessment says:\n\n       The reserve component represents 47 percent of our military \n     structure but consumes only 8.3 percent of the Department of \n     Defense budget.\n\n  There is a bias in the Department for the Active units. I am not \nsaying one is more important than the other, but our budget needs to \nreflect the contributions that both the Active-Duty and the Guard and \nthe Reserve are contributing, reflective of their contribution and \ntheir position in the total force. Our budget does not, today, do that.\n  My amendment attempts to add $1 billion. It is not going to bring the \npercentage up to where I believe it needs to be, but it is a step in \nthat direction and it is something we can do right now. There is no \nreason to wait. The supplemental bill I hope to vote for--I am proud to \nvote for, I want to vote for--has $62 billion for Active Forces but \nonly $271 million for the Reserve Force. Let me repeat, $62 billion for \nthe Active Forces but only $271 million for the Reserve Forces. Yet \nevery day, every night in America, the telephone rings in households in \nLouisiana, in Texas, in Mississippi, with a commanding officer saying: \n``Sir or Ma'am, report for duty. You will get your orders when you \narrive. Please make arrangements.''\n  Do you know what those arrangements are that the Guard and National \nReserve make? They write their wills. They kiss their spouses goodbye. \nThey tell their children goodbye. They call all the friends they went \nto school with to tell them goodbye because they may not see them \nagain.\n  Those are the arrangements that are made when that telephone rings. \nYet this budget that is supporting that effort fails to give them the \nequipment and support they need.\n  I know that is a strong statement. But the facts support that \nstatement. This Senate and House have a responsibility to begin to fix \nthat. We can fix it. We have $65 billion. My amendment asks to add $1 \nbillion. I am prepared to take it out of the $65 billion. We are \nprepared to add it. We are prepared to find an offset. But to continue \nto ask our Guard and Reserve to make arrangements--perhaps we should \nmake arrangements to provide them the equipment they need to fight a \nwar we are asking them not only to fight but to win.\n  If people say, Senator, let's just wait until the 2004 budget, I can \ntell you it is not any better. We are going to spend $400 billion on \ndefense, but a meager $1.9 billion is devoted for Guard procurement. \nThat means we are prepared as a nation to spend less than the cost of \none submarine for all the equipment needs of nearly 50 percent of our \ntroops.\n  That does not make any sense. When we talk about force protection and \nminimizing casualties, you don't have to be an expert in warfare to \nunderstand one of the ways you can minimize casualties is to give your \nGuard and Reserve the best training and the best equipment, so when \nthey ship out, they have a chance to ship back.\n  I am going to spend a few minutes. I wish I had more time because I \nwant to talk about the thousands of men and women who are called up, \nState by State, so when people come down in a few minutes to vote on \nthis amendment, they will know exactly how many families they are \nvoting for in their districts and their States, and how many families \nthey are voting against.\n  Let's start with the States that have over 50 percent of their forces \ncalled up: Alabama, 5,961. This is a portion of the forces. That means \nthe telephones rang in 5,961 houses and a voice said, ``We need \nyou. Close your business. Leave your employment. Make your will. Tell \nyour wife, your spouse goodbye. Hug your children. Tell your family \ngoodbye, and we will let you know when to ship off.'' These people are \ngone. And then there are going to be thousands more who are called up.\n\n  In Washington State: 4,066. In my home State of Louisiana, which is \nover, I think, 35 percent: 2,328.\n  Now, this is the number of personnel mobilized out of the Army Guard. \nThis isn't all of the Reserve components. And we are trying to get a \nhandle on those numbers. Some of those numbers are classified for \nobvious reasons.\n  But suffice it to say, they are not showing up for a weekend of work \nin Iraq. They are going for 6 months or for a year.\n  Some people say, ``Senator, you don't need equipment for the Guard \nand Reserve because they get the equipment when they go over there.''\n  Let me ask you, on the television that we have seen, just think about \nwhat the visuals have been about the war. Have we seen any tanks that \ndon't have people in them? Have we seen any armored vehicles just \nsitting there waiting for a driver? Because that is not true. The truth \nis, the soldier shows up with his rifle, with his uniform, with his \nchemical detection equipment. The planes have to have the radar on them \nalready. They have to show up with their equipment to fight the battle. \nAnd we are not funding the Guard and Reserve at the level we should.\n  I want to tell my people in Louisiana, when that phone rings, their \nSenator was on this floor fighting for them to have this equipment. And \nthe argument is, ``Well, they can't buy it in 30 days, so we can't put \nit in this bill.'' And then the next time we have a bill, they will \nsay, ``We can't buy it in 30 days, so let's not put it in that bill.'' \nAnd then the next time we have an appropriations bill, it is going to \nbe the same story.\n  I am saying today, as we call up 100,000 more troops, half of whom \nare going to be Guard and Reserve, please, let's give them the \nequipment they need to win the war. And that is what my amendment does.\n  I have talked to the chairman. I have asked the chairman. We could \nadd the money. We can take it out of the $65 billion. We can offset the \nmoney that is going to Turkey, $1 billion. I would rather send it to \nthe Reserves. I don't want to cut it in half, but I am willing to \ncompromise. But to tell our Guard and Reserve, no, I just am not \nwilling to do it.\n  I want to list some of the items this money will buy. A great many of \nthese items do not take a great amount of time to order. You could pick \nup the phone and dial it and ask them to deliver it. Let me just give \nyou a couple of examples in the few minutes that I have.\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\n  The collective protection fund would be used to procure collective \nprotection shelters for deployed forces in the event that chemical and \nbiological weapons are fired on them. They would have a shelter to \nprotect themselves.\n  Skin exposure reduction paste, I am sure someone produces that and \nmanufactures it now. It is not something we have to invent. All they \nhave to do is pick up the phone and order it. The skin is exposed, and \nit helps them against chemical warfare agents.\n  Increased resources will be used to procure additional mobile \nchemical agent detectors for use by forces performing the mission of \ndetermining whether weapons of mass destruction are present. How will \nthey know if they don't have the equipment to detect it? And there are \nsome things that are classified in this list that I cannot speak to.\n\n  I think our Active Forces would agree with this amendment. I think \nour Active Forces realize how important the Guard and Reserve are, what \ncapable soldiers they are. And some units are better trained than \nothers. I understand that. And some States have it better organized \nthan others.\n  I happen to represent a State that has one of the finest National \nGuards in the Nation. I guess I am so proud of them, I want to do my \nvery best by them, and to say we are doing a disservice by having $62 \nbillion in this bill for Active Forces and we have added up only $271 \nmillion for Reserve Forces. Yet almost 50 percent of the men and women \nfighting the war are in the Guard and Reserve.\n  It just does not make sense. And perhaps it was an oversight. I do \nnot think anyone means--I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I do not think anyone means harm to the Guard and \nReserve. And I know that every Member of the Senate is most certainly \npatriotic and wants to do their best. But I have spoken about this in \nmeetings. I had to bring it to the Senate floor to give it attention. \nAnd I must ask for a vote because, that way, then people can go on the \nRecord, and they can then be on the Record explaining to these 5,000 \nfamilies why we could support these billions of dollars of equipment \nfor the Active Forces and shortchange our Reserves.\n  I know that is not the intention of the Chair. And I would not in any \nway say he does not have an extremely difficult job of managing this \nbill. And I have no intention of holding up the bill. But I thought it \nwas only fair to offer this amendment, to speak for 20 minutes, to ask \nfor the money that I think our Guard and Reserve need.\n  So when the phone rings in Louisiana, and the Smith family or the \nJames family or the Fonteneau family or the Thibodeaux family is \ncalled, they can say our Senator did her very best to try to convince \npeople that maybe there was a slight imbalance in the money that was \ngiven for the Actives versus the Reserves, and that she is not sending \nmy son, my husband, my wife, my grandmother, or my grandfather out \nthere, at a loss to his or her income, a sacrifice to the family, \nwithout the equipment he or she needs to fight a war we asked them to \nfight, which is what we are doing in Iraq.\n  So I offer my amendment. I ask for support. I am sorry if the \nleadership cannot support this amendment, but I am going to ask for a \nvote. And I will continue, every time there is an appropriations bill \non this floor--whether it is a supplemental appropriations or whether \nit is part of our next year's budget--I will continue to say, if 47 \npercent of our force fighting the war today--not next week; today--are \nGuard and Reserve, don't they deserve more than 8 percent of the money \nwe are sending to support the war.\n  I say that answer is yes. And I want the families in Louisiana to \nknow that I get it, I understand it, and I don't want them to put their \nlives in any more danger than what is absolutely necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from \nLouisiana would add over $1 billion, which would be earmarked for \nNational Guard and Reserve equipment.\n  The amendment proposes to increase the supplemental appropriations \nfund to add funding for something that the Department of Defense does \nnot tell us is a high priority.\n  Equipment is not requested to be funded in the supplemental or in the \nbudget that was submitted by the President for the next fiscal year.\n  Most of the items the Senator is describing are for the purposes of \ntraining. What we are trying to do today is provide funds for the \nDepartment of Defense to wage the war on terror and to pay for what is \nneeded now so that we can win a victory in Iraq and protect the \nsecurity of our homeland, not for items that will reach their \ndestination or be usable by the Guard and Reserve Forces 2 years from \nnow. And that is what these funds will do. They are for future \nprojects.\n  Three of the projects are for construction--$20 million worth of \nconstruction projects--so they are not warfighting funding program \ndollars that are requested by the administration of this Congress at \nthis time.\n  The committee has made available a sum of $11.019 billion in the \nDefense Emergency Response Fund that can be used for any of these items \nthat the military thinks are necessary in order to wage the war on \nterror, so we are not denying the military the opportunity to spend \nfunds for purposes such as the Senator describes. But we are not \ntelling them they have to. We are not earmarking funds and saying you \nhave to spend this for this purpose at this time.\n  The bill that is before the Senate also contains $1 billion in \nprocurement accounts that can be used for Guard and Reserve Forces. So \nwe are not ignoring the Guard and Reserve in this bill. The Guard and \nReserve equipment, and the use of them in the operations at this time, \nis fully provided for in the bill.\n  We hope the Senate will reject the amendment. It has not been \nrequested by the Department of Defense. The requests the Department are \nmaking for waging the war are met by the funding provided in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the pending measure? The first vote will occur \non the amendment of the Senator from Colorado?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina. The Landrieu amendment is currently pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. But under the unanimous consent request, we vote first \non the Hollings amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Hollings vote was scheduled after the \nLandrieu amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. One second till I straighten this out. I don't care \nwhich one. This Senator has no priority on it. I am agreeable to either \none first. The amendment I am trying to address after that, though, is \nthe amendment of the Senator from Colorado. What has happened to it in \nmy absence?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has been set aside.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska indicated he didn't \ncare. The Senator from Louisiana thought her vote would be second. She \nwould rather that her vote follow the Hollings amendment motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has that right. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote on the motion to table the Hollings amendment occur first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided between the two votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. One minute on each side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection. I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nHollings amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the motion to table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. On a motion to table. I have made that motion.\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the motion to table amendment No. 445.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \npending business now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the motion----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, could we have order in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The pending business is the motion to table the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the author of the amendment first. The \nSenator from Louisiana is entitled to 1 minute. I hope my colleagues \nwill let her speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, will the Senate be in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. We will not \nproceed until the Senate is in order. Senators will cease their \nconversations and move from the aisles to their seats.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, where is the Sergeant at Arms?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  This is a very important amendment, and I ask my colleagues to \nconsider carefully their vote. Last week, we voted 100 to 0 in a \nbipartisan fashion to support an increase in combat pay for Active and \nReserve and to increase the funding for necessary equipment for our \nGuard and Reserve. This amendment adds $1 billion to this bill for a \nvery good reason: Because the Reserve component represents 47 percent \nof our military structure and only 8.3 percent of the budget. In the \nunderlying bill, we have $62 billion for Active and $271 million for \nthe Reserves.\n  In every State, thousands of people are being called up. When they \nget the call, they put on their uniform and go. This amendment gives \nthem the equipment to fight and win the war. I ask for everyone's \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, of the $62.6 billion requested by the \nPresident for defense, no less than $10.8 billion in this bill is for \nthe direct support of the Guard and Reserve for this fiscal year. The \nmonies that the Senator from Louisiana wishes would be spent in 2004.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we are addressing the immediate needs. \nThis is an emergency supplemental. The needs as identified by the \nSenator from Louisiana are all nice to have, but they should go through \nthe orderly process, through the Senate Armed Services Committee, a \nrequest by the President of the United States, and then a full and open \ndebate. This is neither the appropriate nor, I believe, fiscally \nresponsible thing to do at this time. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. On each side is all right with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is the Senator from Arizona suggesting the $6 billion \nthat is on the list for the Reserves has not gone through the regular \norder?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am suggesting to the Senator from Louisiana, this is a \nvery large appropriation which has not been examined by members of the \ncommittee themselves in this context and is added after carefully \nthought out, carefully requested amounts of funds have gone through the \nAppropriations Committee in the form of an emergency supplemental. I am \nsure these are all worthy causes. There are billions and billions of \ndollars of worthy causes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. With all due respect to the Senator from Arizona, I am \na member of the Appropriations Committee, and this $6 billion has gone \nthrough, and we are asking $1 billion of the $6 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Louisiana has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the money that is in this bill will \nhelp the Guard that has been called up. That is the case. We want to \nhelp the people who are fighting the wars now. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), \nwould vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding Senator McCain is on the floor to \noffer an amendment. He has graciously consented, since we are going \nback and forth on amendments----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senate will be \nin order.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The senior Senator from Arizona has graciously consented to \nallow Senator Edwards to speak for up to 5 minutes on an amendment that \nwill be offered at a subsequent time by Senator Corzine and himself. \nFollowing that 5-minute statement by the Senator from North Carolina, \nthen Senator McCain will be authorized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I rise today to talk about an amendment \nSenator Corzine and I plan to offer later during debate. At the outset, \nI thank Senator Corzine for his leadership and say he is far and away \nthe Senate's greatest champion on this particular issue.\n  The issue is simple. Will we protect our chemical plants from \nterrorist attacks? The answer to that question has to be yes. All \nAmericans are praying for our soldiers overseas today. Their courage, \npatriotism, and dedication is an inspiration to every one of us. Today \nit is time for folks here in this Chamber to summon a little bit of \ncourage to make sure we do our part to protect America.\n  Folks have been talking about chemical security for months. Everyone \nknows the vulnerability of these plants is a major problem, but nobody \nis acting. The time for talk is past. It is time for us to put the \nsecurity of the American people ahead of special-interest lobbyists and \npass this bill now.\n  Our chemical plants remain dangerously at risk for terrorist attack. \nAccording to the EPA, there are 123 chemical plants that would endanger \na million people each if they were attacked, and those are just the \nchemical plants that are located near big cities. The U.S. Army Surgeon \nGeneral found the No. 2 threat to the American public, second only to a \nmajor biological attack, is a terrorist attack on a chemical plant. And \nthe terrorists know it.\n  Government officials at the National Infrastructure Protection Center \nhave warned that al-Qaida operatives may plan to launch attacks on our \nchemical and nuclear infrastructure, ``to cause contamination, \ndisruption, and terror.''\n  Based on their information, chemical plants remain viable targets for \nterrorists. Despite these enormous and serious threats, our Nation's \nchemical plants remain unprotected. The Agency for Toxic Substances and \nDisease Registry issued a report just a few weeks ago that found the \nsecurity at chemical plants ranged from fair--which is the best--to \nvery poor.\n\n  Last fall, on the anniversary of September 11, Newsweek gave the \nchemical industry an F for failing to beef up its security--an F. \nNewsweek described the threat to chemical plants as 1,000 points of \nvulnerability, risk that has remained largely below the radar. One \nblown-up plant, truck, or train, and the press will be calling for the \nscalps of those who let it happen.\n  We have a chance to stop it. We cannot let this happen. That is our \nresponsibility.\n  Senator Corzine has been on top of this issue from day one. He has \ntaken the lead on getting an effective chemical plant safety bill \nthrough the Senate and signed into law. He introduced his bill, the \nChemical Security Act, back in October of 2001, more than a year and a \nhalf ago. It passed unanimously out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Back then, everyone agreed we needed to protect our chemical \nplants and keep all the American people safe.\n  Unfortunately, since then, some of our colleagues have changed their \nminds. In fact, some of the Members who voted for the Chemical Safety \nAct in committee later reversed themselves and attacked it when it was \nconsidered in legislation to create the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Senator Corzine has reintroduced the bill, but now it is stalled in \ncommittee. Why is it a bill that was so popular to Congress has now \nbecome so controversial? I will tell you one thing that has happened. \nThe industry lobbyists have gotten the word out that they are against \nthis bill. They do not like it. They say they don't want Government \ntelling them what to do. They want voluntary standards, not mandatory \nstandards. Now it is beginning to look as if the administration is \ngoing to take the same line.\n  I have a few questions for these lobbyists. Do we have voluntary \nstandards for whether the air our family breathes is going to be clean? \nDo we let each powerplant decide how much it is going to pollute? That \nmay be what some people want, but I don't think it is a good idea.\n  Do we let sewage plants decide how much toxic waste they are going to \nsend into the water our kids drink? Of course not. When it comes to \nphysical security, do we have voluntary standards for security at \nairports, standards where each airport gets to decide whether they are \ngoing to check bags and how? Of course we don't. When thousands of \nAmericans lives are on the line, we set minimum standards. We have to \ndo exactly the same thing here.\n  Let me go into what this amendment would do. First, it would require \nminimum standards for improving security and reducing potential hazards \nat chemical plants and other industrial facilities that store large \nquantities of hazardous materials. Specifically, the bill would require \nidentification of high-priority chemical facilities within 1 year of \nenactment. These high-priority facilities are the very dangerous ones, \nthe plants that have significant quantities of toxic or flammable \nchemicals and the ones located near major population centers.\n  This amendment would not affect facilities located in remote areas, \nincluding the vast majority of agricultural facilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator have expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nalways enjoy hearing from candidates for higher office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Senator from Arizona should know, having been a \ncandidate for higher office himself. I appreciate his courtesy.\n  For the high-priority plants, the amendment would create a process \nwhere the plants are required to figure out what their vulnerabilities \nare and then address them. It is that simple.\n  Senator Corzine has been extremely reasonable in accommodating \nlegitimate concerns. For example, we heard from some farm groups that \nthey wanted the Department of Homeland Security taking on key tasks \nunder the bill, not EPA. Therefore, we have made those changes.\n  But let me mention one thing in this bill that has not changed and \nthat has become controversial for reasons I do not understand. This \nbill requires what is called hazard reduction. It says to chemical \nplants: If you can use a safer chemical, you have to use a safer \nchemical. This should not be a controversial idea. We all try to \npractice hazard reduction every single day. We put our kids in car \nseats when we are driving, and we cover up electric outlets. We wear \nseatbelts. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about \nindividual lives.\n  Here we are talking about thousands and thousands of lives. We have \nto reduce these hazards. Terrorists want to attack targets where they \ncan hurt as many people as possible. If we can make chemical plants \nless dangerous, the terrorists are less likely to attack them.\n  This works in the real world. Right near Washington, DC, the Blue \nPlains sewage treatment plant has completely eliminated its use of \nchlorine gas. Before, if it had been attacked, the chlorine gas could \nhave been released and blanketed this city in a deadly cloud.\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\nNow they use a less dangerous substance that gives them the same \nresults. We need to make sure that every plant takes the same approach.\n  A GAO report, issued last month, found that neither the EPA nor other \nFederal agencies have gone far enough to gather information about \nplants' vulnerabilities and to reduce their level of risk. The report \nrecommended legislation that would:\n\n       require these chemical facilities to expeditiously assess \n     their vulnerability to terrorist attack and, where necessary, \n     require these facilities to take corrective action.\n\n  This should not be a partisan issue.\n  Let me quote a recent statement by former Senator Warren Rudman, a \nRepublican, and one of the country's acknowledged experts on homeland \nsecurity. Here's what he said about chemical security:\n\n       The federal role needs to be able to set standards and make \n     sure those standards are observed just as we do with clear \n     air and clean water and workplace standards. I think we have \n     to have security standards, and people are going to have to \n     meet those standards.\n\n  When hundreds of thousands of Americans' lives could be at risk, it \nis not enough to hope that chemical plants will change their ways. It \nis not enough to ask. We have to make certain they are doing what needs \nto be done to make the American people safe.\n  I thank Senator Corzine for his leadership, and I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 456\n\n (Purpose: To strike the appropriation of $50,000,000 for the Maritime \nLoan Guarantee Program under title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 456.\n       On page 42, strike lines 16 through 22.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, with the consent of the Senator from \nArizona, I ask unanimous consent that there be 30 minutes equally \ndivided for debate prior to a vote in relation to the McCain amendment, \nwith no amendments in order to the language of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I also ask that the consent \ninclude the fact that Senator Corzine be recognized following the \ndisposition of the matter about which the unanimous consent agreement \nis made.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I so modify my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, if \nI need a few more minutes than that--I don't think I will--I hope the \nSenators from Mississippi and Nevada will indulge me.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator has my assurance that will be \nthe case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I get into the amendment, we have \nmade a preliminary examination of the--this is the reason I said to the \nSenator from Mississippi we may need a few more minutes--we have made a \npreliminary examination of the bill, and the first time through it, \ntragically--I say tragically because the title of this bill is ``making \nsupplemental appropriations to support Department of Defense operations \nin Iraq, Department of Homeland Security, and Related Efforts for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2003, and for other purposes.''\n  The first thing we find is $98 million under the Agriculture Research \nService, buildings and facilities, to complete a research center in \nAmes, IA.\n  What is that all about? How in the world do you call $98 million for \nan agricultural research service center in Ames, IA--remember, it is \ndesignated for Ames, IA, not Des Moines, IA; Ames, IA,--that fits into \na bill that is called ``making supplemental appropriations to support \nDepartment of Defense operations in Iraq, Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and Related Efforts for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2003.'' Disgraceful.\n  We have $1 million for the Jobs for America's Graduates school-to-\nwork program for at-risk young people. I am sure that is an important \nprogram. Someone will have to tell me how that is related to the title \nof this legislation.\n  There is $6.8 million from O Air Force to build and install \nfiberoptic and power improvements and upgrades at the 11th Air Force \nRange in Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska.\n  There is $3 million from O Army to build a rifle range for the \nSouth Carolina National Guard.\n  There is $12 million for research, development, test, and evaluation \nDefense-wide for airfield improvements in Alaska that may be \nassociated--may I emphasize: may be associated--with the ground-based \nmidcourse missile defense program.\n  There is requiring a study regarding delivery of pediatric health \ncare in northeastern Oklahoma.\n  There is $225,000 for the Mental Health Association of Tarrant \nCounty, TX.\n  There is $200,000 for the AIDS Research Institute at the University \nof California, San Francisco, for developing a county medical program \nto facilitate clinician exchange between the United States and \ndeveloping countries.\n\n  There is $1 million for the Geisinger Health System, Harrisburg, PA, \nto establish centers of excellence for the treatment of autism.\n  Why can't we, for once--for once--bring forward a bill--especially \nwhen we are at war, especially when we have young men and women \nfighting and dying--that is free of these outrageous kinds of spending? \nCan't we do that just once?\n  Well, now let's get to the $50 million for the title XI Maritime Loan \nProgram, which is the subject of the amendment.\n  Mr. President, chapter 10 of the bill would provide $50 million in \nfunding to the Maritime Administration's title XI loan guarantee \nprogram for shipbuilders and shipyards. It is not justified as part of \nan emergency supplemental to fund the ongoing war. Not only is the \nprogram riddled with problems, but the administration has proposed no \nfunding for it in either its fiscal year 2004 budget or for the prior \nyear, and for good reason. The title XI program does not serve any \ndefense or homeland security purpose, and it should not receive funding \nunder the guise of a wartime need.\n  I have never been a proponent of the Title XI program. I think that \nmany of my colleagues must be as shocked as I to learn that $50 million \nfor this program has been added to this emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill in the name of defense. The Appropriations' \nCommittee report accompanying this bill claims that this funding is \nneeded to help transport military equipment and supplies to deployed \nmilitary forces during the time of war. Such an allegation is simply \nnot true.\n  According the Maritime Administration, there are 51 vessels currently \nbeing utilized in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Only one \nof those 51 vessels was constructed with the use of a title XI loan \nguarantee. Any claims by the proponents of this mismanaged pork barrel \nprogram that it serves an essential military purpose are ridiculous.\n  The title XI program is, without question, one of the most wasteful \nand mismanaged guarantee programs in the Federal Government. Since \n1998, loan defaults--loan defaults--have totaled $490 million. On \nMonday of this week, the Department of Transportation's Office of \nInspector General released a report that details the multiple problems \nwith the program's administration.\n  The IG's report details the increasing number of loan defaults, \ncoupled with the increasing number of bankruptcies of companies that \nhave been granted loan guarantees. The report notes that Enron--Enron--\nhas three loan guarantees that will soon go under and cost the \ntaxpayers $122 million--Enron.\n  The DOT Inspector General found that ``MARAD needs to improve \nadministration and oversight in all phases of the Title XI loan process \n. . .'' The report says:\n\n       The financial interests of the United States would be \n     better protected through use\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\n     of compensatory loan provisions to reduce risk, improved loan \n     application review procedures, more rigorous financial \n     oversight of borrowers during the term of loan guarantees, \n     better monitoring and protection of vessels and shipyards \n     while under guarantee, and more effective stewardship of \n     assets acquired through foreclosures.\n\n  The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing next month to \nconsider the IG's findings, along with a report being prepared by the \nGeneral Accounting Office. I am informed that the GAO's preliminary \nfindings fully support the Department of Transportation IG's findings \nand provide even greater detail on missteps by MARAD that, again, have \nled to this program having suffered losses of nearly $500 million.\n  I close by reminding my colleagues of just how awry this program can \ngo when Congress jumps in without full and complete consideration of \nwhat is being done. In exchange for a Congressionally ordered monopoly \nfor service among the Hawaiian Islands, American Classic Voyages \nentered into a contract to build two cruise ships in a U.S. shipyard. \nIt is that requirement that has led to the most outrageous example of \nhow provisions inserted to benefit special interest can and often do \nlead to waste and burden American taxpayers.\n  To help push the program, MARAD, in the face of strong political \nsupport for the project, approved a $1.1 billion title XI loan \nguarantee for the construction of these two vessels. Loan guarantees \nand commitments to this company represented over one quarter of the \ntitle XI portfolio.\n  On October 19, 2001, American Classic Voyages filed a bankruptcy \npetition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The petition \nlisted total assets of $37.4 million and total liabilities of $452.8 \nmillion. The cruise line said in its petition that it had more than \n1,000 creditors, including the American taxpayers being represented by \nthe Department of Transportation.\n  MARAD never once sounded the alarm that this project was in trouble. \nIt did nothing to further protect the taxpayers' interest. To the \ncontrary, as noted by the DOT IG in its report, just weeks before \nAmerican Classic Voyages filed for bankruptcy, MARAD granted ACV \nadditional exemptions and modifications to the requirements of the \nprogram and their contract.\n  The failed project is the most costly loan guarantee ever granted \nunder the Maritime Loan Guarantee Program, resulting in the U.S. \nMaritime Administration paying out over $187.3 million of the American \ntaxpayers' money to cover the loan default for this project. Only $2 \nmillion was recovered from the sale of some of the construction \nmaterials and parts.\n  Overall, American Classic held a total of six loan guarantees that \ncost the American taxpayer $329 million.\n  I ask my colleagues to learn from this lesson. Fifty million dollars \nin MARAD guarantees on a bill like this is, first, wrong. And to \ncontinue to fund this program until it is fundamentally reformed, \naccording to the Department of Transportation's inspector general's \nreport and an upcoming GAO report, is a criminal waste of American tax \ndollars. It has no place on this bill.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I were talking, and I believe the best \nthing to do, given these projects I just listed, is probably to have \none amendment that we will propose tomorrow, Senator Kyl and myself, to \nstrike all of these provisions so we give everybody a chance to vote \nyes or no on all these provisions of the bill.\n  Then we can answer to the American taxpayer as to whether $98 million \nfor Agricultural Research Service building facilities; whether money \nfor the Mental Health Association of Tarrant County, TX; whether the \nGeisinger Health System in Harrisburg, PA, to establish centers of \nexcellence for the treatment of autism are what is needed to win the \nwar on terrorism and the war in Iraq today.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I find, in reviewing the report of the \nsubcommittee with jurisdiction over appropriations for the Department \nof Transportation, that $50 million is needed by the Maritime \nGuaranteed Loan Program. This is a program that provides subsidies for \nguaranteed loans for purchases of vessels built in U.S. shipyards and \nincludes the guarantee for facilities or equipment pertaining to marine \noperations related to any of those vessels.\n  The committee report contends that the program is critical for those \nwho transport military equipment and supplies to deployed military \nforces during time of war. There is currently only $1 million available \nin this account for pending and new loan guarantees. There are future \nmaritime projects also which can use these funds.\n  There is a critical need for auxiliary maritime sealift capacity \nduring time of war. This program has provided loan guarantees for \ncompanies that have ordered cargo ships which are available to serve as \na military auxiliary fleet to the Department of Defense during overseas \noperations. Without the funding in the committee recommendation, ship \nowners will not have access to this financing system which has proven \nto help sustain our Nation's commercial, energy transportation, and \nmilitary sealift needs.\n  I urge the Senate to reject the McCain amendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, Mr. Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again that I appreciate what \nSenator McCain does with this amendment and the effort he makes on a \nlot of these bills, to come to the floor with projects that are pretty \nhard to explain and justify. I know he is acting in good faith. I think \nhis amendment, sort of a wraparound amendment, is going to be a very \ninteresting one to hear discussed tomorrow.\n  Let me talk about title XI because I am sure he will not be surprised \nto hear me speak on it. I have supported the title XI program over the \nyears. It is an important program in helping to meet our national \nobjectives, our energy self-sufficiency, increase domestic commerce, \nstrengthen shipbuilding, our industrial base, and a large commercial \nfleet of militarily useful ships to meet DOD sealift requirements in \nour war on terrorism, the war we are involved in right now.\n  The point that Senator McCain made, that of the 51 ships that are \ncarrying cargo now and perhaps, I guess, some equipment, both liquid \nand dry cargo, 51 of them that are involved in the effort now in the \nwar in Iraq, only 1 of them had the title XI funds. In fact, probably \nif you check, you will find that most of those ships are foreign ships, \nships built in foreign shipyards. I suspect probably there are some \nDutch and German and, who knows, maybe even some French ships on which \nwe are dependent. Some of them have American flags and I guess are \ncrewed by American crews. That is all important.\n  But it is a tragedy in America if we don't have a maritime industry. \nWhen I go to the port in my hometown and look at the grain elevators \nand look at the ships hauling poultry products to Russia, there is no \nAmerican flag on those ships. It is Liberian, Panamanian, Ukrainian, \nRussian. It is everywhere in the world but the United States.\n  Is this program perfect? No. Should we try to make sure that it is \nrun better and we get more money for our investment? Yes. But I still \nhave a real trouble with a country such as the United States not having \nthe capability to build our own ships and be crewed with American \ncrews. More and more and more we are dependent on foreign ships.\n  There are good explanations for that. I guess the market is supposed \nto take care of those problems, but it is a danger. How many countries \nin the history of the world have survived very long without their own \nmerchant fleet? Our shipyards now are building Navy combatants \nbasically. That is it. No cruise ships, no cargo ships. We are getting \nout of the business. Maybe that is OK. But I think there is a danger \nthere.\n  We are dependent now on these maritime vessels to move cargo and \nequipment. Right now they are involved in what is going on in Iraq. \nThis program did not get any funds in fiscal year 2003. It is true the \nadministration didn't ask for additional funds. It did not receive any \nfunds in the omnibus bill. That is one of the reasons why it is badly \nneeded now. If we don't have some funds, they might have like $1 \nmillion in funds. There are no funds for the backlog in this area.\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\n  By the way, title XI is not so important to the big shipyards. The \nbig shipyards are not in this business. When they try to get into this \nbusiness, it doesn't work. The best example in the world, I guess, even \nthough it was a victim of timing, was the cruise ship situation.\n  Most of this money goes to the medium and small yards, and it is a \nloan program. Maybe it is not administered closely enough, and I \nacknowledge that. We need to understand what we are doing. If we don't \nfund it with this $50 million, or fund it in 2004, the program is dead. \nI think that is a mistake for our country.\n  I still believe we need our own merchant fleet. I hate to see all \nthose jobs lost--engineers and other workers--and go to the shipyards \naround the world. I still would like to think that those ships are on \ncall to America as American ships.\n  I understand that maybe this is not the right place for it, but there \nis a relationship to the war that is going on right now. It does affect \nour future ability to make sure we have our ships and crews on call \nthat can deliver the dry products, liquid products, and the equipment \naround the world.\n  So I urge defeat of this amendment. I reserve my right to look at the \npackage that Senator McCain may be offering later on this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield such time as I have remaining to the Senator from \nArizona, Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes 53 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support the Senator's amendment. One could \nmake an argument for this particular case, as the Senator from \nMississippi has just done. That argument should be made in a place and \na time that doesn't, however, attempt to take advantage of this funding \nresolution for the war.\n  The President sent up a request for funding for the war specifically, \nand Congress is responding to that in this legislation. By and large, \nthis legislation is directed specifically to that. What is perplexing \nto the other Senator from Arizona and I is why we have this handful--\njust a handful, six or seven--of items that have absolutely nothing to \ndo with the war, such as an agricultural research station at Iowa State \nUniversity, or mental health, autistic help, and others that have \nnothing whatsoever to do with this war effort. There may be a good case \nto be made for every one of these. And there is an appropriations \nprocess for that case to be made. So why are they being put on this \nbill at this time? It is not fair to all of those other people who can \nmake equally good cases for other things.\n  There are a lot of things that need to be done in an emergency way or \nwith timing as a factor. There are other provisions in the bill that \ndon't necessarily relate to the war, but don't cost any money, such as \na study for this, or a change in the language on something. We don't \nhave objection to that.\n  Our objection is taking advantage of this process for the expenditure \nof money on items that have nothing to do with the war. One of the \nreasons for it is because it only relates to a handful of projects, \nprimarily for people who happen to be on the Appropriations Committee. \nThat is not fair to the vast number of Members of this body who have \nequally good requests but don't happen to be in the room when the bill \nis put together.\n  That is why, as an ordinary proposition, these bills are presented to \nus on the floor clean. For those who are not familiar with the Senate \nprocess, that means without extraneous provisions, little pieces of \npork that specific Members add on. The reason for that is because we \ncan all trust the process from the Appropriations Committee to put out \na clean bill that supports the President's request to run the war.\n  I commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nchairman of the subcommittee. They have done a great job. That is \nalmost entirely what was done in this case. But for these few \nprovisions, which we will move to strike tomorrow because they don't \nbelong on the bill, if they can sustain themselves in debate and there \nreally is a good case for them, they will prevail through the ordinary \nprocess. If they cannot, they should be permitted to fall.\n  That is the reason we will urge support for the amendment when \noffered tomorrow and why I support the Senator's amendment this \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Mississippi to \ngrant me 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection to the additional time the Senator \nis requesting.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just say that, in consultation with \nSenator Kyl, and thinking about this, rather than force the Senate \nthrough a series of votes, this is an important piece of legislation. \nSo tomorrow I will be proposing an amendment that includes the \nprovisions that I described that I believe are extraneous and not \nrelated to this bill, as is stated in the title. I will include the $50 \nmillion for the MARAD loan guarantees.\n  Shortly, I will ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment \nbecause I will include it in the wraparound amendment that will be \nconsidered tomorrow on behalf of myself and Senator Kyl and, I hope, \nothers.\n  Let me finally say that I do believe the appropriators exercised \ngreat restraint. I congratulate the Senator from Alaska and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi. I believe this contains probably less unnecessary \nspending than any appropriations bill I have seen. Now I would like to \nsee if it is possible to send an entirely clean bill to the President \nof the United States, and that would be a monumental achievement.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 456, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. What was the request, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked to withdraw his amendment.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 462\n\n  (Purpose: To help the public against the threat of chemical attacks)\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, in a few minutes, I will send an \namendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Edwards and me. About a half \nhour ago, Senator Edwards talked about an issue that has been one of \nthe most serious concerns of mine and a whole host of Americans--about \nthe state of our security and the threat to the American people, which \nthey face by the potential of a terrorist attack on our Nation's \nchemical plants. There are literally thousands of chemical producers, \nrefineries, and similar facilities in the United States where chemicals \nreleased by any of these plants could kill or injure tens of \nthousands--and, frankly, even millions--of Americans through exposure \nto highly toxic gases. That is why these facilities are potentially so \nattractive to terrorists.\n  Unfortunately, there are no Federal security standards for chemical \nfacilities--none. So the private sector has been left to do as it sees \nappropriate on a completely voluntary basis. Far too many facilities \nsimply have not stepped up to accept the responsibility. There are a \nnumber of private companies that have done everything ever thought to \nbe necessary, but there are many that have been left out and keep \nvulnerabilities in front of the American people and are basically \nputting millions of Americans at risk.\n  I have a chart here that will show where--in red--these facilities \nare that put more than a million Americans at risk. There happens to be \n11 in my State of New Jersey. It is a serious issue. There is one of \nthose in the State of the Presiding Officer. But in a broad cross-\nsection of our country, there are huge numbers of these facilities \nlocated in highly populated areas.\n  According to the EPA there are 123 facilities in 24 States where a \nchemical release could expose more than 1 million people to highly \ntoxic chemicals.\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\n  There are 750 facilities in 39 States where chemical release can \nexpose more than 100,000 people to these chemicals. Those are the \nStates in yellow. There are 3,000 facilities spread across 49 of the 50 \nStates where chemical release could expose more than 10,000 people. \nFrankly, these are pretty staggering numbers, and I think it represents \na broad vulnerability across America.\n  The consequences of an attack on a chemical plant are potentially so \nhorrific that it is hard for me to understand or accept inaction in \nthis area. In fact, I would argue this body has been in sort of \npsychological denial, I guess, about this problem. If September 11 \ntaught us anything, it taught us that America can no longer avoid \nthinking about the unthinkable. We have to face up to the Nation's most \nserious vulnerabilities. We have to focus on them, and we have to \nconfront them head on.\n  Let me repeat one statistic. There are 123 chemical facilities around \nthe Nation that, if attacked, could threaten over 1 million American \nlives. This is a big deal in New Jersey. To bring this home in specific \nterms, there are 11 facilities in my home State, and one petrochemical \nplant in the middle of downtown Newark and south Carney that exposes \nnearly 8 million people in the greater New York-New Jersey region--8 \nmillion people potentially exposed to toxic fumes if there were a \nterrorist attack, a criminal attack, or, by the way, even if there was \na safety violation bringing about an explosion. We have had a number of \nthose incidents in my State that have taken lives just because of \nsafety considerations, let alone if the plants were under an attack by \na terrorist or criminal activity.\n  These facilities pose a serious threat to public safety because they \ncontain the kind of toxic chemicals that, if released, could cause \nthose injuries I am talking about--chemicals such as chlorine, ammonia, \nhydrogen fluoride, the types of chemicals that were used to manufacture \nthe bomb in Oklahoma City and the type of chemicals in Bhopal. There \nare all kinds of these chemicals in our cities, in our States, \nchemicals that serve very positive and important industrial functions \nbut could instantly be transformed into weapons of mass destruction at \nthe hands of terrorists.\n  This is not just my opinion. This is not an enviroview. This is not \nsome hyped-up point of view. It has been documented and acknowledged \ntime after time by experts and by the current administration.\n  Most recently, on March 18, the General Accounting Office issued a \nnew report on the matter. GAO found that chemical facilities may be \nattractive targets to terrorists because of the extent of harm they \ncould inflict. Yet, as GAO explained, there are no Federal laws \nrequiring chemical plants to assess vulnerabilities and to take action \nto guard against terrorist attacks.\n  I am going to submit a summary of the GAO report. For those who need \nthoughtful and systematic information about the vulnerabilities, about \nwhat is not being done, I suggest they read the whole report. I ask \nunanimous consent to print a brief summary of the GAO report in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Homeland Security--Voluntary Initiatives Are Under Way at Chemical \n     Facilities But the Extent of Security Preparedness Is Unknown\n\n\n                             what gao found\n\n       Chemical facilities may be attractive targets for \n     terrorists intent on causing economic harm and loss of life. \n     Many facilities exist in populated areas where a chemical \n     release could threaten thousands. EPA reports that 123 \n     chemical facilities located throughout the nation have toxic \n     ``worst-case'' scenarios where more than a million people in \n     the surrounding area could be at risk of exposure to a cloud \n     of toxic gas if a release occurred. To date, no one has \n     comprehensively assessed the security of chemical facilities.\n       No federal laws explicitly require that chemical facilities \n     assess vulnerabilities or take security actions to safeguard \n     their facilities from attack. However, a number of federal \n     laws impose safety requirements on facilities that may help \n     mitigate the effects of a terrorist-caused chemical release. \n     EPA believes that the Clean Air Act could be interpreted to \n     provide authority to require chemical facilities to assess \n     their vulnerabilities and to make security enhancements that \n     protect against attacks. However, EPA has not attempted to \n     use these Clean Air Act provisions because of concerns that \n     this interpretation would pose significant litigation risk \n     and has concluded that chemical facility security would be \n     more effectively addressed by passage of specific \n     legislation.\n       The federal government has not comprehensively assessed the \n     chemical industry's vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. \n     EPA, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department \n     of Justice have taken preliminary steps to assist the \n     industry in its preparedness efforts, but no agency monitors \n     or documents the extent to which chemical facilities have \n     implemented security measures. Consequently, federal, state, \n     and local entities lack comprehensive information on the \n     vulnerabilities facing the industry.\n       To its credit, the chemical industry, led by its industry \n     associations, has undertaken a number of voluntary \n     initiatives to address security at facilities. For example, \n     the American Chemistry Council, whose members own or operate \n     1,000, or about 7 percent, of the facilities subject to Clean \n     Air Act risk management plan provisions, requires its members \n     to conduct vulnerability assessments and implement security \n     improvements. The industry faces a number of challenges in \n     preparing facilities against attacks, including ensuring that \n     all chemical facilities address security concerns. Despite \n     the industry's voluntary efforts, the extent of security \n     preparedness at U.S. chemical facilities is unknown. Finally, \n     both the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Administrator \n     of EPA have stated that voluntary efforts alone are not \n     sufficient to assure the public of industry's preparedness.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, in addition to this GAO assessment, they \nrecommended the Department of Homeland Security and EPA, working \ntogether, develop a strategy, including a legislative proposal, to \naddress the threats of attacks on chemical plants. I listed the \nhighlights of their report which has a recommendation that there is a \nneed for legislation in this area. There is a need now to protect the \nAmerican people against chemical plant risks. The GAO report was \nreleased on March 18 of this year.\n  To continue with the acknowledgment that this is real, only a month \nearlier, the Department of Homeland Security, when it raised the \nNation's alert to code orange, sounded the alarm about the threat \nfacing chemical facilities. In its bulletin it sent out to State and \nlocal officials, the Department stated:\n\n       Al-Qaida operatives also may attempt to launch conventional \n     attacks against U.S. nuclear/chemical-industrial \n     infrastructure to cause contamination, disruption, and \n     terror. Based on information, nuclear powerplants and \n     industrial chemical plants remain viable targets.\n\n  That is from the Department of Homeland Security to all State and \nlocal officials: ``Chemical plants remain viable targets,'' and we have \nnot done anything. It is time to recognize that there is broad \nrecognition by the administration and by those who study this issue \nthat it is time to act. That was on February 12 of this year.\n  Let me go back to October 6 of last year. On that day, Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Ridge and EPA Administrator Whitman had a letter \npublished in the Washington Post. They stated in that letter:\n\n       The Bush administration is committed to reducing the \n     vulnerability of America's chemical facilities to terrorist \n     attack and is working to enact bipartisan legislation that \n     would require such facilities to address their \n     vulnerabilities.\n\n  They go on to say that while there have been good steps taken by \nprivate industry, there are over 15,000 chemical facilities nationwide \nthat contain large quantities of hazardous chemicals, and they must be \nrequired to take steps that mimic industry leaders in this area.\n  That letter was from Secretary Ridge and EPA Administrator Whitman \nlast October. I ask, Has the administration proposed such bipartisan \nlegislation? Have they proposed any legislation? Have they issued any \nregulations to address the threat facing chemical plants? Have they \neven proposed any such regulations? Have they done anything--anything \nat all--to meaningfully address the security threats facing chemical \nplants? I think the fair answer is no to each and every one of those \nquestions.\n  Periodically, we have seen press reports that the administration may \nbe working on some type of proposal, and I commend that effort. I hope \nthey will. But so far, they have shown no willingness to work on a \nbipartisan basis. I have sent letter after letter, question after \nquestion, made phone call after phone call, trying to enter into a \nnegotiation, not only with the\n\n[[Page S4696]]\n\nadministration, but the other side of the aisle, on this issue.\n  The bottom line is, a year and a half after the attacks of September \n11, there still has not been a serious response with regard to what we \nare doing here.\n  In fact, the Nation has known about this problem for a very long \ntime. The Department of Justice issued a report on this matter a year \nand a half before September 11. Let me read a brief excerpt from a \nsummary of that report which was issued on April 18, 2000:\n\n       We have concluded the risk of terrorists attempting in the \n     foreseeable future to cause an industrial chemical release is \n     both real and credible.\n\n  Again, April 18, 2000:\n\n       Terrorists or other criminals are likely to view the \n     potential of chemical release from an industrial facility as \n     a relatively attractive means of achieving these goals.\n\n  That report was issued before September 11. Its conclusion has been \nechoed by other Government agencies and in private studies with regard \nto vulnerabilities in our infrastructure.\n  I will not relate them all, but the warnings have been repetitive, \nfrom the Hart-Rudman Commission to the Department of Homeland Security \non February 12 when they issued their code orange alert.\n  While some companies may well be doing an outstanding job in securing \ntheir facilities, many are not. Simply relying on voluntary standards \njust is not working, and if we are going to protect America from the \nthreat of terrorist attacks on chemical facilities, we need to do more. \nThat is why in October 2001 I introduced the Chemical Security Act. \nThat is why I worked with Senators on both sides of the aisle to move \nthe legislation through the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nUltimately, the committee approved the legislation on a rollcall vote \nof 19 to 0. Not a single Senator voted no--not a single Senator.\n  The amendment I am offering today, along with my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards, is based on the \nlegislation that was approved by the committee on a 19-to-0 vote. \nHowever, we have made a few changes in good faith to make it more \nacceptable to industry and to win broader support.\n  The legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security and EPA \nto do three things: First, the Department has to identify high-priority \nchemical facilities, those that potentially put a large number of \npeople at risk.\n  Second, they must require those high-priority facilities to assess \ntheir vulnerabilities to develop and implement plans to improve \nsecurity and use safer technologies.\n  Third, these assessments and plans would have to be submitted for \nreview by the Department of Homeland Security. The changes could be \nrequired if deficiencies are identified. That is the amendment in a \nnutshell. It is a simple, commonsense approach that would establish \nstandards and ensure some balance at this time.\n  Last year, after my legislation was approved unanimously in \ncommittee, some in industry expressed concerns. Industry opposition \nultimately killed the bill, kept it from even coming up for debate on \nthis floor. Opposition to the bill was largely based on two points, \nboth of which I am going to try to address, with changes from what came \nout of committee.\n  First, opponents argued that the responsibility for overseeing \nchemical security should rest with the Department of Homeland Security \nrather than the Environmental Protection Agency. I proposed giving the \nresponsibility to EPA for a reason. They have the expertise on chemical \nplants. They have the expertise on dealing with these highly toxic \nchemicals. Under the Clean Air Act, they already have a requirement to \noversee. They have the expertise. DHS does not.\n  On the other hand, I recognized from the start that the EPA did not \nhave the expertise to evaluate security arrangements. So we originally \nasked the Department of Justice back in October of 2001--we have \nsubsequently changed that to the Department of Homeland Security--and \nnow we have put the Department of Homeland Security as the lead agency \nin charge of what has been requested by those in industry because they \nwanted security to be the primary element. So we have responded.\n  Having said that, I also acknowledge that in spite of EPA's \nexpertise, the latter was necessary. So in an effort to broaden support \nfor our proposal, we continue to modify and we reflect others' \nconcerns.\n  The second concern raised by industrial lobbyists about the bill, \nagain unanimously approved by the EPW Committee, focused on the bill's \nprovision to require businesses to shift to safer technologies, to the \nextent practical.\n  I will take a moment to explain why this provision was included and \nwhy it is so important. It is not just enough to put barbed wire on \nhigh fences around the place when some attacks could come over those \nwalls--planes and other things--which we have begun to understand can \nhappen post-September 11. We know no matter how high we build those \nwalls a committed terrorist can get to those facilities, and it becomes \nimportant to make sure the facilities are as safe as they possibly can \nbe without putting companies out of business. To truly protect the \npublic, we need to do more. We need to take steps to build in better \ninherent technology.\n  I have seen a great example of that in Washington, DC, as I think \nSenator Edwards mentioned, at the Blue Plains Sewage Treatment Plant. \nPrior to September 11, they were storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide in \ncar trains just across the river. Both are volatile, dangerous \nchemicals. If those tanks were attacked, a poisonous cloud could have \nbeen over Washington, DC. It would have been one of those places where \nroughly a million people could have been exposed--certainly hundreds of \nthousands, including the Capitol and the White House.\n  Business recognized this was a risk and did something about it. In \nfact, we should be quite proud of business taking an initiative on a \nvoluntary basis to address this problem. They changed from chlorine to \nsodium hypochlorite, which is a strong version of bleach but much \nsafer, less volatile. It is going to cost 25 to 50 cents a year for \nthose who drink water in the District, but I think it is a small price \nto pay to bring about the kind of safety considerations that the public \nand the community would expect. It sounds like a bargain to me.\n\n  To the extent practical, we need to find ways to move away from \ndangerous and toxic chemicals to other chemicals or other processes \nthat protect and make the processes safer. I understand it is an \nexpensive process. So what I have done in this amendment, as opposed to \nin the original bill, is I have offered economic incentives and \neconomic support to those companies that transform to safer \ntechnologies. For those businesses that need help, I have put $50 \nmillion into this bill to make that process better. So we have a second \nelement that really has tried to accommodate some of the concerns that \npeople had in this regard and how onerous it might be.\n  We have a problem. We have some obvious steps to deal with it and we \nhave tried to get the private sector to move in a direction that will \nenhance both the security and bring about safer technologies that will \nprotect people.\n  So that is it. I think it is an extremely important initiative that \nneeds to be taken in the context of the homeland security efforts that \nare included in this supplemental. I hope people will take this \nseriously, as Senator Edwards, Senator Jeffords and others have, as 19 \nSenators in EPW did when we voted on this after much review and \ndiscussion.\n  I am eager to work with the administration. I am eager to work with \nthose on the other side of the aisle to make sure we have an initiative \nto protect our chemical plants, which is really about protecting the \nAmerican people. I hope we can move to this goal. This should be one of \nthe No. 1 steps we have in this process.\n  I send the amendment to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator \nEdwards and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine], for himself, and \n     Mr. Edwards, proposes an amendment numbered 462.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S4697]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CORZINE. Again, I urge my colleagues, before we have a chance to \nvote on this amendment in the coming days, to sit down and look at this \nin a serious minded way, knowing that we have addressed some of the \nproblems and that we can move forward to have a positive embracing of \nreal steps to protect the American people from exposure we have to \nchemical plants.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I deeply regret that as manager of the \nbill I am constrained to make a point of order that the Senator's \namendment violates rule XVI and that it is legislation on an \nappropriations bill. It is a totally new title, and while we do have \nsome clauses that might be legislation, we have not accepted any bills \nas such. I make a point of order under rule XVI that it is legislation \non an appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is prepared to rule. The amendment \ndoes constitute legislation on an appropriations bill. The point of \norder is sustained.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered in order notwithstanding rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am informed there is a modification of \nthe Allard amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the Allard amendment be \nreplaced by the modification--a total substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 451), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 89, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\nTITLE V--PANEL TO REVIEW SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AT UNITED STATES \n                           AIR FORCE ACADEMY\n\n     SEC. 501.

I ask that we consider the Allard amendment as pending \nbefore the Senate and it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 451), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Snowe \nand Senator Bennett, I am offering an amendment to the FY2003 \nSupplemental Appropriations bill in order to make available an \nadditional $1 billion in government guaranteed loans to small \nbusinesses.\n  Let me make clear to my colleagues that we are not requesting \nadditional money for the Small Business Administration. This amendment \nis technical, clarifying a provision enacted as part of the Conference \nReport to H.J. Res. 2, the FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations Act. It \nclarifies that Congress intends that the SBA to use a more accurate \nmethod--known in the technical terms as an econometric model--to \nestimate the cost of all small business loans authorized under Section \n7(a) of the Small Business Act of FY2003.\n  Right now the SBA is only using the new method to estimate the cost \nof ``regular'' 7(a) loans, treating differently 7(a) loans--known as \nSupplemental Terrorist Activity Relief (STAR) Loans--made to small \nbusiness victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This inconsistently \naffects the overall program by leaving it short on lending dollars at \ntime when demand for loans through the SBA's flagship loan program is \nup 38 percent. If the SBA will use the new, more accurate method to \ncalculate STAR loans, it will mitigate the shortfall by making \navailable an additional $1.2 billion in loans to small businesses. This \namendment clarifies the SBA's authority to do this.\n  I thank Senator Hollings, Gregg, Byrd and Stevens for their help on \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am advised by the majority leader, with the consent of \nthe minority leader, there will be no more votes tonight. We expect a \nseries of votes in the morning, and we urge Senators to let us know if \nthere are any amendments that have been hinted at, to let us know if \nthey intend to raise them tomorrow.\n  We expect a full day tomorrow, and we hope to finish this bill \ntomorrow night. I thank all Members for their courtesy and \nconsideration and yield to my friend from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S4698]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I confirm that the Democratic leader has said he believes \nit is very important to finish this bill tomorrow. That way, we can \nconference this and have the bill on the President's desk before we \ntake a break for Easter. As we know, this is wartime and we need to \nfinish this legislation as quickly as we can. We are going to do \neverything within our power on this side, and I know the Senator from \nAlaska will do everything on his side, to move this along.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Nevada. He is very cooperative \nand very much aware of the problems dealing with the floor from his own \nexperience, and I appreciate his help on this bill no end.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues on the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources in clarifying the portrayal \nof the military contributions of three island nations with which the \nUnited States has a unique political relationship referred to as free \nassociation: the Republic of the Marshall Islands, RMI, Federated \nStates of Micronesia, FSM, and Palau. Last week an article in The \nWashington Post entitled ``White House Notebook: Many Willing, But Few \nAre Able'' referenced the military contributions of the Freely \nAssociated States, FAS, in a droll and flippant manner. Regrettably, \nthis poorly researched attempt at wit missed its mark. I want to set \nthe record straight.\n  The Compact of Free Association between the United States and these \nstrategic Pacific island nations serves our national security interests \nin the Pacific region by providing the U.S.\n\n[[Page S4699]]\n\nstrategic denial in the region. While title I of the Compact of Free \nAssociation recognizes that the peoples of the FSM and RMI are self-\ngoverning and retain authority over their internal affairs, it mandates \nconsultation with the United States on any defense and security \nmatters. In addition, FAS citizens may volunteer in the U.S. Armed \nForces, and FAS citizens who reside in the U.S. under the compact's \nprovisions are subject to our Selective Service laws, and in the event \nof the return of conscription, could be drafted for military duty.\n  There are hundreds of FAS citizens currently serving in the U.S. \nmilitary, including a number of soldiers assigned to the 101st Airborne \nDivision and 3rd Infantry Division, Mechanized, currently deployed to \nKuwait and Iraq in support of our military efforts. FAS citizens have \nserved in the U.S. military for decades, and have participated in \ncombat in every major U.S. engagement since the Korean war. Given the \nsmall populations of the island nations, almost every citizen has a \nrelative or friend currently serving in the U.S. military, including \nFSM President Leo Falcam, whose son is a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. \nMarine Corps.\n  I have worked with FAS citizens for a number of years. I have visited \nthese islands and have worked with my colleagues to successfully \naccomplish the goals of the Compact of Free Association. I applaud the \npatriotism of these soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, as well as \ntheir families, who are volunteering to defend our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4699-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of our \nNation's greatest public servants: Daniel Patrick Moynihan. As a \nprofessor, as an advisor to four presidents, and through 24 years in \nthe Senate, he lent us the wisdom of his experience, the insights of \nhis keen mind, and above all, the honor of his friendship.\n  Senator Moynihan's example reminds all of us of what a Senator was \nintended to be. He was a leader who not only addressed the needs of his \nState, but who wrestled with the challenges facing the Nation. Senator \nMoynihan was a great servant to the people of New York. But the legacy \nof accomplishments he leaves reaches beyond New York's borders to touch \nthe lives of every American.\n  With a brilliant intellect and an unwavering dedication, Senator \nMoynihan helped us to think through some of the toughest issues before \nthis body, from welfare reform to tax policy. He worked to return \nsecrecy to its limited but necessary role in government, an effort \nwhich I applaud, and an effort which we should continue to maintain \neven in times of national crisis. Especially right now with our Nation \nat war, I know we all miss Senator Moynihan's keen grasp of \ninternational relations, his ability to put world events into a \nhistorical context, and his talent to tell us where they will lead us.\n  Senator Moynihan's lifetime of public service, his wisdom and \nexperience, were a wonderful gift to this body. I know my colleagues \njoin me in my admiration for Senator Moynihan as a public servant, my \nrespect for him as a colleague, and my appreciation for him as a \nfriend. It was a distinct honor for me to serve with Senator Moynihan \nsince I came to this body in 1993. My deepest sympathies go out to Liz \nMoynihan and the rest of Senator Moynihan's family and friends.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4699-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in September \n2000, at Fort Jackson, SC. Ronald Chapman was physically assaulted by \nother soldiers after a drill sergeant called Chapman a ``faggot.'' He \nwas sleeping in his bed when soldiers entered the room and beat him up \nwith blankets filled with bars of soap. Chapman feared for his safety \nafter the beating, and felt compelled to tell his superior officers \nthat he was gay.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4699-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PASSING OF GOVERNOR TAUESE SUNIA\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise today \nto inform my colleagues of the passing of a great leader in the Pacific \nIslands, Gov. Tauese Pita Fiti Sunia, who died on Wednesday, March 26, \n2003, en route to Honolulu from Apia, Samoa. Governor Sunia was a dear \nfriend and Millie and I join the people of Samoa, Hawaii's Samoan \ncommunity, and Samoans throughout the United States in sending our \ndeepest sympathy and condolences to his wife Fagaoalii Satele Sunia, as \nwell as his family, including his 10 children, and many grandchildren.\n  Governor Sunia was an educator. He earned a master's degree in \neducational administration from the University of Hawaii, and spent \nmany years as a teacher, educational television instructor, and \nadministrator. Governor Sunia also served as vice president of the \nAmerican Samoa Community College and territorial director of Education. \nOne of his top priorities was to make sure that every child in Samoa \nwas computer literate, and he worked hard towards his goal of ensuring \nthat every school in American Samoa had a computer room with Internet \naccess.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting and visiting with Governor Sunia on a \nnumber of occasions during his visits to Washington, DC, and Honolulu, \nand during my visits to American Samoa. He was an immensely engaging \nand congenial man, and our official meetings frequently departed from \nthe agenda to discussions of Polynesian history, anthropology, and the \nNative Hawaiian and Samoan cultures. In 1997, Senator Frank Murkowski, \nwho was chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and I \nvisited American Samoa. We met with Governor Sunia and heard about his \nefforts to bring economic development and opportunities to Samoa. We \nwere able to exchange ideas and assist him at the Federal level to \nbolster the local economy. Whether the issue was economic development, \nlocal agriculture, or educational opportunities for Samoan youth, \nGovernor Sunia worked hard on behalf of the people of American Samoa. \nHe understood the importance of balancing the preservation of culture \nwith maximizing opportunities for American Samoa in today's global \neconomy.\n  Governor Sunia was well respected not only in American Samoa, but in \nthe Pacific Basin. He was also a man with a strong and abiding faith. \nHe was deacon, vice chairman, and chairman of the Congregational \nChristian Church in American Samoa, and worked for both the spiritual \nand temporal well-being of the Samoan people. He cared deeply for all \nPacific islanders, and we will all truly miss him. Well done, good and \nfaithful servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4699-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4699-S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we celebrate National Women's History \nMonth during this time of war, I rise to pay tribute to the \nextraordinary women, past and present, who have served this country \nselflessly and courageously in the armed services.\n  Over 20 years ago, my distinguished colleagues, Senator Barbara \nMikulski and Senator Orrin Hatch, cosponsored legislation that first \nestablished the National Women's History Week. I salute my colleagues \nfor their leadership in establishing this now month-long celebration of \nwomen and their many contributions.\n  This year's theme for National Women's History Month is ``Women \nPioneering the Future.'' As we anxiously await a safe and swift end to \nthe war in Iraq, it seems appropriate to honor and remember the \npioneering women of the armed services. Today it is common, and perhaps \nunremarkable, to see women serving in a variety of capacities in the \nPersian Gulf. As a result, it\n\n[[Page S4700]]\n\nis easy to forget that at one time the women who served this country in \nevery major military conflict were unwanted and ill-treated.\n  During the Revolutionary War, women were prohibited from enlisting in \nthe Continental Army, but that did not stop many women from following \ntheir husbands to war where they served as cooks and nurses. One brave \nwoman, Margaret Corbin, took over her fallen husband's cannon at the \nBattle of Fort Washington. During the battle she was wounded and taken \nprisoner by the British. On July 6, 1779, Mrs. Corbin became the first \nwoman to be awarded a Federal pension for being wounded in battle.\n  During the American Civil War, hundreds of women disguised themselves \nas men in order to serve in the Union and Confederate Armies. Many \nwomen were never discovered and most were not discovered until they \nwere wounded or found dead on the battlefield. One woman enlisted in \nthe 95th Illinois Infantry as Albert Cashier. Under the guise of a 19-\nyear-old Irish immigrant, she served for 4 years, participating in \nalmost 40 battles.\n  Following the Spanish American War, where more than 1,500 women were \ncontracted to serve as nurses, the Army Nurse Corps of 1901 and the \nNavy Nurse Corp of 1908 were created, making women official members of \nthe military for the first time. Twenty contract nurses died in service \nduring the Spanish-American War and over 400 nurses died in the line of \nduty during World War I.\n  In addition to serving as nurses, during World War I, women were \nenlisted in the Navy and the Marine Corps to serve as stenographers and \ntypists. In addition to these 12,185 female Yeomen, 230 women were \nhired by the Army to serve in France as bilingual telephone operators. \nThese ``Hello Girls'' routed messages between headquarters and the \nfront lines. Despite the great service of the women of World War I, \nCongress soon took action to close the loopholes that had allowed women \nto serve in the military.\n  Decades later, in order to meet the huge demands of World War II, all \nfour services of the military formed women's components which were to \nlast ``for the duration of the emergency and six months.'' Four hundred \nthirty two military women were killed in that war and 88 became \nprisoners of war. Sixty-six Army nurses endured an incredible 33 months \nat the Santo Tomas prison camp in the Philippines.\n  Finally, in 1948, women achieved permanent status in the Army, Navy, \nAir Force, and Marine Corps, when President Truman signed the Women's \nArmed Services Integration Act of 1948. Unfortunately, that act \nrestricted the number of women who could enlist and the award of \npromotions. Despite these restrictions, many thousands of women have \nserved in a variety of capacities during the major military conflicts \nin Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf.\n  In fact, according to the Department of the Navy, the deployment of \nwomen in the Persian Gulf was ``highly successful.'' More than 37,000 \nwomen served as administrators, air traffic controllers, logisticians, \nengineer equipment mechanics, ammunition technicians, ordinance \nspecialists, communicators, radio operators, drivers, law enforcement \nspecialists, and guards during Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Tragically, \nduring that conflict, 5 women were killed in action, 21 were wounded in \naction, 2 were taken as prisoners of war, and 4 Marine women received \nthe Combat Action Ribbon.\n  Today, women make up about 15 percent of the military and nearly 85 \npercent of all positions and occupations in the military are available \nto active-duty women. The progress that has been made in opening \nmilitary service to the women of the United States is no doubt a \nreflection of the incredible service records of the pioneering women \nsoldiers who have served this country since the Revolutionary War.\n  One such pioneering woman is National Women's History Month Honoree, \nBG Wilma L. Vaught. General Vaught grew up in rural Scotland, IL, and \nattended the University of Illinois. After college and some time spent \nin the corporate world, she joined the Air Force, in part, because of \nthe opportunity it offered for managerial advancement.\n  While serving in the Air Force, General Vaught achieved several \n``firsts'': first female Air Force officer to attend the Industrial \nCollege of the Armed Forces, first woman to command a unit that \nreceived the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, first woman promoted to \nBrigadier General in the comptroller career field, and the first and \nonly woman to serve as president of the board of directors of the \nPentagon Federal Credit Union. In addition, General Vaught is one of \nthe most highly decorated women in history. It was my honor to meet \nGeneral Vaught several years ago and feature her on my monthly cable \ntelevision show.\n  This March, as the Nation prays for the safe return of our soldiers \nin Iraq, let us remember the incredible contributions that women like \nBG Wilma Vaught have made in service of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4700-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF SAM H. JONES\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise \ntoday to honor the life of my friend, Sam H. Jones, who passed away on \nMarch 26, 2003 after 3-year battle with leukemia. Sam was a pioneer of \ncivil rights who dedicated his life to building a community of equality \nwhere people of all races, religions, and backgrounds could have a \nstake in the American dream. He was a soft-spoken man yet he had a \ncommanding presence that gave him the power to bring people of diverse \nbackgrounds together in order to achieve great things.\n  While serving as the president of the Indianapolis Urban League for \nthe past 36 years, Sam Jones worked to build bridges across tumultuous \nwaters of racism, helping to ensure economic prosperity, equal \nopportunity in education, and improved police relations for African \nAmericans and other minorities in the Indianapolis area. Sam championed \nissues ranging from suicide prevention to economic development. He was \nnever afraid to explore new policy areas or to take an unpopular or \nunorthodox approach to solving problems. For these reasons, he was one \nof the most respected leaders in our community.\n  Born in Heidelberg, MS in 1929, Sam saw segregation in its most \nbrutal form at a young age, which profoundly impacted him. He did not \nhold grudges. Instead, he took action to effect positive change, \nworking with those whom he opposed, not against. Sam was known for his \nability to calm opposing sides in difficult situations in order to \nreach compromise. This attitude helped him to build many strong \npartnerships and lifelong friendships.\n  In 1966 Sam Jones cofounded the Indianapolis Urban League and served \nas its president and CEO until last December. He built the organization \nin Indianapolis from the ground up, starting his work in a small motel \nroom, and 36 years later, opening a $3 million Indiana Avenue \nheadquarters. The new building bears his name, and rightly so; Sam was \nthe heart and soul of the Indianapolis Urban League and was widely \nconsidered the dean of all 112 chapters of the national organization.\n  Sam Jones was a truly unique leader and humanitarian whose shoes will \nbe difficult, if not impossible, to fill. For this reason, the sense of \nloss to all those who knew him in the city of Indianapolis, the State \nof Indiana, and the Nation, is tremendous. He will be greatly missed by \nhis family and close friends, to whom he was extremely dedicated. He is \nsurvived by his wife, Prethenia, and their children, Marya Overby, Sam \nH. Jones, Jr., and the Rev. Michael Jones.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Sam H. Jones into the \nCongressional Record. As Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: ``The hope \nof a secure and livable world lies with disciplined nonconformists who \nare dedicated to justice, peace and brotherhood.'' The world has been \nleft a better place because Sam Jones lived his life based on that \nprinciple.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4700-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4700-S4701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING LEXIS-NEXIS\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH.

For the \nsecond consecutive year, UPS is the recipient of this distinguished \nindustry award.\n  One element specifically praised by the council was UPS's Supplier \nDiversity Program. This exceptional program was formally launched in \n1992 as a way of promoting business opportunities through UPS contracts \nto companies either owned by minorities or women. Contracts with the \n25,000 businesses included in this program vary from legal services and \nadvertising to computers and uniforms.\n  Late last year, UPS completed a $1 billion expansion of the UPS \nWorldport facility at the Louisville International Airport located in \nLouisville, KY.

On April 4, 2003, faculty, \nstudents, and members of the community will gather to commemorate not \nonly U of D Jesuit's achievements in education, but also its commitment \nto the community of Detroit.\n  For 125 years, the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and \nAcademy has provided expanding educational opportunities to a wide \narray of students across the Detroit metropolitan area. Since its \nfounding in 1877, U of D Jesuit has continually increased its academic \nofferings to students. The school added an academy serving seventh and \neighth grade students in 1973 and is now known as one of Michigan's \npremier private college preparatory schools.\n  In 1977, U of D Jesuit made the critical decision to remain in \nDetroit. Despite pressure from teachers and alumni to move the school \nout of the city, the Jesuits in Rome urged the school to remain in \nDetroit to continue pursuing their mission of justice in education. \nSince then, U of D Jesuit has strived to offer its students a rich \nmulticultural environment while also providing a challenging and \nmeaningful educational experience. The diversity that now exists within \nthe school is both an incredible asset and an essential component of \nits character.\n  Today, U of D Jesuit offers its students excellent educational \nopportunities while teaching them the importance of diversity and \ncommitment to their community. The student body at U of D Jesuit draws \nfrom nearly 70 different communities in the Detroit metropolitan area. \nStudents come from a variety of religious and cultural backgrounds, yet \nthey all share the common goal of improving their school and community. \nThe University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy truly \ndemonstrates an unwavering commitment to shaping young men into ``Men \nfor Others.''\n  I am pleased to join with my colleagues in the Senate in offering my \ndeepest congratulations to the University of Detroit Jesuit High School \nand Academy as they celebrate 125 years of commitment to the Detroit \narea and excellence in education.

We are pleased to be joined in this effort by the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch.\n  Two years ago, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-517), and \nbefore that in 1998, P.L. 105-181, which we were privileged to \nintroduce. Since its inception in 1999, this highly successful \nDepartment of Justice grant program has provided law enforcement \nofficers in 16,000 jurisdictions with nearly 500,000 vests.\n  There are far too many law enforcement officers who patrol our \nstreets and neighborhoods without the proper protective gear against \nviolent criminals. Each year, on average, more than 60 law enforcement \nofficers are killed by gunfire in the line of duty. The felonious use \nof guns and the increased use of larger caliber handguns and assault \nrifles has created an even greater risk for law enforcement officers \nand an increasing need for higher threat level, better quality, and \nmore comfortable vests that can be worn in a variety of circumstances. \nThe use of body armor to provide protection against the use of deadly \nforce and assaults as well as its demonstrated value in protecting \nofficers involved in vehicle accidents, provides compelling reasons for \nofficers to be equipped with and to wear body armor.\n\n  In 2002, 149 Federal, State and local law enforcement officers gave \ntheir lives in the line of duty, well below the decade-long average of \n165 deaths annually, and a major drop from 2001 when a total of 230 \nofficers were killed. A number of factors contributed to this reduction \nincluding the availability of better equipment and the increased use of \nbullet-resistant vests.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face every day on the front lines, protecting our \ncommunities. Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who serve this \nnation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great personal \nrisk. Every year, about 1 in 15 officers is assaulted, 1 in 46 officers \nis injured, and 1 in 5,255 officers is killed in the line of duty \nsomewhere in America every other day. There are few communities in this \ncountry that have not been impacted by the words ``officer down.''\n  The evidence is clear that a bulletproof vest is one of the most \nimportant pieces of equipment that any law enforcement officer can \nhave. Since the introduction of modern bulletproof material, the lives \nof more than 2,700 officers have been saved by bulletproof vests. In \nfact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has concluded that officers \nwho do not wear bulletproof vests are 14 times more likely to be killed \nby a firearm than those officers who do wear vests. Simply put, \nbulletproof vests save lives.\n  Unfortunately, many police departments do not have the resources to \npurchase vests on their own, especially in America's smaller \ncommunities. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003 would \ncontinue the partnership with State and local law enforcement agencies \nto make sure that every police officer who needs a bulletproof vest \ngets one. It would do so by continuing to authorize up to $50 million \nper year for the grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice. \nIn addition, the program provides 50-50 matching grants to State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies and Indian tribes with under 100,000 \nresidents to assist in purchasing bulletproof vests and body armor.\n  While we know that there is no way to end the risks inherent to a \ncareer in law enforcement, we must do everything possible to ensure \nthat officers who put their lives on the line every day also put on a \nvest. Body armor is one of the most important pieces of equipment an \nofficer can have and often means the difference between life and death. \nThe United States Senate can help, and I urge our colleagues to support \nprompt passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 764\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in the Jacksonville, \nFlorida, metropolitan area; to the Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is a central element of our \nnational character to pay solemn tribute to the service of those who \nhave worn the uniform of our Armed Forces and placed themselves in \nharm's way to defend our freedom and way of life. We raise monuments to \nthe deeds of our great wartime leaders as well as the countless, often \nnameless heroes of those battles fought throughout our history. We also \nset aside special days to remember the sacrifice of generations of \nAmericans who have stepped forward in America's defense.\n  This Nation also sets aside special places, hallowed ground, where we \nlay to rest those who have served us in our hour of greatest need. Our \nNational Cemetery system is not only hallowed ground, National \nCemeteries are monuments to military service, the places where we go on \nthose special days to pay tribute to the sacrifice of so many in our \nhistory. National Cemeteries remind us of where we have been as a \nNation, and inspires future generations to uphold the legacy of our \nveterans' devotion and sacrifice.\n  Today I offer legislation to establish a National Cemetery near \nJacksonville, Florida to meet the needs of thousands of veterans who \nhave chosen to live out their lives in Northeast Florida and Southeast \nGeorgia. Florida's veteran population is the second largest in the \nNation. Right now in Northern Florida and Southern Georgia, there are \nnearly half-a-million veterans. Florida has the Nation's oldest veteran \npopulation and one of the largest remaining populations of World War II \nveterans. We are all aware that this greatest of generations is passing \naway at higher and higher rates.\n  Unfortunately for these hundreds of thousands of veterans in Florida \nand Georgia, the nearest National Cemetery is located in Bushnell, FL, \nwhich is a three-hour drive from Jacksonville. The National Cemetery in \nSt. Augustine is full and closed. The nearest National Cemetery in \nGeorgia is in Marietta just north of Atlanta.\n  Our veterans have defended our country in her days of peril, and \ncertainly deserve to rest in honored respect in a National Cemetery. To \nmeet our obligations to the veterans of Northeast Florida and Southeast \nGeorgia, we must act now, in order to have this facility established by \n2006 when our World War II veterans' deaths are expected to reach their \npeak.\n  I am proud to sponsor this important bill, and look forward to the \nsupport of my colleagues as we provide for our veterans who have given \nso much for our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 766\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish, in accordance with chapter 24 of title 38, United \n     States Code, a national cemetery in the Jacksonville, \n     Florida, metropolitan area to serve the needs of veterans and \n     their families.\n       (b) Consultation in Selection of Site.--Before selecting \n     the site for the national cemetery established under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with--\n       (1) appropriate officials of the State of Florida and local \n     officials of the Jacksonville metropolitan area; and\n       (2) appropriate officials of the United States, including \n     the Administrator of General Services, with respect to land \n     belonging to the United States in that area that would be \n     suitable to establish the national cemetery under subsection \n     (a).\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the establishment of the national cemetery under \n     subsection (a). The report shall set forth a schedule for \n     such establishment of the national cemetery and an estimate \n     of the costs associated with such establishment of the \n     national cemetery.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Miller, \n        and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 767. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe increase in the tax on social security benefits; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my friend and \ncolleague Senator Bayh of Indian, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will repeal a ten year old tax increase on our senior citizens. We \nare joined by Sens. Chambliss, Miller, and Warner. This tax increase \nwas passed in 1993 and has been an onerous and unjust tax on the Social \nSecurity benefits of America's seniors.\n  I am pleased to have the support of the following organizations for \nthis important legislation: United Seniors Association, National \nTaxpayers Union, The Seniors Coalition, Americans for Tax Reform, The \n60 Plus Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   United Seniors Association,\n\n                                      Fairfax, VA, March 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Evan Bayh,\n     Senate Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Senate Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of United Seniors Association's \n     1.5 million-plus nationwide grassroots network, we \n     enthusiastically support your legislation, the Social \n     Security Tax Equity Act of 2003.\n       For over a decade, United Seniors Association has led the \n     charge to eliminate all taxes on Social Security benefits. \n     Your legislation will substantially lift financial burdens \n     from millions of Seniors and I commend you for your \n     leadership.\n       Before 1984, no one paid federal income taxes on their \n     Social Security benefits. President Clinton signed the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which raised to 85 \n     percent the amount of Social Security benefits subject to \n     income taxes. Each year since 1993, more and more Seniors \n     have been hit by this Seniors-only tax. Proponents of the tax \n     hike maintained that it would only affect ``rich Seniors.'' \n     However, that was not true. The tax has hit Seniors with \n     moderate incomes most heavily.\n       The taxation of benefits is confusing, unfair, and makes \n     middle class Seniors pay higher marginal tax rates than many \n     millionaires. Every year, more Seniors feel the tax pinch \n     because the income thresholds are not indexed for inflation. \n     Over 9 million Seniors now pay this unfair tax. This tax is \n     not only bad policy, but it is a disincentive for continuing \n     a productive work-life after age 65.\n       Again, we applaud both of you for your efforts. United \n     Seniors Association stands ready to help you pass this \n     important piece of legislation not only for Seniors, but for \n     their children, and their grandchildren.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles W. Jarvis,\n     Chairman and Chief Executive.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Evan Bayh,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bayh: On behalf of our 335,000 \n     members, the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) strongly \n     supports, in addition to the urgently needed tax relief \n     contained in the President's plan (S. 2 by Senators Nickles \n     and Miller), your proposed legislation to repeal the 1993 \n     imposed upon Social Security recipients. While NTU would \n     prefer the repeal of all taxes on Social Security benefits, \n     we are pleased to endorse your proposal as a good first step.\n       As you know, prior to 1993, seniors paid taxes on half of \n     their Social Security benefits if their combined income \n     exceeded certain levels. In 1993 the taxable portion of \n     Social Security benefits was increased to 85% for individuals \n     with income exceeding $34,000 and couples with incomes \n     exceeding $44,000. This punishing level of taxation applies \n     to almost a fourth of all Social Security recipients. It \n     penalizes seniors who choose to save their money or keep \n     working. For many seniors, just as in the case of dividend \n     income, this taxation is clearly double taxation.\n       Again, in addition to the critical need for the Senate to \n     pass the ``Jobs and Growth Act of 2003,'' we would urge your \n     Senate colleagues to pass your repeal of the 1993 tax on \n     Social Security benefits as an important first step on the \n     road to total repeal of all such taxes on Social Security \n     income for retirees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Al Cors, Jr.,\n                               Vice President, Government Affairs.\n\n[[Page S4706]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                        The Seniors Coalition,\n\n                                  Springfield, VA, March 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Gordon H. Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Evan Bayh\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith & Bayh: On behalf of our four million \n     senior members and supporters nationwide, I commend you for \n     introducing the Social Security benefits that unfairly \n     targets seniors and results in a disincentive for them to \n     work, invest and save. We likewise applaud you for your \n     commitment to a more equitable and nondiscriminatory tax \n     system for older Americans.\n       As you know, Congress passed a law in 1983 that required \n     Social security beneficiaries to pay taxes on 50 percent of \n     their benefits when they exceeded certain income levels. In \n     1993, Congress increased the threshold to 85 percent of \n     Social Security benefits for single retirees with income \n     above $34,000 and for couples with income over $44,000. Since \n     Social Security taxes are only 50 percent deductible (the \n     employer's share), and seniors have already paid taxes on \n     their payroll tax contribution, they are currently taxed \n     twice when they pay taxes on more than 50 percent of \n     benefits.\n       Seniors have spent a lifetime saving and investing in \n     America in order to enjoy financial independence and security \n     in retirement and to accrue assets for their children. Sadly, \n     however, the double tax on Social Security punishes years \n     spent exercising financial discipline. Worse yet, this tax \n     ultimately forces seniors to limit their non-Social Security \n     income or face the financial burdens it imposes at certain \n     levels of earned and investment income.\n       While this double tax on Social Security clearly targets \n     seniors, our entire society bears an incalculable economic \n     penalty as an experienced and knowledgeable senior workforce \n     opts to sit on the sidelines rather than work and invest for \n     substandard returns. In the midst of this current economic \n     downturn, America would greatly benefit from the faithful \n     investment practices and the productive work habits of its \n     senior citizens.\n       Your bill would put an end to the unfair and discriminatory \n     practice of double taxation of seniors' Social Security \n     benefits and encourage senior Americans to continue \n     contributing to the nation's growth. We therefore strongly \n     support the ``Social Security Tax Equity Act of 2003'' and \n     are ready to assist you in securing its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mary M. Martin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Americans for Tax Reform,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Smith: On behalf of Americans for Tax \n     Reform (ATR), I want to thank you for introducing the Social \n     Security Tax Equity Act of 2003. ATR pledges full support for \n     this critically important legislation.\n       As you know, the 1993 Clinton tax increase levied on Social \n     Security was on attack on senior citizens and workers. Worker \n     payroll contributions finance Social Security benefits. Yet \n     the benefits that senior citizens receive are again taxed--a \n     second time--if these citizens have incomes above a threshold \n     amount. This is an unjust form of double taxation and it must \n     be eliminated.\n       Before the 1993 tax increase, single retirees with incomes \n     above $25,000 and $32,000 for couples paid taxes on half of \n     Social Security benefits. The 1993 increase, however, raised \n     the threshold income for single retirees to $34,000 and \n     $44,000 for couples. The increase also imposed levies on 85 \n     percent of Social Security benefits--a 35 percent increase on \n     benefits. Roughly a quarter of Social Security recipients now \n     pay higher taxes.\n       ATR is encouraged by your bold leadership to roll back this \n     unfair form of double taxation. Repealing the 1993 tax \n     increase will yield economic benefits that will grow our \n     economy and reward productive behavior. We applaud your \n     effort to fight for working men and women and especially for \n     our elderly citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n     Grover Norquist.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The 60 Plus Association,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon H. Smith,\n     Hon. Evan Bayh,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith and Bayh: On behalf of the 60 Plus \n     Association, I want you both to know you have our complete \n     support for legislation you soon plan to introduce, the \n     Social Security Tax Equity Act of 2003.\n       Increased taxes for Social Security benefits are a crystal \n     clear example of government greed at the expense of America's \n     seniors. Social Security benefits are already financed by \n     worker payroll tax contributions--but to tax senior citizens \n     a second time on their Social Security benefits should they \n     elect to continue working only burdens retired Americans \n     unfairly.\n       The 60 Plus Association stands foursquare with any group or \n     individual dedicated to maintaining and strengthening Social \n     Security. This vital program ought not be the catalyst for \n     exacting tax revenues on hard-earned retirement benefits.\n       Working allows seniors to earn income that in turn boosts \n     economic growth. Tax penalties on these additional retirement \n     incomes discourage seniors from continuing to lead active, \n     productive lives according to their ability and choosing. \n     That's wrong and needs to be remedied.\n       Senior, the 60 Plus Association is with you in eliminating \n     this double taxation of Social Security benefits.\n           Kind regards,\n                                                  James L. Martin,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Senior citizens pay Federal taxes on a portion of their Social \nSecurity benefits if they receive additional income from savings or \nfrom work. As ludicrous as it seems, our seniors who have worked hard \ntheir lives, and planned and saved for their retirement are being taxed \na second time, when they need their income the most.\n  One of the most unfair tax increases occurred in the 1993 tax bill. \nBefore 1993, seniors paid taxes on half their Social Security benefits \nif their combined income--which includes adjusted gross income and one-\nhalf of their Social Security benefits--exceeded $25,000 for \nindividuals or $32,000 for couples. In 1993 this tax was increased--\nindividuals with incomes above $34,000 and couples with income above \n$44,000 now had a portion of their Social Security benefits taxes at 85 \npercent.\n  I strongly believe that this increase in the taxable portion of \nSocial Security benefits violated the contract seniors had with the \nUnited States government. This tax increase was unfair and it provided \na disincentive to our seniors who chose to save or chose to work. This \nsingle provision increased taxes for almost one-quarter of Social \nSecurity recipients.\n  Seniors have spent a lifetime saving and investing in America in \norder to enjoy financial independence and security in retirement and to \naccrue assets for their children. Sadly, the double tax on Social \nSecurity punishes years spent exercising financial discipline. Worse \nyet, this tax ultimately forces seniors to limit their non-Social \nSecurity income or face the financial burden it imposes at certain \nlevels of earned income.\n  This tax hits middle income seniors, kicking in as soon as that \nsenior crosses the $34,000 mark.\n  While this double tax clearly targets seniors, our entire society \ncarries the economic burden as an experienced and knowledgeable senior \nworkforce chooses to sit on the sidelines rather than work and invest \nfor substandard returns. In the middle of the current economic \ndownturn, America would greatly benefit from the faithful investment \npractices and the productive work habits of its senior citizens.\n  I have been a cosponsor of various bills in the past few Congresses \nto repeal this unfair tax. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, \nI am pleased to announce the introduction of the Social Security Tax \nEquity Act of 2003.\n  I believe that we must do everything possible to turn back this 10 \nyear old tax increase and return some small measure of equity and fair \nplay to those senior citizens affected by that tax. I urge you all to \njoin me and my fellow senators by becoming cosponsors of this \nlegislation, and roll back this unfair form of double taxation on our \nsenior citizens and encourage them to continue contributing to the \nNation's growth. Those who have helped build this great country through \ntheir lifetimes deserve our support now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Social Security Tax \nEquity Act of 2003 be printed in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

There would be no expense to the \ngovernment and the searches would require the consent of the employee \nor applicant for employment.\n  Large numbers of critical non-governmental facilities from power \nplants to schools to hospitals are protected by private security firms \nand their civilian security officers. Keeping these facilities secure \nfrom terrorism or other forms of violent attack is critical to our \nnational security. Yet currently most private security employers cannot \nrequest timely national criminal background check information on the \nvery people they need to hire to protect these key facilities. This \nlegislation seeks to correct that. This bill would authorize private \nsecurity firms to request Federal background checks on current or \nprospective employees through the appropriate state agencies, thereby \npermitting relevant criminal history information to be considered in \nthe licensing and employment of private security officers.\n  The Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the FBI \nmaintains complete criminal history records for both Federal and State \ncrimes on individuals with criminal records in the United States. \nSearches are most effectively conducted using fingerprints to ensure \nefficiency and accuracy. We have already passed legislation \nspecifically permitting other industries--for instance, the banking, \nnursing home, and child care industries--to check their prospective \nemployees against the FBI's comprehensive records. Many of the reasons \nthat supported passage of those laws, particularly the desire to ensure \nthat those who provide certain important services have a background \ncommensurate with their responsibilities, support passage of this bill \nas well.\n  This legislation will enhance our Nation's security. As an adjunct to \nour Nation's law enforcement officers, private security guards are \nresponsible for the protection of numerous critical components of our \nNation's infrastructure, including power generation facilities, \nhazardous materials manufacturing facilities, water supply and delivery \nfacilities, oil and gas refineries, and food processing plants. The \napproximately 13,000 private security companies in the United States \nemploy about 1.5 million persons nationwide. Given the critical nature \nof the facilities private security officers are hired to protect, it is \nimperative that we provide sufficient access to information that might \ndisclose who is unsuitable for protecting these resources.\n  Currently we do not. Relying upon a Federal bill passed in the early \n1970's, 37 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation \nauthorizing State agencies to request both State and Federal criminal \nhistory record searches. Despite this authorization, security firms \nreport that searches of both State and Federal databases for private \nsecurity officers are the exception rather than the rule. That is \nbecause only 20 States plus the District of Columbia regularly access \nthe Federal database for private security officers, and only two--\nCalifornia and Illinois--do so in a way that ensures a timely response. \nIn many jurisdictions with authorizing statutes, reviews of the Federal \ndatabase are conducted sporadically, if at all. Indeed, in \napproximately 17 of the 37 States with authorizing statutes, typically \nonly State databases are searched for private security officers. An \nadditional 13 States have not even passed legislation authorizing any \nform of Federal criminal background check. What that means is that in \napproximately 30 States neither the State agencies nor the private \nsecurity employers typically have any access to any Federal criminal \ndatabase information. In these 30 States, an employment applicant in \none State could have a serious criminal conviction in another State and \nstill be permitted to perform sensitive security work. The state \nreviewing the applicant would have no idea a conviction in another \nState existed without access to the Federal database.\n  Further, even in those few States that actually conduct Federal \nrecords searches, the Federal searches conducted on new employees often \ntake 90 to 120 days, if not longer. While checks are pending, security \nguards frequently are provided temporary licenses. This 90 to 120 day \nperiod is more than enough time for a guard with a temporary license to \nperpetrate dangerous acts. In light of our urgent need to strengthen \nthe security of our homeland, this lack of timely access to criminal \nhistory information is unacceptable. An article that appeared earlier \nthis year in USA Today entitled ``Private Security Guards Are \nHomeland's Weak Link'' got it right when it said, ``more often than \nnot, private security guards who protect millions of lives and billions \nof dollars in real estate offer a false sense of security.'' We need to \nact in order to make it easier for States and employers to gain timely \naccess to this crucial criminal history information.\n  This bill strikes the appropriate balance between the interests of \nall parties involved.\n  First, the bill permits private security employers to request a \nprompt search of the FBI criminal history database for prospective or \nexisting employees. Requests must be made by the employers through \ntheir state's identification bureau or similar state agency designated \nby the Attorney General. Employers will not be granted direct access to \nthe FBI records. Instead, states will serve as intermediaries between \nemployers and the FBI to: 1. ensure that employment suitability \ndeterminations are made pursuant to applicable State law; 2. prevent \ndisclosure of the raw FBI criminal history information to the employers \nand the public; and 3. minimize the FBI's administrative burden of \nhaving to respond to background check requests from countless different \nsources. The program will not cost the Federal Government anything. The \nlegislation allows the FBI, and states if they so choose, to charge \nreasonable fees to security firms to recover their costs of carrying \nout this act.\n  Second, the bill protects employee and prospective employee privacy. \nBefore an FBI background check can be conducted, the employee or \napplicant for employment must grant an employer written consent to \nrequest the FBI database search. In addition, the criminal history \nreports received by the States will not be disseminated to employers. \nInstead, in States that have standards regulating private security \nguard employment, designated State agencies will simply be required to \nuse the information provided by the FBI in applying their State \nstandards. For those States that have no standards, the States will be \ninstructed to inform requesting employers whether or not employees or \napplicants have been convicted of either: 1. a felony; 2. a violent \nmisdemeanor within the past ten years; or 3. a crime of dishonesty \nwithin the past ten years. Thus, in these situations, only the fact \nthat a particular conviction exists or not will be provided by States \nto employers, and the privacy of the records themselves will be \nmaintained. All information provided to employers pursuant to this act \nmust be provided to the employees or prospective employees. \nFurthermore, the bill establishes strong criminal penalties for those \nwho might falsely certify they are authorized security firms or \notherwise use information obtained pursuant to this act beyond the \nact's intended purposes.\n  Third, the bill protects States' interests. The bill does not impose \nan unfunded mandate on the states. It reserves the right of States to \ncharge reasonable fees to employers for their costs in administering \nthis act. Moreover, if a State wishes to opt out of this statutory \nregime, it may do so at any time.\n  This legislation is long overdue. It strikes the right balance \nbetween the need for States and employers to gain access to this \ncritical information and the privacy rights of current and prospective \nsecurity guards. We have\n\n[[Page S4708]]\n\nworked with the FBI to expedite the administrative process, and it will \ncost the Federal Government nothing. There is no undue burden being \nplaced on our States. Most importantly, passage of this act will plug a \nhole in our homeland defense. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto ensure fair treatment and due process protections under the \ntemporary assistance to needy families program, to facilitate enhanced \ndata collection and reporting requirements under that program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, later this year, the Senate will \nconsider the first reauthorization of the 1996 Personal Opportunity and \nWork Responsibility Reconciliation Act. This law ended the Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children program and created our current \nfederal welfare program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, \nTANF, program.\n  I supported the legislation that created TANF because I believed that \nthe\n\n[[Page S4709]]\n\nwelfare system was failing recipients and their families and that we \nneeded to do better. Now, seven years later, the welfare rolls are \nagain on the rise and it is clear that improvements need to be made to \nthe TANF program in order to achieve the goal of breaking the cycle of \npoverty and moving recipients into well-paying, sustainable jobs.\n  As we all know, each State's welfare program is different, and the \nimplementation of these programs often varies from provider to provider \nand from county to county. While we encouraged state-level innovation \nwith the 1996 law and should continue to encourage it with our \nreauthorization legislation, we should also ensure that all State plans \nconform to uniform Federal fair treatment and due process protections \nfor all applicants and clients.\n  I am deeply concerned that a client who applies for or receives \nbenefits in one part of Wisconsin may not be getting the same treatment \nas another applicant or client in a different part of my State.\n  The bill that I introduce today, the Fair Treatment and Due Process \nProtection Act, would improve Federal fair treatment and due process \nprotections for applicants to and clients of State TANF programs by \naddressing gaps in current law in three areas: access to translation \nservices and English as a Second Language education programs, sanction \nnotification and due process protections, and data collection and \nanalysis.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu.\n  In order for low-income parents whose primary language is not English \nto understand their rights with respect to availability of benefits, to \ncomply with Federal and State TANF program rules, and to move from \nwelfare to work, we should ensure that translation services and English \nas a Second Language classes are available.\n  My bill would require states to provide interpretation and \ntranslation services to low-income parents who do not speak English, \nand provides that the standards currently used in the food stamp \nprogram would be used to determine when the requirement to provide such \nservices would be triggered for TANF-funded programs.\n  States would also be required to advise adults who lack English \nproficiency of available programs in the community to help them learn \nEnglish, and to allow individuals who elect to enroll in such programs \nto participate in them. Individuals who participate in such activities \non a satisfactory basis would be considered to be engaged in work \nactivities and these activities would be counted towards the work \nparticipation rates.\n  If we are not only to reduce the welfare rolls but to reduce poverty \nand to ensure that low-income parents find sustainable jobs, we must \nensure that these parents have access to education and training, \nincluding ESL classes, and that this training counts toward the work \nrequirement. I support efforts to expand the number of activities that \nTANF clients are permitted to count as work, and my bill would add ESL \nclasses to that list.\n  In addition, I am concerned about reports of unfair sanctioning and \ncase closures across the country. We should make every effort to \nminimize discrimination in the application of sanctions and the \ntermination of benefits. My bill would require that, prior to imposing \na sanction, States inform individuals of the reasons for the sanction \nand what individuals may do to come into compliance with program rules \nto avoid the sanction. It also would stipulate that sanctions may not \ncontinue after individuals have come into compliance with program \nrules, and that individuals be informed of all other services and \nbenefits for which they may be eligible during the period of the \nsanction, and of their rights under applicable State and Federal laws.\n  Finally, this bill would require States to perform enhanced data \ncollection and analysis so that we can get a better picture of the \npeople who apply for and receive TANF benefits and those who leave the \nwelfare rolls.\n  I share the concern that has been expressed by a number of my \nconstituents regarding the lack of comprehensive, uniform data about \nState welfare programs, including information on those who apply for \nbenefits and those who have left the welfare rolls. My bill would \nrequire States to collect and manage data in a uniform way; to \ndisaggregate the data based on a larger number of subgroups, including \nrace, ethnicity/national origin, gender, primary language, and \neducational level of recipient; to include information on work \nparticipation and about applicants who are diverted to other programs; \nand to track clients whose cases are closed.\n  In addition, the federal Department of Health and Human Services \nwould be required to include a comprehensive analysis broken down by \nthese same data groups in its annual report on the TANF program. The \nDepartment would also be required to perform a longitudinal study of \nprogram outcomes that includes data on applicants for assistance, \nfamilies that receive assistance, and families that leave assistance \nduring the period of the study. The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices would be required to protect the privacy of individuals and \nfamilies applying for or receiving assistance under state TANF programs \nwhen data on such individuals and families is publicly disclosed by the \nSecretary.\n  These enhanced requirements are not meant to impose an additional \nburden on the states. Rather, they are intended to measure the success \nof the program in a more comprehensive and transparent manner.\n  This legislation is supported by a broad array of more than 40 \norganizations, including the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the \nNAACP, the AFL-CIO, the American Association of University Women, the \nAmerican Bar Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, the \nCenter for Community Change, Hmong National Development, Inc., the \nNational Association of Social Workers, the National Campaign for Jobs \nand Income Support, the National Council of Churches, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, the National Organization for Women, the National \nPartnership for Women and Families, the National Urban League, Nine to \nFive, and the Welfare Law Center.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 770\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act take effect on October 1, \n     2003.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nFeingold and Senator Landrieu in introducing the Fair Treatment and Due \nProcess Protection Act of 2003, which will benefit low-income families \nacross the Nation by providing inportant civil rights protections to \nwelfare recipients.\n  Many families who apply for welfare benefits do not speak English or \nhave limited English proficiency. Yet when they arrive at the welfare \noffice, there is no interpreter or translator to assist them. Too \noften, eligible families leave the welfare office not enrolled in the \nprogram and without access to needed benefits and services. Even those \nwho succeed in enrolling often leave the welfare office without \nunderstanding the rules for participation, and are later penalized and \nlose benefits.\n  In virtually all of these cases, families want to play by the rules, \nbut barriers such as limited English language skills prevent them from \ndoing so. By helping to eliminate the language barriers, we can help \nthem to play by the rules.\n  Under the Food Stamp program, States are already required to evaluate \napplicants' English language skills and provide translation and \ninterpreter services when necessary. Our bill will extend this same \nrequirement to the welfare program to ensure that families who need \nbenefits actually get them and can understand how to comply with the \nprogram.\n  States would also be required to advise adults on the programs \navailable in their community to help them learn English. For \nindividuals who elect to participate in an English language program, \nstates would be able to count these activities toward the federal work \nrequirements.\n  Clearly, families must be able to play by the rules, but the rules \nmust be fair, especially when children are at risk. Today, however, \nwhen States impose penalties, they often penalize the entire family. \nEven money to support the childern in these families is suspended. Our \nbill provides important protections against unnecessary penalties.\n  States would be required to inform families of the specific reasons \nfor imposing a penalty and what the families can do to avoid it. States \nwould also be prohibited from continuing a penalty after the family has \ncome into compliance. It is unfair to penalize families for \nnoncompliance because they did not understand the rules. The children \nin these families deserve to be cared for.\n  An additional provision in this bill encourages States to collect \ndata on welfare outcomes, including why families leave welfare and how \nthey fare over the long term. It also encourages States to collect data \nby race, ethnic background, and primary language, so that disparities \nin access, use, or well-being become known and can be addressed by \nchanges in policy and programs. The knowledge obtained from these data \nwill help to ensure that welfare policies help more people in better \nways.\n  Protecting families from discrimination because of their native \nlanguage, safeguarding them from unnecessary and harmful penalties, and \nunderstanding how policies affect families are important parts of \ngenuine and fair welfare reform. The Fair Treatment and Due Process \nProtection Act of 2003 will help many more families to obtain the \nsupport they so desperately need, and I urge my colleagues to approve \nthese important protections.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN.\n  S. 771. A bill to improve the investigation and prosecution of child \nabuse cases through Children Advocacy Centers; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I \nbelieve will bring renewed focus to the battle against child abuse and \nthe services we provide child victims of crimes. Today, I am \nintroducing the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 2003, which reauthorizes \nthe Children's Advocacy Centers. These centers bring together law \nenforcement, prosecutors, child protective services and medical and \nmental health professionals to provide comprehensive, child-focused \nservices to child victims of crimes. Operating in all 50 States, \nChildren's Advocacy Centers served over 116,000 child victims last \nyear. Of these victims, 26,934 received onsite medical exams, 27,684 \nreceived counseling and 69,443 went through a forensic interview \nprocess specially designed for children. Seventy-six percent of the \nchildren they serviced were under the age of 12.\n  In 1994, this body passed a piece of legislation that I authored and \nhad been advocating for a number of years, the Violence Against Women \nAct. When we passed this landmark legislation, what we said as a \nCongress, and were saying as a Nation as a whole, was that domestic \nviolence is not a family problem to be dealt with quietly behind the \nscenes, but a national crisis in need of a coordinated response from \nlaw enforcement, courts and the medical community. Backed by a nearly \n$1\\1/2\\ billion commitment of Federal funds, the Violence Against Women \nAct spurred a sea change on the Federal, State and local levels in how \npolice, prosecutors, judges, medical personnel and others, process and \nhandle cases of domestic abuse. The Violence Against Women Act made it \nclear that victims of domestic violence were, in fact, victims: Victims \nin need of the full extent of this nation's medical and legal \nresources. The bill I am introducing today is designed to bring this \nsame type of concentrated focus, general awareness, and coordinated \nresponse to victims of child abuse, the most heinous and \nincomprehensible form of violence against the most vulnerable and \ninnocent people in our lives.\n  In 1987 Congressman Bud Cramer, then District Attorney of Madison, \nCounty, AL, founded the Nation's first Children's Advocacy Center. As \nstated earlier, these centers bring together law enforcement, \nprosecutors, child protective services and medical and mental health \nprofessionals to provide comprehensive, coordinated services to child \nvictims of crimes. Congress responded several years later. As Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, I\n\n[[Page S4713]]\n\nsponsored, along with Senator Thurmond, the Crime Control Act of 1990, \nP.L. 101-647, which created the Court Appointed Special Advocates, \n(CASA), program, to provide for the appointment of advocates on behalf \nof abused and neglected children. Two years later, Congress created the \nChildren's Advocacy Centers as part of the 1992 reauthorization of the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, P.L. 102-586. \nThe 1992 legislation amended the Victims of Child Abuse Act to include \nChild Advocacy Centers with a fiscal year 1993 total authorization \nlevel of $20 million and such sums as necessary for fiscal years 1994 \nthrough 1996. In particular, Senator Nickles and Representative Cramer \nwere instrumental in championing the Children's Advocacy Centers. The \nChild Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1996, P.L. 104-235, \nreauthorized the Children's Advocacy Centers through fiscal year 2000 \nbut made no substantive changes to the program, nor did it provide \nspecific authorization levels.\n\n  The Children's Advocacy Centers were a logical complement to the CASA \nprogram I authored in 1990, by bringing together law enforcement, \nprosecutors, child protective services and medical and mental health \nprofessionals to provide comprehensive, child-focused services to child \nvictims of crimes. The centers provide immediate attention to the young \nvictims of sexual and physical abuse, so that they are not ``twice \nabused,'' first by the perpetrator and second by a system which used to \nshuttle them from a medical clinic to a counseling center to the police \nstation to the D.A.'s office.\n  Communities with Children's Advocacy Centers report increased \nsuccessful prosecution of perpetrators, more consistent follow-up to \nchild abuse reports, increased medical and mental health referrals for \nvictims, and more compassionate support for child victims and their \nfamilies. Widely cited as an efficient, cost-effective mechanism of \nhandling child abuse cases, these centers are widely supported by \npolice, prosecutors and the courts. In a May 1998 publication titled, \nNew Directions from the Field, the Department of Justice included \nChildren's Advocacy Centers as their number one recommendation for \nimproving services to children who directly experience or witness \nviolence in their homes, neighborhoods and schools--number one.\n  Today in my state of Delaware, there are two operational Children's \nAdvocacy Centers. One is located in Wilmington and one is located in \nMilford. A third center is scheduled to open in Dover. These centers \nprovide a safe, comfortable setting in which cross-trained \nprofessionals interview alleged victims and begin initial investigation \nand evidence collection. Like other centers they offer on-site physical \nexams by specially trained pediatricians, prosecutors on hand to make \nimmediate contact with victims and families, referrals to mental health \nservices and most importantly, one-time minimally intrusive taped \ninterviews of child victims. This last service, one-time minimally \nintrusive taped interviews, is particularly important. Let me read to \nyou from a letter I received from John Humphrey, a retired police \nofficer who now acts as executive director of the Delaware Children's \nAdvocacy Centers, to demonstrate why:\n\n       I am a retired New Castle County Police Lieutenant that for \n     12 of my 21 years investigated child abuse and child death \n     cases. One of the most important pieces of the entire case is \n     the interview of the child victim. . . . Often times I saw \n     children subjected to at least 3-4 interviews by 3 or 4 \n     different interviewers, all with varying levels of \n     interviewing expertise. The end result is three or four \n     versions of events . . . answers vary because of the manner \n     in which questions are asked and the skills of the \n     interviewer. . . . Defense attorneys use that alone to poke \n     holes in a child's story. . . . Children's Advocacy Centers \n     bring all of the involved parties to the table at the same \n     time to work as a team. . . . We use forensic interviewers \n     specially trained in interviewing children. . . . This \n     results in video taped interviews of such quality that most \n     defense attorneys are asking for pleas to escape trial. We \n     are getting good pleas with good sentences. Most importantly, \n     this process minimizes the trauma a child victim and witness \n     must endure by doing one interview of such quality that the \n     child may be spared from walking into a courtroom full of \n     strangers to tell what happened. I would have given anything \n     as a police detective to have a children's advocacy center. \n     It expedites the process, minimizes the problems associated \n     with duplicative and unnecessary interviews, opens the lines \n     of combination between agencies, and provides the best \n     professional assessment of a case.\n\n  Last year Children's Advocacy Centers in Delaware handled 1,000 cases \nwhere child victims as young as 3 alleged physical or sexual abuse. Mr. \nHumphrey estimates that the centers eliminated 2,500 unnecessary \ninterviews by using the multidisciplinary approach.\n  The child abuse and crime statistics in this country are outrageous. \nNationally, 3.9 million of the nation's 22.3 million children between \nthe ages of 12 and 17 have been seriously physically assaulted and one \nin three girls and one in five boys are sexually abused before the age \nof 18. We have to do more to protect our children, by reauthorizing \nChildren's Advocacy Centers we can.\n  I want to believe that we are doing everything we can to prevent \ncrimes against children and, if God forbid they do occur, that we are \ndoing everything we can to treat the victims. This piece of legislation \nwould do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                 S. 771\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Victims of Child Abuse Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to reauthorize funding for the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Protecting \nOur Children Comes First Act of 2003,'' which will double funding for \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, \nreauthorize the Center through fiscal year 2007, and increase Federal \nsupport to help NCMEC programs to find missing children across the \nNation.\n  I am pleased that Senators Hatch, Kennedy, DeWine, Biden, Shelby and \nLincoln join me as the original cosponsors of this bipartisan \nlegislation. Today, Senators DeWine, Lincoln and Shelby launched the \nnew Senate Caucus on Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children. I am \nhonored to join the Caucus co-chairs as a founding member of the \nCaucus, and thank them for their leadership in this area.\n  It pains us all to see on TV, in the newspapers or milk cartons photo \nafter photo of missing children from every corner of the Nation. As a \nfather and grandfather, I know that an abducted child is the worst \nnightmare. Unfortunately, it is a nightmare that happens all too often. \nIndeed, the Justice Department estimates that 2,200 children are \nreported missing each day. There are approximately 114,600 attempted \nstranger abductions every year, with 3,000 to 5,000 of those attempts \nsucceeding. Experts estimate that children and youth comprise between \n85 and 90 percent of missing person reports. These families deserve the \nassistance of the American people and helping hand of the Congress.\n  As the Nation's top resource center for child protection, the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children spearheads national \nefforts to locate and recover missing children and raises public \nawareness about ways to prevent child abduction, molestation, and \nsexual exploitation.\n  NCMEC works to make our children safer by being a national voice and \nadvocate for those too young to vote or speak up for their own rights. \nThe Center operates under a Congressional mandate and works in \ncooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to coordinate the efforts \nof law enforcement officers, social service agencies, elected \nofficials, judges, prosecutors, educators, and the public and private \nsectors to break the cycle of violence that historically has \nperpetuated these needless crimes against children.\n  The Center's professionals have disturbingly busy jobs--they have \nworked on more than 90,000 cases of missing and exploited children \nsince its 1984 founding, helping to recover more than 70,000 children, \nand raised its recovery rate from 60 percent in the 1980s to 94 percent \ntoday. The Center has set up a nationwide, toll free, 24-hour telephone \nhotline to take reports about missing children and clues that might \nlead to their recovery, a National Child Pornography Tipline to handle \ncalls from individuals reporting the sexual exploitation of children \nthrough the production and distribution of pornography, and a \nCyberTipline to process online leads from individuals reporting the \nsexual exploitation of children. It has taken the lead in circulating \nmillions of photographs of missing children, and serves as a vital \nresource for the 17,000 law enforcement agencies located throughout the \nU.S. in the search for missing children and the quest for child \nprotection.\n\n  NCMEC is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia and operates branch \noffices in five other locations throughout the country to provide \nhands-on assistance to families of missing children, advocating \nlegislative changes to better protect children, conducting an array of \nprevention and awareness programs, and motivating individuals to become \npersonally involved in child-protection issues. It has also grown into \nan international organization, establishing the International Division \nof the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which has \nbeen working to fulfill the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of \nInternational child Abduction. The International Division provides \nassistance to parents, law enforcement, attorneys, nonprofit \norganizations, and other concerned individuals who are seeking \nassistance in preventing or resolving international child abductions.\n  NCMEC manages to do all of this good work with a $10 million annual \nDOJ grant, which expires after fiscal year 2003. We must act now both \nto extend its authorization and increase the Center's funding to $20 \nmillion each year through fiscal year 2007 so that it can continue to \nhelp keep children safe and families intact around the Nation. There is \nso much more to be done to ensure the safety of our children, and the \nbipartisan legislation we introduce today will help the Center in its \nefforts to prevent crimes that are committed against them.\n  The Protecting Our children Comes First Act also increases Federal \nsupport for NCMEC programs to find missing children by allowing the \nU.S. Secret Service to provide forensic and investigating assistance to \nthe NCMEC, as well as any State or local law enforcement agency, in any \ninvestigation involving missing or exploited children.\n  The bill also amends of the Missing Children's assistance Act to \ncoordinate the operation of the Center's CyberTipline to provide all \nonline users an effective means of reporting Internet-related child \nsexual exploitation, including the distribution of child pornography, \nonline enticement of children for sexual acts, and child prostitution. \nSince its creation in 1998, the CyberTipline has fielded almost 100,000 \nreports, which has allowed Internet users to quickly and easily report \nsuspicious activities linked to the Internet.\n  We have before us the type of bipartisan legislation that should be \nmoved easily through the Senate and House. Efforts to protect our \nchildren do not deserve to be used as pawns by groups who play politics \nby attaching it to more controversial measures. I applaud the ongoing \nwork of the Center and hope both the Senate and the House will promptly \npass this bill to provide more Federal supply for the NCMEC to continue \nto find missing children and protect exploited children across the \ncountry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 773\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children is a critical component of our Nation's battle \nagainst child pornography and child exploitation. It is absolutely \ndedicated to eradicating these evils, and its members work tirelessly \ntowards this end. The Center deserves more than just kind words for \nthese heroic efforts; Federal funding is necessary for it to continue \nthis good work. Indeed, Congress has tasked the Center with many \nmissions, including maintaining the cyber-tipline that receives reports \nof on-line child pornography, which the Center forwards to appropriate \nlaw enforcement officials. In this, as well as many other areas, the \nCenter forms a valuable partnership with both Federal and State law \nenforcement officials and prosecutors in redressing a host of crimes \nagainst children.\n  The Center's cause is just and its history of performance is \nexcellent. I am pleased to be the lead cosponsor of legislation that \nwill continue to authorize funding for the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children for the next four years. Senator Leahy and I \nintroduced this legislation in the 107th Congress, and our bipartisan \neffort continues in this new Congress. Our bill again authorizes \nfunding at $20 million per year--twice the previous authorization--in \nrecognition of the severity of the problem and the increased duties the \nCenter has taken on.\n  As the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am confident that this \nbill will become law very soon. I hope all of my colleagues will join \nSenator Leahy and me in supporting this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4715-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 103--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \n     COUNSEL IN THE CASE OF JOHN JENKEL V.

Con. Res. 32\n\n       Whereas throughout time various groups have felt special \n     attachment to places that they considered sacred and holy, \n     and the sacred texts of the great historical religions \n     include accounts of specific places where individuals or \n     groups experienced significant encounters with God;\n       Whereas holy places create a memory of these encounters \n     with the divine and are a part of the character of every \n     religious tradition;\n       Whereas holy places are as much a common feature of the \n     religious traditions of humanity as are sacred time, \n     ceremonies, and prayer;\n       Whereas one of the results of the identification of \n     locations as sacred is that these places can become the focus \n     for the tensions between the members of different religious \n     communities;\n       Whereas a place that is considered holy by one group can \n     come to be claimed by adherents of another tradition, and as \n     a result holy places can become the source of conflict as \n     much as of spiritual expression;\n       Whereas when religious communities tragically fall into \n     estrangement or antagonism, the holy places of each community \n     often become the target of violence or vengeance instead of \n     veneration and reverence, and people act out their contempt \n     and anger through occupation, desecration, and destruction;\n       Whereas the location of many holy sites of the three main \n     monotheistic religions are located in the State of Israel and \n     in the Palestinian territory;\n       Whereas this region is especially important to the \n     followers of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, and many \n     visitors from around the world travel to these sites for \n     personal and religious inspiration;\n       Whereas under British control the Palestine Mandate of 1922 \n     contained a number of provisions ensuring freedom of religion \n     and conscience and protection of holy places, as well as \n     prohibiting discrimination on religious grounds;\n       Whereas the Palestine Order in Council of that same year \n     provided that ``all persons . . . shall enjoy full liberty of \n     conscience and free exercise of their forms of worship, \n     subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals'' \n     and ``no ordinance shall be promulgated which shall restrict \n     complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all \n     forms of worship.'';\n       Whereas these provisions of the Mandate and the Palestine \n     Orders in Councils have been recognized in the Israeli legal \n     system and are instructive of Israeli policy in safeguarding \n     freedom of conscience and religion;\n       Whereas the Israeli Declaration of Independence of 1948 is \n     another legal source that guarantees freedom of religion and \n     conscience, and equality of social and political rights \n     irrespective of religion;\n       Whereas this document states ``the State of Israel . . . \n     will be based on freedom, justice, and peace as envisaged by \n     the Prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of \n     social and political rights to all its inhabitants \n     irrespective of religion, race, or sex; it will guarantee \n     freedom of religion, conscience, language, education, and \n     culture.'';\n       Whereas this document expresses Israel's vision and its \n     credo, and adherence to these principles is guaranteed by \n     law;\n       Whereas each religious community within Israel is free to \n     exercise its faith, observe its own holy days and weekly day \n     of rest, and administer its own internal affairs;\n       Whereas the Israeli Protection of Holy Places Law of 1967 \n     states that freedom of access and worship is ensured at all \n     places of worship and religious significance;\n       Whereas this law states ``the Holy Places shall be \n     protected from desecration and any other violation and from \n     anything likely to violate the freedom of access of members \n     of the various religions to the places sacred to them, or \n     their feelings with regard to those places.'';\n       Whereas Israel has worked to abolish discriminatory laws \n     and adopt standards of safeguarding access to holy sites;\n       Whereas in the past fifty-five years Israel has striven to \n     assure the safety of all religions;\n       Whereas the holy sites in Israel and Palestinian regions \n     should be protected from desecration and any other violation;\n       Whereas two years ago, in Nablus, the Tomb of Joseph was \n     ransacked and set on fire on live television, and in \n     retaliation a group twice attempted to burn a mosque in the \n     center of Tiberias;\n       Whereas these actions were followed by attempts to destroy \n     an ancient Jewish synagogue in Jericho;\n       Whereas last spring, during the Easter season, heavy unrest \n     in the West Bank resulted in a stalemate between Israeli \n     soldiers and over 100 Palestinian fighters in the Church of \n     the Nativity in Bethlehem; and\n       Whereas this deadlock lasted over a month and prevented \n     anyone from visiting this church of great historical and \n     religious importance: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) holy sites around the world, particularly in the \n     Israeli and Palestinian region, should be protected from \n     desecration and any other violation;\n       (2) the freedom of access of members of the various \n     religions to the holy sites sacred to them should not be \n     hindered;\n       (3) to assure the safety of American citizens, the holy \n     sites currently under the sovereignty of the State of Israel \n     should remain under Israeli protection, and that all holy \n     sites in the region remain open to visitors of all faiths;\n\n[[Page S4716]]\n\n       (4) the Department of State should continue to warn and \n     protect Americans overseas at holy sites and regions of \n     historical and religious significance; and\n       (5) we should condemn all violence directed against holy \n     sites.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF HOLY SITE.\n\n       As used in this resolution, ``holy site'' means a historic \n     location specifically set apart for religious purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4716-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 435.

I further ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m., the Senate \nresume consideration of S. 762, the supplemental appropriations bill, \nand that Senator Boxer be recognized at that point to offer an \namendment related to antimissiles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4731-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will be in a period for morning business until 10 a.m. to allow \nMembers to continue to make statements in support of the troops. At 10 \na.m., the Senate will resume consideration of the supplemental \nappropriations bill. The chairman has been talking to colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle regarding the lineup of amendments. Senator \nBoxer will go first, and we will try to reach a 30-minute time \nlimitation on her amendment.\n  I understand that following Senator Boxer's amendment, Senator Bayh \nwill be prepared with an amendment regarding bioterrorism, and Senator \nGraham of Florida will have an amendment regarding VA health.\n  We have also had discussions about stacking the votes on amendments \nuntil early afternoon to accommodate some scheduling problems. We will \nbe prepared to do that tomorrow morning.\n  The Senate will complete action on the supplemental appropriations \nbill tomorrow. I thank the two managers for their diligent, hard work, \nand I especially thank the assistant Democratic leader for helping to \nexpedite the completion of this important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader is absolutely right. We \nhave made progress on this bill. Senator Boxer had originally agreed on \n20 minutes. She would have 20 minutes, and Senator Stevens would have \n10 minutes. The amendment is not here so there was no way Senator \nStevens could look at the amendment. Senator Bayh agreed to 10 minutes \nand Senator Stevens agreed to 10 minutes. Senator Graham also agreed to \n10 minutes and Senator Stevens 10 minutes. We hope to work that out as \nsoon as the amendments are here so the majority can look at them \ntomorrow.\n  We had Senator Stevens make an announcement, as I have for the \nDemocratic leader, to make sure people realize we are going to finish \nthe bill tomorrow. Senator Breaux has an amendment that Senator Daschle \nwants him to offer. So we will have to see what else we can work out. I \nknow Senator Stevens has amendments on his side. We have a goal in mind \nto finish this bill tomorrow so we can get it immediately to conference \nand have a bill on the President's desk before we leave for our Easter \nbreak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, I thank all of our colleagues for \nworking very hard, especially the managers of this bill, to complete it \ntomorrow night or tomorrow afternoon, or as soon tomorrow as possible. \nI think we will be able to accomplish that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/02/senate-section/article/S4731-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
