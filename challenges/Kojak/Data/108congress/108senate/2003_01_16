You know \neven better than do we why we entered the public arena. Our aspirations \nof service for others were and still are so high. Yet You know how \nhammered we are in our personal and professional lives by the realities \nof relational tensions, the complexity of issues, the ambiguity of \nsolutions, our partisan agendas, and the pressures, political and \nfinancial, to remain professionally vital. These and more cause us to \nlose our focus on why we are doing what we are doing. Renew our vision \nwhen we temporarily lose it.\n  Dear Lord, may the zeal and enthusiasm of ones new to this Chamber be \nmelded with the experience of the veterans into a synergism of \ngovernance for the common good that is both faithful to deeply held \nconvictions while sensitive to doing together, across party lines, that \nwhich will strengthen this Nation in the challenges we face. Help us to \nuphold righteousness, justice, mercy and peacemaking in all affairs, \ndomestic and international.\n  May our individual and corporate prayer be that of the Psalmist who \nvulnerably cried out: ``Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me \nand know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me \nand lead me in the way everlasting.''\n  Finally, thank You, Lord, for our brother Lloyd Ogilvie who, as \nChaplain, has given 8 sterling years of service marked by dignity, \nsensitivity, eloquence, spirituality, and the modeling of the right \npriorities, as he soon leaves this office to stand caringly by his \nbeloved Mary Jane. Bless him as You, through him, have blessed us.\n  In the name of Jesus I pray. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S999-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable William H.

Mr. President, pending is the Byrd amendment. There will \nbe 2 hours of debate on the amendment. Members should be advised that a \nvote will occur sometime between noon and 12:30 p.m. today.\n  Following the disposition of the Byrd amendment, other amendments and \nvotes are likely. A late night is unavoidable. A number of our \ncolleagues have asked about scheduling for today and tomorrow. My \nresponse has been that in 18 days the President of the United States \nwill be delivering a budget to this body for consideration and for the \nnext fiscal year. We are already about a quarter of the way through \nthis fiscal year, yet the Senate has not yet addressed the 11 \nappropriations spending bills. That process is now under way.\n  We will be having our first vote in 2\\1/2\\ hours. I look forward to a \nvery productive day. Depending on how productive the Senate is today \nand tonight, and we may go well into the evening because we are working \nagainst, hopefully, a coming recess, it is going to be incumbent upon \nus to be disciplined, to be focused. All of our colleagues will want to \ntalk on every single issue. Clearly they have that opportunity. I do \nask, in the consideration of the number of amendments on either side, \nthat we be disciplined on both sides of the aisle so we can finish this \nbill before we leave.\n  We will be here through tomorrow; it could well be tomorrow night. It \nis my goal--my goal--as we are in the early stages on this bill, to \nfinish this bill before we leave. People have asked, Could that \npossibly mean Saturday morning? The answer to that is yes. I think it \nis that important that we move forward.\n  If we are unable to finish tonight or tomorrow or tomorrow night or \nSaturday or decide that going into Saturday is not the appropriate way \nto address it, we absolutely will be back here Tuesday morning to \nfinish these appropriations bills. Whether we finish it then Tuesday or \nlater in the week, it remains on how disciplined we are.\n  I encourage my colleagues to consider the importance of getting this \nunfinished business done as soon as possible so we can move ahead with \nthe Nation's business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S999-6", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nhours of debate on the Byrd amendment No. 2, with the time to be \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I do intend to yield to my distinguished friend from West \nVirginia anytime he wishes to start discussing his amendment.\n  The amendment pending before us to the amendment I have offered, \nwhich contains the 11 bills that were not enacted that the majority \nleader mentioned, the Byrd amendment, deals with additions to the \nhomeland security package that is contained in these 11 bills. As I \nstated last evening, I find myself sort of in a position of a husband \nwho has ordered a new car for his wife and tells her, when the bill \ncomes, he is not going to pay the bill.\n  I sat through the hearings Senator Byrd held as chairman on homeland \nsecurity. I know the amounts that are in his amendment are amounts of \nmoney that various persons from throughout our society and from \ncommunity after community all over the country have asked for. It is \nmoney they want. There is no question they want this money. We had a \nplan to make it available. Actually, it should have been made available \nsometime early last year, but we never got do that because we didn't \nhave a budget last year. And we were unable to move the appropriations \nbills last year because of the lack of a budget.\n  What I am seeking to do today, and started yesterday, is to ask the \nSenate to exercise a rare type of discipline and allow us to take these \nbills to conference. My amendment to this pending continuing resolution \nbill that is before us will allow us to take these bills to conference \nwith the House. There are 11 bills that should have been passed before \nOctober 1 of last year. As I said yesterday, it does not do any good to \ntry to point fingers to say why we didn't do that. The simple fact is, \nwe did not pass them.\n  Now in this new Congress we have to pass bills that actually expired \nat the end of the last Congress. All of the work that was done on those \nbills in the House and the Senate was eliminated by the end of that \nlast Congress.\n  We have initiated a process to catch up with those bills. There are \nbills that deal with the moneys to be expended by the agencies in the \nFederal Government between the time the President signs the bill and \nSeptember 30. That is a very short period of time. It does not exceed \n7\\1/2\\ months. It is probably 7 months. The money that is in my \namendment will provide ample money for those departments for that \nperiod of time. It is less than they would have gotten on October 1 of \nlast year, because since October 1 of last year they have been \nfollowing the provisions of the continuing resolution Congress enacted, \nand they are using no more than the amount of money that was available \nto them in the fiscal year 2002 budget. The 2002 budget was contrived \nby the President really in the fall of 2001. We enacted it sometime in \n2001.\n  We are dealing, in other words, with a process of funding our \nGovernment based upon decisions made in 2001, continuing down to the \nend of this fiscal year.\n  I note the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is here. I am \npleased to yield to him whenever he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. Go ahead.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is money in this amendment I have \noffered, in one bill or another, dealing with each subject Senator Byrd \nwishes to cover by his amendment. I can say that the money in the Byrd \namendment is going to be spent sometime by the Federal Government in \ndealing with these issues. The question is, when should we make it \navailable?\n  The President of the United States has said, because of all the other \npressures on our Federal Government, he wanted to limit spending under \nthese bills to $750.5 billion. He has given us a new amendment--there \nwill be a second one, too--and that adds $825 million to deal with the \nenormous fires that occurred in our country last year. As a \nconsequence, we agreed before the end of last year to try to live \nwithin the President's limitations. We were unable to do so in the \nperiod after the election. Now that we have come back, of course, it is \na new Congress and that agreement we made last year to limit it to the \nPresident's level was not still binding. But it is binding on me, \nbecause I went to see the President and he asked if I would try to do \nthis and get these bills done so we can turn to the budget request, \nwhich he will submit to the Congress after the State of the Union \nMessage. I told him I would.\n  I am in the position of asking the Senate to hold to the amount the \nPresident asked, the amount of these 11 bills. I didn't really decide \nevery number in these bills. These bills came from 11 subcommittees of \nthe Appropriations Committee, with staff members working from both the \nRepublican and Democratic sides at my request to reduce the amount so \nthe total did not exceed the President's request. That has been done. \nWe have a letter now, Mr. President, which I will put into the Record. \nI will read some of it to the Senate:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman:\n       I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your \n     leadership--\n\n  I won't read the whole first paragraph. The second paragraph says \nthis:\n\n       I am writing today to strongly oppose amendments to your \n     bill that would add extraneous spending above the levels \n     requested by the President. In particular, the ``Byrd \n     amendment'' purports to add $5 billion in additional \n     ``homeland security'' spending that is unnecessary.\n\n  This letter goes on to say:\n\n       We are now more than a quarter of the way through fiscal \n     year 2003 and much of the funding contained in the ``Byrd \n     amendment'' could not even be obligated in the remaining \n     months of this year. For these reasons, I urge you to \n     oppose the Byrd amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record at the end of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am prepared to try to explain any \nprovision that is in the 11 bills that are contained in the amendment I \nhave offered, or I will call upon the chairmen of all those \nsubcommittees whenever anything is questioned.\n  My hope is the Senate will understand the problem. The problem is, do \nwe take care of these 11 bills in a very expeditious way, get them to \nconference between the House and Senate, working with the President and \nhis people, and really fashion this into a satisfactory piece of \nlegislation which the President will sign now. If we don't, we must \nwait for the House to pass these bills individually. That will take a \nconsiderable time for them to pass. We are putting this amendment on a \nresolution that has already been passed by the House and we will send \nit back to the House. If we have to wait for 11 bills to come back from \nthe House and send them to conference one by one, it will be late March \nor late April before we get through this process. We will not be able \nto deal with the pressing needs of this economy, with the problems of \ntaxation, the problems of homeland security itself, and all of the \nproblems that really perplex us in terms of medical problems of our \nNation, the health care delivery system. We have the chance now to \nreally try to eliminate the problems caused by a failure to act last \nyear, and act decisively and take these 11 bills, in one bill, to a \nconference and work it out with the House and the President, and come \nback with a final bill in a conference report and send it to the \nPresident and, hopefully, obtain his signature and have this put behind \nus.\n  I intend to oppose any amendment to this bill which adds money. I \nintend to try to get the concept to move expeditiously, if possible. We \nnow have the majority leader's agreement that we will stay in session \nuntil we pass this bill. We can do it sooner or we can do it later. \nWhen we get to conference, we will have representation from both sides \nof this aisle. We will be dealing with the Appropriations Committee \nfrom the House and from the Senate and, by definition, that committee \nis made up of the most experienced people on both sides of the aisle. \nEvery point of view is represented in that conference, and every \namendment that could be offered here could be offered through one of \nthe members on that\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\nconference. We ought to be able to come back to the Senate very quickly \nwith a final solution to this problem, and that is the problem of how \ndo we eliminate this sword of Damocles that hangs over this new \nCongress--that is, the 11 bills that were not enacted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a chart that my staff and the staffs of \nthe individual subcommittees have prepared, which shows the major \nelements of Senator Byrd's amendment, item by item, the amount in \nSenator Byrd's amendment, and the amendment in my amendment for each of \nthose items, be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I confess that if we didn't have the \nlimitations we face, the deficit we face, I would once again support \nSenator Byrd's funding in each of these items. Under the circumstances, \nwe cannot. We must get a bill the President will sign as quickly as \npossible and get these bills behind us so we can come before the Senate \nwith the individual 13 appropriations bills that represent the bills \nfor fiscal year 2004.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Homeland \n           Security,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I would like to take this opportunity to \n     thank you for your leadership in bringing the FY 2003 Omnibus \n     Appropriations Bill to the Senate floor and for supporting \n     critical funding for out Nation's homeland security.\n       I am writing today to strongly oppose amendments to your \n     bill that would add extraneous spending above the levels \n     requested by the President. In particular, the ``Byrd \n     amendment'' purports to provide $5 billion in additional \n     ``homeland security'' spending that is unnecessary.\n       The base omnibus bill contains, as the Administration \n     requested, an unprecedented 30% increase over 2002 (including \n     supplemental funding) in the fiscal commitment to defending \n     the homeland. The funds requested and provided are sufficient \n     to address homeland requirements and, in many cases, are the \n     most that can be absorbed responsibly in the remaining months \n     of this fiscal year.\n       In total, the budget for FY 2003 will provide $37.7 billion \n     in homeland security funding, nearly doubling the pre-9/11 \n     levels. Investments made in previous supplemental \n     appropriations and the FY 2003 Budget will build capacity in \n     areas that will help protect our Nation against terrorist \n     attacks. Since 9/11, the Administration and Congress have \n     committed to providing: $9.6 billion to defend against \n     biological terrorism, more than doubling the level that the \n     Government spent prior; $3.3 billion to secure our borders \n     and ports and over $10 billion for aviation security \n     activities. The omnibus bill as proposed by Senator Stevens \n     supports all of these homeland security initiatives and \n     further funding is unnecessary.\n       We are now more than a quarter of the way through fiscal \n     year 2003 and much of the funding contained in the ``Byrd \n     Amendment'' could not even be obligated in the remaining \n     months of this year. For these reasons, I urge you to oppose \n     the Byrd amendment.\n       Thank you again for your support and we look forward to \n     working with you to ensure that our homeland is protected.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Steve Abbot,\n\n                                              Admiral (ret.), USN,\n     Deputy Homeland Security Advisor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n         MAJOR ELEMENTS OF $5 BILLION HOMELAND SECURITY PACKAGE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         FY 2003 level/\n                                      Byrd amendment   Stevens amendment\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nState and Local Assistance to       $1.4 billion.....  $3.7 billion\n Combat Terrorism.\nBorder Security...................  1.0 billion......  4.3 billion\nAirport Security..................  720 million......  374 million\nPort Security.....................  585 million......  120 million\nNuclear Security/Energy Security..  296 million......  1.1 billion\nMass Transit Security.............  300 million......  15 million\nFederal Law Enforcement...........  212 million......  1.2 billion\nWater Security....................  178 million......  65 million\nCyber Security....................  128 million......  48 million\nOther (Food Safety, Securing        167 million......  1.9 billion\n Biohazardous Materials at USDA\n Facilities, Embassy Security,\n Research to Combat Chemical\n Attacks, Security at Washington\n and Jefferson Memorials, and DC\n Emergency Response Plan).\nTotal.............................  5 billion........  12.8 billion\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I begin my speaking with reference to my \ncolleague, Ted Stevens. He is a beacon of reasoning. I was saying to my \nstaff last night--or this morning, I forget; I am almost oblivious to \ntime--here is a man who is standing up for the institution.\n  It is not the administration's desire that we have a time agreement \nthat allows the minority, the Democrats, to offer amendments with up-\nor-down votes, with an understanding there will be no stacking of the \ntree. This is something new in the Senate, in a way, under this \nadministration. Yet this man, Senator Stevens of Alaska, has taken the \nposition the minority is going to have its opportunity--when I say the \nminority, I am talking about the Democrats--to offer amendments. We \nwill have up-or-down votes. We are not going to stack any tree. This is \na breath of fresh air, and I think we ought to recognize this in \nSenator Ted Stevens' chairmanship. He is fighting for fairness and \nequality between the two parties when it comes to deliberations on the \nSenate floor and the offering of amendments. I want to pay this tribute \nto him. This is really the kind of chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee a Senator ought to be. We have not always seen this insofar \nas the other side of the aisle is concerned, when the other side has \nbeen in power. We have seen a willingness to run roughshod over the \nrights of the minority to offer amendments and to debate.\n  I do not say this to gain any favors from this chairman. He has been \naround a long time. I have been around a long time. We know we have to \ngive and take, but I point this out at the beginning of this debate. If \nit were not for Ted Stevens, we would not be debating my amendment \ntoday. I would probably not have any amendment up. This is the way the \nSenate ought to work, a forum for free debate and for amendments to be \noffered.\n  So to begin with, I salute him. I admire him. I respect him. It does \nnot matter how this finally turns out. As far as this Senator from the \nState of West Virginia is concerned, Senator Stevens is my friend, I am \nhis friend, and that is the way it is going to be.\n  I also recognize that Senator Stevens would probably do things \ndifferent if it were not for the circumstances that he is in. The \nadministration kept the House from acting on appropriations bills after \nJuly of last year. This administration put their foot down, put the \nbrakes on. The House Appropriations Committee chairman, Mr. Young, \nwanted to go forward with additional appropriations bills. He is \nanother man who is entitled to great credit. Of course, my counterpart \nin the House, Mr. Obey, is a very knowledgeable and forceful advocate \nof programs, a very experienced man.\n  So what I say has nothing to do with Mr. Obey or Mr. Young, but Mr. \nStevens is, in a way, swimming upstream. He has the opposition, I am \nsure, of the administration and, being as fair as he is being, he has \nthe opposition, I would imagine, of the House leadership. The House \nleadership has not wanted the appropriations process to go forward \nsince July of last year. Of course, I can only assume that the House \nleadership was carrying the water for and taking its orders from the \nadministration, which I do not exactly agree with when it comes to \ntaking orders and giving orders, if I may use those crude forms of \nexpression.\n  I pay tribute to this chairman. He is swimming upstream. I expect \neven on his own side he has a lot of opposition to the fairness he is \ndisplaying. I do not know that, but I have a feeling that is true. I \nhave a feeling that is true with respect to the Republican-controlled \nHouse and the administration.\n  I fully understand Senator Stevens' situation. In many ways, I expect \nhis heart is not in the coffin with Caesar. I have a feeling he has \ngreat empathy for what he is doing, but he is also trying to get a \nmassive bill through. We failed last year because of the \nadministration's bullheadedness, its stubbornness, its pigheadedness in \nrefusing to go forward with these bills and holding them back so that \nwe would operate on automatic pilot with continuing resolutions, so \nspending would not be one dollar above last year's levels--if we might \nspeak in general terms.\n\n  So I pay him tribute and I pay tribute to the Republican members of \nthe Appropriations Committee who time after time voted to report out \nthese appropriations bills. We had unanimity, complete bipartisanship. \nWhat a model for committee bipartisanship that committee was.\n  Now we come to the situation where in order to get a bill that is \nmade up of\n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\nthe 11 appropriations bills that were not passed last year, the Senator \nfrom Alaska has to come in with some cuts. I do not believe his heart \nis in those cuts, but he has to make this presentation. He does it \nforcefully, and I respect him for that.\n  Having said that, I have to vigorously oppose the amendment offered \nby my distinguished colleague, Mr. Stevens.\n  Before I make any further remarks, I yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow. If she needs more \ntime, let us know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for yielding 5 minutes to me. I also share his great \nrespect and admiration for the Senator and the processes in which he is \ninvolved and the bipartisan way the Appropriations Committee has moved \nforward in working together with our two leaders.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his leadership on the issue of homeland--\nmany of us are saying ``hometown''--security, because that is really \nwhat it is. I come with thanks and gratitude from law enforcement, \nfirefighters, EMS workers, hospital emergency room workers, all across \nthe great State of Michigan.\n  I have held six different community meetings around Michigan in the \nlast month asking our local first responders how they are doing, what \ndo they need, do they feel prepared, what can we do to be of \nassistance. I have scheduled three more meetings in Michigan to listen, \nand I am hearing the same thing over and over again, and that is our \nfirst responders, our firefighters and police officers on the front \nline, emergency personnel, health departments, local emergency rooms, \ndesperately need us to partner with them to give them the resources \nthey need to take the necessary steps to be prepared in the case of \nterrorism in their communities.\n  I heard concern about training, not only the need to have a trainer \nbut the costs that it takes to remove that police officer. In a small \npolice department, when an officer goes to training for a week, there \nis the additional cost to replace that person, with overtime involved, \nand all kinds of concerns about training relating to the cost. They \nvery much want this training. They need the training. But they need our \nhelp to be able to continue to provide law enforcement safety services, \nfire services, and other services in the community while their \npersonnel are being training.\n\n  I heard great concern about the lack of resources for equipment and \ncommunications, one county not being able to speak to the next county, \nlarge departments in one city not being able to speak to a township, \nvery small fire departments that are not yet on e-mail. We have \ninformation coming out from the Federal level, many of them saying they \nappreciate the information coming from the FBI or the Department of \nJustice, but small departments are not receiving that in a timely \nmanner. There are great concerns about lack of coordination and \ncommunication, all of those things involving resources.\n  We have also heard great concerns about additional personnel who are \nneeded in this time when the States are cutting back. In my own State \nof Michigan, because of tremendous budget crises, we have seen cuts in \nrevenue sharing to our local governments. Police officers are being \nlaid off. Firefighters and other front responders are coming to us and \nasking us to partner with them. We have a new Homeland Security \nDepartment. We have new responsibilities that have been given to our \nlocal hometown security leaders. We need to provide them the resources \nto be able to get the job done.\n  Michigan is a border State. In Senator Byrd's amendment, the \nresources for border security are absolutely critical. We have three of \nthe top five busiest borders, the busiest being in Detroit.\n  I rise today to support Senator Byrd's amendment and to urge that we \npass it as he has provided. We are in a situation that I believe is \nabsolutely critical. We are hearing this from Republican sheriffs and \nDemocratic sheriffs, from Republican police chiefs and Democratic \npolice chiefs. This is not a partisan issue. This is about the local \nlaw enforcement and emergency management personnel desperately needing \nour help to be able to get the job done to keep families safe and \nsecure in their homes and in their neighborhoods.\n  I urge colleagues to support this effort. Once last year we came \ntogether to pass emergency dollars in the supplemental. The dollars \nthat are being proposed are absolutely critical. It is a small amount \nto pay in order to give the assurance to our families that they will in \nfact have the resources given to first responders in their community so \nthey know they can respond in a crisis. I cannot think of anything more \nimportant today than making sure we are funding hometown security \nefforts. Senator Byrd's amendment is critical to that effort. I hope we \nwill join and have 100-percent support to send a message to our police, \nfirefighters, emergency health personnel, and medical personnel that we \nstand with them in partnership, the Federal Government with our local \ncommunities, and we will be there and make them a priority for the \nresources they need in order to keep us safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the concerns of the Senator from West Virginia. We all \nadmire his commitment to the issue as we all try to make sure we as a \nnation have prepared effectively to address the issue and the threat of \nterrorism in our homeland. This has been a priority. This has been the \nNo. 1 priority of the President of the United States. I don't think \nanyone can argue that this President has not committed himself and his \nadministration in an almost messianic effort to get our Nation ready to \ndefend itself in the face of this terrorism threat.\n  Thus, we have to give great credibility to do what the President \nwants and believes he needs in order to accomplish the protection of \nthe homeland. What he has said he wants and needs is in the bill as \nbrought forward by Senator Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. In fact, the add-ons which are requested by the Senator from \nWest Virginia, in large part, although well intentioned, may in fact \nundermine the effort to try to get efficiently into place a response to \nthe threat of terrorism.\n  Why is that? Because sometimes when these agencies receive much more \nmoney than they can handle, they handle all their money poorly. If they \nreceive the money they need to do the job right, they focus on doing \nthe job right rather than simply spending the money.\n  The administration has written us and said they believe the \nadditional funds requested by the Senator pro tempore emeritus are \ninappropriate. I have a letter signed by Admiral Abbott, the Deputy \nHome Security Adviser:\n\n       I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your \n     leadership in bringing the fiscal year 2003 omnibus budget \n     bill to the floor of the Senate. I am writing today to \n     strongly oppose amendments to your bill that would add \n     extraneous spending above the levels requested by the \n     President. In particular, the Byrd amendment purports to \n     provide $5 billion additional homeland spending that is \n     unnecessary.\n\n  That is one paragraph from this letter. He is very clear. The \nPresident of the United States, through his Deputy Secretary for \nHomeland Security--Deputy Secretary-designee anyway--Admiral Abbott, \nhas said this money is not needed and it is not appropriate for the \neffort they are trying to undertake to protect the homeland.\n  I don't think anyone can question but that this President understands \nthe importance of protecting the homeland.\n  I will go through a few specifics relating to issues over which I \nhave had jurisdiction with my subcommittee I have been honored to chair \non the Appropriations Committee, the Commerce, Justice, State, and the \nJudiciary Subcommittee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Of course, I yield----\n  Mr. BYRD. I will refer to something----\n  Mr. GREGG. For a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. He is citing a statement of a Deputy Director of Homeland \nSecurity; is that it?\n  Mr. GREGG. Designated Deputy Director.\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Citing that individual as saying that they do not need any \nadditional moneys as we find in the amendment I have offered; is that \nwhat he is saying?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I was off the floor, and I want to make sure I heard. I \nmake this comment in that regard. We heard that same tune last year \nfrom Mr. Ridge who was at that time the Director of Homeland Security. \nHis comment was with respect to moneys that were in legislation I was \noffering. His comment was: We don't need any more. We don't need any \nmore money. The same old tune: We don't need any more money. We heard \nthat from Mr. Ridge last year.\n  I don't speak with criticism of the distinguished Senator who is on \nthe floor, but I am simply pointing out, that is the same old saw, the \nsame old tune we heard last year from the then-designated Director of \nHomeland Security, Gov. Tom Ridge. He even wrote me a letter.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a second? I have to reclaim my \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRD. I had the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yielded for a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am talking on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. He has the floor, but I point out that I had the floor. I \nhad to leave the floor, and I yielded to the distinguished lady from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Now the Senator from New Hampshire has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I understand that. I very well know the rules of the \nSenate. I am not itching for a fight with the Chair. I respect the \nChair. I respect the Senator from New Hampshire. But the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, let him understand that I am yielding--I have asked for \nhim to yield on my time, my time.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Fine. I am yielding for a question. I am not yielding the \nfloor, but the time is being charged to the Senator from West Virginia; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The time is so charged.\n  Mr. BYRD. I only want to point out that we heard that same old tune \nlast year from then-Director Tom Ridge of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. He wrote me a letter--probably wrote the same letter to \nSenator Stevens at that time--that they didn't need the money we were \ntrying to put in the bill. So we have heard that before.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding. That is the only \npoint I wanted to make. I wanted to recall for the record that we have \nheard that same argument before from this administration, at that time \nthrough Director Tom Ridge, whom the President of the United States \nrefused to let come before the Appropriations Committee and testify on \nbudget matters.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I simply add, today we have a letter from Admiral Abbott, in which it \nis stated that they think this money is unnecessary, and I believe \ntheir point is it is unnecessary at this time because these agencies \ncan't handle it.\n  Let me go through why that is the case with the agencies with which I \nhave some familiarity. I have been fortunate enough to serve as either \nranking member or chairman of the Commerce-State-Justice Subcommittee \nfor about 8 years, and during that time I have come to know with some \nfamiliarity of the activities of the agencies under that jurisdiction, \nmany of which impact homeland security. Let me specifically talk about \nthe FBI, INS, first responders, and the issue of the Marshals Service.\n  This amendment includes in it $137 million for the Triology Program. \nThe Trilogy Program was an attempt to get coherence into the computer \nsystems of the FBI and basically be able to get every agent at the FBI \nthe capability to go online and instantaneously access the database of \nthe FBI, so you would have the capacity of a field agent actually \nhaving the information necessary to find out, if they ran into a \nsuspect, what that suspect's threat situation was and also to feed into \nthe system information they may have developed that was important to \nprotecting the country, especially in the area of terrorism.\n  Unfortunately, Trilogy has become a large disaster. A big part of the \ndisaster of the Trilogy Program is that we, last year, threw $237 \nmillion at the program that they didn't need in order to develop it. \nThat was part of our efforts last year to try to show that we were \nconcerned about terrorism. This money, essentially, buried the program. \nAs a result, in large part, the program has fallen apart. The situation \nis that the FBI software and hardware contracts for Trilogy have \nessentially become gold plated. The cost is soaring. The schedule is \nout of control. Right now we still do not have contracts on Trilogy \nhardware or Trilogy software. We are completely at the mercy of the \ncontractors.\n\n  The practical effect of that is that we now have a program which has \nwhat is estimated to be an approximately $213 million increase in 1 \nyear--that is a 57-percent increase--and we are not getting what we \nexpected out of the program. The simple fact is that putting another \n$137 million on top of a program which already is awash with money, so \nmuch awash in money that it basically has caused the FBI to lose its \nfocus on how to best get contracts for software and hardware, is not \ngoing to help the program at all. In fact, to put another $137 million \ninto the program is not going to contribute anything to making Trilogy \nwork better.\n  Regarding the additional funds in this amendment, there is a point \nmade that, in the prior bill from which this bill was brought up, there \nis at least $100 million of unobligated funds at the FBI. We happen to \nthink it is probably much higher than that. It may approach $150 \nmillion. It makes much more sense to say to the FBI: You spend the \nunobligated funds first before we put more funds on top of the funds \nyou already have, because we already know you are having trouble \nmanaging the additional resources that you have received.\n  The FBI is, regrettably, a very troubled agency today. I don't think \nthere is anybody who has been following the news who doesn't recognize \nthat. If you happen to follow the actual substance of the situation, \nyou can appreciate that. For example, the National Infrastructure \nProtection Center, NIPC, which presented a spending plan that was so at \nvariance with what the committee guidance was--and this was committee \nguidance when the committee was under the chairmanship of Senator \nHollings, who did an extraordinary job as chairman of this \nsubcommittee, by the way--it was so at variance with that we had to \nredirect $30 million and basically NIPC was transferred out of the FBI \nbecause they simply couldn't handle the program any longer.\n  The Foreign Terrorism Tracking Task Force--this was created on a \nwhim. It was a press release creation. We still don't know what it \ndoes. We still can't figure out what it does. As a practical matter, it \ndoesn't know what it does.\n  The efforts to implement the Webster Commission mandates on security \nhave ended up creating unnecessary tasks because of the initial Bureau \nreluctance to allow us to have full oversight. That has made it \nimpossible for us to determine whether the Webster Commission mandates \nare being met.\n  Director Mueller is trying very hard, and I have immense respect for \nhim. I honestly believe--unfortunately, with time--he is going to get \nthe FBI up and running, to be the type of force it needs to be in order \nto protect us from terrorist attacks.\n  But right now the FBI has serious managerial problems. It does not \nhave serious cash problems. We have funded the FBI at very high levels \nin this bill, very high levels. They have significant unobligated \nfunds. Programs such as Trilogy do not need more money. What they need \nis more management.\n  We can move on to the INS. The amendment would add $267 million more \nfor INS construction. The fiscal year 2003 bill before us already \nprovides $267 million for INS construction. We doubled INS \nconstruction, compared to historic levels at which INS construction was \ngetting funded. If you take the money now being proposed in this \namendment, you will be doubling it again. This is one area in the INS \nDepartment where they actually do things well--construction. They know \nwhat they are doing. They do it well.\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\nBut, as any other agency, if you overwhelm it with funds, many more \nfunds than it can handle--and I respectfully present that a quadrupling \nof funds in one agency's construction account is an overwhelming \nevent--you are going to find that agency starts to erode its internal \ncontrol mechanisms and you are probably going to find that money will \nbe spent recklessly, inappropriately, and, unfortunately, wasted.\n\n  The doubling of the money in this account is a reasonable number. I \ndon't see how anybody can say it is not a reasonable number, which is \nin this legislation as it comes from Senator Stevens. It does not need \nto be quadrupled.\n  The amendment also calls for $262 million in the exit/entry program. \nThe exit/entry system is, unfortunately, another computer disaster. It \nis a proposed system. Unfortunately, it is a promise; it doesn't exist. \nWe can't even begin to develop the system until the INS has a central \ncomputer control network. The INS has so mismanaged its information \ntechnology programs over the years that we now have several core \nsystems that cannot communicate with one another. That is one of the \nreasons the 9/11 disaster is so frustrating. It was the fact that the \nINS systems couldn't communicate with each other that didn't allow us \nto find out that we had folks training in flight school 9 months before \nthe event.\n  The situation is so bad that the proposed fiscal year 2003 mark \nprovides $83 million for the Justice Department to come in and develop \na new central computer system for the INS, because we have decided--and \nthis wasn't my unilateral decision; this was a decision made under \nChairman Hollings' leadership, and I applaud him for it because he went \ninto this and they understand the problem--we came to the conclusion \nthe INS couldn't straighten this out; it is such a disaster, their \ncomputer systems. The amendment would have us spend $362 million on a \nsystem that, if developed, would be standing in isolation because there \nis no central computer system that is working now at the INS.\n  What we need to do first is develop a central computer system at the \nINS that can communicate within the INS, and then with the exit/entry \nsystem in place. So we are putting the cart before the horse, to say \nthe least, and it is going to cost us $360 million to do it and it \nmakes very little sense, although it is well intentioned. But it is not \ngood fiscal management for that agency.\n\n  Finally, the amendment adds some $80 million for salaries and \nexpenses. The fiscal year 2003 mark already funds 500 new Border Patrol \nagents and 460 new inspectors. We know from the historical experience \nover the last few years that we have been trying to hire up the Border \nPatrol and that we simply can't fill these positions as fast as we \nwould like. We can say they want 1,000 new Border Patrol agents. We \nknow they will not get them. Why? Because we have language \nrequirements. We require significant training experience for these \nindividuals. And up until last year or the year before, we didn't pay \nthem enough to get the people who had those qualities. We are losing \nthem at a high rate, especially since TSA came into existence and the \nrate of pay there was better than the Border Patrol. We saw people \nmigrating from the Border Patrol over to there. We need to fill the \nslots that are already there. We need to hire up those slots and not be \nputting another $80 million on top of that. That is $80 million that \ncan't be used. It really isn't necessary in order to accomplish what we \nwant in the area of hiring up the Border Patrol.\n  We know--once again, like the FBI--that the INS has huge amounts of \nmoney that are sitting there that are unobligated and basically \nbecoming slush funds. That is what this $80 million would be added to.\n  Just last month, like a rabbit out of a hat, when a hole in the \nsecurity bill was announced, they came up with $30 million at the INS, \nbang, just like that. We don't know where it came from, but we know \nthey found it in that agency.\n  Unfortunately, this $80 million, as well intentioned as it is, is \nsimply not going to be able to be used because we have already put in \nplace as many new positions as they possibly can hire up in the next 8 \nmonths which this bill covers.\n  In the area of the U.S. Marshals, the U.S. Marshals is a small agency \nthat is trying hard. They are sort of like the little-engine-that-could \nagency. This amendment is suggesting $537 million for 200 new deputy \nU.S. marshals--the revival of an idea that I think was initially put on \nthe floor here by Senator Graham of Florida last year. Again, it is \nwell intentioned. But this is especially an agency that we do not want \nto overload with money they can't use and with which they would \npotentially end up producing inefficiencies and waste.\n  Rather than throwing a whole lot of money and saying hire up a whole \nlot of new people at the U.S. Marshals Service, this bill suggests that \nwe shift 106 presently underused senior U.S. marshalls away from their \ndesks and back onto the front lines. What is the advantage of doing \nthis versus hiring up? The advantage is you don't end up with fresh, \nnew faces out there; you end up with people who have line experience, \nknowledge, and ability, and who will from day 1 know how to handle a \ndifficult situation should they confront it in a courthouse. This is a \nprudent course.\n  The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia, unfortunately, in my \nopinion, would simply swamp the marshals. It is better to bring 106 \nsenior deputies back to the fold than to chase and try to capture 200 \nrookies who may or may not be able to be added in time, and may or may \nnot be able to be constructive, compared to moving the 106 onto the \nfront line.\n  By moving those senior marshals to those positions, we will address \nthe problem most effectively. That is why the bill takes this approach \nrather than additional funding.\n  The bill has also added a huge new increase on top of the very \ndramatic increase that is in the bill for first responders. This is an \narea where I have spent a huge amount of time, as has Senator Hollings. \nOur committee basically first began the first responder effort 3 years \nbefore the 9/11 event. We set up five major schools across the country. \nWe started with training. Actually, we had them in 167 cities before 9/\n11. We wish we had been able to do more. We weren't. But as a practical \nmatter, this is an area where we have focused a lot of energy and a lot \nof time to get this program to work right. It is working right. This is \none of the real things in our efforts to address terrorism that is \nworking right.\n\n  This bill has put $2 billion into what used to be DPO, the Domestic \nPreparedness Office, which will go out to the police and the emergency \nresponders. Then it has another $1 billion-plus going over to FEMA, \nwhich will help with fire first responders.\n  We don't want to put more money on top of that--and I will be willing \nto place odds on this one--than these agencies are going to be able to \nhandle in the next 8 months, and at the end of the next 8 months we are \ngoing to pour another dramatic amount of money into this account.\n  We understand that these are the people who need the support. They \nneed the technical support and the training. They need the equipment. \nBut we also understand, once again, that putting these types of dollars \ninto these agencies this fast--into the local fire departments, local \npolice departments, local public health departments--if you do it at a \nrate that you can't keep track of it and you can't manage it \neffectively, you are going to end up with a lot of bells and whistles \nrather than substantive equipment. That is what we don't want. We don't \nwant people buying blue lights; we want people taking care of the \nequipment they should be buying--respirators or machines--and we want \nthe training to be directed at the training needed by a first responder \nin a terrorism event--especially weapons of mass destruction. We don't \nwant this money simply ending up by placing dollars that are flowing \ninto these agencies.\n  The $2 billion that is coming out of our subcommittee and the $1 \nbillion-plus coming out of the FEMA subcommittee is a dramatic increase \nand a very significant commitment to the first responder program. \nPutting more money on top of that, as the Homeland Security Assistant \nSecretary, Admiral Abbott, pointed out, simply isn't going to add to \nsolving the problem.\n  As well intentioned as this amendment is--it is well intentioned, and \nI respect immensely the author, but certainly the author's commitment \nto\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\nthis issue which as been acted on for the last few years in a very \naggressive way--I think at this time that the administration has it \nright and knows what it is doing as well as anyone can in this type of \na climate and that this bill properly funded was brought to the floor \nby Senator Stevens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 52 minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for the rollcall \non Senator Byrd's amendment be changed to commence at 12:30, with the \ntime added to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. He is a very knowledgeable Senator. He is a \nreasonable Senator, and he is a courageous Senator. He doesn't always \nfall in line and do the party thing. But let me say this. He raises a \nstraw man when he talks about computers. We are knowledgeable. He is \nright on the computers. So we didn't ask to put any money in this \namendment for computers.\n  Let me also say this. Is there anybody in this Chamber who would \nmaintain that we know who is coming into this country and who is going \nout of this country from day to day? The borders are wide open. We know \nthat. So let it not be said that the FBI and the other agencies, the \nBorder Patrol people, and all of those are awash with money. Don't \nlisten to that. Our country is not secure. This amendment is attempting \nto make our Nation secure.\n  With regard to the FBI, we have $46 million. We say we are awash with \nmoney, that we don't need any more money. That was a mainstay of the \ndistinguished Senator's argument. I will defer to Senator Hollings \nbecause he can best speak to this subject matter with respect to the \nFBI, and so forth.\n  But the Senator from New Hampshire says we are awash with money; we \ndon't need any more money. Well, in this amendment, there is $46 \nmillion for aviation support, including funding for additional pilots \nand mechanics, for two Blackhawk helicopters and surveillance aircraft, \nfunding for maintenance and equipment, and other items needed by the \naviation program.\n  This money has been requested by the President of the United States. \nDoes the right hand know what the left hand is doing here? This \namendment is attempting to, in this instance, with respect to the $46 \nmillion--nothing was said about that by the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire. Now they are sending in their top artillery people over \nhere on this amendment. I hope our top artillery people will come and \naddress these comments.\n  But let it not be said that we are spending more money on computers. \nWe are not doing it in this amendment. The Senator from New Hampshire \nis exactly correct. We know that, so we did not add money for that.\n  But there is other money here requested by the President. So let it \nnot be said we do not need that money. Who is right? If a President \nrequests the money, is the Senator from New Hampshire, or any other \nSenator on that side of the aisle, or any Senator who is opposed to \nthis amendment, willing to stand on the floor and say the President is \nmistaken, the President does not know what he is talking about, the \nPresident does not speak for us?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I have listened to this debate, and it appears, with the \nremarks from the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, that these \namounts in this amendment which the Senator from West Virginia has \nfiled were just brought out of the sky someplace. The fact is, agencies \nof the executive department requested these matters initially; is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is true. And not only the agencies in the executive \ndepartment, but the distinguished Senator from Utah, for example, \ntalked about cybercrime, cyberterrorism, the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Bennett. He is a very knowledgeable Senator on this subject. \nSo in this amendment we have $70,600,000 to combat cybercrime and \ncyberterrorism. We have taken this from testimony at last spring's \nhomeland security hearings. These are funds that were blocked--\nblocked--by the President in the $2.5 billion supplemental.\n  Hear me now. Who asked for this money? Senators on that side of the \naisle have maintained that this is a very, very worthy cause; we need \nto combat cybercrime and cyberterrorism. This amendment is trying to \nrespond to that need that was evidenced by Senator Bennett at the \nhearings.\n  Everybody knows we have a language translation problem in the \nservices. We have heard that from all sources in the hearings that were \nheld by the Appropriations Committee last spring. We heard it from the \npeople at the local level. They could not talk with one another. And \nthere are problems in language translation. So this was a Hart-Rudman \nreport recommendation, and this amendment is trying to respond to that.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 49 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  How much time does the Senator from New York want?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If it is all right with the Senator, 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I stand here to back up our leader, the \nSenator from West Virginia, who has waged a long fight.\n  First, I wish to say that the Senator from New Hampshire is very \nerudite, and I am glad he chairs his subcommittee, but what he is \nsaying, that we do not need money, does not square with the facts. The \nbottom line, if you have followed the fight of our good friend, our \nleader, the Senator from West Virginia, is that this administration has \nconstantly cut back on homeland security, on requests they have made, \nand on things that we need.\n  We are in a strange situation; that is, when we fight a war on \nterrorism overseas, every penny is available, as it should be. We back \nup our men and women who are overseas. But when it comes to fighting \nhere at the homeland, we have no money. The analogy would be telling \nthe generals to fight the war in Iraq--the upcoming war we pray to God \nwill not happen; but if it does, fight the war in Iraq--with no new \nmoney. It makes no sense.\n  I want to point out three areas because I heard my colleague from New \nHampshire.\n  First, in my State--all of which I know from my State; and I will \ntake one end of my State and the other--at one end we have a northern \nborder; at the other end we have a port. The northern border is totally \nunguarded. Every 2 weeks we hear on television the fact that some \nunknown group may have come over the northern border.\n  In the PATRIOT Act, a bipartisan act which the Justice Department \npushed, we called for tripling the Border Patrol, Customs, and INS on \nthe northern border. In Buffalo we have the second largest port of \nentry between Canada and the United States. I have been there. I have \ntalked to the head of the Border Patrol in New York on the northern \nborder. I have talked to the head of Customs. I have talked to INS. \nThey are desperately short of people.\n  If my friend from New Hampshire thinks we don't need money to \nincrease personnel for Customs, INS, and the Border Patrol, I would \ninvite him to come to my State.\n  For the southern border, we have some guards and strictures, and, \nunfortunately, the terrorists have realized that and they use the \nnorthern border.\n  Again, the President called for tripling--tripling--in the PATRIOT \nAct, the personnel of those three Departments on the northern border. \nThe underlying amendment does virtually nothing. Even the amendment \noffered by my good friend from West Virginia does not triple the amount \nwe need on the northern border, but at least it takes a step in that \ndirection.\n  I have asked the people in Buffalo and in Plattsburgh and in \nOgdensburg\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\nwhy they can't hire people. Because they don't have the money. Not that \nthe personnel aren't there, not that there are bureaucratic \nbottlenecks, but they don't have the money.\n  Let's go to the southern end of my State, New York City, the port. \nRight now, unfortunately--and this is well known--we are wide open in \nterms of what can be smuggled into our ports on the Pacific, on the \nAtlantic, and on the gulf coast. God forbid if a nuclear weapon was \nsmuggled in.\n  My good friend from Virginia and I, Senator Warner and I, put in an \namendment in the homeland security bill, and then in Senator Hollings's \nport security bill, to create detection devices to prevent these \nnuclear weapons from coming in. Do you know what we were told? There is \nno money. The President asked that it be taken out.\n\n  How can we say we need to go into Iraq to find nuclear weapons--I \nsupported the President in his move to go into Iraq--and at the same \ntime leave our ports wide open to someone else--al-Qaida, a Chechen--\nsmuggling in a weapon?\n  Again, the amendment of our leader, the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, does not come close to putting the money in we need, but \nhe puts in some. At the same time we are raising the budget for the war \noverseas by tens of billions of dollars, we refuse to even begin to do \nwhat we need on homeland security.\n  Let me say to my friend from New Hampshire, the only bottleneck that \nprevents us from developing a detection device and implementing it on \nevery container, on every toll booth at the northern and southern \nborders, to prevent nuclear weapons from coming in, is money. Again, if \nwe are going to fight this war on terrorism abroad, we need the dollars \nto do it. Everyone agrees. But, somehow, there is a disconnect, and \nwhen we fight the war on terrorism at home, we say there are no \ndollars.\n  God forbid that something happens and we rue the day.\n  One final point. My friend, again, from New Hampshire was saying that \nour first responders in our localities do not need any more money, that \nthe $3.4 billion they put in is enough. I beg to differ.\n  Let me talk about New York City.\n  If you drive over the Brooklyn Bridge, there is a police officer at \neach end of the bridge now. There never used to be. Now that has to be \n24 hours, 7 days a week, to prevent someone from placing a bomb there. \nThat is six police officers--three shifts, 24 hours a day--for each end \nof that bridge and for each end of every one of our bridges.\n  We, in New York City alone--Commissioner Kelly, Mayor Bloomberg--have \nrequested $265 million of this committee, not for anything new, and not \nfor the new equipment that my good friend from New Hampshire talks \nabout, but simply to pay for some of the costs.\n  Let's face it, ladies and gentlemen, the city of New York has been--\nup until now; I hope it does not happen again--their No. 1 target.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator for 2 more minutes to \ncomplete my point.\n  Mr. BYRD. Two more minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We, in New York City, are stretched. I know what is \ngoing to happen. They are going to say: New York City, $265 million out \nof $3.4 billion? That is unfair. Everyone else needs the money.\n  Well, we are the No. 1 target. We don't have enough money for the \nfirst responders. And this is true throughout every part of our \ncommunity--our hospitals, our firefighters. Everyone is stretched. Our \nStates and local governments have no money to do all this. So, of \ncourse, we need more. The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia \ndoesn't do enough, but at least it is a step on the road.\n\n  I could go on and on. I have talked about the northern border, which \ninvolves Customs, INS, and Border Patrol. I have talked about the port \nof New York and all the ports of the country which involve both TSA and \nsome of the scientific research. I have talked about first responders. \nI could go on and on, but I know there is not enough time. We \ndesperately need this money. Let us hope and pray that our stinginess \nin this vital area, where there is no ideological dispute, doesn't hurt \nour people this year or next year or the year after.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is making a lonely and difficult \nfight. He has done it for 6 months. But once again, we will look back \non history and say he was right. We cannot fight a war on terror at \nhome if we don't appropriate the dollars.\n  My good friend from New Hampshire can say we may not need this or we \nmay not need that. In my State, the focal point of terrorism, we are \nnot doing what we should on homeland security because we don't have the \ndollars--plain and simple.\n  I will enthusiastically support the amendment by the Senator from \nWest Virginia, my leader. I hope the rest of the Senate will, too. God \nforbid we regret the day we do not.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Recently, former Senators Rudman and Hart released a report \nthat concluded that American transportation, water, food, power, \ncommunications, and banking systems remain easy targets for terrorist \nattacks.\n  The report highlighted the vulnerabilities created by the miniscule \nfraction of trains, ships, trucks and containers that are searched for \nweapons of mass destruction; poor radio communications and equipment \nand training for police, fire, and emergency medical personnel; \ninadequate coordination and focus on threats to food safety; lack of \nlab capacity to test for biological or chemical contaminants; and \ninsufficient sharing of intelligence information with State and local \ngovernments on potential terrorist threats.\n  Not only has President Bush failed--failed, failed--to lead the \nNation in addressing these vulnerabilities, he has in fact actively \nopposed efforts to provide the resources necessary to address these \nsignificant weaknesses. The record will show that. When it comes to \nhomeland defense, the President is strong on rhetoric and weak on \nresources. The record will substantiate that statement of mine.\n  Under pressure from the White House since September 11, 2001, $8.9 \nbillion of critical funding to address the specific concerns identified \nin the Rudman-Hart report and in our bipartisan Senate Appropriations \nCommittee hearings have been squeezed out of spending bills considered \nby the Congress. In November of 2001, just 2 months after the attacks \nof September 11, the President said: Wait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield myself an additional 2 minutes.\n  The President said: Wait, we can wait until 2003 to begin spending \nmore on homeland security.\n  Now it is 2003. What is the President saying? He is saying: Let's \nwait until 2004.\n  Now the administration is saying we don't need more money for fiscal \nyear 2003 because the administration has not spent some of the money \nthat was appropriated for fiscal year 2002. The administration is \nleaving itself wide open to justified criticism when it maintains that. \nSo it is saying we don't need more money because the administration has \nnot spent some of the money that was appropriated for fiscal year 2002. \nWhat poppycock.\n  If the administration has not spent essential funds approved by the \nCongress over 1 year ago for homeland security, then the Senate \nAppropriations Committee should be holding hearings to find out why. \nWhere does the fault lie? Who is right here? Who is wrong? What are we \ndoing?\n  Very little is being said on the part of the administration these \ndays about protecting the homeland. Everything is go, go, go, go, go. \nThey are sending off our National Guardsmen. We see the tears streaming \ndown the cheeks of the wives and the children and of the guardsmen and \nreservists themselves. We see this on television every day or so. These \npeople are part-time soldiers, but they are full-time community\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\nworkers. They are lawyers. They are doctors. They are firemen. They are \npolicemen. They are State policemen. These people are being sent \noverseas to fight a war in Iraq, an undeclared war on the part of the \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield myself whatever time I need from my time.\n  It is time somebody says something about what is going on in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not for the moment. I will shortly.\n  Mr. President, I don't hear a whimper from the Congress which only a \nshort time ago attempted to give up its constitutional power to declare \nwar to one man. He will determine when, how, and where our military \nforces will be used in an unprovoked war against a sovereign state that \nhas not attacked us in this new doctrine of preemption. It is a new \ndoctrine.\n  This Senator is just not going to take this lying down. I don't care \nhow popular Mr. Bush may be. I answer to my constituents, I answer to \nmy Constitution, and I answer to my conscience.\n  Here we are penny pinching when it comes to protecting the homeland. \nThis administration is not paying enough attention to the protection of \nthe homeland--our country, our people, our institutions, our \ninstallations.\n  I think it is time we called the hand of this administration. If the \nadministration says: We don't need any more money, we are awash with \nmoney, well, then, if the administration has not spent essential funds \napproved by the Congress over 1 year ago for homeland security, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee ought to be holding hearings to find \nout why. Let's find out why.\n  We need these homeland security resources now to meet real needs that \nhave been authorized by the Congress for port security, airport \nsecurity, border security, nuclear security.\n  I understand the Senator would like for me to yield. How much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 34 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished chair. I yield time to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  One of my favorite historians, William Manchester, in writing his \nvolumes concerning the life of a great man named Winston Churchill, \nentitled the second volume ``Alone,'' telling of that period in Winston \nChurchill's career in the 1930s when he stood in the House of Commons \nin England as a lonely voice warning his countrymen of the impending \nperil of what was to occur in World War II. He was ignored. He was \nderided. He was ridiculed. Eventually, history vindicated him.\n  The same will be true of the Senator from West Virginia. I want to \nlet him know, he does not stand alone in this battle. There are many of \nus who believe we need to step up at this moment in time and speak up \nfor not just the defense of America from foes who attack us overseas \nbut the defense of hometown America, the defense of our homeland. It is \nnot enough to create a new bureaucracy and a multi-agency unit with a \nhigh-sounding name, the Department of Homeland Security, and not \nprovide the resources that are essential to protect hometown America.\n  My colleague from New York recounted the challenges in New York City. \nThe same can be said for the city of Chicago and for small towns and \nvillages all across Illinois. Something as basic as establishing a \ncommunications network for police and fire first responders and the \nmedical community is essential to respond to a crisis. The money is not \nthere. My State is deep in debt, as are many States across the Nation. \nThe question is whether this administration will come forward and \nsupport Senator Byrd's amendment to put in a small proportional \nincrease, a small incremental increase in terms of homeland security, \nand to think this would be resisted is an open invitation for critics \nto say this administration supports a hollow homeland security--one \nthat will not be there when we need it. I hope this great Nation and \nour people never face an act of terrorism again. But it is foolhardy \nfor us to ignore the threat of September 11, 2001, and its repetition. \nWe live on Capitol Hill most of our working lives and we know that two \nletters mailed to an office in Capitol Hill containing anthrax cost us \n$20 million to clean up, cost us American lives, and closed down office \nbuildings for months--two envelopes. That is our vulnerability. That is \nthe vulnerability of America.\n  Senator Byrd, you do not stand alone. I hope there are Members across \nthe aisle who will join us in this effort to make certain our \ncommitment to homeland security goes beyond rhetoric.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois. He stood with me when we opposed the Iraq resolution, and we \nstand together today.\n  Let me say this, Mr. President: This is not the last word with \nrespect to sending our men and women across the seas to fight a war \nthat has been unprovoked. We have not been attacked. We will have more \nto say about that later.\n  We do need to protect this homeland. This amendment will do that. The \nSenate is at a crossroads. We face a choice: Will we allow partisan \npolitics to rule the day or will we step up to the responsibility to \nrespond to the growing security crisis facing our country? Of course, \nthis administration is not going to support me in this amendment. The \nadministration has opposed every effort I have made in the past to add \nmoneys for homeland security. The administration, the White House, \nwould not let their key point man on homeland security come before the \nAppropriations Committee in the Senate last year. They said: He is a \nstaff person. Yes, he was, but he was the administration's point man on \nhomeland security. They kept him from coming. Then when we tried to \nappropriate more money--unanimously--in the committee, what did we get? \nWe got veto threats from this administration.\n  Now, what does that tell you about this administration? They don't \nwant to work with the Congress. They want to have it their way all the \nway. They don't want to admit there are weaknesses, admit Congress can \nbe right, and is right on many occasions. No, we don't expect them to \nsupport this amendment. They have not supported our amendments in the \npast.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 29 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I see my distinguished chairman and I will be glad to yield \nthe floor for now.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nAgain, I have to come back to where we are. We are trying to send to \nthe House, in order that we might convene a conference between the \nHouse and Senate, the 11 bills we did not pass last year, governing 11 \ndifferent appropriations bills. The President has to be taken into \nconsideration because we are asking him to sign 11 bills with one \nsignature. Rather than have 11 bills individually come over here from \nthe House, handle them individually in committee, bring them to the \nfloor and handle them individually, take them to conference and handle \nthem individually, pass them by the Senate again individually, and send \nthem one by one to the President, we are asking to play catchup, send \nthem to conference, work it out with the President, within his limits, \nand he will sign the bills and we will put this problem behind us.\n\n  The Senator from West Virginia raises a series of issues about \nhomeland security. This Senator does not dispute the fact that \nadditional funds will be needed for homeland security. For instance, if \nwe go back to the State, Justice, Commerce bill, the section of the \namendment I have put before the Senate contains $11.3 billion for \nhomeland security for State, Justice, Commerce functions only--\nDepartment of Commerce, Department of Justice, Department of State. \nThere is $8 billion for the Department of Justice, $222.7 million for \nthe judiciary, $262.8 million for the Department of Commerce, and $280 \nmillion for the Department of State.\n  Adding another $1.2 billion, as the Senator from West Virginia \ndirects under his amendment, would not be something that can be used by \nthese departments in the 7-plus months that are left--plus maybe a week \nor two--to spend that money.\n  My position is, let's get this behind us. In every instance, there is \nmoney in\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nthe bill that would deal with the issues at the President's level; but \nSenator Byrd wants to increase that money. For instance, for the DC \nemergency response plan, Senator Byrd wants to add $12 million for the \nDistrict's unified communication center. We have $10 million for that \npurpose in this amendment. The President didn't request any money, so \nwe have already added $10 million. Senator Byrd wants to add $12 \nmillion to that.\n  In the District of Columbia, Senator Byrd wants to add $13 million \nfor the bioterrorism hospital preparedness account. We already included \n$10 million in this amendment, and there is $8 million already \navailable from the supplemental passed late last year for the fiscal \nyear 2003. So the District of Columbia has already $18 million for that \nfunction to which the Senator wants to add $13 million.\n  In the civil defense area--this is under the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee--the Senator from West Virginia wants an additional $100 \nmillion for security upgrades for the Army Corps of Engineers. That is \nfor reviewing facilities such as dams, water treatment plants, et \ncetera. We already have $65 billion to be spent in less than 8 months. \nMy friend wishes another $211 million for security upgrades for the \nDepartment of Energy's nuclear facilities. In this omnibus amendment \nbefore us, we have $1.2 billion for that purpose. Even that money will \nnot be spent in the balance of fiscal 2003.\n  It doesn't do us any good to pass bills that contain surplus money \nthat cannot be spent in this fiscal year. This omnibus bill is for \nfunding the balance of fiscal year 2003.\n  For the Department of Homeland Security's national infrastructure \nsimulation and analysis center in New Mexico, the Senator from West \nVirginia wants to add $25 million. The President asked for $20 million. \nWe have increased that to $30 million--more money than requested for \nthat function. We increased it 50 percent already. This agreement is \nnot with the function, it is with the pace of spending. The money the \nSenator wants just cannot be spent in this period of time. I say that \nrespectfully because we have already passed 4 months. At the end of \nthis month, it is 4 months of the fiscal year that is gone. It takes \nabout a month to allocate money, get it out to where people can use it, \nand it takes time to contract it and hire new people to spend it. It is \nnot physically possible, administratively possible, to spend this \nadditional money. The main thing is, if it is needed, we have a \nsupplemental that is coming along. We will be looking at additions to \nthese bills.\n  We will have money in the 2004 bill which will be available in the \nlast 3 months of this calendar year, this coming October 1. I urge the \nSenate to look at each issue.\n  Again, I sat with my good friend when we had those hearings. There \nwas not a person there who did not want more money. I do not remember \none single person who did not want more money. As a matter of fact, as \na father of six, I have had people around me who wanted money all my \nlife. The question is: How much should be allocated, and how fast \nshould they spend it?\n  Now, on this concept of taking the bill and saying, we want to add $5 \nbillion to this omnibus amendment I have, we will take it back into the \nsame fight we had last year, the same thing that delayed us last year, \nand it will delay us so we cannot even get to the battle for the 2004 \nappropriations bills.\n  Not to be disrespectful to my friend from West Virginia, but I urge \nthe Senate to not approve this amendment that really does not solve the \nproblem. The problem is, how do we catch up with the appropriations \nprocess? How do we face up to the fact that the last Congress did not \npass 11 of the 13 bills?\n  I admit I have suggested a rather abrupt and arbitrary procedure, \nputting them all together in one package, but I did not do it alone. \nEach of the subcommittees reviewed every single line in these bills.\n  I put into the Record last night the summary of the reports that \nwould have been prepared had we brought out 11 separate bills so that \neverybody can see where this money is intended to go.\n  Very clearly, it is designed to go to conference with the House. As \nwe go to the conference with the House, I hope we can have a wide-open \nconference that deals with the issues, and it may be that some of the \nitems that Senator Byrd wants will be brought to us by the House. I do \nnot know, but I know every issue the Senator wants to cover goes into \nconference. We have rule 28, and those things will be in conference. \nThey can be increased if the conference wishes to do so.\n  I know of no instance where anyone has come to this Senator and said \nthe amount of money that is in this omnibus bill is not enough to \nfinish their functions for fiscal year 2003. There are a lot of them \nwho want more money, but there is not one of them who said, we cannot \nsurvive with that amount of money.\n  We have ample money for every function of homeland security that I \nknow of in this bill, and we should not confuse the issue. The \nSenator's amendment does not address how much money is required for \nhomeland security but whether we should go beyond the President's total \nrequest for homeland security.\n  As I mentioned in several instances, we have recommended more than \nthe President requested, but we offset it with cuts from other areas. \nUnfortunately, the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia does not \noffset at all. It adds to the bill. There are no offsets. So we do not \nhave a budget resolution. We ought to have agreed to that level right \nafter the election, and had we had the chance to move before then, \nSenator Byrd would have had the job I have of coming down to that \nlevel.\n  Now the gavel has shifted, but the problem has not changed, and I am \nasking the Senate to do what I think Senator Byrd would have asked last \nNovember/December had we gotten to the point where we are now, actually \nconsidering the bills on the floor.\n  Again, I do not want to put all of this in the Record, but, again, I \nwill put the summary in the Record in terms of the charts I have \nprepared. We have covered these functions. We have funded the functions \nfor the amount that the subcommittees, working with the staff of both \nRepublicans and Democrats, believe is sufficient to carry this through \nuntil October 1 of this year, fulfilling the obligation to fund the \nfiscal year 2003 functions of Government.\n  If we do not do this now, there is not one agency that is going to \nget any money until at least the end of March. It would be a miracle \nfor any one of these bills to pass before the end of March.\n  My suggestion is, let's take it to conference now, and if anyone \nwants to come in and convince the conference that something is \nunderfunded, do it. These are the collective recommendations of the \nstaff, the chairmen, and ranking members of these subcommittees as to \nhow they would live under this lid of $750.5 billion, as I agreed to \ndo, staying within the President's level, get it to him, and let him \nsign the bills.\n  Don't misunderstand me. The President is not too happy with this \nomnibus package either because there are lots of items that are \nincreased and others decreased in terms of his requests. It is not over \nuntil the pen moves, until the President signs the bill.\n  I think the only place we can get to the point where he will sign the \nbill is in conference, and I urge the Senate not to approve this \namendment and not to approve the other amendments. Let's take this \nomnibus package to the conference and work with our counterparts in the \nHouse on a bipartisan basis and fashion a bill that the President will \nsign.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I realize my leader is in the Chamber and wishes to speak \non leader time, and we have other Senators who wish to speak. How much \ntime do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to my distinguished friend, and he is \nmy friend, but remember that my friend from Alaska said in December a \nyear ago: Now, 4 months have already passed. We have 8 months. Let's \nwait until 2003. We have already gone through 4 months. Let's wait \nuntil 2003.\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\n  Now we are hearing the same argument, may I say, from my dear friend: \nLet's wait until 2004.\n  We cannot wait.\n  The distinguished chairman refers to the fact that the President will \nnot like this either. Well, I accord this President the same respect I \naccord any other President. This President is not infallible, nor is \nany other President we have ever had.\n  The problem with what I see in this administration is they want to \nhave it their way with every comma, semicolon, colon, and hyphen. They \ndo not want the Congress to come forward with anything. They are \nagainst anything we propose. They have been against everything we have \nproposed thus far.\n  Let's take their own argument and turn it on its head. Congress has \napproved $365 billion for Defense. That is a lot of money. We have \nnever squeezed a penny. We have never denied Defense anything. We do \nnot deny the Defense Department anything they want. When they come up \nand want more money, we give them more money, almost without questions \nasked.\n\n  On top of the $365 billion for Defense that we have provided, this \nbill adds $3.9 billion. That is $3.90 for every minute since Jesus \nChrist was born.\n  Can the Defense Department spend that money? My distinguished \nchairman asks, can this Government responsibly spend this additional \nmoney that Senator Byrd is asking for in this amendment? Well, I ask \nthe same question: Can the Department of Defense spend the money? Can \nit spend $3.9 billion more? Yes.\n  We are adding $5 billion for homeland defense on homeland security--\nthe security of your people, Mr. President, my people, my children, our \ninstallations, our institutions, our borders, our country. Can we spend \nthat money, $5 billion for homeland defense and homeland security? Yes, \nthey can spend it, and spend it well.\n  Let something happen, and then we will see what the polls show. If \nsomething happens, let the American people then take a look backward \nand see how this Congress sought to add monies for border security, for \nairport security, for homeland security, for port security. Those are \nmonies the administration threatened to veto. It turned its back on \nthem. It turned its back on the $2.5 billion last year. The President \nrefused to sign a bill that provided $2.5 billion for emergency \nplanning. He turned the back of his hand. He turned his back on his own \ncountry when he turned down that opportunity to give $2.5 billion for \nhomeland security, to put it in the hands at the local level, the law \nenforcement people, the health personnel, the people at the local \nlevel. He flatly rejected it. Let something happen, and then see what \nthe polls show. Then see where the questions are asked. Then hear what \nthe answers will be. I say a stitch in time saves nine.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use leader time that I have under \nthe order of the day.\n  Let me begin by congratulating the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia for his eloquence and for his leadership on this critical \nissue. As we consider all of the priorities we ought to be concerned \nabout in this bill, there is no priority of greater import than the \nhomeland defense of this Nation. I have immense respect for the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I admire the way he works \nand his dedication to his work and the leadership he provides. I can \nonly surmise this would not be his package, either, had he had the \nopportunity to do this on his own. He is forced to work with an \nadministration and people in the House that have different priorities. \nI understand that.\n  We have differences and disagreements with regard to priorities, but \nthere should not be any disagreement under the Constitution as to what \nthe most important priority is. It is to protect and defend this \ncountry against enemies, both foreign and domestic. That is what the \nConstitution says. They leave no doubt, our Founding Fathers, about \nwhat our priorities ought to be as we consider budgets, as we consider \neach year what should be our priorities under fiscal management. Over \nthe course of the last couple of years we have turned to experts to \nask, How are we doing with that constitutional responsibility in light \nof 9/11?\n  The Conference of Mayors, under the leadership of President Tom \nMorino, said about a year ago: It has been 16 months since 9/11, and \nthe Congress has still failed to deliver public safety money for first \nresponders. They vote for tax cuts for special interests but deny \ncities and States money for critical programs. Washington, he said, is \nout of step with the rest of the country.\n\n  We asked two of the most respected experts in the Senate, former \ncolleagues, to give their evaluation of how it is we are doing as we \nattempt to protect this country against enemies both foreign and \ndomestic. Their response: America remains dangerously unprepared to \nprevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil.\n  We hear from the experts. We hear from those people who are charged \nwith the responsibility of ensuring that first responders have the \nability to do what our constitutional obligations require. Today what \nSenator Byrd is proposing is we put our money where our mouth is, that \nwe make the commitment required to live up to those constitutional \nobligations.\n  I find the current circumstances in the Senate absolutely bizarre \nbecause, on one hand, we are told by our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle that we can afford a tax cut of the magnitude almost equal \nto what we passed 2 years ago. Take the President's recently proposed \ntax package, add to it the cost of interest, and add to that his \nproposal that we make those tax cuts permanent, and you come to about \n$1.3 trillion. Now they tell us we can afford that. We can pass this \n``leave no millionaires behind'' bill. We can do that. We can somehow \nfind the resources to give more tax breaks to 226,000 millionaires, but \nwe do not have $5 billion to live up to our constitutional obligations. \nThat is bizarre. That is, in my view, one of the most preposterous \npositions anyone could come to the Senate floor and take.\n  Yet that is exactly what I hear our Republican colleagues saying. I \nhave a handout I was given this morning from the Republican caucus. It \nsays: Homeland security funding, and it lays out the reasons why \nSenator Byrd's amendment ought not be supported by Senators on their \nside. It says the Byrd amendment is well-intentioned but unaffordable.\n  Unaffordable? Five billion dollars is unaffordable? Unaffordable, \nwhen we know we have to provide smallpox vaccine? Unaffordable, when we \nknow we have to ensure that we synchronize the police and fire \ncommunication systems and have the emergency planning? Unaffordable, \nwhen we see cuts in Coast Guard programs and our efforts to try to \nprotect our ports and bridges and infrastructure? Unaffordable, when we \ncannot find the money to ensure that we can even deal with the security \nquestions we are facing right now in protecting our nuclear facilities \nand our water and other unique needs to every community in the nation? \nUnaffordable? That is preposterous. This debate is bizarre. For the \nlife of me, I cannot understand how anyone can say in light of their \nadvocacy of a $1.3 trillion tax cut that defending this country, as the \nConstitution requires, is unaffordable.\n  I hope our colleagues think very long and hard about how unaffordable \nthis is. God forbid anything happens in the coming months. God forbid \nwe once again experience what we did on 9/11. I would think we would do \nexactly what Senator Byrd is proposing, and even more. I think $5 \nbillion is just the beginning for what we are going to be required to \ndo to make this country safer and stronger and to live up to those \nconstitutional obligations.\n  If we do not start now, in this fiscal year, when do we start? Tell \nthe mayors they cannot spend the money. Tell our firefighters and our \npolice officers, they cannot spend the money. Tell all of those who are \nconcerned about responding to whatever eventuality there may be, they \ncan't spend the money. I have not found one yet who has given me that \nanswer. When I ask them, Do you need more resources, they say yes, I \nneeded them yesterday. Yes, if we are going to defend our water system, \nand if we are going to defend all of our facilities and our \ninfrastructure in this country; I needed that money a year ago. Yes, I \nneed the money.\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\n  But for Heavens' sake, if anyone can say with a straight face that we \nought to spend $1.3 trillion more on tax cuts, they ought to be able to \nsay yes, we have $5 billion to protect our homeland, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield? Does the Senator still have time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am sure I do.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I say to the leader, how long ago was it we \nheard the President of the United States saying, no price is too great \na price to pay for freedom? Right? When they talk about war in \nAfghanistan, they talk about war in Iraq, no price is too great a price \nto pay.\n  Where are those voices now from the administration? Where are the \nvoices that say no amount of money is too much to pay? What about this? \nWhat amount of money is too much to pay for homeland security? Who \nknows but when the first shot ricochets in the war against Iraq--which \nCongress is not declaring--when that first shot is fired, is it \npossible we may hear some shots fired in our own country; that we may \nsee the terrorists come out of hiding; we may see them come from the \nveil; we may see them come forward? What will happen then? What will \nhappen then to this Capitol?\n  What saved this Capitol from being demolished on September 11? A few \nbrave men and women on that plane that went down in Pennsylvania saved \nthis Capitol. Who is to say that these terrorists--we don't have them \namong us now? Who can say there are not terrorists out here now, \nwaiting, just waiting, waiting for the moment?\n\n  And here the people downtown, when it comes to homeland security, \nwhen it comes to the protection of our homeland, when it comes to the \nprotection of our families, when it comes to the protection of our \nchurches, our schools, our stores, our jobs--aha, $5 billion is too \nmuch to pay, too much to pay; we don't need it.\n  If you don't need it, don't spend it, and let's have some hearings as \nto why it isn't spent.\n  No price is too much to pay. No price is too much to pay for the \nsecurity of this great land of ours.\n  I thank the distinguished leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would just say to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia that he is absolutely right. This city has heard a lot of \ngreat speeches since 9/11, but I keep thinking of Teddy Roosevelt who \nsaid: ``Speak softly but carry a big stick.''\n  What I find this administration doing is speaking loudly and carrying \na small stick. It is a small stick when you consider what they are \ndoing with homeland defense. What you want to do is give them a bigger \nstick. What you want to do is send as clear a message as we can that we \nare willing to commit the resources of this country to carry out the \nrhetoric that we have heard so often on the floor of the Senate and in \nevery one of these State of the Union Messages. We have to match our \ncommitment in resources to the rhetoric we hear from our leaders.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is what you are doing.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have heard various accounts of how much \nthe war in Iraq will cost. The accounts range from $60 billion to $250 \nbillion, a quarter of a trillion dollars. That is the wide range of the \ncost of a war in Iraq. A resolution passed here saying the President \ncould go to Iraq when he believed it appropriate.\n  It seems to me that if we can spend up to a quarter of a trillion \ndollars to go into the Middle East, we can spend a paltry $5 billion to \nmake sure that my people in Nevada have some semblance of protection.\n\n  Would the leader agree that if we can spend hundreds of billions of \ndollars going to Iraq, we can afford, we should spend, $5 billion to \ntake care of the people in South Dakota, West Virginia, Montana, \nNevada, Alaska, Kentucky--the States of the Senators I see on the floor \nhere now?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator from Nevada makes a very important \npoint. I have about 1,000 people from South Dakota who are now in the \nPersian Gulf, who are awaiting further orders from the President of the \nUnited States and from the Pentagon with regard to what may occur in \nthe Middle East and in Iraq in the next couple of weeks.\n  Of course, I want to provide whatever resources are necessary to see \nthat they are protected and that they have the ability to do their job. \nBut I ask, if we are willing to make that commitment to those fighting \nthe war in the gulf, why aren't we willing to make the same commitment \nto those fighting the war here at home? Why aren't we willing to \nprovide the resources to the police and the first responders and to all \nof those who are fighting just as critical an effort to defeat \nterrorism here at home?\n  Why do we say we have the money for the people in the gulf but we \ndon't have the money for the people here at home? Are they less \nvulnerable? Is their role less important? Do they have some degree of \ndisadvantage because they are here at home? I think the Senator from \nNevada makes a very critical point in the argument here. If we have the \nresources and if we have the commitment to fight terrorism, regardless \nof whether it is abroad or here at home, we ought to have the resources \ncommensurate with that commitment.\n  What the President is saying is we don't have that kind of commitment \nhere at home. That is inexcusable. And it is especially inexcusable \nwhen he says we have the resources for a tax cut of the magnitude they \nare considering today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes, and then I want to \nyield to the distinguished Senator from Washington.\n  I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his contribution \ntoday. I thank both the leader and the assistant leader for what they \nhave contributed to this debate.\n  Mr. President, we talk about sending our troops, men and women, \nfathers, brothers, husbands, wives, overseas to fight a war in Iraq. We \ntalk as though it is just a video game. Nobody raised a question. We \ndon't hear a whimper--not a whimper.\n  We see the pictures on television every day. These people are going \naway. We see them kissing. We see them waving goodbye. We see them \nshedding tears. We know that those tears are shed at night on those \npillows. There seems to be no thought to the sacrifices that may be in \nthe offing for this country. They talk as though it is a video game, \njust a matter of pushing a few buttons and we will win.\n  Well, now, we may be lucky. If we go to war, we may be lucky. I hope \nwe will be lucky. But what if we are not lucky? Where will those who \nare silent now be? Why don't they raise their voice now? Why don't we \nask questions?\n  I am not one to be driven in a hole. We hear a lot about driving them \nin the holes and we will go in and get them. Our men--our men--will go \nin and get them. We talk about driving the enemy into holes in \nAfghanistan and in Iraq--we will drive them into holes.\n  I yield myself as much time as I may consume.\n  We will drive them in the holes; we will go get them. Who is ``we''? \nIt is not I. I don't think I will be going in those holes, driving \nanybody out. It is going to be those poor men and women who are giving \nup their salaries as lawyers, as doctors, as teachers, as security \npeople, as law enforcement people, as firemen--they are the people who \nare going in those holes in Afghanistan. They are the people who are \ngoing to go into those holes and bringing out the enemy.\n  We talk as though it is a video game. I hope and I pray to God that \nif we do go to war with Iraq, we will be lucky. I hope Saddam will \ncatch the first plane out to Libya or to some other country. I hope he \nwill. But what if he doesn't? We have to contemplate that.\n  So I think it is our responsibility here in the Congress to do two \nthings at least: Raise questions, and provide the money for the \nsecurity of this homeland. We don't know what will happen to this \nhomeland once we open fire in the hot sands of the deserts in the \nMiddle East. We don't know what may break out in this country. Are our \nwater resources fully protected? Are\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\nour energy resources fully protected? Are our nuclear facilities fully \nprotected? Are our borders secure? Are our ports secure? Are our \nairports secure? Are our people secure? No. And here we strain at a \ngnat and swallow a camel when it comes to fighting and protecting \nourselves on the homeland.\n  How many here, right here in this Chamber today, will feel secure in \nthis very Chamber in the future? I say we had better stop, look, and \nlisten while there is time to stop, look, and listen. I will have \nplenty more to say on that subject.\n  But on the subject of homeland security, let it not be said that we \nare not doing our very best to give this administration all the tools \nit needs, all that it can possibly usefully use, all that it can \npossibly efficiently use, to protect this homeland of ours. And who \nwill say that this land is fully protected? Who feels secure in this \nhomeland of ours today? Ask your wives. Ask your mothers if they feel \nsecure. And here we are, quibbling over $5 billion.\n\n  Nobody is going to put you in jail if you don't spend it. But if you \nneed to spend it and don't--don't have it, and if you haven't spent it \nalready, why haven't you? Surely we are not perfect. Surely we are not \nabsolutely secure.\n  Mr. President, how much time does the Senator wish?\n  How much time does the Senator from Washington want?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I simply ask for 1 minute, or 2, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair indicate at what time the vote will occur as \na result of Senator Daschle having spoken?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is estimated right now by the \nParliamentarian that 12:44 will be the time for the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I came to the floor last night to give \nextensive remarks about the tremendous importance of the amendment that \nhas been offered by Senator Byrd in the area of transportation for port \nsecurity, airport security, and transit security. I have been listening \nto the debate this morning.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to refute a critical misstatement that \nhas been made about the amendment that has been offered by Senator \nByrd. It was argued by my friends on the other side of the aisle that \nthe funds in this bill are all over and above the funding requested by \nPresident Bush. I need to tell my colleagues that in the area of \ntransportation that is just simply not true. In the underlying bill, \nthe funding level for the Transportation Security Administration is \nsome $460 million short of what is needed to fully fund all of the \ncongressionally directed initiatives, as well as fully fund the \nsecurity requests of the Bush administration. It is a simple \nmathematical fact. This amendment that has been offered by Senator Byrd \nprovides $460 million for the TSA needs to fully fund what President \nBush has requested for the Transportation Security Administration. \nWithout the amendment offered by Senator Byrd--if we enact this without \nthat--the TSA will have to cut $460 million to make way for the \ncongressional mandates that all of us have worked on, supported, \npassed, and told our constituents are coming. The only way to fully \nfund what President Bush has requested for screening passengers at our \nairports and purchasing the explosive-detecting machines is by \nproviding the funding for the Byrd amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for yielding me a minute to \nclarify this critical point--that we need to have this amendment to \nfully fund President Bush's request, particularly in the area of \ntransportation security.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWashington for clarifying a very critical point. I thank her, and I \napologize to her for keeping her waiting. She has been on the floor \nwaiting to make this correction. I am glad she made the correction. I \nhope that Senators will carefully study what she has said. She has \npointed to a yawning flaw in the argument of the other side. I thank \nher for her contributions to her country.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, once again Senator Byrd has taken up the \nfight to fund adequately our homeland security needs. I supported his \nefforts last year, I voted with him today, and I will continue to back \nhis efforts to sufficiently fund out security needs in the future.\n  Last year the Senate included supplemental funding for homeland \nsecurity needs but the President refused to spend those funds. The \nSenate Appropriations Committee wanted to spend an additional $8.3 \nbillion, but the administration only agreed to spend $4.2 billion. The \nPresident effectively vetoed $2.5 billion in emergency funding for \nhomeland security last August. We hear reports that our country is no \nmore secure today than we were on September 10, 2001, but the \nadministration refuses to spend the funds required. This administration \nseems to believe that wisdom can only come from one end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue.\n  The $5 billion in this package goes for hiring and salaries for FBI \nand Customs Agents. It purchases more patrol boats for the Coast Guard \nand improves port security. This money will help transform the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service and improve security at our \nembassies around the world. Almost $150 million will go out to our \nfirst responders through the COPS program, one of the more effective \ncommunity policing programs. There are important funds in this package \nto protect and secure important Army Corps of Engineers infrastructure. \nWe need to protect our dams and water projects from potential attacks \nor tampering.\n  There is also significant funding to improve our transportation \ninfrastructure. There is $300 million for improving security at \nairports and hardening cockpit doors. These two issues are critical to \nimproving safety in the air. We know these changes have to happen, and \nshould have happened a long time ago. We can't afford to waste any more \ntime. Two years have passed and we cannot say that our aviation network \nis safe from a terrorist attack.\n  This money meets real, documented, legitimate demands. These needs \nhave been testified to in hearings, they were exposed in the Hart-\nRudman report, and the agencies themselves have asked for these funds \nbut have been denied by the Office of Management and Budget. I \nunderstand that some on the other side of this issue are concerned that \nthe money will not be spent correctly, that we are forcing these \nagencies to grow too quickly. I believe we have a duty to give the \nagencies an opportunity to do their job. We have a duty to give the \nagencies all the tools they need to protect the American people. I \nwould rather be accused of trying to do too much, than not enough.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, there is nothing more important than \nAmerica's homeland security. I support Senator Byrd's amendment because \nit provides essential funds for hometown security.\n  It will improve our ability to prevent terrorism, through stronger \nport security, border security, and transportation security. And it \nwill improve our ability to respond to acts of terrorism by giving \nfirst-responders the tools they need.\n  Local communities are on the front lines in our war against \nterrorism. They must not bear the full cost of this war. This means \nCongress must do its share by providing funds for: local law \nenforcement, first responders and public health professionals; extra \nsecurity for critical infrastructure like public water supplies; and \nimproved communications systems.\n  This amendment accomplishes six important things. First, it improves \nport security, airplane cockpit security, and airport security by \ngiving the Transportation Security Administration $1.64 billion. It \npermits INS to better monitor who is coming into our country by giving \nthem $363 million to develop an entry/exit system. It enables community \nlaw enforcement agencies to upgrade communications equipment by \nproviding $100 million through the COPS program. It ensures that the \nChildren's National Medical Center here in DC can expand their \nquarantine and decontamination facilities for children and families by \ngiving the Center $8 million. Senator Byrd's amendment allows states to \nenhance\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\ntheir chemical response capabilities by giving them $9.5 million. \nFinally, the amendment assures that 10 million doctors, nurses, and \nfirst-responders will receive the smallpox vaccination this year by \ngiving $850 million to state and local health departments.\n  Without this additional funding, States will be forced to cut back on \nother critical public services, such as putting more police officers on \nthe streets to fight ``everyday'' crime, or tracking West Nile virus \ncases. I have received dozens of letters pleading for promised Federal \nassistance for first-responders. For example, Laurel, MD continues its \nefforts to organize and prepare their regional emergency services to \nrespond not only to terrorism but to all local emergencies. Since \nSeptember 11, Laurel has had to use their limited resources to respond \nto several critical events, a tornado on September 24, 2001, and the \nsniper shootings that required them to be on extended heightened alert. \nDespite this, Laurel continues to prepare its emergency service \nproviders to respond to the various alerts and incidents that continue \nto occur. Baltimore, MD also has the additional task of securing large \npublic arenas such as Camden Yards and Ravens Stadium against terrorist \nattacks.\n  This is why it is so important that we pass this amendment. Cities \nare on the front lines in preparing for, and responding to, acts of \nterror. Who are the people on the front lines? They're police, \nfirefighters, EMS and public health responders. Firefighters in \nMaryland alone need $40 million for equipment, training and personnel \nprotective gear. Our law enforcement officers play a critical role in \ndetection and prevention, and must also have equipment, training, and \nbetter information from federal agencies to do their jobs. By investing \nthis money today, we get double value, more money to prepare for \nterrorism means more money to fight crime and fires.\n  My own State of Maryland has made great strides in preparing our \nNation against a terrorist attack, but communities need this additional \nfunding to make sure they are combat ready and fit-for-duty. Let's \nprotect the protectors and keep our promises to the warriors on the \nfront lines of this new war against terrorism.\n  That is why I support homeland, and hometown, security, and I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to strongly support the \namendment by the Senior Senator from West Virginia to restore funds \napproved by the Senate Appropriations Committee last year to enhance \nour homeland security.\n  The Byrd amendment would be giving law enforcement the tools they \nneed to do their job, focusing on both immediate and long-term threats \nwe face at home and abroad. It aims to bolster our security against \nterrorists, and to improve the administration of justice throughout the \ncountry.\n  This Federal support is desperately needed by our States, counties, \ncities and towns, which are now facing fiscal crisis.\n  Since September 11, 2001, States, counties, cities and towns have \nbecome overwhelmed by increasing homeland security costs. The National \nGovernors' Association estimated that States incurred about $7 billion \nin security costs in the past year alone. The National Association of \nCounties believes at least $5.2 billion is needed to better equip \npublic health systems to cope with attacks and fight terrorism.\n  The President's ill-conceived tax cut in 2001, along with the new \ncuts he proposes now, are likely to exacerbate these economic woes.\n  The Byrd amendment would provide the Federal support that our States \nneed by restoring $1 billion in homeland security cuts, restoring $2.5 \nbillion of emergency homeland security funds, and funding the Airport \nSecurity Act, all critical needs.\n  The Byrd amendment would also provide needed funding to protect our \nborders. Through the USA Patriot Act and the Enhanced Border Security \nand Visa Reform Act, a Democratic Senate led the fight to dramatically \nincrease authorizations for personnel and technology to guard our \nnorthern border. Unfortunately, the appropriations package before us \nwould shortchange that pressing need.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment includes an additional and much-needed $83 \nmillion to enforce our immigration laws and safeguard our borders, \nincluding funding to provide pay upgrades for Border Patrol agents and \nImmigration inspectors. We are asking more and more of our border \npersonnel, and we must reward them for their hard work or risk losing \nthem altogether.\n  In addition, the Byrd amendment expands the COPS program by providing \n$150 million for grants to law enforcement and first responder agencies \nfor improved communications systems. I know that Senator Gregg and \nSenator Hollings, the new chairman and ranking member of the Commerce, \nJustice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, understand that \ncommunication is key to coordinated and effective law enforcement \nefforts. I thank them for their past bipartisan support in my home \nstate for upgraded communications systems for better law enforcement.\n  This year marked an unfortunate turn after a decade of remarkable \ndeclines in the Nation's crime rate. The decade of progress we made \nunder the leadership of President Clinton and Attorney General Reno \nhelped revitalize our cities and restore a sense of security for \nmillions of Americans. According to the latest FBI report, however, the \nnumber of murders, rapes, robberies, assaults, and property crimes is \nup across the United States, the first year-to-year increase since \n1991.\n  It is troubling that, at this crucial moment, the Bush Administration \nis proposing to reduce by nearly 80 percent the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services, COPS, program that has helped to put 115,000 new \npolice officers on the beat since 1994 and Byrne grants to State and \nlocal law enforcement. I believe that we must fight to maintain and \nextend the COPS program and Byrne grants, which has proven its value in \nincreasing the security of our cities, towns, and neighborhoods.\n  I am a strong supporter of Senator Biden and Senator Specter's \nbipartisan bill to reauthorize the COPS program, which the Senate \nJudiciary Committee approved unanimously last year only to have an \nanonymous Republican hold put on it to prevent final passage. I hope we \ncan finally reauthorize the COPS program this year since it has proven \nto be such a crime-fighting success.\n  As we provide the necessary tools for federal law enforcement \nofficials to protect our homeland security, we must remember that State \nand local law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency \npersonnel are our full partners in preventing, investigating and \nresponding to criminal and terrorist acts.\n  As a former State prosecutor, I know that public safety officers are \noften the first responders to a crime. On September 11, the Nation saw \nthat the first on the scene were the heroic firefighters, police \nofficers and emergency personnel in New York City. These real-life \nheroes, many of whom gave the ultimate sacrifice, remind us of how \nimportant it is to support our State and local public safety partners.\n  In addition, the ``Comprehensive Homeland Security Act of 2003'', S. \n6, and the ``Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act,'' S. 22, \nwhich Senator Daschle introduced on behalf of the Democratic Caucus and \nwhich I am proud to cosponsor, establish the First Responders \nPartnership Grant program, which will provide $4 billion in annual \ngrants for each of the next 3 years to support our State and local law \nenforcement officers in the war against terrorism.\n  First Responder Grants will be made directly to State and local \ngovernments and Indian tribes for equipment, training and facilities to \nsupport public safety officers in their efforts to protect homeland \nsecurity and prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. Grants may be \nused to pay up to 90 percent of the cost of the equipment, training or \nfacility, and each State will be guaranteed a fair minimum amount. This \nis essential Federal support that our State and local public safety \nofficers need and deserve.\n  Our State and local public safety law enforcement partners welcome \nthe challenge to join in our national mission to protect our homeland \nsecurity. But we cannot ask State and local law enforcement officers, \nfirefighters and emergency personnel to assume these\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\nnew national responsibilities without also providing new Federal \nsupport.\n  The Byrd Amendment is an essential down payment and with the First \nResponders Partnership Grant Program, which I hope the Senate will turn \nto and enact without delay, we can provide the necessary federal \nsupport for our State and public safety officers to serve as full \npartners in our fight to protect homeland security and respond to acts \nof terrorism.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from West Virginia \nfor his leadership in providing the resources needed to enhance our \nnational security.\n  One of the most important aspects of the Byrd amendment is the \nadditional resources it will provide to protect America from the threat \nof bioterrorism. The anthrax attack of a year ago has made all \nAmericans aware of the grave threat posed by biological weapons. We \nknow, for example, that terrorists bent on savage destruction may well \nhave access to the smallpox virus, one of the deadliest plagues ever to \nthreaten humanity.\n  Faced with this obvious danger, it is essential for Congress to \nprovide adequate funds to our hospitals, medical professionals, and \ncommunities. They need to act now to prepare for this threat.\n  In a few days, thousands of health and emergency workers will be \nasked to roll up their sleeves and be vaccinated against smallpox. \nThere is a cleave need to inoculate health care workers, so that they \ncan quickly vaccinate millions of Americans in the event of an \noutbreak, as a CDC advisory committee has recommended to the White \nHouse.\n  We need to protect the safety of those who receive the vaccine. We \nneed to provide financial assistance to the communities that will bear \nthe expense of giving the vaccine to thousands of workers. We need to \nprovide compensation to those who are injured by the vaccine and \nguarantee their medical care.\n  Smallpox vaccination must be coupled with effective education and \nsafety programs to minimize the risks to those receiving the vaccine \nand to their communities. The health of those receiving the vaccine \nmust be closely monitored. Recipients of the vaccine must be educated \nabout its risks and potential benefits. All of these essential elements \ncost money.\n  The Nation's health departments and hospitals should not have to \nimplement the smallpox plan by taking from other vital health \npriorities or risking their financial viability.\n  Just this month we've seen new figures that the current death toll \nfrom the flu has surpassed that from HIV/AIDS. Senior citizens around \nthe Nation may have to go without flu vaccinations if local health \ndepartments are spending their immunization budgets on smallpox. Women \nmay not receive needed screenings for breast cancer because scarce \nfunds are being siphoned away. Certainly, we must enhance our \nhomeland's security, but we must not purchase security at unacceptable \nprice of missed immunizations or reduced care for those most \nvulnerable.\n  The cost of implementing the smallpox plan should not be reducing \nefforts to enhance our preparedness for other forms of biological \nattack. Public health organizations report that many communities are \nthinking of following the example of Seattle and Arlington, VA, where \nalmost all other bioterrorism preparedness activities have been \nsuspended in order to free up funds for smallpox vaccinations. The \nMassachusetts State Laboratory Institute has had to divert $110,000 \nfrom preparedness planning, $165,000 from epidemiology, $125,000 from \nexpanding disease tracking networks, and $261,000 from health education \nand information, all to fund the new smallpox plan.\n\n  These diversions of funding may be just the tip of the iceberg. \nAlthough the direct costs of the smallpox plan are large, the indirect \ncosts may be even larger. Even with the best safety measures, some \nindividuals will be injured by the vaccine. Military personnel \nreceiving smallpox shots can rest assured that anyone injured by the \nvaccine will get the best of medical care. We should do no less for the \ncivilian heroes who put their lives on the line to safeguard our \nsecurity. It would be shameful for the Federal Government to encourage \nany American to receive the vaccine, and then deny proper care for the \nconsequences.\n  Yet this is just what the current plan would allow. Instead of \nassuring medical care to vaccine recipients, the plan relies on the \nuncertain coverage of the private insurance market or workers' \ncompensation programs to provide care. If a health care worker who \nvolunteers for vaccination has no coverage or has inadequate coverage, \nthey are out of luck, and that is wrong.\n  Nor does the plan provide an assured system of compensation for those \nwho are injured by the vaccine or for health workers who must take days \naway from work to protect their patients from the risk of accidental \ntransmission of the live virus in the vaccine. Instead, the plan forces \nclaimants to sue the U.S. Government in Federal courts, where they face \nthe arduous task of proving that their injuries were due to negligence.\n  The Byrd amendment takes the steps that are necessary to deal with \nthese problems. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia provides \nalmost $1 billion to help communities around the Nation implement the \nadministration's smallpox plan. I urge my colleagues to approve the \nByrd amendment and devote adequate resources to protecting not only \nsafety of the Nation, but the health and safety of those who defend it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment proposed by Senator Byrd, which would restore a portion of \nthe devastating cuts to this year's Senate-passed appropriations \nmeasures that are contained in the pending Republican omnibus \nappropriations package.\n  In my own State of Maryland and across the Nation, State, local, and \nregional authorities are struggling to make even the most basic of \nhomeland security improvements. In many cases, these communities have \ntaken exhaustive measures to identify their areas of greatest \nvulnerability, and have made commendable advances in enhancing their \nown preparedness and response capabilities.\n  Last year, this body made a series of nearly unanimous legislative \ncommitments to assist these local security efforts in several important \nareas. Moreover, while the House of Representatives passed only a \nportion of its spending measures, the Senate completed action on all 13 \nof its own appropriations bills. After months of hard work on behalf of \nboth my Democratic and Republican colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee, difficult decisions were made, and spending levels were \nagreed to. Contained in these bipartisan commitments was critical \nFederal support in several key homeland security areas.\n  The Republican omnibus appropriations proposal slashes an astonishing \n$9.8 billion in Federal support--funding that was overwhelmingly agreed \nto in the Senate during the 107th Congress. A disturbingly large \nportion of these cuts--approximately $1 billion--were made in the area \nof homeland security. Senator Byrd's amendment would restore this \nimportant funding.\n  Maintaining these funding levels becomes even more critical in light \nof the regrettable decision made by President Bush this past summer to \nshort-change many of our vital security needs by not spending $2.5 \nbillion in emergency supplemental funding passed by the Congress. \nSenator Byrd's amendment would also restore much of this important \nsupport.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we have become \nincreasingly aware of the woefully inadequate safeguards to our \nNation's 361 seaports. Last November we took a significant first step \nin improving this aspect of our homeland security by passing the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act. I joined 94 of my Senate \ncolleagues in supporting the passage of this measure, and the bill was \nsigned into law by President Bush soon thereafter.\n  A critical section of this legislation reaffirms the importance of \nproviding funding to the Nation's seaports for security upgrades. The \nomnibus appropriations package introduced yesterday by my Republican \ncolleagues would cut this program significantly. Senator Byrd's \namendment would restore these dangerous cuts, providing $585 million \nfor port security grants to implement the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\nAct--which, I again remind my colleagues, we overwhelmingly approved a \nmere 2 months ago.\n  In my own state of Maryland, the Port of Baltimore is an important \nand vulnerable point of entry for the country. Indeed, handling over 30 \nmillion tons of cargo each year, it is one of the busiest seaports on \nthe East Coast. Clearly, the volume and traffic associated with this \ndistinction present considerable security challenges for the port. \nWhile the port has made important progress in this area, the grants \nprovided are vital for making some of the most basic of security \nupgrades.\n  Unfortunatley, the cuts made in the Republican spending package are \nnot confined to our Nation's seaports. As the outgoing chairman of the \nCongressional Fire Services Caucus, I have heard many of the concerns \nof first responders in Maryland and around the country.\n  First responders were devastated last summer when they learned last \nthat the President would be withholding $100 million in grant funding. \nAnother $155 million was withheld from State and local law enforcement. \nNow we learn that the administration and my Republican colleagues are \nproposing further cuts to the Senate-approved funding for first \nresponders. This time, first responders would lose an additional $132 \nmillion. This amendment would merely provide some of the basic promises \nthe Congress has already made to those Americans who we call on to \nprovide our most vital emergency preparedness and response needs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Byrd's \namendment. If the Congress and the administration are to enact \nlegislation signaling our commitment to securing the homeland, we must \nprovide the resources to provide even the most basic levels of \nprotection. We must demonstrate steely resolve in our efforts to \nprotect our citizens and critical infrastructure, and this will not be \nachieved if the resources committed to the task are inadequate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Byrd's \namendment to increase funding for homeland security.\n  A little over a year ago, we experienced the worst terrorist attack \nin U.S. history. As a result, we began to examine where our country had \nsecurity weaknesses and work to prevent another attack. Unfortunately, \nthe appropriations bill brought forward by the Republicans does not \nfund homeland security to the level that is needed, which is I why I \nsupport Senator Byrd's amendment.\n  Since the September 11 attacks, the State of California and its \ncities and counties have spent almost $600 million on homeland \nsecurity, on emergency operations and response, on protecting \npowerplants and water supplies, on fire and emergency medical services.\n  Our States and cities and counties need our help. The Federal \nGovernment cannot abdicate its responsibility. Yet last year, after \nCongress passed $5 billion in funding to improve homeland security at \nthe national, State, and local levels, President Bush refused to spend \nthat money. It is still needed.\n  Let me mention just a few things the Byrd amendment does.\n  It increases funds for port security by $585 million. Last year, I \nwas a member of the Port Security Conference Committee. We ended up \nwith a good bill to improve security at our Nation's ports. But, there \nwas no way to pay for it, despite my efforts and the efforts of \nChairman Hollings. To get the money to our ports, we need to rely on \nthe appropriations bill, so the additional funding in the Byrd \namendment is crucial.\n  For over a year now, I have been calling for the Federal Government \nto protect first responders--police, firefighters, emergency personnel, \nnurses, and doctors--by immunizing them against smallpox. If terrorists \nwere able to unleash smallpox in the United States, these people would \nrisk their lives to save us and protect us. We need to protect them \nnow. The Byrd amendment provides $850 million to immunize first \nresponders against the smallpox virus.\n  The amendment would also increase funding for the Coast Guard for \npatrol boats by $40 million. The Coast Guard has many important \nmissions including homeland security, drug security, and environmental \nwork. After September 11, Coast Guard resources needed to be shifted. \nWe now need to provide the Coast Guard with the necessary patrol boats \nto protect our coastline and ports as well as undertake its other \nmissions.\n  The amendment includes $200 million for airports for the installation \nof the baggage screening machines. Screening of all baggage was \nrequired as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which \nbecame law in November 2001. Estimates for the cost of installing these \nmachines are, at a minimum, $2 billion. Los Angeles International \nAirport estimates that it will spend $135 million, San Francisco $65 \nmillion, and Oakland $16 million. So I support the $200 million that \nSenator Byrd proposes. This is only a downpayment.\n  Congress has also required that cockpit doors be reinforced. But the \nairlines, for a variety of reasons, are in a difficult financial \nsituation. Senator Byrd's amendment would provide $100 million to \nstrengthen the cockpit doors. Let's not let another terrorist gain \ncontrol of an airplane.\n  Every day millions of people across the Nation take public transit to \nwork. We need to ensure that these people are protected from a \nterrorist attack. Senator Byrd's amendment does just that by providing \n$300,000 in grants to public transit agencies.\n  One of the problems in the aftermath of the September 11 attack was \nthat first responders often could not communicate with each other. This \namendment provides $150 million to first responders in our local \ncommunities in order to improve communications. That way, if there is \nanother attack, and we all hope there will not be, we can rescue and \nsave as many people as possible.\n  The Byrd amendment also increases funding for border security, for \nfood safety, and for the FBI.\n  The Byrd amendment is vital for our nation's security for our \nhomeland security, for the security of our cities and towns. I urge all \nSenators to vote for it to ensure that we can prevent more terrorist \nattacks.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled that the Bush \nadministration has not done more since September 11, 2001, to close \nmajor gaps that remain in our domestic security. Senators Gary Hart and \nWarren Rudman, who presciently predicted a major terrorist attack \nwithin our borders before it actually happened, produced a new report \nlast September in which they observed that ``America remains \ndangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic \nterrorist attack on U.S. soil. In all likelihood, the next attack will \nresult in even greater casualties and widespread disruption to American \nlives and the economy.''\n  This is a sobering prediction. And it has convinced me to make it a \npersonal priority and mission to ensure that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has the resources it needs and deserves.\n  The fact is homeland security costs money, to train people in the \nskills they need, to buy the right equipment, and to pay the men and \nwomen in every community across America, on police forces, in fire \ndepartments, and emergency medical services, who are our front line \ntroops in the war against terrorism here at home.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors reported last year that cities will \nhave already spent more than $2.6 billion on additional security costs \nbetween September 11, 2001, and the end of 2002, with precious little \nhelp from the Federal Government.\n  Seventeen months after the September 11 attack, thousands of \ncommunities across the country have been unable to press ahead to meet \nthis awesome security challenge. Our firefighters are left holding the \nladder. Our police departments are put in fiscal handcuffs. Washington \nis demanding expensive new programs without offering States the \nfinancial support to implement them. And the States, according to the \nNational Governor's Association, are already experiencing their worst \nbudget crises since World War II.\n  Governors will have a harder time developing and implementing \nemergency preparedness plans. And local communities may not even be \nable to pay for critical security projects and programs that are \nalready underway. Federal agencies, too, are being underfunded, with \nthe Customs Service, the Coast Guard, and others coming up hundreds\n\n[[Page S1015]]\n\nof millions of dollars short of what they need to protect us.\n  Indeed, it may surprise some people, though not the first responders, \nto know that all the money appropriated by Congress in the days \nimmediately following the terrorist attacks in 2001 has not reached its \ndestination, and the administration has exercised no leadership that I \ncan see to speed up the process. For example, according to a December 2 \nreport from the Office of Management and Budget, FEMA had obligated \nonly $33 million out of some $214 million in budget authority for \nStates for emergency management planning and assistance. That is truly \nshameful.\n  A year ago, in his fiscal year 2003 budget, President Bush proposed \nspending $3.5 billion on first responders for training, equipment, and \nplanning to respond, if necessary, to a major terrorist attack. Of \ncourse, none of that money has been appropriated, and now, as we try to \nresolve outstanding fiscal year 2003 appropriations, I am distressed to \nlearn that our Republican colleagues are seeking to cut $1 billion from \nthe homeland security funding levels Senate appropriators agreed to \nlast year.\n  Homeland security cannot be had on the cheap. Therefore, I am proud \nto cosponsor Senator Byrd's amendment. This amendment would make good \non our promises to put in place critical new programs to boost homeland \nsecurity and, most important, to help State and local governments and \nfirst responders bear the costs of their front-line responsibilities in \nthe war on terrorism.\n  First, it would provide the full $2.5 billion in homeland security \nfunding in last summer's emergency supplemental appropriations bills. \nThis is money, for first responders among others, that was approved by \nCongress but which the President blocked from actually being spent.\n  The amendment also restores about $1 billion in cuts to the fiscal \nyear 2003 spending bills below what Senate appropriations agreed to \nlast summer and fall.\n  Finally, the Byrd amendment provides money for critical new programs. \nIt includes $850 million to help States and localities implement the \nPresident's smallpox vaccination plan. Another $585 million would go to \nimplement the new port security law, legislation that passed \noverwhelmingly in November but which to date has not been funded. We \nwill not be any more secure if we just pass these security blueprints, \nthen walk away.\n  Taken together, the amendment will provide $1.4 billion to State and \nlocal governments, including grants to make first responder radio \nequipment compatible, a priority ever since we learned of the \ncommunications problems that hampered September 11 rescue workers.\n  The amendment will provide an additional $1 billion for border \nsecurity, including funding new initiatives to identify suspicious \ncontainer traffic and to keep track of who enters and exits our \nborders.\n  I truly hope the Bush administration hasn't settled on a strategy to \ntalk tough on homeland security, while withholding the money necessary \nto make that security possible. So far, their approach has been all \ntalk and little action, but we can't defend the country on words alone.\n  It is time to make our commitment to our domestic defenses ever bit \nas strong and bipartisan as our commitment to our Armed Forces. If we \nwon't do that now, with September 11 still fresh in our minds and \nhearts and our communities still struggling to protect themselves, when \nwill we?\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support Senator Byrd's amendment \nto add $5 billion in homeland security funding to the omnibus \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2003. I cannot be here for the \nvote, but if I were, I would vote in favor of the amendment. The Byrd \namendment provides funding for several critical initiatives aimed at \nstrengthening our efforts to protect America and its interests. It is \nunbelievable to me that the President can propose a $674 billion tax \ncut, but can't make a sufficient investment in homeland security. When \nI look at the important programs that this amendment would support, I \ncan't fathom that the Senate won't pass it. It is imperative that we \nprovide the resources necessary to protect this Nation. Vulnerabilities \nexist in our homeland security infrastructure and we should not \nsquander a single day addressing them. An independent task force, \nchaired by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman, recently \nadvised that ``America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and \nrespond to a catastrophic attack on U.S. soil.'' We must act to ensure \nthat the functions needed to better protect our borders, coasts, \ncities, and towns have sufficient resources to do so.\n  The Byrd amendment would provide more money to states and localities \nto implement President Bush's smallpox vaccination plan, to make the \nradio equipment of first responders interoperable, and provide \nemergency planning and training for terrorist attacks. It would make \ncritical investments in our preparedness for biological attack. It \nwould also fortify our borders by funding such things as additional \nCoast Guard patrol boats and improvements to the INS entry and exit \nsystem. The Byrd amendment also fully funds the newly created \nTransportation Security Administration so that our airports are made as \nsecure as possible. Mr. President, last year I was very involved in the \ndevelopment of the new port security law, and I am pleased that the \nByrd amendment includes funding to help implement these new rigorous \nsecurity requirements for our ports. Finally the Byrd amendment \nprovides resources to secure nuclear weapons and materials and conduct \nvulnerability assessments for energy supply and distribution systems.\n  The funding that the Byrd amendment provides for the Transportation \nSecurity Administration is critical to our national security. Given the \nvulnerabilities that we know exist in our port and airport security, I \ncannot imagine that this body would opt to provide insufficient funding \nto address these problems. The need to fully fund the TSA cannot be \noverstated; installing baggage screening equipment in the top forty \nU.S. airports alone is expected to cost billions, and to date only one \nmajor airport has installed the necessary equipment mandated by the \nAviation Security Act. Mr. President, we cannot hope to maintain the \nconfidence of the American people in our ability to secure the nation's \ntransportation system if we fail to adequately fund the legislation \nwe've passed to achieve that goal. These investments are essential if \nwe are to be fully protected from those who threaten our freedom.\n  Our task is to make America more secure. We cannot allow the \nRepublican omnibus appropriations bill to undermine the war on \nterrorism and we must pass the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to correct some \ninaccuracies that were stated by my colleague from Nevada during last \nnight's session regarding nuclear security and Senator Byrd's amendment \nto increase funding for homeland security. My friend from Nevada came \nto the floor and argued that this body should support Senator Byrd's \namendment because our Nation's nuclear facilities are ``inadequately \nprotected.'' After hearing this statement, I felt it was my duty as the \nchairman of the Clean Air, Climate Change, and Nuclear Safety \nSubcommittee to set the record straight on the security of our Nation's \nnuclear facilities. This is an area that I have worked hard to \ninvestigate and fully understand. I urge my colleagues to also spend \ntime carefully reviewing the existing security controls at our Nation's \nnuclear facilities before they rush to any judgments. The best way to \ndo this is to go and visit the facilities in order to see the security \nmeasures in practice.\n  Last August, I visited the Davis Bessie Nuclear facility in Oak \nHarbor, OH, for the purpose of reviewing the operations of the plant. I \nwas extremely impressed with security measures in place to gain \nentrance and access to the facility. Also this last April, I had the \nopportunity to spend a half day at the Perry Nuclear Power Plant in \nPerry, OH to specifically review their security systems. I received a \nclassified security briefing at the facility, which I highly recommend \nto all of my colleagues. In addition, I participated in personnel and \nvehicle searches, and I\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\nreviewed the external security systems, including meeting with the \nCoast Guard which patrols Lake Erie off the coast of the Perry \nfacility.\n  My tour of the security operations confirmed for me that every \nsecurity measure is being taken to protect our energy supply from \nterrorist attack and the members of the surrounding community should be \nvery comfortable with the level of security that protects them and the \nfacility. In fact, if I were a terrorist the last place I would try and \ntake over or attack would be a nuclear powerplant with the security \nmeasures at Perry and Davis Bessie. This past fall, I visited the EU \nHeadquarters at The Hague in Brussels. I was impressed with the \nsecurity required to gain entrance to the facility, but it didn't \ncompare to the security at Perry and Davis Bessie nuclear plants.\n  In addition to these visits, I have participated in several committee \nhearings on nuclear plant security and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nincluding a classified security briefing. While I have found the \nsecurity measures to be impressive, this does not decrease my resolve \nto remain at the forefront of this issue and ensure the safety of these \nfacilities. Last Congress, I supported the Nuclear Security Act of 2002 \nin the EPW Committee. In the 108th Congress, I will continue to look \nfor ways to improve our excellent security at our Nation's nuclear \npowerplants.\n  Nuclear energy is important to our Nation's economy and environment. \nAmerica's nuclear energy industry currently provides approximately 20 \npercent of our energy. It is a safe, reliable, and zero-emission source \nof energy that is an important part of our energy future.\n  I agree with my colleague that we have an obligation to the American \npeople to ensure the safety of these facilities. I have and will \ncontinue to scrutinize the security at our Nation's nuclear plants. \nHowever, I disagree that this is an appropriate argument for this \ndebate on homeland security funding. I urge my colleagues to look at \nthe facts and go and see for yourself the efforts of these plants.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to myself.\n  In this new world, we face a new kind of war--a war on our shores, a \nwar that is different in scope and intensity from any that we have ever \nfaced before. The enemy is no organized army. There is no organized \narmy of infantry, or artillery. The enemy is not an organized army with \nmaps and bayonets. The enemy follows no rules of engagement. The enemy \nheeds no Geneva Convention. Their weapon is fear. Their application is \ndestruction.\n  We cannot stand idly by and put our total faith in some new \nbureaucracy. We ought not be lulled into complacency that the hope of a \nnew government department may eventually make us safer.\n  This Congress has the responsibility to protect the American people. \nThat responsibility lies here as well as downtown in the executive \nbranch. This Congress has the responsibility to protect the American \npeople. This Congress has the responsibility to invest the dollars \nwhere they are most needed and to focus on the Nation's many serious \nvulnerabilities. But by blindly supporting the arbitrary figures that \nare undermining the package before this Senate, we take a dangerous \ngamble with the lives of the American people. And we do not have that \nright. We do not have the right to take that danger and gamble with the \nAmerican people. The White House does not have that right. The \nPresident of the United States does not have that right. Let him come \nbefore the cameras of the electronic eye. Let him say to the American \npeople that you are secure and you don't need more money; that we don't \nneed to spend another dollar; and that we don't need to spend any more \nthan we have.\n  I can be mistaken, and I am often mistaken. I don't maintain that I \nam always right. But I maintain that we have a duty to protect our \npeople. I maintain that in the Appropriations Committee we conducted \nhearings--lengthy hearings. We heard from administration witnesses. We \nheard from the people at the local level. We heard from mayors. We \nheard from Governors. This Appropriations Committee, when I was in \ncharge, unanimously voted out these bills appropriating moneys. Time \nand time again, this administration turned the back of its hand to the \nCongress and in so doing to the American people because the people in \nthe Congress are the elected representatives of the American people. \nThe people in the Congress are the elected representatives of those \ntaxpayers out there who send us here. We don't come here at the bidding \nof any President. No President can say when I have to go home or when I \ncan come to this place. The people of West Virginia determined that, \nand they are my bosses.\n  No President is infallible. But this administration, more than any \nadministration that I have seen in my 50 years in Congress, maintains \nthat it is right; that it is always right; that Congress is wrong, \nalways wrong.\n  We are coming to some very difficult showdowns in this country. Who \nknows what may happen in the days ahead?\n\n  This legislation would cut investments in homeland security. I \nappreciate the work and the effort Senator Stevens and his staff have \nput into this package given the arbitrary constraints placed on them by \nthe White House. But the Senate should not allow itself to be \nhandcuffed by the political advisers inside the White House. Who are \nthey? To whom do they answer? They answer to the President of the \nUnited States, I guess. They do not answer to the American people.\n  We should not accept the hundreds of miles of our northern and \nsouthern borders remaining unguarded. We should not accept the alarming \ndeficiencies in our seaport security, an area that many experts have \nidentified as perhaps the Nation's single greatest vulnerability. We \nshould not accept the fact that first responders and local doctors and \nnurses do not have sufficient training and equipment to handle wide-\nranging threats involving madmen who may have gotten their hands on \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  This Senator from West Virginia is not now nor will he ever be \nprepared to accept those dangers. This Senator is prepared to do \nwhatever it takes to close the gaps and to protect the American people. \nI urge my colleagues to join me.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the threat of a terrorist attack has only \nincreased. It has not decreased. Administration officials have said \ntime and time again that another terrorist attack will happen. It is \ninevitable, they say, and it could involve weapons of mass destruction.\n  Last September, the administration raised its terrorist alert system \nto its second highest level and closed nine embassies for security \nreasons.\n  Last October, the FBI warned of terrorist attacks against railroads.\n  Last November, the FBI warned hospitals in Houston, Chicago, San \nFrancisco, and Washington of an imminent terrorist attack. The CIA \ndirector warned of terrorist dangers, and testified that once war \nbegins in Iraq--hear me now, hear me--the CIA director warned of \nterrorist dangers and testified that once war begins in Iraq, Islamic \nextremists will likely increase their effort to attack us here at home.\n  It is not to be a video game. Oh, praise God that we will be lucky. \nWe could be. I hope we will be.\n  Last December, the administration reported that Islamic extremists \nassociated with al-Qaida may have taken possession of chemical weapons. \nCanadian intelligence told us that al-Qaida was plotting attacks from \nCanada.\n  An increasing number of terrorist warnings threats to the use of \nweapons of mass destruction against us, a war with Iraq that could \nescalate the threat level, yet this Congress and this President process \nall of that information and conclude that the best place to find \nsavings is in the funding for homeland security funds. That is simply \nastonishing.\n\n  Our borders remain dangerously unguarded. They leak like a sieve. We \ndon't know if terrorists have crossed into the country, as we saw over \nthe New Year's holiday, when the FBI was frantically looking for \nsuspected terrorists. Do you remember that? They were frantically--\nfrantically--looking for suspected terrorists who they later concluded \nhad not entered the country after all. Yet this administration wants to \ncut border security funding by $705 million.\n  The Customs Service is able to inspect only 2 percent--at most, 5 \npercent--of cargo entering this country.\n\n[[Page S1017]]\n\nWe know terrorists could smuggle weapons of mass destruction into our \nports, either to blow them up and cause massive economic and physical \ndestruction or to explode those weapons within the interior of the \ncountry near a major city. Yet this Bush administration wants to cut \nport security funding by tens of millions of dollars. Astonishing? Yes, \nastonishing.\n  The FBI lacks the law enforcement personnel to track potential \nterrorists and disrupt potential terrorist cells already based inside \nthis country. Yet this White House--this White House--the Bush \nadministration wants to cut money for Federal law enforcement personnel \nby more than $250 million. Irresponsible? Yes, irresponsible.\n  The President has suggested that a smallpox attack is a big enough \nrisk to the American public that a smallpox vaccine should be made \navailable to the public by the beginning of 2004. Yet this President \nknows that State and local governments lack the necessary funding to \nadminister the smallpox vaccination plan, let alone provide for the \nhomeland security protections for which the State and local governments \nare responsible. Never mind. This administration wants to cut aid to \nthe States by more than $500 million.\n  Our nuclear facilities remain dangerously exposed. Yet this White \nHouse, this administration, seeks to cut funding to protect our nuclear \nfacilities by more than $230 million.\n  Airport security, mass transit security, cybersecurity, water \nsecurity, embassy security, food safety--these are all critical \nvulnerabilities and yet the administration wants to whack those moneys \nby a total of $1.5 billion.\n  Then, on top of all of those reductions, this bill has an across-the-\nboard cut of 1.6 percent for each and every Federal law enforcement and \nhomeland security initiative across this country. It is a shameful \nway--a shameful way--to fund the protection of this Nation.\n  Sound policy decisions cannot possibly be driving these spending \ncuts. Clearly, these programs need more money, not less. The \nadministration cannot blame these decisions on growing budget deficits \nbecause that same administration now argues that deficits don't matter.\n  It is politics. The administration chose an arbitrary number last \nyear, and it is twisting the arms of the Congress to stick to it. The \nresult is a disaster for homeland security programs.\n  While our troops overseas are equipped with high-tech gadgets to \nfight our enemies, our troops left at home will have to defend us with \nmeager resources. Our troops in the desert are bouncing their \ncommunications off satellites, while our homeland defenders may have to \ncommunicate with twine and coffee cans. This may sound ridiculous, but \nit is much closer to the truth than many of us would like to believe. \nWhen it comes to fighting overseas, this administration's attitude is: \nSpare no expense. There is no pricetag on freedom. But when it comes to \nfighting the war here at home, this White House, this administration, \nprefers to shop in bargain basements.\n\n  Delays of this funding for a few months, until the next fiscal year's \nappropriations bills, translates into more than a calendar year. By \nwaiting for the next fiscal year, we would force first responders to \nwait for help until the calendar year 2004. By waiting for the next \nfiscal year, we force our airports and our seaports to struggle with \nsecurity until the calendar year 2004. These delays do not serve any \nconstructive purpose, and they certainly do not help to protect \nAmerican lives. If we provide these moneys, the oversight committees \nshould do their job to ensure that the agencies invest these dollars \nquickly and effectively.\n  The amendment I have proposed would invest funds where they are most \nneeded. First, it would restore the $1 billion in reductions in \nhomeland security initiatives made from the original committee-passed \nappropriations bills and for which every member of the Appropriations \nCommittee voted. Second, it would restore much of the $2.5 billion in \nemergency homeland security funds that passed this Congress \noverwhelmingly in the summer but was vetoed by this White House.\n  Finally, this amendment would fund the priorities that Congress has \nfound so necessary and that President Bush has already signed into law. \nThis amendment would fund the border security authorization bill that \npassed the Senate 97 to 0 and that the President signed last May. This \namendment would fund the port security authorization bill that passed \nthe Senate 95 to 0 and that the President signed into law last \nNovember. This amendment would provide funds--hear me now--this \namendment would provide funds for the 10 million smallpox vaccinations \nthat this administration has mandated from State and local health \nprofessionals.\n  These dollars address our most critical needs, Mr. President. These \nfunds would help to shore up our defenses and could save lives here at \nhome.\n  We are in new and dangerous times. No attack should be deemed so \nunlikely that it can be ignored. The men and women who send us here \ndemand that we protect them, that we protect our country first. The \nfathers and mothers who send their children to school each morning \nexpect us to invest the dollars to keep their little precious ones \nsafe. That is a solemn duty that lies on the conscience of every man \nand woman Member of this body. It is a basic and sacred duty. And may \nGod forgive us if we so cavalierly fail in our duty to protect our \npeople, the American people.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute twenty seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute twenty seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First, I commend the very able Senator from West \nVirginia for this amendment. This is an extraordinarily important \namendment. If we are going to provide for homeland security, we must \nprovide the resources for homeland security; otherwise, it is all a \ncharade.\n  I wish to focus on just one thing. I represent a great port, one of \nthe world's great ports. In fact, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia worked in the Port of Baltimore in World War II.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Contributing to the war effort in the construction of \nLiberty ships.\n  We passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act last year; 95 to 0 \nI believe was the vote in this body. But what good does that bill do us \nif we do not have the resources with which to carry out the promises \nand the concepts that are contained in the legislation?\n  Mr. BYRD. Right. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What good does it do us if we pass this legislation on \nhomeland security, we beat our chests about it, and then we don't \nprovide the resources? The Senator's amendment will provide the \nresources to carry out this legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. It will. It will.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I very strongly support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from West Virginia has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the time of the Senator from \nWest Virginia has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the majority whip, and he has allowed me \nto read a letter Senator Byrd has asked me to read into the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. This letter is from the American Public Health Association, \naddressed to the Honorable Robert Byrd.\n\n       Dear Senator Byrd: On behalf of the American Public Health \n     Association (APHA), the largest and oldest organization of \n     public health professionals in the nation, representing more \n     than 50,000 members from\n\n[[Page S1018]]\n\n     over 50 public health occupations, I write in strong support \n     of your amendment that would provide an additional $850 \n     million to assist state and local governments with \n     implementing the Administration's smallpox vaccination plan.\n       States and localities are preparing to vaccinate more than \n     500,000 public health and hospital response teams. Should the \n     risk be elevated to merit the need for a broader smallpox \n     vaccination program, significant new resources will be \n     required. Beyond vaccinating workers, funding will be needed \n     to educate volunteers, monitor adverse events, treat \n     complications and train personnel.\n       APHA believes this additional funding is essential to \n     provide local health departments with the resources they will \n     need to implement the Administration's plan without having to \n     divert scarce funds and staff away from other important \n     bioterrorism preparedness and public health programs. At a \n     time when many states are facing large budget deficits, it is \n     essential that the federal government assist state and local \n     governments in undertaking this expensive and labor intensive \n     task.\n       APHA also believes that those who volunteer to receive and \n     administer the vaccine must be protected from liability and \n     compensated for vaccine-related injuries that result in \n     medical costs, lost wages and pain and suffering. We hope \n     that Congress will address these issues as soon as possible.\n       Thank you for your efforts to address this important issue \n     facing our nation's public health system.\n\n  The letter is signed by George C. Benjamin, Medical Doctor, Fellow of \nthe American College of Physicians, who is executive director of the \nAmerican Public Health Association.\n  I thank my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I announce for the information of all \nSenators it would be our intent to yield back the balance of the time \nat 12:30 so the vote can commence at that time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time \non this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. All time has \nexpired.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 2 offered by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL, I announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID, I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), and the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Conrad), the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would each \nvote ``aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 2 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Conrad\n     Edwards\n     Hagel\n     Kerry\n  The amendment (No. 2) was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in order to give Senator Byrd a chance to \nreview the amendment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mikulski be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for 10 minutes and that I retain the \nfloor thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Mikulski are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have an understanding with Senator \nByrd. He will have the floor to offer the second amendment, if he \ndesires to do so. We await that decision.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment Senator Byrd will offer now be subject to a time agreement \nunder which Senator Byrd has an hour and a half for his amendment and I \nhave one half hour in rebuttal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I add to that request that this amendment not be subject \nto second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 90 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. On the last amendment, what was the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the last amendment, the vote was 51 to 45; \n45 ayes and 51 nays.\n  Mr. BYRD. How many absentees were there on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There were three on the minority side not \nvoting, one on the majority side not voting.\n  Mr. BYRD. One Democrat voted against my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 8\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I make another plea to my colleagues, and I \nspeak on behalf of the American people in doing so because it is their \nsecurity I am talking about. By all let this be heard, by Democrats as \nwell as Republicans. I make this last plea to my colleagues with \nrespect to homeland security. If they will not allow the Government to \ninvest $5 billion to protect the lives of the American people from \nterrorist attacks, at least let us invest in the most obviously \nvulnerable segments of our infrastructure.\n  Now listen to me, colleagues. You are going to have to answer to the \nAmerican people for your vote. Democrats are going to have to answer \nfor their votes. Republicans are going to have to answer for their \nvotes. You may say, well, I am ready. That is all right. You be ready. \nYou be ready. And the record will follow you. The record will follow \nyou.\n  You cannot nonchalantly say: Well, we had a caucus and we decided we \nwould have a party-line vote; we would\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\nstand against Senator Byrd's amendment and we would oppose all \namendments, et cetera, et cetera--if that is the case. That may be OK \nhere, but wait until the American people look at the record. It was \ntheir safety that you are compromising when you voted against this past \namendment. I am surprised that we had any votes at all, at least from \nthis side of the aisle, against that amendment. But every Senator has \nto answer to his own conscience and to his own people. I respect that \non any Senator's part.\n\n  I will send up an amendment in due time, and I understand the time is \nlimited on this amendment whether I send it up or not, so that is \nunderstood to start with.\n  In the past year and a half, this Senate, and indeed the entire \nCongress, have voted overwhelmingly for authorization bills that commit \nfunds for the protection of the American people. This Senate and the \nentire Congress have voted overwhelmingly for authorization bills that \ncommit funds for the protection of the American people.\n  In November 2001, this Senate, by a 100-to-0 vote, approved the \nFederal Aviation Security Act: a vote of 100 to 0. The President signed \nthis legislation amid great fanfare--how sweet it is. Oh, it was great \nto pass the legislation. But despite the high-toned rhetoric, the \nresources to implement this act have been denied.\n  Last May the Senate passed the U.S. Border Security Act under an \narray of great speeches, noteworthy speeches. Oh, the speeches, I can \nhear them yet. I can hear the reverberation of those stentorian tones--\nthe reverberations around this great Chamber and outside the Chamber as \nwell, and other places.\n  The border security bill passed the Senate 97 to nothing, and the \nPresident very accommodatingly and happily signed that legislation into \nlaw. So with a flourish of the pen it became law, a flourish of the pen \nin the mighty hand of the chief magistrate of this country, a great \nflourish of the pen. Headlines in the newspaper, excellent paragraphs \nas to the comments that were made, worthy of keeping in our scrapbooks, \nmay I say.\n  And then this past November, by a vote of 95 to 0 again--95 to zero? \nWhere was the opposition then? A vote of 95 to zero the Senate passed \nthe Port and Maritime Security Act, giving approval for massive \ninvestments at the Nation's seaports. And, again, the Commander in \nChief--if I may use that term, if I may pluck that term out of the \nConstitution--the Commander in Chief signed the bill into law.\n  Despite these overwhelming bipartisan votes, despite the stentorian \nrhetoric that came from many voices that spoke as though they had lungs \nof brass, despite that great rhetoric that accompanied the signing of \nthese bills, the resources have been slow in coming, to say the least. \nAs a result, our Nation's defenses against terrorist attack have \nremained vulnerable--vulnerable. You better ponder that word.\n  I have seen more than 85 summers. More than 85 years have passed; 50 \nof those 85 years have been spent in the Congress of the United States. \nNever have I seen a Congress that has been more recreant in its duty to \nstand up against an executive branch that looks with utter contempt on \nthe elected Representatives of the people in this, the legislative \nbranch.\n  People downtown, many of them it seems, feel that the legislative \nbranch is beneath the dignity of the executive branch. They have \nnothing but contempt for this branch.\n  So when this branch comes forward with recommendations as to what is \nneeded to ensure the people's security, the executive branch turns the \nback of its hand to the recommendations of the legislative branch. And \nit has done that repeatedly, time after time, over the past year.\n\n  The fact of the matter is that the Senate Appropriations Committee in \nthe 107th Congress did its work. It passed all 13 appropriations bills. \nIt did so responsibly. It did so in a bipartisan fashion, in a fashion \nthat was remarkably bipartisan. What we have before us is not merely \nthe last year's committee-passed bills for fiscal 2003 with a nip here \nand a tuck there to address new budgetary circumstances. The bills that \nare now before us are shaped around policy completely divorced from \nreality.\n  Mr. President, the Chamber is empty. I, too, would like to be sitting \nsomewhere. It is not easy. It is not easy to make this fight. But who \ncares whether it is easy or not. That is not important. I will give the \nlast vestige of my strength to stand and speak on behalf of the \nsecurity of the American people. I am putting this amendment before the \nSenate today, and I am asking Senators to carefully weigh the amendment \non behalf of the American people. It is not easy. But never was I more \nwilling to expend my limited energies and my frail voice on behalf of \nthe safety of the American people than I am here today.\n  I know that what I am saying will fall upon deaf ears in some \nquarters. But the bill before us now, let me say again, was shaped \naround sound policy that is completely divorced from reality. If we are \nto be treated to speeches touting what this administration can do when \nit controls the Congress, perhaps we should take a close look. The most \ntelling example of what we are in for is demonstrated in how these \nappropriations bills treat domestic security.\n  Just yesterday, two distinguished Members of this body, the senior \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the senior Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison, released a report from the General Accounting \nOffice that examined the vulnerabilities in the Nation's air cargo \nsystem.\n  Let me say that again. Two distinguished Members of this body on \nyesterday, the senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the \nsenior Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, released a report from the \nGeneral Accounting Office that examined the vulnerabilities in the \nNation's air cargo system.\n  The GAO found that while 22 percent of the Nation's air cargo is sent \non passenger aircraft, very little of that cargo is ever inspected.\n  Listen to that. How many Senators have ridden on cargo planes? I \nhave. Does it make one pause to reflect upon the fact that so little of \nthat air cargo is ever inspected?\n  Your life and the lives of others who ride those cargo planes are in \nthe hands of God. He isn't getting much help from this administration, \nand He isn't getting much help from the Congress of the United States \nas reflected by this last vote, for example.\n  The GAO found that while 22 percent of the Nation's air cargo is sent \non passenger aircraft, very little of that cargo is ever inspected.\n  The GAO reported that:\n  First, there are simply not enough safeguards in place to ensure that \nsomeone shipping air cargo under the existing protocols has taken the \nproper steps to protect against the use of that shipment by terrorists.\n  Second, cargo tampering is possible at various points where shipments \ntransfer from company to company.\n  Third, air cargo handlers are not required to have criminal \nbackground checks and do not always have their identities verified.\n  Fourth, most cargo shipped by air is never screened.\n  How many more attacks, how many more warnings, how many more reports \nwill it take before this Congress awakens, before it believes that this \nNation is seriously at risk?\n  Instead of simply paying lipservice to the many vulnerabilities in \nthis Nation, it is time to invest real resources to protect the \nAmerican people from terrorist attack. We cannot nickel and dime the \nprotections of American lives. Think of your own. National security \nrequires national investments. We hear that freedom has no price. The \nsame can be said of safety--the safety of the American people. The \nsafety of the American people should have no pricetag.\n  The lessons from September 11, 2001, are clear--as clear as the \nnoonday Sun on a cloudless sky. Terrorists live among us, and they \ntraverse our open borders with relative ease.\n  We know that the enemy prefers weapons fashioned from the ordinary \ninfrastructure of modern life--trucks, trains, planes, mail delivery, \nenvelopes in the mail, ports, energy sources, cyberspace, spent nuclear \nmaterials, and one can go on and on. All of these, we are told, can be \neasily adapted to cause death, sudden death and destruction, fear and \npanic.\n  At home, our technology is deficient, with outdated computers in key \ngovernment agencies unable to easily\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\ntransmit vital information back and forth.\n  Last April and May, in 5 days of hearings, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee heard testimony that indicated our adversaries could cripple \nthe U.S. economy without great difficulty and without enormous cost. It \ncan be done on the cheap.\n  The warnings have been prolific. The warnings that have come down \nfrom the various agencies of this administration have made it clear \ntime and again that we are at great risk. This country is at great \nrisk. With these warnings in mind and with the realization of the many \ngaps in our homeland security network, the men and the women of this \nCongress are playing Russian roulette with the safety of our people \nunless we take immediate steps to protect American lives and to avoid \nfuture tragedies.\n  I could go on and on. But Senators already know where we are \nvulnerable--border security, airport security, port security. We are \nwell aware of the gaps in our protections. If we know where those gaps \nare--if we know where those gaps are--you can be sure that the \nterrorists know where those gaps are.\n  Further delay is unconscionable. Further delay on the part of the \nelected representatives of the American people is unconscionable. This \nis not a time for politics. We may think we can play politics. But this \nis not something with which we can play politics. Further delay is \nunconscionable.\n  That is why I offer an amendment that is smaller in scope and more \nnarrowly defined than the one that was just considered by the Senate \nand defeated by the Senate. This amendment, which I shall shortly send \nto the desk, would fund the core mandates of the authorization bills \nwhich the Congress last approved and the President of the United States \nhas signed into law. What are they? The Airport Security Act, the \nBorder Security Act, the Seaport Security Act. Let us match the \nrhetoric with resources. Let us fulfill the promises that we made to \nprovide the necessary funds when we voted for and last passed those \nauthorization bills and when they were signed.\n  I urge Senators to expedite this much needed assistance for our \nNation. We must not turn our backs on the efforts to bolster our \nweaknesses, on the effort to address our vulnerabilities, on the effort \nto protect American lives, the lives we say may be our own.\n\n  Now, the amendment which I am going to send to the desk shortly, I \nshall explain. This is the summary of the amendment.\n  This amendment provides $500 million for aviation security--get that, \n$500 million for aviation security--to implement the law signed by \nPresident Bush in November of 2001.\n  The amendment directs $750 million for border security to implement \nthe law signed by President Bush in May 2002.\n  The amendment invests $500 million for seaport security to implement \nthe law signed by President Bush in November 2002.\n  The amendment provides $850 million to State and local health \nprofessionals to implement the President's announced plan from December \n2002 to vaccinate 10 million first responders and health care workers \nagainst smallpox.\n  Are you going to vote against that? This is your President. This is \nmy President. This is our President. Are you going to vote against \nthat?\n  Let me say it again, lest you did not hear. This amendment provides \n$850 million to State and local health professionals to implement the \nPresident's announced plan to vaccinate 10 million first responders and \nhealth care workers against smallpox. The President mandated that the \nStates--including West Virginia, including New York, including \nCalifornia, including Alaska, including Washington, including Texas, \nincluding Florida--and local governments carry out this vaccination \nplan but provided no financial support to implement it.\n  Let me say that again. The President mandated that the States and \nlocal governments carry out this vaccination plan--we are talking about \na plan to vaccinate responders, local responders, and health care \nworkers against smallpox--the President mandated that the States and \nlocal governments carry out this vaccination plan but provided no \nfinancial support to implement it.\n  This amendment directs $200 million for law enforcement agencies and \nother first responders to address the communications conflicts that \nexist in their current radio systems.\n  How many times have we heard that the local responders--the fire \ndepartment people, the law enforcement personnel--could not talk with \none another? Law enforcement could not talk with firefighters. \nFirefighters could not talk with emergency health personnel. How many \ntimes have we heard that? How many times did we hear it during the \ncourse of those hearings last year in which both parties worked \ntogether, in a bipartisan fashion, to have the hearings, to shape the \nhearings, to determine who would be called, and to pass the legislation \nimplementing the requests of the people from the local levels--the \nmayors, the Governors, the first responders?\n  So I say again, the amendment directs $200 million for law \nenforcement agencies and other first responders to address the \ncommunications conflicts that exist in their current radio systems.\n  The amendment invests $200 million for nuclear security to protect \nagainst theft of nuclear materials and to provide increased security at \nnuclear facilities.\n  Did we hear Sam Nunn? Did we hear former Senator Sam Nunn when he \nappeared before the Appropriations Committee in last year's hearings? \nDid we listen to former Senator Rudman when he appeared there before \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee in those hearings? Senator Nunn, \nworking with Senator Lugar, addressed these problems. And they continue \nto be very concerned about the problems involved in nuclear security.\n  This amendment invests $200 million for nuclear security to protect \nagainst theft of nuclear material and to provide security at nuclear \nfacilities.\n  Now, Mr. President, that is all I shall have to say.\n  I send the amendment to the desk, and I ask that it be read in its \nentirety so that all Senators will hear it today, not wait until \ntomorrow to read it in the Congressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 8.\n       At the appropriate place in the joint resolution insert the \n     following:\n\n       DIVISION   --HOMELAND SECURITY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n       That, in addition to the funds provided elsewhere in this \n     joint

additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses, \n     Enforcement and Border Affairs'', $77,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended, of which $25,000,000 shall be only \n     for apprehending absconders, of which $25,000,000 shall be \n     only for fleet management, and of which $6,250,000 shall be \n     only for pay upgrades for Border Patrol agents and \n     Immigration

Security \n     Supplemental Appropriations Division'', of this joint \n     resolution.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have not yet seen a copy of the \namendment. I need to have a copy in order that I may address it.\n  I have a summary of the major elements of this. This is a $3 billion \npackage as opposed to the one we just voted upon that was $5.1 billion. \nI am compelled to make the same statement I made before, that unless \nthis is offset, we would not be within the guidelines of the commitment \nI made; that is, to take a bill to conference which does not exceed the \nPresident's total request to the Congress for the fiscal year 2003 \nappropriations bills.\n  I can hear and see that a great many of the items in this amendment \nare items for which we will appropriate these moneys sometime, but the \nHomeland Security department itself is not yet organized. The funds \nalready contained in the Omnibus and prior year funding is sufficient \nto begin the first phase of the smallpox vaccination program. The \nborder security systems, the security systems, are still in the process \nof being evaluated. We do have sufficient money in the bill, a \nsubstantial amount of money, as a matter of fact, in the bill to deal \nwith those issues.\n  It is with a great deal of sadness that I must tell the Senator, I \ncontinue to oppose his efforts to increase the amount of money that \nwould be available to be spent during the fiscal year 2003. I do so \nwith great respect but with total confidence that each of these \nagencies has enough money to go forward. If they run into problems that \nare really serious, we can act expeditiously to meet them.\n  The goal we want to achieve now is to get the bill to conference and \nto get it to conference in a way that we can work out differences with \nthe House over the total amount of money that is to be made available \nto the administration for these various items.\n  For instance, there is already $24.7 billion in this bill, the \namendment I have offered, for homeland security efforts; $4.3 billion \nof that is for INS, $1.26 billion is for the FBI. We have $5.3 billion \nfor the Transportation Security Administration, including an increase \nof $1.84 billion for that agency. There are funds for the airport \nsecurity concepts. We have money for the port security concepts. Each \nof these items has been covered by the bill that is before us in my \namendment.\n  I say to my friend, I cannot in good conscience support this, having \nopposed the same amounts of money in the larger amendment upon which we \njust voted.\n  I would hope the Senator would understand, again, what I am trying to \ndo. I am trying to get the 11 bills to conference as a whole and to \nwork with the House and try to come back with a bill the President will \nsign, if possible, this month. If it can get to the President this \nmonth, we will have this money working by February. If we don't do that \nand the House has to start moving single bills, the 11 bills that \naffect 2003, when they should be starting to move the 2004 bills, we \nwill be more than a full year behind by the end of this year. That will \nbe a collapse of the appropriations process. I hope we don't have to \nface that.\n  I urge the Senate to defeat amendments to add money to this Omnibus \nbill unless it is offset. If the offsets are valid, we will be pleased \nto consider such amendments.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 61 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Alaska need have no \nsecond thoughts as to where I stand. I understand the problem he has to \ndeal with and the efforts he is making, trying to do what he sees as \nthe right thing under the circumstances. I can understand that. I \nsympathize with what he says regarding offsets. But I don't believe all \nthis defense money is offset either. I haven't heard anything about \noffsetting defense moneys in this amendment. Perhaps I missed \nsomething. I haven't heard anything said about offsetting defense \nmoneys.\n  The $24.7 billion in the bill compares to $24.2 billion for fiscal \nyear 2002. That is hardly a significant increase in our commitment to \nhomeland defense.\n  For 50 years, I have been supporting funds for the defense of this \ncountry. For 50 years, I have been supporting the appropriations for \nour military men and women. So when it comes to supporting funds for \nthe defense of this Nation, I have been at that job 50 years. I think I \nam doing that now. I support the moneys for defense. I consider \nhomeland security, homeland defense as much a part of defense, the \noverall rubric, as anything else or more.\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\n  The defense of our homeland is No. 1, as far as I am concerned. We \nhave a war on terrorism going on right here at home. I don't hear much \nabout it anymore. I hear more about fighting a war in foreign lands, \nacross the seas. I hear more about sending our men and our women away \nfrom their homes, away from the fatherland, sending them abroad to deal \nwith an enemy that has not attacked our country.\n  We are sending those men and women at great cost. Are they fully \nprepared? I don't know. I hear that they are not fully prepared to meet \nand contend with biological weapons, which might be lodged against \nthem. I understand that there is equipment--by way of protecting our \ntroops from biological warfare--that is unaccounted for, and there is \nequipment that is untested.\n  I am not for pinching pennies when it comes to our troops. I will \nsupport those troops as they are sent across the seas by air and by \nwater, perhaps against their own personal will, certainly at great cost \nto themselves personally. They give up salaries; they give up the wages \nof sweat and labor and work and thought; they give up those wages to go \nabroad, to answer to the call of a war overseas; they give up home and \nfireside, warm quarters at home, where they can be with their families, \nwhere they can be with their wives, children, parents; they sacrifice \ntheir own businesses--small businesses perhaps--and their own \nprofessions. I am for every penny; I am not for pinching pennies when \nit comes to our men and women who are sent overseas. For 50 years I \nhave never been for pinching pennies.\n  I am not for wasting money. I often think of myself as the last \nwarrior in Vietnam, the last man to come out of Vietnam. I stood at the \nelbows of the then-Commander in Chief, Richard Nixon. I supported him \nin his efforts to protect our men who were sent overseas, sent to \nCambodia, sent to fight the Vietcong across the borders in Vietnam, to \ndeal with people in the Vietcong located in Cambodia and striking our \nown men. I stood by the Commander in Chief in those days, and we were \nunder a Republican administration at that time. I stood with that \nPresident, at times against my own then-majority leader. I don't know \nhow many other Senators in this body would do that. But my credentials \nare pretty good when it comes to supporting and standing up for \ndefense.\n  But today I am pleading on behalf of the unprotected men and women, \nboys and girls, in this country who may be subject to terrorist attack \nat any moment. I am pleading with my colleagues here on both sides of \nthe aisle to forget politics and to vote for what is right and to vote \nfor the security of the American people.\n  I am trying to support funds here for the legislation that we \npassed--with great fanfare--to protect the airports, to protect the \nports, to protect the borders. I am fighting for funds to provide \nvaccinations for those first responders, the people at the local level \nwho will possibly have to deal with biological and chemical warfare. So \nwhen you say stand up for the defense of the country, count me No. 1. I \nam up there first in the ranks.\n  Mr. President, this is not a political matter. I note that, again, \nthe Deputy Homeland Security Adviser, Mr. Steve Abbott, wrote Senator \nStevens to strongly oppose amendments to Senator Stevens' bill that \nwould ``add extraneous spending.''\n  Well, can you imagine extraneous spending to protect our homeland? \nThis amendment is not about politics; it is about a vulnerable nation. \nAny Member who has told his or her constituents that he or she will \nwork for homeland security should vote for this amendment. Our \nPresident has signed an authorizing bill to improve port security, \nborder security, airport security, and he has called on State and local \ngovernments to implement his smallpox vaccination plan. All right. Step \nup, belly up to the bar here. Let's put the money where our mouth is. \nThis amendment funds those important programs.\n  Mr. President, I hope other Senators will come to the floor and speak \non behalf of this amendment. I will be glad to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska at any time he wishes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I inform my friend that none of the \npersons who spoke on the previous, similar amendment by my colleague \nfrom West Virginia wish to speak on this amendment. They have called my \nattention to the fact that this amendment deals with the first five \nitems in the last amendment.\n  What was in the first amendment for State and local assistance to \ncombat terrorism, the $1.406 billion has been reduced to $1.05 billion; \nfor border security, the $1.008 billion is reduced to $750 million; for \nairport security, the $720 million has been reduced to $500 million; \nfor port security, the $585 million has been reduced to $500 million; \nfor nuclear security and energy security, the $296 million is reduced \nto $200 million.\n  In other words, the Senator's amendment takes the first five items he \nhad in the last amendment and reduces them by a reasonable amount in an \nattempt to reduce its impact in terms of the budget. He has reduced it, \nby quick calculation, by $1.015 billion in those five areas. He also \nhas deleted another $985 million in other categories.\n  I commend the Senator for being willing to come down in his request. \nIt still amounts to a concept of offering a portion of the last \namendment. Instead of the amount that would have been requested--$5 \nbillion--the Senator now says $3 billion.\n  Under the circumstances, I am constrained to again say I oppose the \namendment. I would like to have a vote on it. I have no requests for \ntime on this side. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I may consume. \nI will not be long. I think Senators ought to be aware that a vote can \ntake place on this amendment momentarily, virtually.\n  Let me simply say, in closing my remarks on this amendment, I think \nthe record is clear, and I thank my colleague, Senator Stevens, for his \nhaving accommodated me, and those Members who may wish to speak on the \nprevious amendment that I offered and on this amendment. He has done \neverything he possibly could do to accommodate us. We have not been \ncramped for time on these amendments. I again want to thank him for his \nfairness, absolute fairness.\n\n  I also want to thank the two leaders for their fairness. I thank our \nnew Republican leader for his fairness. He has been willing to debate \nthis matter at considerable length. I am not aware if he has pressured \nmy colleague, Mr. Stevens, to cut the debate short, not have the \ndebate, to try to thwart the efforts on the part of Members on this \nside to call up amendments. I am not aware of any effort toward that \nend. I am only aware of the fact that we have been allowed ample time \nto debate. I have been allowed ample time to offer amendments, other \nMembers on my side allowed to offer additional amendments dealing with \neducation, dealing with Amtrak, and other matters involved in homeland \nsecurity.\n  I thank Senator Stevens again. I thank Senator Frist. I think this is \na good indication on his part that we are going to debate matters in \nthis forum and that we are going to be allowed to call up amendments. \nThat is what the Senate is all about. That is why we are here. That was \nthe beauty of the Great Compromise of July 16, 1787, when it was \ndecided there would be two bodies and that the size of one body would \nbe determined on the basis of population, while in the other body \nStates would speak with equality. A small State would be equal with a \nlarge State and with the largest States in our numbers here. That is \nwhat the Senate is all about.\n  I am glad to see that in this instance we are being allowed to work \nour will. The Senate is being allowed to work its will on this \nimportant matter. We have offered the amendment. We have had our say. \nWe have not been shut off at the pass. There has not been an effort \nhere to gag the Members. We have had our say. I do not ask for anything \nelse. That is the Senate.\n  I say that to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee who now \npresides over this Senate with a degree of dignity and aplomb and poise \nthat is so rare as a day in June. When I see our former colleague, our \nquondam colleague, Howard Baker, I want to pass along to Howard Baker a \ngood word concerning the new Senator from Tennessee who sits in the \nChair today, as\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\nhe listens. He is sitting at the desk. He is not reading newspapers. He \nis not reading letters. He listens to what is said. That is the \nappropriate role of a Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, we do not have any complaints. I am ready to have a \nvote. I do not think I have anything else to say at this point, so I \nyield the floor. I am ready for a vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on Senator \nByrd's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 8. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), and the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Conrad), the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would each \nvote ``Aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To provide additional funding for education)\n\n       At the appropriate place in division G, insert the \n     following:\n\n                 TITLE __--EDUCATION TO SECURE TOMORROW\n\n     SEC. __. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Trust in Education to \n     Secure Tomorrow (TEST) for America's Future''.\n\n     SEC. __. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Declaration of Purpose and Policy.--Congress declares \n     the following:\n       (1) The security of the Nation requires the fullest \n     development of the mental resources and technical skills of \n     its young men and women. The present national security \n     emergency demands that additional and more adequate \n     educational opportunities be made available. The defense of \n     this Nation depends upon the mastery of modern techniques \n     developed from complex scientific principles. It depends as \n     well upon the discovery and development of new principles, \n     new techniques, and new knowledge.\n       (2) We must increase our efforts to identify and educate \n     more of the talent of our Nation. This requires programs that \n     will correct as rapidly as possible the existing imbalances \n     in our educational system and will give assurance that no \n     student of ability will be denied an opportunity for higher \n     education because of financial need.\n       (3) Congress reaffirms the principle and declares that the \n     States and local communities have and must retain control \n     over and primary responsibility for public education. The \n     national interest requires, however, that the Federal \n     Government give assistance to education for programs which \n     are important to our defense.\n       (4) To meet the present emergency requires additional \n     effort at all levels of government. It is therefore the \n     purpose of this division to provide substantial assistance in \n     various forms to individuals, and to States and their \n     subdivisions, in order to insure trained manpower of \n     sufficient quality and quantity to meet the national defense \n     needs of the United States.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In fiscal year 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act of \n     2001 (Public Law 107-110) was funded at $22,195,000,000. The \n     Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2003, \n     as submitted to Congress, proposes to fund the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) at $22,105,000,000.\n       (2) The size of the maximum Federal Pell Grant is \n     authorized to be $5,800, but because of insufficient funding, \n     in fiscal year 2002, the maximum Federal Pell Grant was only \n     $4,000.\n       (3) State budget deficits are having a pronounced effect on \n     State education funding and public college and university \n     tuition.\n       (4) In fiscal year 1946, the share of the Federal budget \n     dedicated to education was 10.4 percent. In fiscal year 2002, \n     the share of the Federal budget dedicated to education was \n     2.5 percent. On March 23, 1994, the United States Senate \n     unanimously resolved to increase to 10 percent by 2004 the \n     share of the Federal budget dedicated to education.\n\n     SEC. __.

RESTORATION OF FUNDING FOR EDUCATION.\n\n       Section 601 of Division N shall not apply with respect to \n     programs funded under title III of Division G.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as all of us in this Chamber understand, \nand perhaps those American citizens who are watching this debate do not \nunderstand, this matter that we are considering is also the instrument \nby which we are going to fund the support for educational programs. The \namendment which we offer is directed primarily at the title I parts of \nthe educational programs. It also has an important addition in terms of \nthe Pell provisions which make such a difference to children who have \nconsiderable ability but lack financial support.\n  I wish to review very briefly where we have been in terms of the \nfunding of education. The Federal role in the area of education has \nbeen limited but very important. It goes back to the early mid-1960s \nwhen the Congress and the President at that time made a decision that \nit was in the national interest to try to provide some help and \nassistance to the neediest and poorest children of this country, \nrecognizing that education was a local and State responsibility. And \nthey continue to remain the responsibilities for the localities and the \nStates. But, nonetheless, the issue of very poor children in our \nsociety was a matter of national interest and national concern, and so \nwe tried to fashion an educational program to provide assistance so \nthose children would not be left out and left behind.\n  That was, basically, the reason for the development of the title I \nprogram in the mid-1960s.\n  In the 1960s, as that went through the Senate and eventually went to \nthe House of Representatives, the formula for the implementation of \nthat program spread those resources far and wide. Rather than being \nreally targeted on the neediest children, it was spread among a broader \narea. The actual resources that went to aid the neediest children was \nvery little, sometimes $100 or $200, but essentially small, generally \nspeaking.\n  In the review of the effectiveness of title I, we have seen over a \nlong period of time that hasn't produced the kinds of results that many \nof us had hoped would be achieved. We have seen a number of different \nsteps that were taken during the Clinton administration where we had a \nvariety of different pieces of legislation, for instance, the Goals \n2000, which provides help and assistance to localities through the \nStates. That was the legislation that helped develop the concept of \nstandards which has been so important and embraced in the No Child Left \nBehind bill, with the idea that States would develop the kinds of \nstandards they thought necessary for each grade in that particular \nState.\n  What No Child Left Behind tried to do was say these are the standards \nestablished by the States, this is the curriculum for teaching those \nstandards, and these are the tests to try to make sure those children \nare learning what was intended they should learn, and then these are \nthe supplementary services to try to help those children who are \nfalling further behind.\n  That was the concept in the No Child Left Behind bill. Nonetheless, \nthe good work of the Goals 2000 made an important downpayment.\n  There was also the efforts of the School-to-Work Program to assist \nsome of the children who might have been dropping out. We have close to \n500,000 children a year who drop out of school, who think they can not \nmake it academically. This program provided help and assistance when \nthey went from school to work. We have had strong success in a number \nof different areas, and continue to, even though the legislation has \nexpired.\n\n  We had additional educational funds in the AmeriCorps and in the \ndirect loan program to try to provide help and assistance to children \nin higher education--a whole range of HOPE scholarships, and lifelong \nlearning scholarships for educational efforts during that period of \ntime.\n  Nonetheless, if we look back over the focus and attention of where \nthis institution has been in funding educational programs, it is not a \nstrong record.\n  I wish to review very quickly as we put into perspective the needs of \nthis amendment, which adds some $6 billion to the overall omnibus bill, \nmeaning we would have $16 billion in the title I program and which \neffectively is what our conference committee agreed to when we reported \nout and accepted the No Child Left Behind bill that the President \nsigned.\n  In my opening comments, looking at the figures, I mention to the body \nthe amendment that was offered by my friends and colleagues from \nConnecticut and Maine. During authorization of the No Child Left Behind \nbill, we took the time to consider the Dodd-Collins amendment which \nwould have provided $18 billion. That was agreed to by 79 Members of \nthis body. It had 29 Republican votes supporting that increase of $18 \nbillion as the total amount in title I. This is $16 billion. We are \ngoing to find out this afternoon whether there is that kind of \ncommitment so clear from the debate and discussion and vote that we had \non May 3 which provided 79 votes in favor of that, with virtually no \nDemocrats voting in opposition to it.\n  Now we have a chance for real money. This is real money. That is the \nauthorization. Now we have the chance to implement what we voted for \nsome time ago in terms of the No Child Left Behind bill.\n  As we look over the last years in terms of where we are and what the \nrecord is in this body on various educational funding, the reason this \nis so important is that we find there has been a strong element in this \nbody that believes there is no role whatsoever for the Federal \nGovernment in the field of education. I understand that. I respect \nthat. I differ with it. I think most parents want to see their children \nlearn. They want to see smaller class sizes as we have seen in \nrecognizing the distinguished Presiding Officer's State of Tennessee \nwhich has moved to get smaller class sizes. They want well-qualified \nteachers. They want afterschool programs to help and assist the \nstudents who are falling further behind. They want that certainly. They \nneed that kind of a program. They want some help and assistance for \nlimited-English-speaking students to help and assist those individuals. \nThey want to make sure when these children, who may come from limited \nresources, also have an opportunity to continue their education in \nterms of help and assistance with either Pell grants and loan programs. \nThey work hard during the course of the summer and they may want to \ntake out some loans to continue their education. I think that is what \nthe American people expect.\n  There should be no mistake about it. In this body, we have had a \nlong, hard battle in getting adequate funding in education.\n  In considering the No Child Left Behind bill, we have a great sense \nof expectation for the children in this country. No Child Left Behind \nsaid to the young people in this country: We will do our best to give \nyou a well-qualified teacher, smaller classrooms, and help and \nassistance when you need it. And we are going to be committed to trying \nto assist you to continue your education.\n  We put strong responsibility on the children. We put strong \nresponsibility on the schools that if they are failing, they have to \nreorganize or restructure themselves or there will be action by the \nStates. We put responsibility on the parents with the report card to \ninform parents how their children are performing. We have even involved \nthe parents in a variety of educational alternatives, all of which have \nbeen recommendations and experiences which we have found to have \nbenefited the children left behind.\n  We have to ask ourselves today, who is failing in meeting their \nresponsibilities? It is right here in the Congress of the United States \nthat we are failing the children of America. This omnibus bill is \nfailing the children of America. With this amendment we have an \nopportunity to provide the kind of assistance to the children all \nacross this\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\ncountry that the No Child Left Behind bill was intended to provide.\n  This has been a long and continuing struggle. Many of us can \nremember, going back to 1995, when we had already appropriated funding \nin the area of education, and there was actually a rescission offered \nby the new Republican leadership for moneys going to education of $1.7 \nbillion. And we were able to get $1.1 billion restored with the \nDemocratic support.\n  The next year, there was a $3.9 billion reduction in the cut in the \nRepublican House of Representatives. We, the Democrats, were able to \nrestore $3.5 billion. It was repeated again in 1997. It was repeated \nagain in 1998. In 1999, the Republicans authorized and appropriated $2 \nbillion below what the President requested. And then, after tough \nnegotiations, President Clinton was able to get the $3.6 billion. And \nthe list goes on.\n  I want to bring to the attention of the Senate, and our friends who \nare watching this debate, these figures. This is what was actually \noffered by the President of the United States. In the year 2000, he \nasked for a $2.5 billion increase, and we stood for, with the reform, \n$7.7 billion.\n  We are going to hear a lot about increases over 2002. Let's remember \ntheirs was $2.5 billion and this was $7.7 billion. Then, this year, \nthey asked for $1.4 billion, which is 2.8 percent above what was asked \nfor in the previous years.\n  I want to say, right at the outset of this debate, money isn't \neverything, but it is a pretty clear indication of a nation's \npriorities. That is what this debate is about: a nation's priorities. \nThat is what the omnibus bill is about: reflecting the Nation's \npriorities in the amount of moneys that are going to be appropriated by \nthe Congress and Senate of the United States. That is what this debate \nis all about.\n  When we talk about these figures, we are not just talking about \ndollars--hundreds of millions or billions of dollars--we are talking \nabout making sure qualified teachers get in those classrooms. That is \nwhat money represents. It is not just spending; it is providing \nqualified teachers. It means smaller classrooms and afterschool \nprograms and assistance to students with limited English.\n\n  We do not have the construction money in here that we had in the \nprevious administration. So we effectively made a contract with the \nAmerican people. We said: Look, we will pass No Child Left Behind. We \nhad made a contract with the parents, with the students, with the \nStates, with the local communities, and we were signatories. The \nPresident was a signatory. Every Member of this Congress, at that time, \nwas a signatory with their vote. There were a handful of Members who \nvoted in opposition, but those who voted in favor were signatories to \nthat particular proposal.\n  So we are looking, effectively, with the report that we have before \nus, at an increase of $1.7 billion instead of the amount that was \nrequested, $1.4 billion. We will hear a good deal on the floor of the \nSenate about what kind of increase this is, what kind of increase it \nisn't, that it is a large increase or that it is really just a small \nincrease, as I have described it.\n  I have here the Department of Education Fiscal 2003 Budget Summary. \nIt says on page 2: The President is requesting $50 billion in \ndiscretionary appropriations for the Department of Education, an \nincrease of $1.4 billion or 2.8 percent over the 2002-enacted level. So \n2.8 percent over the 2002 level.\n  That does not even take care of inflation. That is effectively a cut.\n  Let me show you what has happened over the previous years in \neducation. Let me just show you what has happened over the last several \nyears in the areas of education funding. This chart includes total \neducation. Going back to 1997, a 16-percent increase; 1998, 12 percent; \n1999, 12 percent; 2000, 6 percent; 2002, 19 percent; 2002, 16 percent.\n  Now, the administration's budget is at 2.8 percent--the lowest we \nhave had over this whole period of time. This is when we have the most \nimportant education legislation before the children of America. That is \nwrong. That is wrong. And that is what we are attempting to address.\n  This is, as I mentioned, under the Department of Education, 2.8 \npercent. I mention this because we will hear others talk about: Oh, we \nhave the largest increase we have seen in recent times.\n  Listen to this. I have here a page, which I will print in the Record, \nentitled ``Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related \nAgencies Appropriations.'' It says: ``Republican House Appropriations \nStaff Document Accompanying [their bill] H.R. 246.]''\n  If you look down at ``Total: Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nprograms,'' there is a cut of $89.655 million. So a $90 million cut \nright here in the effect of their program, a $90 million cut, because \ntheir funding does not even meet the education inflationary needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the item to which I just \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations\n                                                                       [$ in 000s]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                 Difference                  Difference\n                                                                         FY 2002     President's                 President's   Difference    House bill\n                                                                       comparable      budget      House bill   request/2002   House bill/   President's\n                                                                                       request                      comp.      2002 comp.      request\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearch and Statistics:\n    Research.................................................

Mr. President, this is all against a background of what \nis happening out there in the States. Six months ago, we thought the \nStates had about a $45 billion shortfall; now the best estimates are \n$90 billion. A conservative estimate is that a third of those budgets \nare education budgets, divided between higher education and elementary \nand secondary education. But that is $30 billion that is going to be \nwithdrawn from the States in terms of education.\n  We have an administration program which is effectively cutting back \non the title I at the same time that we are considering the largest tax \nreduction in the history of the country--$670 billion now over the next \n10 years. When you add on the costs of carrying that out, another $300 \nbillion. So it is close to $1 trillion. And the administration cannot \nfind $16 billion out of that $640 billion tax cut, much of it going to \nthe wealthiest individuals in this country, to say: Let's invest in \nwhat America was proud of when the President of the United States \nsigned the No Child Left Behind bill.\n  How do you explain that? How do you explain that to parents in this \ncountry? How do you explain that? This is an institution of choices. We \nhave choices. We have choices here this afternoon. And we have the \nrecognition, when all is said and done, that this proposal before the \nSenate of the United States is $10 billion less than what was generally \nagreed to in the last Congress by Republicans and Democrats, reflected \nin a vote of 59 Senators but agreed to as being the target figure for \nthe appropriators.\n  This bill is $10 billion less. Republicans voted for that higher \nnumber. I am not asking to exceed it. I am just saying, instead of $10 \nbillion, let's fund education including title I programs and the Pell \ngrants and use up $6 of that $10 billion, which would move us a little \ncloser to what we voted for.\n  Is that so irresponsible? Is that so outrageous, when we have the \nkind of need and opportunity taking place all across the country? This \nis a matter of enormous importance to the children.\n  I see my colleagues on the floor who want to speak. Let me wind up \nthis phase quickly.\n  We know that the earlier the intervention in terms of children, the \nbetter the opportunity that they will have a successful education. We \nare not talking here about early education, which I hope later in the \nsession we will be able to address in a bipartisan way. Hopefully we \nwill. But all of the Academy of Science's studies show that early \neducation is absolutely crucial in terms of children. And that is \neffectively what the title I program is all about, trying to intervene \nin the early years.\n  We have tried to coordinate the Head Start Program with the first \nyear of education training and with the title I. We have made efforts \nand we will make more of an effort this year on reauthorization. We \ntried in the last Congress, with the last reauthorization, increasing \nand enhancing the quality of the Head Start Program, and we are going \nto try and bring this into greater conformity in the course of this \nyear. But all of our efforts are going to be weakened dramatically if \nwe are going to fail to meet even our minimum responsibilities to the \nchildren by investing and restoring this kind of commitment.\n  The amendment which we offer today will invest $16 million in the \ntitle I program. It was passed overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, on \nthe reauthorization. I am hopeful we can have bipartisan effort when we \nvote later in the afternoon. By doing so, we will live up to our \ncommitment and meet our responsibility in the contract of No Child Left \nBehind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the presence of several of my \ncolleagues. I will not take long.\n  I commend our friend and colleague from Massachusetts for offering \nthis amendment. He mentioned at the close of his remarks how this body \nin the previous Congress had voted some $16 billion in authorization \nmoneys for title I. That amendment was offered by myself and my \ncolleague from the State of Maine, Senator Collins. We received 79 \nvotes on that amendment, a recorded vote, supporting the $16 billion \nfigure to authorize the title I funds.\n  What we are doing here today with this amendment is merely trying to \nconfirm once again the Senate's commitment in the previous Congress to \nthat dollar amount. My colleague from Massachusetts has laid out the \nsubstantive arguments--in fact, even gone back and reminded us of the \nhistory of our efforts to try and get additional funding for the \ncritical area of elementary and secondary education. I rise to support \nthis effort and hope once again for the same spirit that imbued this \nbody only a Congress ago, when 79 of us thought this was so important \nwe ought to support the authorization figure of $16 billion. You now \nhave an opportunity, albeit a bit late, but nonetheless an opportunity \nto reconfirm the commitment made by most of us to that dollar amount.\n  We have all heard the language and the rhetoric over the last several \nyears about leaving no child behind. Nothing could be more important to \nthe well-being of this country than to see to it that we make the \nnecessary investments our children will absolutely need if they are \ngoing to have the quality of education necessary to maximize their \npotential in the 21st century. I can't think of a better way to begin \nthat effort than by providing the resources necessary.\n  We have already seen the budget cuts, some $4.6 billion short of the \npromise made when the President signed into law the $16 billion \nauthorization level. Yet hardly before the ink was dry on that \ncommitment we saw the cuts come in. How many of us remember the \nPresident traveling around the country, celebrating this major first \ninitiative of his administration, proud of the fact he had built \nbipartisan support for dealing with the educational needs of America's \nchildren. What a great irony to find ourselves back here in this \nCongress arguing with the administration about restoring some funds to \na program that was so highly celebrated by them.\n  This is an issue that should not divide Americans by ideology or \nparty or partisanship. I do not know of a single citizen who believes \nwe can continue to prosper and grow as a people while simultaneously \ndepriving the youngest of our citizens the opportunity to acquire the \nskills necessary to do what will have to be done to make us a strong \nand prosperous Nation in the 21st century.\n  We all know how painfully difficult it is to provide that opportunity \nof education today at the local level, with property taxes being the \nmajor source of funding for educational needs, and in some areas State \nbudgets also contribute. It is incredible to me that we contribute less \nthan 2 percent of the entire Federal budget to the elementary and \nsecondary educational needs of our students. About 6 cents on the \neducation dollar comes from the national Government, and the \noverwhelming burden falls on local property taxpayers.\n  We have been debating the issue of affirmative action and the \nPresident's decision yesterday to oppose the plan at the University of \nMichigan. I will find another moment and time to address that issue \nhead on. But let me suggest to the President and others, if you want to \nknow why there is a need for affirmative action, you merely have\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\nto look at how we spend money when it comes to elementary and secondary \neducation and on title I. If you are wondering why a child entering \ncollege may need some further consideration when it comes to accepting \nthem or rejecting them to a higher educational opportunity, consider \nwhat we do at the earliest stages of their educational development.\n\n  In most States in this country, if you go to the inner city urban \nschools, you will find that 35 or 36 percent of the teachers are not \ncertified to teach the course the children are taking; whereas \nStatewide, in the more affluent communities, those numbers are \ndramatically lower.\n  We should be doing everything we can. If you want to eliminate \naffirmative action, then you better begin here with the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Massachusetts, to make it possible for \nevery child to have an equal opportunity to learn. Today, given the \ndisparities in our communities based on the wealth, the poverty, or \naffluence of those communities increases the likelihood of an \neducational opportunity. It should not be a question of where you were \nborn as to whether you will have a right or an opportunity to succeed. \nWe ought to be doing everything we can to see to it that every child, \nregardless of the circumstances of their birth, will have an \nopportunity to achieve to their maximum potential.\n  We bear no responsibility to guarantee success. We bear every \nresponsibility to see to it that there is an opportunity to succeed or \nfail. That is all we are trying to do in this one area of title I and \nPell grants which the Senator rightly has added to the amendment.\n  I can't recall a prouder day in the last Congress than when we stood \nhere, 79 of us, and Senator Collins and I offered that amendment.\n  Many thought we could not pass it. But 79 of us here said we ought to \ndo this on title I. I hope the Members who cast the vote that day, as \nthey walk into this Chamber in the coming hour or 2, will recall how \nthey felt when they actually voted to see to it that we maximize the \ndollars necessary to support this critically important program and cast \na ballot again today in this Congress to see that we have full funding \nfor title I and the necessary dollars to support the Pell Grant \nProgram, which will make it possible for children of modest means to \nachieve a higher education which, in the absence of this amendment, \nwould be difficult to do.\n  This is important to children at both the elementary and secondary \nschool levels. It is important to the security of America. Our security \nis directly linked to the wellness and ability of our children to \nacquire the educational skills they will need. This is a national \nsecurity issue, not just an education issue. I look forward to \nsupporting this amendment when the vote occurs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also want to speak in favor of the \namendment my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has \noffered. I commend him and Senator Harkin, in particular, for the \nleadership they have shown in trying to maintain an adequate level of \nfunding for education. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment \nand the amendment Senator Harkin will offer later today.\n  The pending omnibus appropriations bill we are debating on the floor \nis woefully inadequate when it comes to funding education. Senator \nKennedy and Senator Dodd have just pointed out that last year, with \ngreat acclaim, we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, and I supported \nthat. I believe there are accountability provisions in that act that \nwill move us in the way of implementing major changes in our \neducational system and will bring us a long way toward ensuring equal \neducational opportunity for all children in this country.\n  What we were starting to do with that act, as I understood it, was to \nwork in partnership with States and local governments to see this \nimprovement occur, and part of that partnership was that we would help \nprovide resources to the schools and the teachers so that those \nchildren could succeed.\n  The President's budget abandoned that effort. This bill that we have \non the floor today--although it is slightly better than the President's \nbudget--also abandons the promise to leave no child behind.\n  Like the President's budget, the pending bill underfunds the No Child \nLeft Behind Act by several billion dollars. I do think the context is \nimportant here. The context is the one to which Senator Kennedy \nreferred. We are being urged as a Congress and a nation to embrace some \n$660 billion or $670 billion worth of new tax cuts. At the same time, \nwe are being told now there is not enough money to adequately fund the \nNo Child Left Behind Act: We cannot make good on the promise that we \nmade when we passed that act because we cannot afford it, but, by the \nway, why don't you speed up and pass this $660 billion tax bill, which \nis really focused on assisting those who are the best off in our \nsociety.\n\n  So you have an interesting juxtaposition, where tax cuts are targeted \nat the wealthiest versus having adequate funding for programs to \nbenefit our most disadvantaged children. That is the choice we are \ngoing to have to make in the Senate this afternoon.\n  Unlike the President's budget, this bill has a small increase for \nprograms authorized in the No Child Left Behind Act--an increase of \n$400 million. But that funding level will mean a significant cut in \nservices because of expected inflation. Inflation is not going to be \nmuch; it is expected to be 1.8 percent. But even with that, we are not \nproviding the funds to make up for it. The only significant increases \nfor education in the bill are a billion dollars for title I and a \nbillion dollars for IDEA.\n  This bill--like the President's budget--makes those increases at the \nexpense of other very crucial programs. In addition, even with the \nincrease for title I--the program targeted on districts and schools \nwith large numbers of our most disadvantaged students--in this bill, \nthe program is $4.6 billion short of the levels agreed to on a \nbipartisan basis when we passed the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The proposed funding level will not be sufficient to keep pace with \nthe growth in child poverty. It will mean that over 6 million poor \nchildren will in fact be left behind.\n  If we truly intend to leave no child behind, then education funding, \nparticularly targeted at this group of disadvantaged children, needs to \nbe our top priority.\n  The increase for IDEA is also insufficient. I am sure people will \ncome to the floor today and say, no, we are increasing IDEA. At the \nrate of increase provided for in the underlying bill today, it will \nonly take us 33 more years to get to the level we promised the Federal \nGovernment achieve when we enacted that program. That is covering 40 \npercent of the cost of that program. So the funding level in this \nyear's bill is a mere 17 percent of those costs.\n  The pending amendment would go a long way toward ensuring that no \nchild, in fact, will be left behind. If Senator Kennedy's amendment \nprevails--which I hope it will--we will have over 2 million more needy \nchildren who will be fully served by the title I program. It will \nprovide sufficient funding to hire 50,000 fully qualified new teachers. \nIt will provide afterschool opportunities for a million more children. \nEvery one of the 10,000 schools currently identified as not meeting the \nstandards provided in the No Child Left Behind Act will be able to \nimplement research-based school reform models. There are 200,000 \ncollege students nationally who will be able to receive a Pell grant to \ndefray the cost of college. So this amendment can make a great \ndifference.\n  Let me give a few statistics about my home State of New Mexico, and \nthen I will yield to my colleagues who also wish to speak on this \nimportant amendment.\n  This amendment will provide the Albuquerque Public Schools $9.8 \nmillion in increased funding. In my home State, we will receive \napproximately $54 million under this amendment; 1,400 more college \nstudents will be eligible for a Pell grant in New Mexico and over \n42,000 grant recipients will receive a substantial increase.\n\n  This is an important amendment for my State, and it is an important\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\namendment for all the schoolchildren in the country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I also come to the floor to support the \nextremely important amendment offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, which is offered to ensure that all students get the \neducational resources they deserve.\n  This amendment funds title I at the level we agreed to when we passed \nthe No Child Left Behind Act and increases Pell grants so we can help \nmore low-income students afford college. This is the minimum investment \nwe need to make if we truly are going to leave no child behind.\n  Leaving no child behind is a noble goal, one that we all endorse. But \nit is a travesty to use the mantra of the Children's Defense Fund as a \ncover for policies and budgets that hurt rather than help American \nstudents. Make no mistake, the bill before us, based on the President's \nbudget, will leave students behind.\n  I find it particularly incredible that at the same time the President \nand his friends in Congress are pushing for a $674 billion tax cut, \nthey are insisting that we provide less money for the education of our \nchildren.\n  Look at title I. Title I pays for things such as books, teachers, \ntutoring, and preschool for our most needy students. The President and \nhis party are saying that we can no longer afford the $1.5 billion \nincrease slated for title I last year, yet we can afford to give $20 \nbillion to 226,000 millionaires.\n  One year ago, when we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we agreed \non new sweeping requirements and mandates. We also agreed that title I \nwould need to be funded at $16 billion this year for schools to meet \nthose requirements. America's students and their parents have entrusted \nus with their future. We cannot turn our backs on them and say we have \ndone our part by setting high standards and creating tough \naccountability, and the rest is up to you--even if you are trying to \nlearn in overcrowded classrooms or from unqualified teachers or you are \ncoping with crumbling school buildings. That is what they are really \nsaying.\n  Last week, the President celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the No \nChild Left Behind Act by calling it the most meaningful education \nreform probably ever. But that reform had two parts. On the one hand, \nit called for higher standards and accountability, and on the other \nhand it promised more investment so schools could make progress.\n  My good friend, Senator Paul Wellstone, spent many hours on this \nfloor reminding all of us that the so-called No Child Left Behind Act \nwould, at best, be a sham and, at worst, a serious blow to the public \nschool students of our country if it was funded on a tin cup budget. I \nfear this appropriations bill will prove him right.\n  By providing only an inflationary increase in education funding while \nsignificantly raising the demands on our schools, we have reduced \nAmerica's students to begging for the Government's spare change to \nfinance their future.\n  Setting a high bar is important, but setting a high bar and failing \nto give kids the resources to succeed is just setting them up for \nfailure.\n  The appropriations bill before us offers the smallest increase in \neducation funding in 7 years. It freezes the State grants that reduced \nclass size and improved teacher quality and, as a result, no new \nteachers will be hired and fewer teachers will get professional \ndevelopment.\n  This bill does not fully fund our share of special education costs, \nfailing yet again to fulfill that commitment to our communities, our \nschools, and our disabled students. And it falls far short of title I \nfunding we included in the No Child Left Behind Act because we knew it \nwas necessary to help our students succeed.\n  We know what the needs are. We know what works to help our children \nsucceed. And we also know that making college affordable is critical to \nhelping students succeed and to helping our economy grow. Senate \nDemocrats have worked to increase funding for Pell grants. In fiscal \nyear 2002, while the Bush administration proposed no increase in Pell \ngrants, Senate Democrats increased the top limit from $3,750 per year \nto $4,000 per year.\n  Again this year, the President proposed no increase in Pell grants. \nIt is a good step that this bill includes a small increase for Pell \ngrants, but it is not nearly enough to meet the rapidly rising needs. \nIn my home State of Washington, our legislature cut $1.6 billion out of \ntheir budget last year. This year they are suffering from even deeper \neconomic stress, and they need to cut an additional $2.5 billion. A \nresult of that is tuition at our public colleges and universities \nincreased 12 to 16 percent this year, and we could be looking at \nsimilar increases next year. I am really worried that students will \nlook at that increase in tuition, see no significant increase in \nFederal aid, and decide they cannot afford to go to college.\n  One of the most important things we can do to ensure a safe and \nsecure future is to help educate our young people. We know a college \ndegree means on average an additional $20,000 a year for men and an \nadditional $15,000 a year for women. Given today's global-based \neconomy, the gap in earnings between those Americans who have a college \ndegree and those who only have a high school degree is likely to grow. \nEnsuring that our young people have the resources to go to college is a \ncritical national priority.\n  Putting America's future first means putting our children's education \nfirst. But the sad truth is that this appropriations bill shortchanges \nall of America's students. We have spent so much time talking about how \nwe can hold teachers, administrators, and parents accountable for doing \ntheir jobs well. I think we ought to focus on how well we are doing our \njob, and that means making good choices for our children and investing \nin their futures.\n  At a time when we are and should be demanding more than ever from our \nschools, we must not slow down the Federal investments in our schools. \nWe must not abandon our commitment to help reduce class sizes and \nprovide quality teachers. We must not continue to shirk our \nresponsibility to disadvantaged students.\n  The Republican bill freezes our progress. That is why we have offered \nthis amendment. That is why Senator Kennedy has offered this amendment: \nTo provide the resources that parents, teachers, and students need.\n  This amendment will ensure more children start school ready to learn. \nIt can help children learn in smaller, well disciplined classes by \nhiring 50,000 fully qualified teachers so we can reduce the size of \nclasses. It will help our local districts that are badly in need of \nhelp right now to ensure there is a high quality teacher in every \nclassroom. It could allow communities to offer more afterschool \nprograms to keep 1 million additional latchkey children safe and \nlearning, and it would help more Americans afford college at this \ncritical time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was listening to the Senator. I see my colleagues who \nhave not spoken. I will only take a minute.\n  I was listening to the Senator talk about opportunities for young \nchildren to go to college. I have here a chart which indicates the \naverage requested increase during the Clinton years was $167. Last \nyear, the Bush request was $100 in Pell grants. The Congress raised \nthat to $250. This year it is zero. In the matter before us, this \namendment raises it by $500. I want the Senator to know, as she talks \nabout higher education, the administration request was zero. Last year \nit was $100, and we raised it to $250.\n  If this amendment is successful, it will be $500. There will be \n200,000 new Pell grant recipients, 4.5 million college students with \nPell grants that on average are $300 higher, and it hikes the maximum \nPell grant to these needy students by $500.\n  As she was talking about the importance of higher education, after \nbeing the leader in this body on the issue of smaller class size and \nqualified teachers over the years, and I believe the only former member \nof a school board, as well as a teacher, it is wise that our colleagues \nlisten to the Senator from the State of Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct.\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\nOn his point on the Pell grants, I remind us again that our States are \nsuffering severe budget crises. Some people estimate as much as a $100 \nbillion shortfall in our State legislative budget this year. Those \nState legislatures are going to have to look toward increasing revenue \nin their States at this difficult time because they have to balance \ntheir budget. Many of those States will do as my State has done--raise \ncollege tuition. At the same time, if we do not have Pell grants \navailable to students under this appropriations bill presented to us, \nwe are going to have kids say: I cannot afford to go to college. That \nis the wrong message for our students at this time in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding in some schools they are cutting \nback the school week from 5 days to 4 days because they have inadequate \nresources.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. Many State legislatures are \nlooking to cut back the school week because of lack of resources for \neducation at this time because of the effects of the economy.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator agree with me that you cannot give \nmeaning to the Leave No Child Behind legislation, which not only did \nthe President sign but made a great to-do about signing it? He traveled \naround the country and said this was his commitment to education, but \nyou cannot make a reality out of what that legislation contains if you \ndo not provide the resources with which to carry it out. Would that not \nbe the case?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Maryland makes an absolutely critical \npoint. He knows as well as I do that we sincerely miss Senator Paul \nWellstone who I know would be sitting next to Senator Ted Kennedy--\nactually, he would be roaming up and down this aisle saying: I told all \nof you this No Child Left Behind hype is a sham if we do not provide \nthe resources. Providing accountability on one hand and not providing \nresources on the other hand says we only did half what we promised.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What does the distinguished Senator from Washington \nmake of the contrast that the President, while not providing the \nresources to carry through on the promises contained in the Leave No \nChild Behind legislation, is pushing very hard in every way he possibly \ncan for a tax cut for very wealthy people, what I have characterized as \nthe ``leave no millionaire behind'' legislation?\n  So the sense of priorities from the administration is that they are \ndetermined to try to get this tax cut to benefit the very wealthy so no \nmillionaire is left behind, at the same time that they are failing to \nprovide the resources in order to deliver on the Leave No Child Behind. \nThese connections must be made.\n  There is a tendency to look at the tax side as though it is somehow \nsomething separate, but the fact is, the President wants to commit \nscarce resources, given our fiscal position, to the tax cut to benefit \nthe very wealthy at the same time that he is unwilling to commit the \nresources in order to fund the educational programs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. The \nPresident is asking for a $674 billion tax cut that essentially means \nwe can no longer afford the $1.5 billion increase to title I funds that \nwe promised in No Child Left Behind at the same time he is giving \n226,000 millionaires a $20 billion tax cut.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On this point, will the Senator give a reaction to this \nparticular chart? This chart provides a tax cut for the top 1 percent \nversus the Leave No Child Behind. This is the point the Senator from \nMaryland made so eloquently. That amounts to a $180 billion tax cut for \nthe top 1 percent versus No Child Left Behind.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the top 1 percent of the income and wealth \nscale; is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Now, this is the choice for the Senate. We can fully fund No Child \nLeft Behind, reach the 10.8 million children all across this country; \nwe can provide for universal afterschool programs, provide the needed \nresources to assist those children who need the extra help and \nassistance in afterschool programs. We can make sure there is a \nqualified teacher in every title I classroom in America, and provide \nhelp and assistance for the English instruction to every LEP child, \nevery child who needs language training in English.\n  We have the alternative of funding the tax cut for the 1 percent, the \nwealthiest individuals, or all of these items of the No Child Left \nBehind. That is the choice the Senator from the State of Washington has \nposed to this body and that the Senator from Maryland has underlined, \nand I think it is important that our colleagues and the American people \nunderstand what this debate is all about.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct, and I \nappreciate the comments of the Senator from Maryland. I think we should \nask the millionaires in this country whether they want the tax cut or \nwhether they would prefer to see no child left behind. My guess is many \nof them would prefer to make sure that the generation that follows them \nhas the same opportunities they have had in this country.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield, hopefully many of them \nwould be sufficiently enlightened to perceive that by strengthening our \nsociety through implementing the Leave No Child--actually, this goes \nbeyond implementing the legislation because it sets out other \npriorities that we can accomplish to succeed in strengthening our \nsociety to the benefit of everyone. It is a clear choice of priorities, \nwhat we are going to put first.\n  I think most of the American people would put education first, \nrecognizing that it not only benefits the students who gain the \neducation but benefits the society generally. We all draw a benefit \nfrom having a well-educated society with people who are able to work to \nthe very limits of their capacities.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Maryland for his comments \nbecause I think they are essential to this debate. I also thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for one more observation and \nindicate whether she agrees, and I hope I have the attention of the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  I will read these words. It will take less than a minute.\n\n       The security of the Nation requires the fullest development \n     of the mental resources and technical skills of its young men \n     and women. The present national security emergency demands \n     that additional and more adequate educational opportunities \n     be made available. The defense of this Nation depends upon \n     the mastery of modern techniques developed from complex \n     scientific principles. It depends as well upon the discovery \n     and development of new principles, new techniques, and new \n     knowledge.\n       We must increase our efforts to identify and educate more \n     of the talent of our Nation.\n\n  That was President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958. Those words are the \nsame words that we need today when we are talking about the defense of \nour country as well, and that had virtually unanimous support in this \nbody at that time in 1958. That is the same principle we are trying to \nsupport with this amendment today.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for that \nstatement as well.\n  As I finish my statement, and I know the Senator from Iowa also wants \nto speak, I think we have to ask ourselves are we going to let our kids \ngo to school in overcrowded classrooms in crumbling school buildings \nwith underpaid and inadequately prepared teachers or are we going to \nrise to the occasion and make the choices to invest in our children's \nfutures?\n  We know what the needs are out there. We know what helps our kids \nsucceed. We need Members of Congress to stand up and put the money \nwhere their mouths are.\n  Parents, teachers, students, and community leaders are saying do not \njust talk about the importance of education funding, make the tough \nchoices to show the American public that education is truly a priority, \nand that means giving our local school districts the resources they \nneed to provide a first-rate education to every student in this country \nby supporting this amendment.\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\n  I urge the millionaires in this country who are looking at a tax cut \nto let this Congress know that the education of the next generation, \nthe possibility of creating future millionaires, is far more important \nthan the tax cut they have been promised by this administration. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote yes on this extremely important amendment that \nwill benefit our children and grandchildren and their future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his great leadership on this specific item, but also \nhis great leadership on all issues concerning education, both in this \nCongress and in Congresses of the last 25 or 30 years.\n  This amendment is one that is needed to meet the barest of needs of \nthis country in terms of educating our children and making sure we live \nup to the commitments we made a year ago when the President signed into \nlaw the Leave No Child Behind Act.\n  It is time to stop talking about a commitment to education and start \nproving it. All across my State of Iowa, all over the Nation, teachers, \nprincipals, and parents are deeply worried about this new education \nlaw. They are on edge not because they are afraid of accountability--\nteachers and parents want their schools to be held accountable--but \nthey are on edge because they are afraid the Government is going to \ncome in and label their schools a failure without giving them the \nresources they need to succeed.\n  People all over this country are now beginning to see this law for \nwhat it is: an unfunded Federal mandate. President Bush keeps saying \nthat schools do not need more money. His attitude is more tests are \nneeded, more unfunded mandates; the schools do not need more money.\n  Well, it is a funny thing about money. It sure comes in handy when \ntax cuts are being given to the rich. When it comes to tax breaks for \nmillionaires, why, money seems like a pretty nice thing to have, \naccording to this White House. But when it comes to education, \nPresident Bush's education plan sounds more like that old beer ad, the \nMiller Lite ad: Great tests, less funding. In essence, what it is all \nabout is priorities, President Bush's priority, as we have seen now, is \nleave no millionaire behind.\n  Instead of focusing on dividends for millionaires, we should be \nfocusing on making sure our kids can multiply and divide. If we really \nwant to do something that will pay dividends for our country, we need \nto invest in our children.\n  No one in this Chamber thinks money is the only answer to improving \nschools. We all can come up with examples and instances of chasing bad \nmoney with good in education. But it takes money to hire a highly \nqualified teacher. In fact, I submit that what we are seeing happening \nin education in America today is what I call ``finally the education \nsystem is meeting the marketplace.'' More and more of our teachers are \nfinding they can make a better living doing something else than what \nthey went to school for and were trained for. That is why we have so \nmany teachers leaving education after two or three years, because the \nmarket in the private sector will pay them more for their skills and \ntheir learning than they can get in education.\n\n  In my time, when I was in elementary school and high school, perhaps \neven college, there were not that many opportunities for a lot of the \npeople who were teachers. Most of the teachers in those days were \nwomen. Women did not have access openings. You could be a teacher or a \nnurse and that was about it. Thankfully this country, through various \nCivil Rights Acts, now has a society where an American woman can become \nanything she wants. So we have women who are lawyers, doctors, Senators \nand Congresspeople, truck drivers and welders, and everything else. \nTherefore, we do not get the teacher on the cheap anymore like we did \nwhen I was younger. If you want a good, qualified teacher, you have to \npay the money. There is no way around it.\n  If we want to reduce class sizes so kids can learn better and have a \nbetter learning environment, that takes some money. If we want to send \na poor middle-class kid to college, that also takes some money. If we \nwant to fix up our broken-down school buildings--the average age is \nalmost 50 years old--and get the new technologies in the classroom, \nthat is not free. That costs some money.\n  President Bush does not want to face that fact. As soon as he signed \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, he walked away from the job of improving \nour schools. Take a look at this chart. There seem to be mistakes made \non the Senate floor a week ago by my friend from New Hampshire. I \nthought I might correct the Record. About a week ago, I was on the \nfloor talking about how the President actually cut funding for Leave No \nChild Behind. Secretary Paige said that was not true, and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, in the Record of January 10, also said Senator \nKennedy and Senator Harkin had it wrong and that it was not cut. Just \nget the executive branch budget book, what he requested in funding for \nthis year. In fiscal year 2002 we put $22.195 billion into the programs \nauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act. The President's request in \nthe budget for this year was $22.105, a $90 million cut. One might say \nthat is not much. All right, it is not, but my point is that right \nafter signing the Leave No Child Behind Act the President submits his \nbudget to this Congress and actually cuts the programs authorized by No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire last week was talking about $90 \nmillion from earmarked programs, which he says is not working to begin \nwith, which has virtually no purpose other than to fund special \ninterest activities which is worth $90 million. The fact is there were \n25 programs authorized by the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  For instance, rural education in fiscal year 2003 was $162 million. \nThis is part of No Child Left Behind. We do not want to leave rural \nkids behind. It is part of the bill. For this year, President Bush \nzeroed it out. He requested zero dollars for rural education. School \ncounselors, $32 million in the previous year--this is the previous year \nbefore we had No Child Left Behind. These were specifically authorized \nby No Child Left Behind. These are not earmarked programs, not in the \nleast. These are authorized under the heading of No Child Left Behind \nAct. Dropout prevention; $11 million to zero for gifted and talented. \nZeroed it out. The national writing project, of which I know the \nSenator from Mississippi has been supportive, $14 million before, is \nzeroed out. This is just a partial list of the 25 that were cut--either \nzeroed out or cut--under the President's budget.\n\n  Again, we in Congress in both the Senate and the House did not follow \nPresident Bush's lead. We put money back into these programs. The fact \nis the money we put in is now cut out by the appropriations bill we \nhave before us in the Senate. The amendment offered by Senator Kennedy \nputs that money back in. President Bush requested this $22.105 billion \nfor all of the programs under No Child Left Behind, less than what we \nhad the year before. Our Appropriations Committee last year bumped that \nup to $24.512 billion. Every Republican on the Appropriations Committee \nvoted for that. It passed unanimously. The bill before the Senate today \ncuts that back down to $22.65 billion. The amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy, of which I am a cosponsor and many others are, brings that \nback up to over $27 billion, to meet the minimal requirements of what \nwe need around the country to support No Child Left Behind.\n  The real question is, Are we going to do it? The President, we know, \nsays, no, we do not have to. Now we are fighting to make sure we live \nup to our promise we made just 1 year ago when the President signed No \nChild Left Behind. As this chart demonstrates, President Bush's request \nfor this year for education was the lowest, 2.8 percent, of the last 7 \nyears. One might say you could live with that but for the fact a year \nago the President signed into law No Child Left Behind, touted it \nwidely, said it is a new era in education, and we are not going to \nleave kids behind, and then sends Congress a bill that gives us the \nlowest increase in education in 7 years.\n  I suppose maybe the President and others might say we will leave it \nup to the States and local schools. They just got hit with the biggest \nFederal mandate in education in over 30 years at\n\n[[Page S1031]]\n\nthe same time they are facing the worst fiscal crisis they have had \nsince World War II.\n  Again, why am I spending so much time talking about funding? I \nsuppose I will be accused of saying money is the answer to education. \nThat is not it at all. I support accountability. I support making sure \nparents of all kids, including poor kids, get a report card and know \nhow their kids are doing so they can hold their schools accountable. I \nsupport the law. I voted for it. But I voted for it because there were \nrepresentations made to us by this administration that they were going \nto back it. In fact, they walked away from it.\n  I read this weekend that schools in Portland, or may have to cut 24 \ndays from the school year because they have run out of money. More than \n100 school districts in 7 States have switched to a 4-day week during \nthis school year because they are out of money.\n  If students are not in class, they are not going to reach the \nstandards we set for them in No Child Left Behind. Right now, the \nFederal Government is leaving behind 6.2 million students who are not \nbeing fully served by the title I program, the main Federal program for \neducating disadvantaged students. That is what the Kennedy amendment \nwill do, get these title I students back to where we make sure we meet \nthe needs of these title I students. Only 4.1 million out of the 10.3 \nmillion needy students are getting the services for which they are \neligible.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator remembers, the legislation actually is a \nguarantee that all of those children, the whole 10 million, will reach \nwhat we call proficiency.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That's right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That means they will have the basic kinds of educational \nskills over a 12-year period. That was the national goal. That is what \nhad the support of the President, Republicans, and Democrats alike.\n  Can the Senator possibly explain how we are ever going to have those \n6 million begin to even reach proficiency when, year after year, they \nare left out of any kind of coverage, any help--a qualified teacher, \nsmaller classroom with supplementary services, which is guaranteed in \nthe legislation?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond to the Senator, it is a promise delayed. We \npromise these kids and their families we are not going to leave them \nbehind, that they are going to have good teachers, good education--but \nnot these kids, not this year, maybe not even next year but sometime in \nthe distant future. But in the distant future these kids will be out of \nschool and they will be ill-educated. They will not be fully productive \nmembers of our society. A day lost in education today is a day you \ncannot make up. A year lost to these students is a year that cannot be \nmade up. That is why we have to put this money back, to make sure we \nmeet our commitments.\n  The bill before us would add just 289,000 students. We have 4.1 \nmillion out of 10.3 million needy students. The Republican bill would \nonly add 289,000 students to that total. That does not even keep pace \nwith the growing number of needy students in this country. They are \nfalling backwards.\n  This amendment would make it possible to serve another 2 million \nstudents--not 289,000 students, 2 million students--by funding title I \nat $16 billion. That is the level we committed to, if I am not \nmistaken, in the bill last year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That's right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, is that not the \nlevel to which we committed?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is the figure that came out of the conference. That \nis the figure the President agreed to and signed to. That, actually, is \n$2 billion less than was voted on by 79 Members of the Senate in the \nDodd-Collins amendment, which would have added $18 billion. This is $16 \nbillion. That's what came out of the conference.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That's right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So the Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. Last year this Senate voted, 79 \nSenators voted to increase title I by even more than what Senator \nKennedy has proposed in his amendment. We will see how they vote today.\n  There is one other aspect of this amendment, too, to which I just \nwant to address myself. It addresses the needs of students who cannot \nafford to go to college. This amendment would add $1.35 billion to the \nPell Grant Program, which would make it possible to increase the \nmaximum grant award from $4,000 to $4,500. Pell grants are the key \nprogram for making sure that poor and middle class students have the \nsame opportunity to attend college as our wealthy students. Pell grants \nbuy a lot less than they used to. In 1976 the maximum Pell grant award \npaid for 84 percent of the average 4-year public college tuition. Last \nyear it paid for half of that, just 42 percent. So we have fallen far \nbehind in Pell grants.\n\n  With the economy still in a rut, more people laid off, more \nunemployment, two things are going to happen. More students would like \nto go to college, to fine-tune their job skills and enhance their \ncareers. Second, more and more families will fall below the eligibility \nline. So kids who may not have qualified for Pell grants in the past \nwill now qualify because their parents are unemployed, or not employed \nfull time. So the demand in the Pell grant program will go up as the \neconomy continues to slow down. The Kennedy amendment would provide 4.5 \nmillion college students an average increase of $300 a year.\n  Think about this, think about $300 a year for the neediest students \nin this country to go to college, that juxtaposed against the \nPresident's proposed tax plan to give more and more tax breaks to the \nrichest people in this country.\n  Again, as I said, it is really a matter of priorities. This amendment \nis one that ought to have strong support in the Senate from both sides \nof the aisle. It is the right thing to do for our kids. It is the right \nthing to do for our country. Frankly, in the end, what it does is it \njust makes us live up to the commitment we made 1 year ago, to actually \nleave no child behind.\n  I commend the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership. I hope \nwe have an overwhelming vote in support of education, making sure we do \nnot leave any kids behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Massachusetts \nand all the others who have come before us this afternoon supporting \nthis amendment. This amendment supports funding for two significant \nprograms, title I and Pell grants.\n  I have been in the Congress 30 years now and this is the worst \neducation crisis this Nation has seen in that 30 years. I will go back \nto some of those that we faced before.\n  I come from the State of Justin Morrill, a United States Senator who \ngave America the Land Grant College System. The Land Grant College \nSystem opened the doors for college education for every American child, \nand I am proud of that. I am proud of Vermont's history in education.\n  I have spent 30 years, as I said, in Congress, and this is the worst \neducation crisis I have seen in that time.\n  I should have known this was coming because I was the chairman of the \neducation committee when it was introduced. I realized, as we started \nthat it was going to be tough. We gave the tests out and did a model on \nit and found out every school in America, I think, failed to pass it.\n  Then I asked them who was going to pay for the cost of the test, to \nfind out how bad you were. They said: Oh, that will be up to the \nschools. I think I finally won a battle and shamed them into thinking \nthat maybe at least they ought to pay for the tests that were going to \nprove how bad they were, and they agreed to do that.\n  Unfortunately, though, now, due to budget cuts at the State, local, \nand Federal level, those doors we thought we were opening are becoming \nclosed. We have the worst education crisis in this Nation in 60 years.\n  Pell grants are important avenues toward making higher education \navailable. The amendment before us will increase higher education \nopportunities for today's students who will be tomorrow's workforce.\n  The worst crisis we had was at the end of World War II, where \nthousands of young people came back. I was a\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\nyoung person at that time. But I know that my neighbors came back and \nthey had been interrupted in their studies in high school. They had \nbeen interrupted going to college. So we had a crisis of a magnitude \nthat was even worse than today. Hundreds of thousands of young people \ncame back without any high school education. With huge increases in \nFederal funds we made at that time, we finally got a sufficient amount \nof money into the system to allow the creation of junior colleges all \nover this Nation, and allowed people to get back to try to make up all \nthey had lost.\n  So we have experiences of how it is to react to crises and that we \ncan react if we have to. Our higher education institutions are the envy \nof the world. Yet we have so many individuals who graduate high school \nfirst in their class and so desperately want a higher education, but \nthe means are not there for them to make that goal a reality. That is a \nsad situation.\n  A similar crisis existed in this Nation in the 1960s, when the \nSputnik launch came. All of a sudden, we who thought we were the best \nin the world in science and all found that a Sputnik was raised into \nthe sky by Russia, and we recognized that we were defenseless against \nthat. Our institutions of higher education rallied due to some good \nstrong economic help. They became the best in the world. Federal funds \nwere provided to make that possible.\n\n  Instead of being behind the eight ball, we had thousands and \nthousands of students coming from all over the world to come to our \ninstitutions of higher learning, to pass and to be ready to bring this \ncountry up to a position where we could hopefully be able to head off \nattacks by missiles.\n  But we have slipped again. Our schools are in dire need, and it is \nperhaps the worst position we have been in since World War II.\n  Last week we celebrated the 1-week anniversary of No Child Left \nBehind--the law that is to provide the tools so every child will be \nable to receive a quality education. In order to accomplish this \nmission, significant commitments were made to fund K-12 programs \nauthorized under No Child Left Behind. We have yet to see those \ncommitments realized.\n  In addition, the Federal Government, all 50 States, and cities and \ntowns, are facing budget troubles as well. This is especially true in \nthe area of education--both undergraduate and graduate. For example, \nsome of our school districts are considering 4-day weeks. The Tulsa \nSchool District recently announced that it could no longer afford to \nhire substitute teachers for the remainder of the school year.\n  Beginning in the late 1940s, and continuing through the 1960s, this \nNation decided that education was a top domestic priority. I mentioned \nearlier what we did at the end of World War II. The passage of the GI \nbill at that time gave veterans access to higher education. The passage \nof the Defense Education Act, which concentrated on teacher preparation \nfor math and science, and title I which realized the importance of \nproviding education resources to our children so economically \ndisadvantaged children could also receive a quality education. We gave \nthem an opportunity, and we succeeded in doing what had to be done to \nget the quality of our education up.\n  Now we jump back to World War II again and the horrible problems we \nhad in education when hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of \nyoung people arrived without the opportunity to have had even a high \nschool education, to say anything about higher education. We found that \nwe had a crisis of great magnitude about which we had to do something. \nWe did. We made the highest increase in educational spending that \nprobably will ever be made because we increased it from 2 percent of \nthe Federal budget to 10 percent of the Federal budget--a huge \nincrease.\n  It worked. We were able to make sure those young people could \nflourish and that this country could flourish and that it could be the \neconomic wonder it turned into. But now we are in a similar situation \nwhich we need to do something about.\n  To give you an example of the comparison of what our Federal \nGovernment pays for education with the rest of the world, almost all of \nour economic competitors pay a substantial percentage of the local \nschool money. In Japan and other countries, 40 percent of the money \nthat goes to the local schools comes from their federal government. \nWhat is it in the United States? Right now, less than 2 percent--right \naround 2 percent--of the moneys for local schools comes from the \nFederal Government. We need to recognize that our schools are having \ndeep financial problems.\n  We have to, as every other country has, recognize the modern needs \nand get our share of the education up in the area of 30 to 40 percent \nfor our local schools rather than the meager 7 percent that it is now. \nThat is a big charge and a big challenge for us in the future.\n  Right now we must correct the problems created by the committee in \nmarking up this particular piece of legislation and make sure we bring \nit up to a more reasonable and effective amount of funding to make sure \nthat every child will not be left behind, but, even more than that, \nthat every child will have some chance of being able to have the \neducation they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to support the compelling notion \nthat we need to as a Congress and as a Senate and, hopefully, with this \nadministration, find a way to fully fund the Leave No Child Behind Act.\n  It is imperative for any number of reasons. I would like to speak to \na few of those reasons for a few minutes and join my colleagues who \nhave so eloquently expressed in their own ways and in their own words \nwhy this is so important.\n  Let me give you just three reasons why I think it is very important, \ncritical, and essential that we have this amendment, or something \nsimilar to it, and continue to fight for full funding.\n  No. 1, it is important that this Senate and this Congress in a \nbipartisan way continue to push for reform. We must not fail in that \neffort or we will not be able to reform our schools, whether the \nschools are in Louisiana, Mississippi, Massachusetts, Vermont, or \nCalifornia. We cannot continue to encourage them and push them to \nreform in excellence and greatness if we don't help fund them.\n  No. 2, I think it is important that as an adult, as a citizen, as a \nmother, and as a Senator we keep promises when we make them. We are, \nunfortunately, in the process, with this administration leading us, to \ncause us to break a promise. We shouldn't be breaking our promises to \nanyone, let alone the children, the schoolchildren and the students and \ntheir parents and families at a time such as this. We simply shouldn't \nbreak our promises.\n  The President is wrong to break his promise to the schoolchildren and \nto the families and to the Americans when he did not sign the act that \nthose of us on both sides of the aisle helped to craft. He just simply \nshould do that. He doesn't have to do it because there is money enough \nto fund it. It is a matter of priority.\n  A third good reason why we shouldn't go down this path is that if we \nwant to promote long-term stimulus, which I actually believe we \nshould--I believe in short-term stimulus, and there are a number of \nthings that would do that--the tax cut for dividends is not one of \nthem, but there are many ways that we could do that.\n  But one of the things that is clear to me and should be crystal clear \nto everyone in this Chamber is that a college graduate makes 50 percent \nmore over a lifetime than a person without a degree.\n  In a country where we have 260 million-plus people--maybe close to \n300 million now--it would be very important for us to make investments \ntoday that help our children, teenagers, citizens, and citizens of all \nages, to get that college degree by preparing them before they even hit \nthe kindergarten door, and then promoting their lifelong learning.\n  Why? Not only is it good for them personally and their personal \ngrowth and development as a human being, and their immediate family, \nbut for a nation, for long-term economic stimulus it brings wealth to \nAmerica. When America has wealth, and when America spends its wealth \ncorrectly, we help to lift the world to a higher place, including \nourselves. Those are just three reasons why this amendment is worth \nconsidering and just three reasons why we\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\nshould respond in the Senate, and in Congress, to what the American \npeople are asking us, imploring us, and telling us how they would like \nto have their money spent.\n  Let me just begin by giving a very brief history of how we got here. \nAbout 30 years ago or more, 35 years, the Federal Government decided \nthat States alone should not have to fund the education of its \ncitizens. While the bulk of that has to be picked up at the State and \nlocal level, the Federal Government decided it was in the Federal \nGovernment's interest to make sure every child was getting a quality \neducation. Regardless of whether a child was born or grew up in a very \npoor, small town, with limited resources, and a limited tax base, or \nwhether a child was born in a very wealthy part of the country, it was \nin the country's interest to have a school system that was strong in \neducating the citizens of the future.\n  So the Federal Government enacted, 35 years ago, a way for us to \nsupplement in a small way, but in an important way, money for \neducation, and we went along that road for over 35 years. Every 5 years \nwe would reauthorize the elementary and secondary account, adding \nprogram after program, trying to get money to places that needed it, \ntrying to help promote and urge and encourage States to, at first, help \nall students, and then we helped disabled students, and then there have \nbeen many early reading programs. I could go on--arts in education. We \ntried it, and many of these programs worked. Some of them did not work, \nbut many of them worked.\n  But then, just a few years ago--2 years ago--after 35 years of this \ngeneral framework, we said: That is not enough. Because the public \nisn't just asking us to spend more money, the public wants results for \nthe money we spend. Why are we continuing to fund schools that fail? \nWhy is it every time there is a problem, we just add a new program? So \nsome of us said: It doesn't make sense. We have been doing it for 35 \nyears. Let's do something differently. And we did.\n  We joined forces, Republicans and Democrats, and we said: No, we are \nnot going to abandon the public school system and come up with a system \nof vouchers. We said no to a group of people who only wanted to send \nmore money. And do you know what? We won that battle, and the President \nhelped to lead that battle. We said: No, we are not going to abandon \nthe public school system, but we are also not going to keep funding \njust yet one more program and throwing money at it. We are going to \nreform the schools.\n  So we raised standards. We instituted pretty rigorous tests. We put \non deadlines, to tell our schools--and in Louisiana this is a big \ndeadline for us to meet--no longer can you have unqualified or \nuncertified teachers. You have to have completely certified teachers. I \nam happy with that. I helped to initiate that as one of the major \nreforms. But it is going to be a heavy lift in Louisiana and in other \nStates, even with alternative certification, even with recruiting, even \nwith raising the teachers' salaries, even with improving their \nbenefits, to get a qualified, certified teacher in every classroom in \nAmerica. But we did that. We put that deadline in the bill.\n\n  We also, besides the testing, besides the qualification, increased \nstandards. Then we turned around and pulled the plug on funding. So we \nhave set our students up and our system up, made them a real big \npromise, and then are just about getting ready to walk away. And it \nshould not happen. I am going to fight, along with many Senators in \nthis Chamber, to make sure it does not happen because it is not right, \nit is not smart, and it is not fair.\n  So we did not just throw more money. We said: Investment in education \nwithout accountability is a waste of resources. I do not believe in \nwasting resources. Why? Because we have a couple of wars we might have \nto fund. We cannot waste a penny. We are fighting in Iraq. We are \nhelping rebuild Afghanistan, holding off a potential conflict in Korea. \nWe do not have time in this Chamber to waste any money.\n  So we have reformed the system, retooled the system, and said: We \ndon't want you to just continue funding failure. So the States all over \nthis Union--and there are a lot of people engaged in this effort--are \ndepending on us to deliver the funding to help them. And what do we do, \nat the first chance? This administration backs down from its commitment \nto fund it.\n  I am hoping we can reverse this decision, move some money into this \narea, so we can eventually increase the share of Federal funds to \neducation, maybe yet, to a percentage of somewhere between 10 and 20 \npercent. We were at 7 percent. We got up to 12 percent. I would like to \nsee us get up to 20 percent.\n  Why? There is no magic number, but if we want to be honest with \nourselves, and we want to say, as a Federal Government, what portion we \nhave to contribute so we can pretty much guarantee that even if you \nwere born in a poor little town, with very little tax revenue to \nsupport your school, or you graduated, like Harry Reid did, from \nSearchlight, NV--he had eight people in his graduating class; I don't \nknow how rich Searchlight is, but probably it is not a very rich town--\nor a small town in Louisiana, such as Dulac--whether you come from a \nsmall town or whether you happen to be born in a very wealthy place, \nbecause you are an American, and because we think it is important for a \ndemocracy to be educated in order for it to exist, the Federal \nGovernment thinks we should contribute at least 20 percent to the \neducation of our children.\n  We are not even anywhere near there, and the Senator from New \nHampshire understands this. We need to be moving, not in the direction \nwe are going but in a different direction, even if it means cutting \ndown on some tax cuts we would like to give.\n  If the President would fund this, I don't care if he would give every \nmillionaire in the country a big tax cut. I don't have a problem with \nthat. What I do have a problem with is suggesting tax cuts before he \nlives up to his promises he made, with our support, to the children of \nthis country.\n  Let me also say, this is pretty much of a crisis. I will tell you \nwhy. Everybody says everything is a crisis on this floor, but let me \ntry to give you some hard numbers.\n  The States have a shortfall. Maybe it is because they do not manage \ntheir money well. Some people think that: They have a shortfall because \nthey cannot run any good programs and Government is bad and Government \ndoes not do anything good. But, for whatever the reason, the States are \ngoing to be short $17.5 billion.\n  As you will recall, what I just said is that the States pick up the \nmost important part of funding for schools. In my State, it is a great \npercentage because we rely less on property taxes at the local level \nand more at the State level. So my State government contributes between \n60 and 70 percent of the total education budget for all of the \nschoolchildren in Louisiana.\n  Maybe in other States the local governments pick up more of that \nfunding. But as States have crises in their budgets, they are going to \npass that headache of the shortfall on to their cities and on to their \ncounties, and, in our State, on to their parishes.\n  So the States are going to have to probably cut their education \nbudgets unless they are in some kind of trust fund. While our State has \nsomething like that, we cannot completely protect our education \ndollars.\n  So if we do not step to the plate and live up to our promise, they \nare going to get a double whammy. We have said--and basically did not \ntell the truth about funding this new reform act: You raise your \nstandards, you put in these goals and objectives, and we will be there \nwith you, buddy, every step of the way. And the first chance we get, we \nwalk away. Then, on top of that, you could argue that policies \nconducted by this Congress, and things that are out of our control--\nsuch as 9/11 and terrorist attacks, which we, of course, are doing \neverything we can to fight against--have caused the economy to turn \nsour in many ways. But they find themselves $17.5 billion short.\n  Where are the States going to go to get their money? To their \neducation budgets, which will make the situation worse. I know the \nSenator from Massachusetts wants to engage others in the debate. I want \nhim to know the reason I would like to stay on the floor for a couple \nof hours is that this isn't a little change to Louisiana, this is $122 \nmillion that is going to be short in my State, on top of which they are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\nto have to probably cut the education budget to balance their budget. \nWhy? Because States can't deficit spend like we do--sometimes in a more \nhaughty fashion than we should. They can't deficit spend. They have to \nbalance the budget.\n  On whose backs are they going to balance the budget in the State? The \nbacks of the children who are trying to learn to read but they can't \nlearn to read because we won't put a qualified teacher in their \nclassroom.\n  When you want to spread the responsibility for fighting a war and for \nother things, then put the responsibility at least on the backs of \nthose physically strong enough to bear it. But no, we are about ready \nto put it on the backs of kids who can't bear the burden and should not \nhave to bear the burden. It is wrong.\n  I hope we will find the wherewithal, from wherever we get the money, \nor, if we have to, put this on par with the tax cut. We are deficit \nspending for a tax cut. Why not deficit spend for education? What \nanswer will the President give to the Senate? What will he say? I think \nit is OK to deficit spend for a tax cut but it is not OK to deficit \nspend for education? What is his answer? He doesn't have an answer.\n  I have a quote I keep in my office. I try to read it to myself to \nremind me of why I am here: If you want 1 year of prosperity, you grow \ngrain. If you want 10 years of prosperity, you grow trees. And if you \nwant 100 years of prosperity, you invest in people.\n  The best way we can invest in people is to invest in an education \nsystem. If we don't want to invest in it, then we should not be telling \nthem every year what to do, what tests to give, how many teachers to \nhire. We should just keep our mouths shut and walk away and let them \nfigure it out. But we dragged them to the deal. We dragged them to the \ntable. Some of them came more happily than others. And we got a new act \nand a new approach. And then the first thing we do is walk away. I \nthink it is a disgrace.\n  I know my colleagues are going to come down here and they are going \nto talk about the other side of the aisle: All the Democrats want to do \nis spend more money. I am not one of those Democrats. And I don't think \nDemocrats generally want to. But I most certainly have shown on this \nissue I am not just willing to spend more money for education. I will \nfight the good fight for accountability, but I will be darned if I am \ngoing to fight the fight for accountability and then have the \nRepublicans say they will deficit spend for everything--the military, \ntax cuts--but won't deficit spend for education, leaving the country \nvulnerable in the short term and in the long term because of it.\n  I rise to support the amendment. I would like to fund it in many \ndifferent ways. It could be funded. It is a relatively small amount of \nmoney, $6 billion to live up to even a partial part of our promise, \nover 10 years $60 billion, one-tenth of what the President is \nsuggesting for a tax cut.\n  For those reasons and others, I strongly suggest that we reverse \ncourse, that the public, the people in Louisiana, the viewing audience \nwould let the President of the United States know how disappointed they \nare that his budget and his proposal fail to live up to the promises he \nmade when he signed the bill for education. Let Democrats themselves \nrecommit to make sure that we have our priorities in order and that we \nput the education of our children and their ability to grow and to \nbecome all that God intended for them to be when He created them, let \nus be part of that part of strengthening our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am hopeful we can arrive at some \ntimeframe for wrapping this up and getting on to a vote. I have spoken \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts about that. I believe he is also \namenable to that approach. I do intend to lay down an amendment in a \nfew minutes which we have already represented will be one of two \namendments voted on.\n  Prior to laying down that amendment, I did want to respond to a \nnumber of the representations made over the last hour or so on the \nissue of the President's commitment to No Child Left Behind and the \nRepublican Party's commitment to it and how we will make this law work \nwell.\n  First, let's remember, when this law was passed, it really was a \nbipartisan effort to try to accomplish something special for our kids, \nespecially low-income kids on whom we had just an inordinate amount of \ndata and, unfortunately, real-life examples of the fact that they were \nnot being educated at a level that made them competitive in America, \nthat low-income kids were being left behind and that, as a result, we \nwere turning out generations of children who were not able to \nparticipate in the American dream because they were not able to read \nand write and to add and subtract and do math at a level competitive \nwith their peers.\n  All these numbers get thrown out here, but this bill, No Child Left \nBehind, has at its core the simple purpose of making sure that American \nchildren, children in our public school system, which is the essence of \nthe strength of our Nation--we all understand that; the ability to get \nan education in America and the public school system has and always \nwill be the essence of our strength--learn what they need to learn, \nthat they are able, when they finish their elementary and secondary \nschool experience, to participate in American society, to find a good \njob, and take part in the American dream. That was the purpose.\n  You have to thank the President for leading the Nation in this \ndirection. He feels it with great emotion and purpose, as does the \nSenator from Massachusetts, as do many people who worked on this bill. \nWe want to do something that gives those kids an extra shot at the \nAmerican dream, make sure they do not get left behind.\n  No Child Left Behind was passed, and it had four basic purposes. I \nwill just quickly recite them so we are all working off the same page. \nThe first purpose was to give local school districts more flexibility \nover how they managed their dollars, Federal dollars specifically.\n  The second purpose was to make sure there was an accountability \nsystem where, when a child goes through the system, how a child is \ndoing at different grade levels could be compared to other grade \nlevels.\n  The third purpose, of course, was to fund adequately this bill, which \nI believe was done, and which I think we can defend. On that point of \nfunding, I want to start with a little bit of a comparison. When the \nPresident came into office, we, of course, had the experience of a \nprior administration in the area of title I, low-income programs. The \nClinton administration--in the 7 years leading up to President Bush's \nundertaking of this effort--had put approximately $2 billion into title \nI.\n  Within the first 2 years of President Bush's administration, he added \n$2.5 billion to title I. The single largest increase ever experienced \nby title I occurred in his first year, the second largest increase was \nin his second year, and probably the third largest will occur in the \nthird year--if he gets the billion dollars he asked for. That is title \nI.\n  The practical implications of this are that increases under President \nBush represented about a 27-percent jump in title I over what the prior \nadministration did. If you look at it in cumulative years, you see it \nis rather startling. Over 7 years, the Clinton administration did $2 \nbillion. Over 2 years, President Bush did $2.5 billion. Massive \nincreases. To put it into real dollar terms, the difference in new \neducation funding--total--between the last year of the Clinton \nadministration and the first year of the Bush administration is, again, \n$20 billion--$42 billion versus $60 billion. These are massive \nincreases of funding into the educational system in order to try to \nmake sure we meet the requirements and needs of No Child Left Behind.\n  In addition to this type of funding, which was direct cash into the \nschool systems type of funding on the discretionary side, the President \nalso made a huge and dramatic commitment in the area of giving parents \nmore dollars in their pockets, through a tax cut, which was directed \nspecifically at the issue of helping parents educate their children--a \n$30 billion tax cut, which created new deductions for qualified high \neducation expenditures, increased the amount individuals could \ncontribute to their educational savings accounts, and dramatically \nexpanded the availability\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\nof tax-free distributions for qualified tuition plans--a very \nsignificant effort, which has basically been overlooked and never even \nmentioned in the debate on the other side.\n  This tax cut the President put in place, which benefits moderate-\nincome Americans as they attempt to educate their children with cash in \ntheir pockets, which they can then put into the savings vehicles and \nother vehicles that assist them as their children get ready for \ncollege--and also assist in the elementary and secondary school area--\nalso helped teachers by giving them some deductions that they didn't \nhave before as they spend money in doing things relative to their \nclassrooms, such as buying books, maps, and things such as that.\n  In addition to the huge increases, the $20 billion actual increase--a \nhuge increase in title I funding--the President made a dramatic \ncommitment to IDEA, special education, the biggest single commitment to \nspecial education in the history of the country. Again, this dwarfs the \neffort made by the Clinton administration in special education. During \nthe run-up years before President Bush came into office, President \nClinton actually proposed virtually no increase in special education. \nIn fact, in 1992-93 when he came into office, you would see virtually \nno green bar. The only year the Clinton administration asked for a \nsignificant increase was in his last year in office when they asked for \n$300 million, I think. There were dramatic increases made in this \nperiod--in 1999, 2000, 2001--and they came as a result of the \nRepublican Congress and the leadership. I would like to think I played \na role in that, along with Senator Lott and Senator Specter. We were \nable to dramatically increase special education funding during this \nperiod.\n\n  When President Bush came into office, he ratcheted up special \neducation funding dramatically, putting a billion dollars of new money \ninto special education in each of the first 2 years of his term in \noffice, which translated to money going back into the school districts \nto assist them in moving forward and addressing the requirements of \nspecial needs children.\n  So we have had increases in title I, which are historic under this \nadministration, and which dwarfed the increases in title I put in by \nPresident Clinton's administration--a 27-percent increase just in year \n1. We have increases in overall discretionary education funding of $20 \nbillion year to year. We have the increases in special education \nfunding--again, dwarfing anything done in the prior administration--a \nbillion-dollar annual increase each year. And we have the massive \nincrease in availability of money to parents to save for their \nchildren's education through the tax cut.\n  So the effort here has not been anything but significant in the area \nof trying to make sure we have funding in education, and this \nadministration has certainly made that commitment. This chart shows how \nthat works in relationship to all the other funding going on in the \nFederal Government. Here we are in the midst of a war on terrorism. We \nhave a health care concern. If you look at the education funding, it \nhas gone up 132 percent. Health care funding has gone up 96 percent. \nDefense spending has gone up 48 percent. The fact is that education \nfunding is outstripping every other element of the Federal budget by \ndramatic amounts as a percentage and, in real terms, in real dollars \nflowing back to the States.\n  No Child Left Behind specifically. I already mentioned that the title \nI money has jumped by 27 percent. Let's look behind that to some of the \nother accounts that are involved in the No Child Left Behind bill. One \nof the important things the No Child Left Behind bill did was to take \nall sorts of accounts, merge them together, and then say to the local \ncommunities: Here is the money, with no strings attached. You can do \nwhat you want with this money. But in the end, what we want is to make \nsure that every child at the third-grade, fourth-grade, fifth-grade, or \nsixth-grade level has learned enough so that their parents and the \nother people in the community can compare whether or not that child is \nlearning at a level that is competitive with their peers and with other \nschool districts: Accountability, to put it quite simply.\n  Instead of controlling input and having lots of strings running to \nthe child and to the funding, as it came out of the Congress, we \nreversed that trend and said: We are not going to put a lot of strings \non what comes out of the Congress, but we are going to expect results. \nWe have had discussion of this before. One area where I think this has \nbeen most telling and constructive is that of teachers. This bill took \na lot of the different teacher funds, such as the Eisenhower Fund and \nthe classroom size fund, and moved them into a pool of money, and then \nit said to the local school district--principals especially because \nthey are key here--you can take this new pool of money, and instead of \nhaving to spend it under the categorical terms you used to get it under \nso you could only spend it for the purpose of basically classroom size \nreduction or teaching math-science, you can use it however you want for \nyour teachers, to improve your teacher situation. If you want to hire \nmore teachers, you can do that. If you want to have your teachers \nbetter trained, you can do that. If you want your teachers to have \nbetter technical support, you can do that. If you have good teachers \nand you want to pay them more to keep them, you can do that with the \nmoney. All sorts of different options were given to the local school \ndistricts to make sure that teacher money was more effectively used. \nAnd then we increased the money flowing into that account, again \ndramatically--35 percent. That was up by $742 million over the last \nyear of the Clinton administration.\n\n  So, once again, I think you can see that the game plan of No Child \nLeft Behind was to fund aggressively, with flexibility, and then leave \nit to the local school districts to find out how to best use the \ndollars. That is exactly what has been accomplished. The number \nincreases, as I have said, are rather dramatic in this area. In fact, \nthe number increase in education has been so dramatic that we presently \nhave here at the Federal Government approximately $4.5 billion that has \nnot been drawn down by the States and local communities because the \nmoney has been flowing in so fast that they cannot keep up with how to \nspend it. That is hard to believe, but it is true.\n  Here is a chart that reflects that $4.5 billion. The majority of it \nis in the school improvement program, and in the special education \ngrant program, and in the education for disadvantaged program. But it \nis there, and it is available, and it hasn't been spent yet.\n  When I hear colleagues on the other side saying there is a dearth of \nmoney available in the Federal Government, and just because we have \nincreased it by 27 percent, that is not enough; and because we \nincreased it by $20 billion in a year, that is not enough; and just \nbecause we cut these taxes, that is not enough; and just because we \nhave a 12-percent increase in educational funding, that is not enough, \nit does seem to me when we have $4.5 billion sitting down there at the \nDepartment of Education waiting to be distributed, that might be a sign \nwe are doing a pretty good job in putting money into the system and, \nhopefully, we are going to start getting it out the door, too, fairly \nsoon.\n  That is where we stand today. A very important point is that if you \nwant to do another comparison, which I think is fairly interesting, we \nhave heard almost incessantly we have to fund the authorization level; \nwe have to fund the authorization level; we have to fund the \nauthorization level. The only problem with that argument is the \nCongress almost never funds the authorization level. Authorization is a \ngoal, but it is hardly ever attained. The purpose of authorization and \nappropriations is sometimes quite different.\n  If we are to assume that is the purpose--that we must fund the \nauthorization level--then I have to ask my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle: What were they doing the last time they controlled the \nCongress and the Presidency? What were they doing? Because at that time \nthere was a $2.7 billion difference between the authorized level and \nthe appropriated level, which represented a 21-percent difference.\n  If we look at the Bush administration's difference between authorized \nand appropriated levels, it is 15 percent. We are doing 50 percent \nbetter under this administration. It is pretty hard to defend this \nauthorization argument, in my opinion.\n  That puts us at the point where we are now, and I hope I have \nadequately\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\nresponded to some of the comments on the other side, although I suspect \nI might have engendered some other comments from the other side. But \nlet me go on to the amendment which I intend to offer. I am still \nawaiting its arrival, so I will have to wait before I can send it to \nthe desk.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to say: OK, I am willing to increase \nthe funding for education, and I think people on our side are willing \nto increase the funding for education, but let's do it in a way that is \nresponsible. The President has said--and it was agreed to at one \npoint--that we will stay at a $750 billion discretionary number. I \nthink it is pretty important we start getting fiscal discipline around \nhere or we are going to be in big trouble. I think that is obvious.\n  In order to accomplish this--I do think education is a priority, and \nI do think as we prioritize items within the Federal Government we have \nto put education right up there. In fact, if I were to prioritize, I \nwould put fighting terrorism as No. 1, and that is in a class by itself \nbecause we have to defend ourselves. These people want to kill us \nbecause we are Americans, and we have to make sure we are ready to \nrespond to them and defend ourselves. Fighting terrorism is No. 1.\n  Right behind fighting terrorism comes the issue of education. I \nbelieve a reasonable approach to this question of how we fund education \nis that if we are going to jump the number significantly--and under the \nproposal of the Senator from Massachusetts, he has about $4.6 billion \nin here for No Child Left Behind, we are going to jump that amount \ndramatically, then we ought to do it in a way that is fiscally \nresponsible.\n\n  I am offering an amendment which increases the funding by $5 billion, \nbut it says that we do an across-the-board cut to get to that number so \nthat we are going to stay under the $750 level.\n  In addition, I do not know about my colleagues, but I am hearing from \nmy school systems again: We need more flexibility. I am saying we have \n$5 billion you can fund No Child Left Behind, you can fund anything \nunder the No Child Left Behind bill, but we are not going to put any \nstrings on this. You are, basically, going to get this money to assist \nyou at the local schools in undertaking and accomplishing the No Child \nLeft Behind effort. In addition, you can use this money, if you feel \nyou need to, for IDEA and for programs like TRIO.\n  Essentially, we are not going to put any strings on this. We are \ngoing to send it back to the States and say: All right, States, this is \nan add-on. You are concerned about unfunded mandates. If there is \nanything in this bill that is unfunded and is a mandate, these dollars \nwill certainly take care of it.\n  I want to touch base on that because there was some representation \nout here that the testing regime in the bill is an unfunded mandate. It \nsimply is not. It is fully funded under this bill, and the bill \nspecifically says you do not have to pursue the testing regime if it is \nnot paid for. That is a totally irresponsible statement.\n  In fact, and I know in my State, they are spending $300,000 per test. \nUnder this bill, they are going to get $500,000 per test. So they are \nactually going to make money in their testing regime in New Hampshire, \nwhich I am sure they will put to good use in some other area of \neducation.\n  This amendment is a fairly reasonable, straightforward amendment. It \nis $5 billion more. It is actually a little higher than the proposal of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts in the area of No Child Left Behind \nfunding--$5 billion more--but it is going to be done by an across-the-\nboard cut so it is fiscally responsible. The money will be available \nwith no strings attached. Our local school districts and State school \ndistricts can see we mean it when we say there is no unfunded mandate \nin this bill.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 19\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk. I hope we \ncan enter a time agreement for a vote on these two amendments. I ask \nthe Senator from Massachusetts if he feels we can enter such a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have yet to see the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is being brought to the Senator at this moment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me have a chance to review it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 19.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding for innovative programs at the \n                         state and local level)\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n\n     ``SEC.  . FUNDING FOR INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS.\n\n       In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated under \n     this Act for part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965, the following sums are \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003, \n     $5,000,000,000 for carrying out such part, to remain \n     available through September 30, 2004; Provided, that \n     notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any amounts \n     appropriated for programs or activities under title III of \n     Division G that are in excess of $54,195,685,000 shall be \n     distributed to States and local educational agencies in \n     accordance with sections 5111 and 5112 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 to be used by such States and \n     local educational agencies to carry out any activity \n     authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965, the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, \n     or the Higher Education Act of 1965, to remain available \n     through September 30, 2004: Provided further, that the \n     percentage amount of any across-the-board rescission provided \n     for under section 601 of Division N of this Act shall be \n     increased by the percentage amount necessary to rescind an \n     amount of funds equal to the total amounts appropriated in \n     excess of $54,195,685,000 for title III of Division G.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I reserve my request of the Senator from \nMassachusetts and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I want to have a chance to review \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have had a very good discussion with seven or eight \nof our colleagues who have spoken. Senator Reed wants to speak. Senator \nClinton, Senator Corzine, and Senator Stabenow also want to make \ncomments.\n  This has been an important debate. I agree with the Senator from New \nHampshire that the issues of ensuring protection at home and education \nare the Nation's top two priorities. We do not differ, evidently, on \nthose issues. We have important differences on how to assist in \neducation. I will mention a couple quick responses to the Senator.\n  My first response is about the unspent figures, about $4.5 billion. \nMost agencies, not all, but most agencies have unspent funding. The \nreason the funds are not spent is because we are in the middle of the \nschool year. Do we understand that the funds that will be in this \nomnibus bill will be for the next year, for July? That is when they \nwill be committed.\n  We have unspent money because we are only halfway through the school \nyear. The districts have already obligated these funds. Anyone who does \nnot believe that there are severe fiscal challenges in local school \ndistricts has not talked with their local school board, principals, \nstudents, or the teachers in communities across this country. That is \nnumber one.\n  Second, I welcome the fact the Senator from New Hampshire wants to \neffectively take credit for the increases we were able to agree on in \nthe No Child Left Behind legislation. As he remembers very well, when \nthe bill was first introduced, it was $500 million. It ended up at $1.5 \nbillion because we insisted on it. I am glad we worked that out in a \nbipartisan way. I am glad he is prepared to say that is part of the \nBush commitment at this time.\n  We ought to understand exactly what the history has been. When he \ntalks about the increase over the last 2 years, he is talking about the \nincrease which the Democrats were able to get, with the agreement of \nthe Republicans, in the last year of the Clinton proposal.\n  The Senator makes a fair point in terms of the funding of Title I \nunder the previous administration. I would have liked to have seen this \nfunding higher, but it was not higher. We have to recognize all that \nwas being done in the area of education during that period of time, \nwhich was extremely important, to respond to many of the challenges in \nthe areas of title I.\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\n  Under the previous administration, what did they have? They had no \nschool left behind. To do what? To provide funds at the local school \nlevel. To do what? To establish standards, which were eventually \nadopted in the No Child Left Behind legislation. There was basic school \nreform in the good legislation of Goals 2000 that was passed. We had \nthe school-to-work program, that has not been referenced, but has been \nvery important in terms of opening opportunities for students moving \nout of high schools.\n  There was expansion of the TRIO program, which also is a program \nwhich targets the disadvantaged. We also had expansion and improvement \nof Head Start. We had AmeriCorps, which was a new educational \nopportunity. We had the GEAR UP program, which built upon the concept \nthat rather than just looking for individuals whose education ought to \nbe furthered by special individual help and assistance at the \nuniversity, to look instead at the idea of helping a whole class, \nmoving a whole class forward. A very interesting and new concept, \nparticularly to tie universities to school districts with disadvantaged \nchildren. A great deal was done in that time.\n  There was also the HOPE scholarship, the lifelong learning \nscholarship. There was a lot of educational activity during that period \nof time. I think it is fair to say that we did not see the expansion in \nTitle I that we have seen in recent times; but in the area of \nprioritizing education, no administration can compete with what was \nachieved in the Clinton administration, quite frankly. Many of us are \nproud to be a part of it.\n  Nonetheless, when we take all of that apart, let us get to what the \nfacts are. I have in my hand a report by the Center on Education \nPolicy. This is not a Democratic report. This is not a Republican \nreport. This is a board of some of the most distinguished educators \nacross the country, and this is what it says, effectively: We have \nfound that the fiscal crisis in most States, coupled with the prospect \nof limited Federal aid, threatens the successful implementation of this \nambitious law, the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  There it is. At this time, we have more than 6 million children who \nqualify for assistance under Title I who are not assisted without this \nkind of amendment. With this amendment, we would include 2 million more \nof those children. Without this amendment, maybe 354,000 of those \nchildren are helped. So are we going to try to reach out to children \nwho are being challenged educationally in every community, as the \nSenator, my friend from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, has pointed out, \nwhich is a major kind of reform in terms of advancing teacher training, \ninvolving the parents, developing good curriculum and working with \nafterschool programs, or are we going to cast them adrift?\n  We have the framework. We will lose the opportunity. Those are the \nfacts concerning the number of children who still remain to be covered. \nThat is the essential part of where we are in the funding.\n\n  Now I will say a word about the Gregg amendment, and then I will \nyield. This puts $5 billion in a block grant which will go to the \nStates. As far as we are reading it now, it is not directed toward the \ntitle I program. If I am wrong on that, I hope to be corrected because \nwe just received this amendment.\n  What our amendment does is, it deals with the title I program. It \nalso deals with Pell grants, but it is primarily for title I, the \nneediest children. The primary purpose of President Bush's program was \ntitle I, but the Gregg amendment is not a title I program, it is \nbasically a block grant to the States. It does not focus on or require \nthat it be spent on title I.\n  It provides for a 1.3-percent across-the-board cut in addition to the \n1.6-percent cut, which is almost double the amounts that previously \nwould have been cut. If this program is supported, this will mean \n248,000 women, infants, and children will be turned away from the WIC \nprogram. It eliminates 8,600 children from the Head Start program. It \nmeans 250,000 fewer veterans being treated, 1.6 million fewer visits by \nveterans to outpatient clinics. Eighty-eight thousand fewer families \nwould receive housing assistance. And the list goes on.\n  This omnibus bill is $10 billion less than what was basically agreed \nto in the previous Congress. My amendment says $6 billion of that will \nbe used now. It will still be $4 billion less than what was agreed to \nlast year, even with this amendment. It is effectively replicating what \n79 Members of the Senate voted for.\n  Some say, well, that does not really make much difference because it \nwas an authorization. It evidently made a difference to the Senators \nfrom Maine and Connecticut who offered the amendment and to the 79 \nMembers who voted for it and went back to their constituents and said \nthey voted for it, said: This is what we believe in.\n  I take their votes seriously. That was for $18 billion. This would be \na total of $16 billion. I hope the Senator's amendment will not be \nagreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as we consider appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2003, I want to express my strong support for Senator Kennedy's \namendment to increase funds for education spending by $6 billion. This \nincrease would bring the total funding for Title I programs to $16 \nbillion, the level authorized by the No Child Left Behind Act that was \nsigned into law by the President. It is imperative that Congress sends \na strong message supporting education accompanied by strong funding for \nthis important goal. The practice of paying lip service to improving \neducation for our Nation's children without following up with the money \nthat States and local school districts to do so must cease. Only then \nwill children and educators receive the resources they need to meet \nhigher standards and eliminate barriers to higher education.\n  States are struggling with budget shortfalls, rising student \nenrollment, and an increasing number student with limited English \nproficiency. At the same time, States are working to meet the new \nrequirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. I supported the No Child \nLeft Behind Act because I agreed with its principles, all public school \nchildren should be able to achieve and all schools should be held \naccountable in seeing that they do so.\n  I believed the President when he said education would be a priority. \nBut now the Senate is considering a spending bill that encapsulates the \nPresident's proposed education funding levels, a bill that does not \neven provide a 1 percent increase over fiscal year 2002 spending. The \nNo Child Left Behind Act requires a variety of new requirements \nincluding annual standardized testing and increased teacher \ncertification. While we can expect our educators to do all within their \npower to improve our schools, we cannot expect this landmark \nlegislation to be effective if States and school districts are not \ngiven the resources to implement these programs.\n  Congress must also demonstrate its commitment higher education. We \nall know that pursuing a college degree dramatically increases earning \npotential. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median \nincome for high school graduates is $28,800 but is $46,300 for those \nwith a bachelor's degree. However, the burden of higher education costs \nis crushing low-income students and their families. The inability to \npay for college makes it more and more likely low-income students will \nbe unable to pursue higher education or do so facing staggering debt \nupon completion. The economic benefits are clear but the promise of \nmany will not be fulfilled if Congress does not assure that every \nstudent eligible for a Federal student aid receives it and if the \nmaximum Pell Grant award is not raised to bridge the gap between higher \neducation costs and the ability of many to pay.\n  Many States are considering stiff tuition hikes at their public \ninstitutions. Between 1991-1992 and 2001-2002, average tuition and fees \ngrew 37 percent in private 4-year institutions and 38 percent in public \n4-year institutions, outstripping the 8 percent growth in inflation-\nadjusted median family income over that same period. Maryland's public \nuniversity system is notifying its students that it may have to raise \ntuition by up to five percent for the Spring 2003 semester so these \nyoung people have to face the dilemma of addressing increases after \nalready budgeting for a certain amount. The National Center for \nEducation Statistics estimates that annual prices for undergraduate \ntuition, room, and board were\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\nestimated to be $7,621 at public colleges and $21,423 at private \ncolleges for the 2000-2001 academic year. Yet the maximum Pell Grant \naward is only $4,000 per year. In addition, more and more student aid \nis being shifted from grant money to loans. Senator Kennedy's amendment \nwould help over 200,000 students by adding $1.35 billion for the Pell \nGrant program making it possible to increase the maximum award to \n$4,500.\n  While we consider education funding, it is important to note the \nchallenges we face in educating children with disabilities. Congress \nmust increase the Federal contribution for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act, IDEA. When Congress enacted IDEA, it committed the \nFederal Government to pay 40 percent of the average per pupil cost of \neducating students with disabilities. However, to this day, the Federal \nGovernment has provided only 16.7 percent. The Federal Government must \nmake good on its promise and provides the resources disabled students \nand their families need.\n  That we can consider a tax cut aimed at the wealthiest Americans \nwhile purporting to be unable to adequately fund education programs is \nabsurd. Where are our priorities? Now is the time to move beyond the \nrhetoric of the No Child Left Behind Act and deliver the resources that \nteachers and students so desperately need. I urge my colleagues to vote \nin favor of Senator Kennedy's amendment and to support meaningful \nincreased in education spending.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, if there is one thing that this Senate \ncan agree on wholeheartedly is that we, as a Nation, need to invest in \nour children's educational future. There is no other issue that hits \ncloser to home for America's families.\n  But even as we recognize the importance of education, we must realize \nthat close to home is where education works best in America, and simply \nspending more and more Federal dollars on more and more Federal ``one \nsize fits all'' education directives will not, by itself, make our \neducation system perform better.\n  When this body voted to pass the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, I \ndid not vote for this bill. I could not vote for this bill in good \nconscience for two reasons. One, the bill fundamentally usurped control \nover education from those closest to the students. Education has been \nand should continue to be a State and local responsibility. \nAdditionally, the excessive spending within the bill provided \nunrealistic expectations.\n  Over the course of my 36 years of public service to the people of \nOhio, I have developed a passion for the issue of federalism, that is, \nassigning the appropriate role of the Federal Government in relaxation \nto State and local government.\n  Our forefathers outlined this relationship in the 10th Amendment: The \npowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor \nprohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states \nrespectively, or to the people.\n  Education is one such responsibility. And this was the tradition in \nAmerica for 200 years. Only in the last 35 years has the Federal \nGovernment played a prominent role in education in America. And even \nthen, the most we sent to our State and localities is 7 percent of the \neducation spending in America.\n  In my view, the No Child Left Behind Act not only violated that \nprinciple of federalism, it puts us on a fast-track towards thoroughly \nfederalizing education and violates local control of schools.\n  Some of my colleagues think that the Congress is the national school \nboard. Well, we are not the national school board here in this \nCongress.\n  With the expansion of education programs that the Federal Government \nundertook in that bill, I have a genuine concern that in ten or fifteen \nyears, Washington will be dictating what is happening in every school \nhouse in America. In spite of the limited contribution of the Federal \nGovernment, under the No Child Left Behind Act, Washington will be \nmandating annual tests for elementary and middle school children in \nAmerica regardless of how the kids are doing or whether or not the \nStates already have sophisticated testing regimes in place.\n  States as Ohio, where the Governor signed a new testing system into \nlaw on June 12, 2002, detailed testing systems are already in place. \nAnd no one understands how onerous additional testing programs will be. \nPrincipals, local school boards, parents and especially teachers in \nOhio are saying, ``Here we go again.''\n  We are already seeing the results of Federal intrusion into our \nNation's schools. It is an unworkable, unflexible plan that is punitive \nto our children. Simply spending more Federal dollars on more Federal \n``one size fits all'' education directives will not make our education \nsystem perform better.\n  Besides the dangerous increase in Federal control of education, I \nwant to point out the real increase in funding the Department of \nEducation has received over the past several years, during which \ndeficits have only grown. From 1998 to 2002, we have increased total \nfunding for the Department of Education by 57 percent or $20.3 billion.\n  Specifically following the passage of the No Child Left Behind \nlegislation, according to the Congressional Research Service, funding \nfor ESEA in Fiscal Year 2002 increased more by than $3 billion, 17 \npercent, from fiscal year 2001.\n  Unfortunately, because the majority of No Child Left Behind does not \nprovide actual monetary guidelines for its authorization--instead \nutilizing ``as such sums''--we have no idea of the potential costs of \nthe bill.\n  However, we can look at Title I, one of the largest accounts within \nthe No Child Left Behind Act.\n  In the Omnibus bill before us, the base text already includes an \nincrease for Title I funding of $1 billion, a 10 percent increase from \nfiscal year 2002.\n  Senator Kennedy has brought an amendment to the floor that seeks to \nappropriate the entire amount of the authorization for Title I--$16 \nbillion for fiscal year 2003. His one amendment alone would cost $6 \nbillion.\n  If we follow the argument that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle make, that the authorization level is a mandate to fully fund \nthese account, in this case Title I, this body will vacate any fiscal \nresponsibility we have.\n  Just look at the increases for Title I if we were to fully fund them: \nfrom fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003, an increase of 18.5 percent; \nfrom fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2004, an increase of 15.6 percent; \nfrom fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005, an increase of 11 percent; \nfrom fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2006, an increase of 11 percent; \nfrom fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2007, an increase of 10 percent; \nwhere is this money coming from? We are spending money we don't have.\n  The projected deficit for fiscal year 2003 is already $315 billion, \nand don't forget, folks, we have a $6.2 trillion national debt.\n  According to CBO projections that I recently requested, if we \ncontinue spending at the rate we have been spending and extend the tax \ncut, we could rack up an additional $5.4 trillion in debt by fiscal \nyear 2012.\n  This means that by fiscal year 2012, our national debt could stand at \na whopping $11.6 trillion.\n  Leaving this sort of burden on our children and grandchildren is \nsimply wrong. We need to make hard choices now so that this doesn't \nhappen.\n  We just increased the debt ceiling in June 2002, and we will probably \nneed to increase it again before the end of this year. We are looking \nat oceans of red as far as the eye can see.\n  This entire omnibus process is indicative of how the entire budget \nprocess has slipped.\n  While the House passed a budget resolution in March 2002, the Senate \nnever did.\n  That was the first time in the history of the budget process that the \nSenate failed to enact a budget resolution. Not only did we not pass a \nbudget, the Democrat leadership did not even bring a resolution to \nfloor for consideration.\n  This only precipitated what has become modus operandi for the \nSenate--not getting our appropriations bills out in time.\n  This body cannot go back in time to correct our past mistakes. We \nneed to move forward and we need to move forward now.\n  The executive branch is already one-third through the fiscal year. \nStarting this week, executive branch agencies must absorb a 3.1 percent \npay raise within Fiscal Year 2002 funding levels.\n  Many agencies will be unable to effectively allocate funds prior to \nthe\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\nend of the fiscal year without a final appropriation in the next 20 to \n30 days.\n  Let's get on with the business at hand. This Congress has much work \nto do, not the least of which is providing our Nation's seniors with a \nprescription drug benefit and an economic growth package to stimulate \nthe sagging economy.\n  The Congress and the administration have already agreed on a $750 \nbillion cap for fiscal year 2003. This amount meets President Bush's \nrequest and will fund critical priorities.\n  And let me remind my colleagues who seek to spend additional money; \n$750 billion represents an increase of over 12 percent in discretionary \nspending in just the last two fiscal years.\n  We need to be real in our assumptions and our spending habits.\n  If Congress doesn't wake up and smell the coffee, we are going to \nwake up with enormous deficits--by CBO's most recent projections, $866 \nbillion in fiscal year 2012.\n  Enough is enough.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Kennedy-\nHarkin amendment to increase education funding by $6 billion in Fiscal \nYear 2003. I cannot be present for the vote on the Kennedy-Harkin \namendment, but I would vote for it if I were Present. The increased \naccountability and teacher quality requirements of the No Child Left \nBehind Act necessitate a significant investment in our schools, but the \nomnibus appropriations bill before the Senate falls short of the needed \ninvestment. The Kennedy-Harkin amendment is critically important to \nensuring that all children can learn to high standards, which is the \ngoal of the No Child Left Behind Act. States, schools, and districts \nare diligently working to meet the stringent requirements of the new \nlaw at a time when they are facing shrinking education budgets due to \nthe state fiscal crisis. Right now states are facing a shocking $75 \nbillion budget deficit. Twelve states cut K-12 education spending last \nyear and another eleven are poised to do so this year.\n  The Kennedy-Harkin amendment would increase funding for the Title I \nprogram--the education program that provides resources for the most \neconomically disadvantaged students in the country--to the level that \nwas authorized for Fiscal Year 2003. The omnibus appropriations bill \nincludes an increase of only $1 billion, falling $4.65 billion short of \nthe level authorized by the No Child Left Behind Act. The Department of \nEducation announced that 8,652 schools will begin the 2002-2003 school \nyear ``in need of improvement.'' How will these schools be able to \nperform Mr. President, if they are not provided with the resources to \nattract and retain high quality teachers and to implement reforms that \nwill ensure all children can learn to high standards? As I stated many \ntimes during debate on the No Child Left Behind Act, tough \naccountability requirements without sufficient resources to meet the \nrequirements is cruel to students, teachers, administrators, and \nparents and ultimately it will undermine the success of the education \nlaw.\n  The Kennedy-Harkin amendment would also provide $1.35 billion to \nincrease the maximum Pell grant award from $4,100 to $4,500. Pell \ngrants are extremely important in helping financially needy students \nenroll and stay in college, many of whom would not otherwise have the \nopportunity to attend college. According to Empty Promises, a report \nreleased in June 2002 by the congressionally-mandated Advisory \nCommittee on Student Financial Assistance: ``. . . this year alone due \nto record-high financial barriers, nearly one-half of all college-\nqualified, low- and moderate-income high school graduates--over 400,000 \nstudents fully prepared to attend a four-year college--will be unable \nto do so, and 170,000 of these students will attend no college at \nall.'' If we are to reduce income inequality in this country, then we \nmust support students who are academically prepared to attend college, \nbut do not have the financial means to do so on their own.\n  The Kennedy-Harkin amendment is about opportunity. The chance for \neconomically disadvantaged students to succeed in school, and the \nchance for those same students to attend college. I urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy \namendment to increase funding for vital education programs. There is a \nlot of talk about leaving no child behind. Yet the No Child Left Behind \nAct, which we passed just last year, will be a hollow promise if we \ndon't match our rhetoric with resources. We must make sure no child is \nleft out of the budget. This amendment increases funding for two of the \nmost vital educational programs--title I and Pell grants.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act placed the burden on schools to improve. \nIt is a worthy goal, but it will be a difficult task for our schools. \nWe knew this when we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, and so we \npromised to give schools adequate resources. I am outraged that only 1 \nyear later, we are already falling behind in our commitment to \nproviding the resources needed to make the reforms work. By increasing \nfunding for title I, our Nation's poorest schools will be able to hire \nmore teachers, buy more computers, and implement the kind of reforms \nthey need to improve student achievement.\n  Increasing funding for Pell Grants is equally vital. In the 21st \ncentury, a college education is the key to moving up the opportunity \nladder. Yet the average Pell grant doesn't come close to covering \ntuition at a State college, and the gap between the cost of college and \nthe amount of financial aid available to the neediest students is only \ngetting bigger. In my own State of Maryland, colleges have had to raise \ntuition by 5 percent this year because of the State budget shortfall. \nThis amendment raises the maximum Pell grant from $4,000 to $4,500. \nThat is a big step on the way to making college more affordable for \nstudents of all backgrounds.\n  Education and the opportunity to go on to higher education are what \ngive parents hope for their children. Yet today we are still fighting \nto make sure our children go to good schools with good teachers and up-\nto-date books and facilities. That is why this amendment is so \nimportant. It will help the neediest students of all ages, elementary \nschool, middle school, high school, and college.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my good colleagues, \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Harkin, in offering this amendment to \nensure that we live up to the promise we made just over 1 year ago to \nimprove student achievement by raising standards, increasing \naccountability, and investing more resources in the classroom.\n  Recently we celebrated that 1-year anniversary of the most far-\nreaching Federal education reform in a generation. Today, we ought to \nbe celebrating our progress and looking forward to more. Instead, too \nmany public schools across the country are being taught the difference \nbetween rhetoric and reality, and when they read the name of this bill, \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, they are being taught the meaning of \nirony.\n  It is sadly fitting that the traditional first anniversary gift is \npaper because so far, this education reform has happened only on paper, \nnot in practice. The bill was signed, but the bills haven't been paid.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act is an important law. It is a bipartisan \nlaw. It is a strong expression of our intent to prepare all our \nchildren to excel in our increasingly competitive information economy. \nI am proud to have helped shape it.\n  But what good is a piece of legislation if the executive branch ducks \nits implementation? What value is a bill if government lacks the will \nto make it happen?\n  A little over a year after signing the bill, the President deserves a \nreport card on putting it into action. And here is what I would give \nhim: an ``A'' for words, a ``D'' for deeds, dollars, and dedication. In \nStamford Public Schools, where I was educated, those are pretty bad \ngrades.\n  President Bush talks plenty about the soft bigotry of low \nexpectations; somebody needs to make sure he understands the hard \nreality of inadequate appropriations. The fact is the funding levels \nthat the President has requested have been consistently, dramatically \nbelow what was originally promised, leaving inadequate funding to \neducate our neediest children.\n  Money isn't everything, but schools need money to hire good teachers.\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\nThey need money to implement high quality reforms. They need money to \ntruly raise standards. Without those resources, the new bill is just \nWashington's hollow holler for them to change.\n  It is a disgrace that the President has underfunded title I by nearly \n$5 billion compared to what was called for in the bill he himself \nsigned with great fanfare. Our amendment would, will, fill that gap by \nfunding an additional $4.65 billion, to ensure that we meet our \ncommitment to fully fund education for our Nation's most disadvantaged \nstudents.\n  In my own State of Connecticut, this would mean an addition of nearly \n$11 million for local schools to help them fund the critical reforms \nthat will raise academic achievement for all students.\n  It would also raise the maximum amount of the Pell grant to $4,500 so \nthat more low-income students are not priced out of higher education. \nMy father worked days and nights in his store to earn enough to send me \nto college. I was the first in my family to go. But for most families \nin an equivalent position today, even two incomes aren't enough to \ncover tuition.\n  The Pell grant increase we propose is not nearly enough to fully meet \nthe needs of low- and moderate-income students, but it is a positive \nstep forward. It will help make the college dream, the dream to keep \nclimbing the learning ladder and get the skills necessary to compete in \nthis information economy, a reality for more students.\n  Of course Federal money can't flow freely, not while we fight a war \nagainst terrorism at home and abroad. But the choice we face isn't \nbetween fighting the war against terrorism and fixing our schools. It \nis infuriating to hear people suggest that false choice.\n  The truth is, this administration's unfair and unaffordable tax cut, \nwhich does too little to grow the economy and too much to reward a few \ntaxpayers, has made it all but impossible to meet other critical needs.\n  Think about what it would cost to fully fund the new education law \nand raise Pell grants versus what the President wants to spend on the \nleast effective pieces of his 2001 tax cut, or on his misguided so-\ncalled stimulus plan proposed earlier this month.\n  This is about priorities. Do we spur economic growth with responsible \ntax cuts and necessary investments in education, or do we blow the bank \non unaffordable and ineffective tax cuts and chronically fail to rise \nto our commitment to education?\n  Throughout our history, public schools have been the ladder that \nchildren in poverty climb to enter the middle class, the ladder that \nkids at all economic levels climb to reach greater heights and access \nnew opportunities. More and more that ladder is extending into higher \neducation as well.\n  But in recent years, for too many kids those rungs have gotten \nslippery. The ladder has gotten rickety. If passed, this amendment will \nhelp make the learning ladder steady and strong again. But if not, as \nstandards continue to rise in our elementary and secondary schools, and \ncollege costs continue to soar, we will be setting up our kids for a \nlong, hard fall.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to \njoin me in supporting this amendment that will restore $6 billion to \nour public schools, and put us back on track for meeting our funding \ncommitment to the high-quality academic reforms Congress strongly \nsupported last year.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment by Senator Kennedy. But frankly, I am surprised and \ndisappointed that it is even necessary.\n  Just one year ago, Congress overwhelmingly passed, on a bipartisan \nbasis, the No Child Left Behind Act. Eighty-seven Senators supported \nit. Three hundred eighty-one House Member supported it. And the \nPresident signed it into law, hailing it as the most sweeping reform of \nFederal education policy in a generation.'' We all agreed that the \ncombination of flexibility, accountability, and investment were the key \nto making the new law work.\n  Now, a year later, States and school districts are working hard to \nmeet their responsibilities. But the Republican majority in Congress \nand the President are reneging on that deal.\n  The omnibus bill before us falls far short of the funding we promised \njust a year ago. In other words, just as we are asking States, teachers \nand students to achieve more, we are taking away the funding they need \nto succeed. That is a cruel joke to play on students who we committed \nto help 12 months ago.\n  The Kennedy amendment would increase education funding by $6 billion \noverall--rather than the $90 million cut recommended by the President. \nIt would ensure that Title I, the main Federal program that serves \npoor, disadvantaged children, would be fully funded. That means 2 \nmillion more poor children would be served nationwide. Wisconsin would \nreceive $229 million, an increase of nearly $80 million over fiscal \nyear 2002 levels.\n  In addition, this amendment would ensure that 200,000 more students \nin our nation have the opportunity to go to college. Unlike the \nPresident's budget request, which flatlines Pell grants, this amendment \nwould provide $1.4 billion more for Pell grants. It would increase the \nmaximum award to $4,500--the highest level ever.\n  The amendment before us would keep the promises we made to States, \nschool boards, teachers and parents across this country. It would \nincrease funding--not exhorbitantly, not unnecessarily--it simply \nprovides the funding we have already promised. States and school \ndistricts are working hard to do their part to improve education. It is \ntime that the President and Congress take responsibility and do our \npart.\n  I realize that our country has tremendous needs. We need to fully \nfund homeland security. We need to spur strong economic growth. But we \ncannot turn our backs on our children. We can afford to fully fund \neducation if we are serious about making it a priority and not just a \nsoundbite.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Are we under a time agreement at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I come to the floor to congratulate the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts on his amendment and on his efforts this \nafternoon. I said this morning I believed the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia was perhaps the most \nsignificant priority we could address, and indeed in terms of our \npersonal security that is true, but I cannot think of a higher \npriority, in terms of the long-term future and strength of this \ncountry, than this issue and this amendment.\n  We talk about the need for strength. This amendment provides it. I \nhave been home a good deal over the course of the last several months, \nand I do not know that I have ever seen a time when my teachers, my \nschool districts, my school superintendents, were more alarmed at the \ncircumstances they faced than they are today.\n  We are not alone. There are many schools in South Dakota that have \nnow been forced to move from 5-day-a-week school sessions to 4 days a \nweek. Why? Because they do not have the resources. Why? Because they \nhave to share teachers. Why? Because in many cases the Federal \nrequirements are putting burdens on them that they simply cannot meet \nbudgetarily.\n  I recall a debate we had years ago about unfunded mandates. I recall \nthat debate so vividly because, I think probably with unanimity, we \nsaid: Let's put an end to unfunded mandates. Let's say we are no longer \ngoing to press upon States and local governments more regulation if we \nare not going to provide the funding for them.\n  What has happened since that vote? Year after year, session after \nsession, we have done just the opposite. There is layer after layer of \nadditional unfunded mandates. I cannot think of anything more critical \nand more in evidence of that trend than this.\n  I was an enthusiastic backer of the No Child Left Behind Act when we \npassed it. There is a need for greater accountability. There is a need \nto recognize the importance of more shared information and a better \nunderstanding of how schools are performing. We know we need that. We \nsaid at the time, as important as reform is, it is impossible without \nresources. So we said at that time, in order to ensure that we do not \nget to the position once more of imposing unfunded mandates and \nimpressing upon school districts the need for reform without the \nsupport for reform, we would guarantee them the resources, \n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\nguarantee them the support. Guarantee them they would not be facing the \nextraordinary nightmare that my school districts are facing right now.\n\n  That is what this amendment does. This amendment says we are serious \nabout providing those resources. We are serious about providing the \nopportunity for meaningful reform. If we are going to do it, we have to \nstart in this year's appropriations bill. We cannot wait 6 more months. \nWe cannot tell the school districts, hold on, help is on the way. Help \nis needed now.\n  This amendment fully funds title I. As I talk to school districts all \nover my State and around the country, they say, if there is one thing \nyou can do to help, it is ensuring we have the resources for title I.\n  What is troubling to me is the bizarre set of priorities we continue \nto face as we look at the budgetary questions that have come before the \nCongress in the early days of the 108th Congress. We are told we cannot \nafford this amendment. We are told the cut is necessary because it is \nin keeping with a budget that requires us to cut $10 billion, first, \nand another 1.7 percent, or $6 billion, second, out of an \nappropriations bill that is already inadequate. That is what we are \ntold. We are told the only way we are going to be able to meet our \nobligations is if we make these cuts.\n  I guarantee in a couple of weeks we will be right back, saying in \nspite of all the need for the cuts, we have plenty of room for a $1 \ntrillion tax cut, most of which will go to those in the very top \nbrackets of income in the country. That is a bizarre juxtaposition of \npriorities. We have a choice of helping our kids, building strength for \nour future, recognizing that school districts are in dire straits and \nin desperate need of this help, or turn around and say no to those \nchildren, no to those school districts, no to those States, and yes to \nthe millionaires, yes to the tax cuts, yes to this extraordinary zeal, \nin spite of the need we find this very afternoon.\n  I hope on a bipartisan basis we can recognize that if we were serious \nabout passing real reform a year ago last December, if we were serious \nabout suggesting that school districts would have a new day, a new \nopportunity for meaningful reform with accountability and resources, we \nare going to support this amendment. We are going to recognize that \nschool districts have no choice but to rely on us for help through this \namendment. We are going to say yes, we recognize this is important from \nan educational point of view, from a stimulus point of view, from the \npoint of view of providing strength to our schools and to our kids. \nThere can be no more important amendment we could take up on this \nappropriations bill than this amendment this afternoon. We have to \nrecognize that.\n  I can say with unanimity, we do on this side. I only hope there are \nthose on the Republican side who recognize it, too. Let's put our real \ncommitment where our mouths were a little over a year ago. Let's say we \nunderstand the need for reform but we also understand the need for \nresources. That is what this amendment does. That is why I feel so \nstrongly about supporting it. That is why I applaud its author, Senator \nKennedy, and others, who have presented it to us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would appreciate it if the Senator from Rhode Island \nwould allow me to proceed with a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent there now be 60 minutes equally divided \nbetween myself and Senator Kennedy; provided further that following the \nuse or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelationship to my amendment, to be followed immediately by a vote in \nrelationship to Senator Kennedy's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to support the Kennedy amendment \nwhich would allow us to live up to the commitment we made just over a \nyear ago in the No Child Left Behind Act, that we would fully fund \neducational programs contained in that law and other educational \ninitiatives that are so important to all of our citizens. Today we are \nfacing a budget that does not do that.\n  I was listening to my colleague who talked about President Bush's \nefforts of the last two years with title I, which is very important. \nThese increases are commendable. I was listening to comparisons with \nPresident Clinton. I think President Clinton did extremely well in \nterms of funding education, and he focused not just on title I but also \nefforts to reduce class sizes, increase professional development, and \nincrease and improve the quality of the educational efforts throughout \nthis country.\n  It is particularly noteworthy that President Clinton exceeded all of \nhis recent predecessors in terms of Title I increases. President Reagan \nproposed a 2.99-percent cut; President George Herbert Walker Bush, a \n2.31-percent increase; and President Clinton, a 4.01-percent per year \nincrease.\n  When I arrived in 1990 in the other body and served on the Education \nCommittee there, it was recognized that education was important, but by \n1995 a Republican Congress was making its first priority the \nelimination of the Department of Education. Yet in that environment we \nwere still able to increase funding for title I and other educational \nprograms.\n  The issue is not about comparing President George W. Bush to \nPresident Clinton. We are simply asking President Bush to do what he \nsaid he would do when he signed the No Child Left Behind Act, when he \nembraced all of the reforms within this act, when he touted these \nreforms as a path-breaking development in Federal education policy.\n  He understood, I think, and certainly in the deliberations we all \ncame to the understanding, that education is not just about one \nsegment, not just about students. It is about teachers. It is about \nfacilities. It is about giving local school districts incentives to \nimprove and ensuring they do improve by setting up accountability \nmeasures. We cannot do that without providing the resources.\n  There have been discussions in the Chamber about unfunded mandates, \nand my colleague from New Hampshire pointed out that in his view the \ntesting is not an unfunded mandate because we will fund the testing. \nThe reality is that we are telling school districts to not only test, \nbut then to take those results and improve schools.\n  I already have schools in Rhode Island that have been required by the \nDepartment of Education to be certified as not making sufficient \nprogress. Under our legislation, that triggers steps the State and \nschool districts must take. Those steps are not without costs. Yet we \nare not providing sufficient resources to meet all of those costs.\n  That is the unfunded mandate. That is what is objectionable. That is \nwhat we hear in every State capital in every community. You asked us to \ngo out and test our children, you asked us to start reforming, you \nasked us to have better teachers, better facilities, better libraries. \nYou give us money to test, but where are the other resources? That is \nthe heart of this whole discussion and whole debate.\n  I recall, they were so eloquent and so passionate, the words of our \nlate colleague, Paul Wellstone, who said repeatedly:\n\n       We cannot realize the goal of leaving no child behind on a \n     tin cup budget.\n\n  There were loads of us who, a year ago, applauded the approach but \nfeared the authorization would be what it seems to be on the floor this \nevening, just a hortatory, nice thing to do, rather than a goal we are \nbound and committed to achieve.\n  Last year, no one was talking about this as just merely suggestions, \nthese authorization levels. They talked about it as a real commitment. \nThat is why we are here. That is why Senator Kennedy has this \namendment. Let's make a real commitment, not just a rhetorical one. \nLet's put our money where our mouth was last year and should be this \nyear. We have to do that because we recognize unless we invest in \neducation we are not going to be able to prepare young people to assume \nroles, not just in our economy, but also in our civic life.\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\n  The tasks before schools today are so much more complicated. The new \nAmericans who arrive daily with different languages and different \ncultural viewpoints have to be, we hope, seamlessly brought into our \nsystem, and public education has been the great institution to do that. \nWe have to support that.\n  So we are here today to be very serious about education, not just to \npass a bill that we can go out and tout in our states and then come \nback here and say that was just rhetoric. We are here for the \nresources. We are here for the second part of the equation.\n  The goals are there. The structure is there. Now we really have to \nput the resources to those goals and to that structure. Senator Kennedy \nhas identified two of the key components: title I, which serves \npractically every community in this country, and also Pell grants.\n  In distinction to the approach of Senator Kennedy, my colleague from \nNew Hampshire would suggest an across-the-board cut. So many people \nhave already pointed out this overall omnibus is deficient in so many \ndifferent ways, to take from the Department of Veterans Affairs, to \ntake from the other departments, is not a way to solve this issue. We \nhave to stand up and fund these programs in education without denying \nother worthwhile programs. I think we can. I think we should.\n  Of course, all of this is in the context of what follows this \nappropriations process. It is already the announced goal, the objective \nof the President, to propose a huge tax cut. We should ask ourselves \nwhy can't we, today, simply reserve from that proposed tax cut \nsufficient moneys this year and in the years to come to fully fund \neducation? I would suspect, and I would even wager that, if you asked \nmost Americans whether they would prefer to fund this bipartisan \neducation act--which has been touted, supported, embraced by all sides, \nPresident Bush, Republican congressional leaders, and Democratic \ncongressional leaders--by taking money from that tax cut and putting it \ninto this sound program, and they agree it is sound, they would agree \noverwhelmingly.\n  In a way, we are not doing that directly, but that is the overarching \ncontext of our efforts this afternoon. We want to put the resources \nwhere they should be, in title I and in Pell grants. We want to keep \nour promises. We want to make sure all the provisions of this No Child \nLeft Behind Act have a fair chance to operate and succeed.\n  Let me just conclude by saying one of the major points that persuaded \nme with some--I wouldn't say reluctance, but with some hesitancy, \nbecause I feared this day where we, a year after our press releases, \nwould be coming here and finding the money is not there to do the job--\nbut what persuaded me is that this bill essentially recognized that \neducation is not just one thing, it is many things. That is why this No \nChild Left Behind Act has funding for professional development, \nparental involvement, school libraries, and a host of other programs.\n\n  Let me tell you, those programs are going to be drastically \nunderfunded in the President's budget, as I see it, even if we put more \nmoney into the title I program.\n  But the point is, if we do not commit ourselves to the full change of \neducational reform we are going to, I think, sadly misspend even the \nmoney we commit to the program.\n  I hope we can support the Kennedy amendment. I hope we can support \nadditional resources for education. In doing so, let's fulfill our \ncommitment, not just our commitment to the act that was passed last \nyear, but a greater commitment, to give every citizen in this country \nthe opportunity to succeed, and the best instrument to do that is good \neducation. We all believe that. Let's translate our beliefs into votes \nthis evening and put the money where it should be.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, every time we have the education debate I \nfeel a little bit compelled to come over to the floor and point out to \nmy colleagues the extent of what we are talking about. We are talking \ntoday as if the Federal Government solves all education problems. We \nare the problem. We provide about 8 percent of the funding for \neducation and we provide over 50 percent of the paperwork for \neducation. We have been attacking this accountability thing with papers \nthat have to be turned in to the Department of Education for years.\n  I have a person on my staff who is a former principal. He was a \nprincipal and he took a leave of absence to come back to Washington and \ntake a look at what happens to the forms he fills out. He spent a \nsemester at the Department of Education. When he reported back he said: \nYou know, they actually read all of those documents. They make sure \nthat every ``i'' is dotted and every ``t'' is crossed. He said the big \ndisappointment is then there is no use for the paperwork. Nothing \nhappens with it. There is no accountability. There is no support. There \nis no help to the schools. We need to do something differently.\n  That is what No Child Left Behind is about, taking a different \napproach to accountability. We have been placing this huge burden on \nschools for a long time. We have not been providing the money to \nprovide the paperwork. Now we said let's try a different approach; \nlet's let them set up an accountability mechanism; let's give them some \nmoney so they can do the accountability; and then let's see if we can \nhold their feet to the fire with that so it's not just another report \ngoing into the garbage can. Actually, they don't go into the garbage \ncan; they go into some file cabinets that we also pay a lot of money \nfor.\n  I am not going to spend a lot of time defending the levels of funding \nor trying to show who is outbidding whom--and that is what this is, \njust a bidding war, and we do it every year. Of course, what I would \nlike to ask the other side of the aisle is, if the increases in funding \nand the funding is so important, why did we have to change majorities \nbefore we could even debate it? Why wasn't this appropriations bill \ndone last summer? Why wasn't it done in July or September? We are just \ndebating it now, and 4\\1/2\\ months of the time has already passed and \nwe are saying this is a crisis and we need to outbid each other.\n  This is a crisis and we need to get it done, but it doesn't have to \nbe a bidding war. We need to get this done so we can get to the next \npart of the process, which is to do a budget. Remember, we missed \nhaving a budget last year, the first time in 32 years that we had not \nhad a budget. That kind of kept us from getting to those appropriations \nbills. And we did not. Now what we need to do is get this done, get on \nto the budget, get on to the appropriations, and do it correctly this \nnext year; have the hearings, have the debates on this floor without \nthe time constraints of being 4\\1/2\\ months late.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his presentation on the \nway the Bush administration has increased funding for schools. As the \naccountant, I am pleased with the charts he has done and the figures he \nhas given on the increases the Bush administration has done for \neducation.\n  Elementary and secondary education funding is growing at a faster \nrate than enrollment. In 2002, there was a 27 percent increase in \nelementary and secondary education funding, and that was compared to a \n0.3 percent increase in enrollment.\n  Let me say that again. In 2002 we did a 27 percent increase in \neducation funding, and that was compared to a 0.3 percent increase in \nenrollment.\n  Since much of the new money from 2002 is just reaching the schools \nfor the first time, the massive increase for 2002 began reaching them \nin last July. It is disingenuous to make the case that the Federal \nGovernment isn't doing its share when it comes to dollars for \neducation. Again, I point out the delay in appropriations this year. In \nfact, a total of $19 billion from 2002 is still sitting over at the \nDepartment of Education and has not been drawn down by the schools. \nThat is $19 billion. That is more than we are talking about in any \nbidding wars we are doing here.\n\n  But let us not forget that the No Child Left Behind Act is not just \nabout Federal investment in education. It is about getting a return on \nthat investment and improved student achievement for all of our \nchildren. That\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\nmeans dedication of the States, too. It is not just an effort to move \nthe burden to the Federal Government. The States have to be involved.\n  I am pleased to say that according to the Washington Post there are \ntwo States in the United States that fully fund their education plan. \nOne of those is Wyoming. When we are talking about increases in \ndollars, we are certainly hoping it can have the flexibility that will \ngo to the kinds of programs to help develop our kids for the kind of \njobs there will be in the future so they can stay in Wyoming and so \nthey can compete in the global market. We have recognized the \nimportance of education. We have fully funded education. That isn't \nenough money. We are also one of those States with a declining \nenrollment. We aren't even three-fifths of 1 percent in increase in \nenrollment.\n  Let us keep in mind that, even with limited resources, economic \nconcerns, and many additional important national priorities as a result \nof our Nation's war on terrorism, the President's 2003 budget and this \nbill contain significant increases in the areas that most directly \naffect the neediest children.\n  I could go into some more detail on that. We have a time agreement. I \nappreciate having a time agreement so we can begin some votes.\n  But I do think we have the capabilities to do the kind of things for \nwhich the No Child Left Behind Act is intended. We can do better next \nyear, and we will as we do the process the way it was designed to be \ndone.\n  We know well-prepared teachers lead to a child's success in school. \nHowever, millions of children don't have the benefit of a qualified \nteacher in their classroom. That is why this bill provides almost $3 \nbillion this year to support our Nation's teachers.\n  I am particularly sensitive to that because my oldest daughter is a \nprincipal in the Wyoming School System. She was a teacher. She taught \nEnglish to seventh graders for about 6 years. I think that is one of \nthe challenging places to teach because students have all those \nhormones and body changes and all of those things. She really enjoys \nit. She got two masters degrees while she was doing that, and one of \nthem entitled her to be a principal. She was hired principal in a \nlittle community called Chugwater. I hope you will try Chugwater chili \nand the great spices for the chili. It is the community activity and \nthe community business in a town of 256 people.\n  Enrollment in the school, kindergarten through 12th grade, is 130. \nShe found out there are some experiences the education textbooks don't \ncover. On the the first day of school there was a rattle snake in the \nbuilding. On the second day, a seventh grader found a black widow \nspider. Day before yesterday, there was a skunk in the schoolyard. This \nis 45 miles from anywhere. There are some different problems dealing \nwith a situation such as that. It took 45 minutes for the police to get \nthere to remove the skunk.\n  Teachers are challenged. Principals are challenged. We need to have \nwell-prepared teachers who are qualified to teach. I am blessed to say \nthat in Wyoming that we have met that goal--not completely. We are \nstill working on having better teachers all the time.\n  I remember one fellow running for superintendent in the public \nschools saying the job of the principal was to make sure good teachers \ngot better and bad teachers got better somewhere else.\n  But I do want to say the President's budget asks for money for \nincreases in teachers and increases for reading programs.\n  I want to close by saying that the combination of the very \nsubstantial new funding provided over the past 3 years and the reforms \nin the No Child Left Behind Act will make a real difference in \nimproving the performance of our schools and the achievement of all \nstudents.\n  What I have said today shows the picture in addition to what the \nSenator from New Hampshire said. He has put in an amendment that does \ncall for an increase in spending and the flexibility that I have been \ntalking about for the Wyoming schools and for other States that have \nbeen doing an adequate job of funding their students presently. It \ngives them the flexibility to spend it on the things they think are \nneeded the worst.\n  I hope you will support the Gregg amendment. I hope you will defeat \nthe Kennedy amendment and provide for a budget and appropriations now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 6 minutes \nfrom the time allotted to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I want to say a few words to reflect what \nI know the people of New Jersey believe with regard to the debate we \nare having on the floor about the omnibus appropriations bill, \nparticularly with regard to the two priorities we talked about today--\nhomeland defense, but particularly as it relates to our educational \npriorities in this country.\n  I feel as if I am living in a different world from what I hear talked \nabout on the floor of the Senate. We are experiencing in my home State \na severe fiscal crisis. We have a $5 billion budget deficit this year \nthat has to be closed at the expense of our kids and investing properly \nin our homeland defense. Then I hear, by the way, that we are having on \naverage, across our local communities, about a 7-percent increase in \nproperty taxes, which is really going to fund education.\n  Since I have been here in Congress, we are doing a lot to put new \nmandates on our local communities about what their responsibilities are \nwith regard to education. But we are not providing the kind of \nresources that will allow them to fulfill those mandates effectively to \nmeet the needs of our kids--those 6 million children left behind under \ntitle I whom Senator Kennedy so appropriately tried to address with his \namendment.\n  I just have an incredible misunderstanding of why we think we need a \n$675 billion tax cut and $375 billion of it going to dividend \nexclusions, 80 percent of the overall tax cut going to the top 5 \npercent, and 60 percent going to the top 10 percent in our society, \nwhen we are unwilling to invest in those 6 million kids and the 10,000 \nfailing schools that have already been identified. And 40 percent of \nthe title I schools don't have teachers who are qualified to sit in the \nclassroom. I don't get it. I don't understand why there is this serious \ndeficit problem back in our State and local communities and we are \ntalking about a tax cut and a priority that doesn't relate to the long-\nterm health and growth of our Nation. It just doesn't make sense.\n  I hear all the arguments about who is growing the educational budget \nfaster, or whether it is this year or over in the Clinton \nadministration. The fact is we have a real need. These are tangible \nneeds to be addressed. They need to be addressed now. We have choices. \nSix billion dollars is not even a tenth of the $675 billion we are \ntalking about in the tax cut. And, by the way, when you add the \ninterest, it is $1 trillion. What is $6 billion among friends?\n  This is not the right priority, in my view, and it certainly is not \nwhat the people of New Jersey are telling me they want.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point? I yield myself 2 \nminutes on this.\n  Is the Senator saying as we are considering the omnibus bill and the \nmoney which is going to be expended on that--of which $10 billion was \ngenerally agreed to last year by Republicans and Democrats--that we \nwould take $6 billion of that $10 billion--and there are those who are \nopposing it--that we are still going to say we can afford the $670 \nbillion, and a great percentage of that will go to the top 1 percent of \nthe wealthiest individuals, and that is a higher priority than meeting \nwhat President Bush and a bipartisan group pointed out were the needs \nof children in many of the poorest areas of this country?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Massachusetts is, as always, using \ncommon sense. We are saying this tax cut is more important than \ninvesting in our kids, investing in our schools, fulfilling the promise \nthat we talked about and debated and worked, on a bipartisan basis, to \nprovide. Improvement and flexibility--all the things the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire talked about in principles--we\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\nare all for that, but we are saying this darn tax cut is a lot more \nimportant than the priorities of educating our kids.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself one more minute.\n  Is the Senator, therefore, suggesting, as we look down the line in \nterms of the national budget--and what the budget is going to be--that \nwe have the choice of having the $6 billion to take care of 2 million \nmore children, who we promised we would take care of in title I, and \nperhaps reducing the President's tax cut by $10 billion this year?\n  That could be done, as the Senator said. We could say: Look, we, in \nthe Senate, say, OK, we think it is more important to provide funding \nfor the children and to reduce the President's tax cut by the $6 \nbillion that would be affected this year. We have that choice, do we \nnot?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I think it is absolutely in the hands of the people who \nsit in this Chamber to make the decisions. We are elected to talk about \npriorities. Where are the priorities in this Nation with regard to \nhomeland defense, and certainly with our longrun health and security--\nthat American promise that we hear and we all embrace?\n  We are making a choice that a tax cut, which is going to promise \nthose who are already doing really well--that 1 percent, that 5 \npercent, or 20 percent; however you cut it--they are more important \nthan our kids in making sure that everybody has access to the American \npromise.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator again and appreciate his comments. I \nhope he will continue.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I will just wrap up.\n  Again, I have a hard time understanding this debate, when we have \nsuch a clear choice in front of us, when we talk about the needs of \nthese 6 million kids, the 10,000 identified failing schools.\n  By the way, we are all in favor of the flexibility and making sure \nthat the local school districts have the ability to deal with a lot of \nthese issues. But we cannot turn around failed schools if we don't have \nteachers who are qualified to sit in the classrooms. And we need to do \nit.\n  By the way, one of the ways we get those qualified teachers in those \nclassrooms is to make sure the Pell grant program is properly funded, \nwhere people who need the opportunity to get a higher education \nactually have access.\n  I hear about the tax cut, $30 billion that went into the tax system. \nThat is great, as long as you have taxable income. If you don't have \nanything to have a tax credit against, it is pretty hard to figure out \nhow you are going to use that to fund higher education that will \nultimately end up providing our teachers, our doctors, our researchers, \nand all the people to go forward.\n  So I hope my colleagues can understand the simple concept: Do we \nreally need a $675 billion tax cut, for those who are already doing \nwell, when we can't make the choice to provide the $6 billion that we \nwant to invest in our schools?\n  I appreciate Senator Kennedy's efforts here. I wholeheartedly support \nthem and hope my colleagues will as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 11\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from New Hampshire has 19 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts not \nonly for yielding time but also for his leadership on this issue.\n  I would like to note to the Senator from Massachusetts that the \nPresident gave a speech last night relative to the issue of affirmative \naction in which he said he did not believe preferences should be given \nbased on race but, rather, people should be chosen based on merit.\n  If you accept the President's premise, that Americans should have an \nopportunity to be educated, and then compete for spots at good \nuniversities, then doesn't it follow you would want to make certain \nthat people across America have equal opportunity in education? Because \nhow can you compete on the basis of merit and education if you don't \nhave a good school and a good teacher, a good curriculum, and an \nopportunity to learn?\n  Senator Kennedy comes to us today offering this amendment saying: Why \naren't we putting money into education so that children--all children, \nminority children as well as majority children--have an opportunity to \nlearn?\n  I think this is a test for the other side of the aisle. If you \nsupport the President's position, in opposition to affirmative action, \nand believe people should be judged on merit, then, for goodness sakes, \ncreate a level playing field, so the children from the poorest \nfamilies, in the poorest schools, have a chance to learn, compete, and \nlead fulfilled lives.\n  It will be interesting to see what happens, whether the same Senators \nwho oppose affirmative action will also oppose funding education.\n  Secondly, let me suggest Senator Kennedy is keeping his word. When he \nand I and others joined the President in voting for No Child Left \nBehind, it was not an empty promise; it was a promise that we would \nstand with the schools, the families, and the children in improving the \nquality of education across America.\n  The President took great pride in this education bill, and he passed \nit and said: The first thing we need is accountability. I certainly \nagree with that. But he called for more tests than usual, so that we \ncould monitor, on an annual basis, how our children are doing in \nschool. And, of course, those schools that are not doing a good job, \nwhere children are falling behind, will require some remedial effort. \nThe remedial effort involves title I, part of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which Senator Kennedy is trying to fund.\n  Senator Kennedy is trying to keep President Bush's promise to America \nwhen it comes to education. It is not enough to say that the schools \nare failing us, the schools are falling behind. Senator Kennedy brings, \nwith this amendment, a chance for every Republican who voted for No \nChild Left Behind, and those of us on the Democratic side who joined, \nto keep our promise and keep our word.\n  Failing that, if we do not come up with the resources for West \nVirginia, for Massachusetts, or New Hampshire, then they will have to \nmake difficult decisions.\n\n  They will have the Federal requirements of No Child Left Behind--\nrequirements to improve their curriculum, improve their teachers, \nimprove their teaching assistants, formulate all sorts of tests and \nevaluate the students--but they will not have the resources to improve \ntheir schools.\n  What will we have accomplished? We will have diagnosed an illness, \nbut the President refuses to come up with the drugs necessary to cure \nit. Senator Kennedy's amendment does. Senator Kennedy comes forward and \nsays: Let's put the money we promised on the table. If you don't do \nthat, I will tell you what will happen in my State and most other \nStates. You will have a mandate from Washington, under President Bush's \nNo Child Left Behind, and no funds to meet the mandate. And what a \nterrible time for that to happen.\n  Estimates across the Nation suggest that States are falling behind \n$90- or $100 billion this year. In my State, it is $5 billion. I can \ntell you where the cuts will be made. Sadly, they will be made in \neducation. And so, in Illinois, we will be cutting basic funds for \neducation while President Bush's requirements under No Child Left \nBehind are being imposed on Illinois school districts facing \nbankruptcy.\n  Where is the fairness in that outcome? And the Senator from New \nHampshire suggested we do across-the-board cuts from all the other \nagencies to come up with a pot of money, and send it to the States to \ndeal with on a grant basis. You can certainly argue with his premise as \nto whether or not we can continue to make cuts in a lot of different \nagencies that have already been cut and trimmed, time and time again--\nwhether it is the Veterans' Administration or homeland security; and \nthose are certainly areas where we could debate long and hard as to \nwhether that is the right thing to do--but what Senator Kennedy is \ndoing\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\nwith this amendment is asking Congress to keep its word.\n  All of those who posed for those political ``holy'' pictures with the \nPresident, which showed us being friends of the education President and \nfriends of education, now have to come through with the money to make \nsure it happens. If we do not, then, frankly, we should be held \naccountable.\n  Those who vote no on this amendment--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thirty seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those who vote no on this amendment have \nbasically asked for the best of both worlds. They want all the positive \npublicity for reforming education, but they don't want to pay the bill. \nThat is an abdication of responsibility to my State and every other \nState.\n  I urge Senators who believe in the President's program to stand with \nthe program when it comes to providing the funds. This amendment will \ngive them that chance to do so.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 19 minutes \n17 seconds. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let's remember what we are debating here relative to \nthe merits of the various amendments. We heard another restatement of \nthis representation that the President has not made a commitment to No \nChild Left Behind. He has not only made a commitment, he has made the \nmost significant commitment to education in recent history, the most \nsignificant commitment to title I in history, and the most significant \ncommitment to IDEA in history. Compared to the prior administration, \nhis commitment represents a massive increase. In fact, if you take the \n7 years of the prior administration, running up to 2001, and compare it \nto the President's first 2 years, the President has actually made a \ncommitment that exceeds those 7 years in 2 years by approximately $500 \nmillion. Or almost 25 percent more than what President Clinton put into \neducation over 7 years, President Bush has put into education in 2 \nyears.\n  His commitment to title I has been a 27-percent increase over the \nClinton commitment. His commitment to special education has been $1 \nbillion a year each year for the first 2 years of his administration, \nthe two most significant increases in history compared, again, to the \nClinton years. It dwarfs what the administration did during that \nperiod. That isn't necessarily the issue, although it has been a matter \nof debate.\n  The issue is the appropriateness of the two different amendments. The \nKennedy amendment essentially tries to fund No Child Left Behind at \nabout a $4.6 billion level of additional funding, which theoretically \ngets to an authorized level, which is pretty hard to put your hand \naround but theoretically gets there. We are talking about putting $5 \nbillion, which works out to about the same number as Senator Kennedy's, \ninto the No Child Left Behind bill.\n  From a dollar standpoint, the two amendments are essentially the \nsame. Where they differ is in how they approach those dollars. We say \nto local school districts: Here is the money. You can take it. You can \nuse it to address your needs in your local school systems as you try to \nrespond to No Child Left Behind.\n  We know that many of our school systems think that in areas such as \nteacher training or classrooms or maybe just testing or whatever it is, \nthey think they need more money for No Child Left Behind. This money we \nare proposing goes to them without any strings, without any controls \ncoming from Washington. It says, you have to use it for No Child Left \nBehind initiatives. As a result, it is going to give the flexibility to \nlocal school districts which they really want with these dollars to \naccomplish the goal which, let's not forget, is to make sure the kids \nlearn. The whole purpose of this bill is to make sure the kids learn. \nThe priorities should be how we get to that point.\n  The second thing we do in our amendment, which is not done under the \nKennedy amendment, is that we pay for it. I just heard the Senator from \nIllinois say: We don't need to pay for this. We can't cut anything \nelse.\n  Listen, we are running a deficit. We are at war. We are a nation \nwhich is under some fiscal strain in our economy. The fact is, we have \nto reinstitute fiscal discipline in the Congress. Regrettably, under \nthe prior Congress, no budget was passed. The Democratic Party, for \nwhatever reason, decided not to bring a budget to the floor of the \nSenate in the last session of the last Congress, which left us without \nany enforcement mechanisms. It was, in my opinion, a grossly \nirresponsible act; the first time in my experience in this Congress \nthat we did not have a budget. Therefore, we did not have enforcement \nmechanisms.\n\n  Now we are in a situation where the President has said, through the \nforce of his bully pulpit: Here is the number, 750. It is a reasonable \nnumber. It represents a significant, dramatic increase in funding by \nthe Federal Government. It represents a massive increase in Federal \nspending. It is a double-digit increase in Federal spending. He said: \nHold that 750 number.\n  Members of the other side are not willing to do that. They don't want \nany budget discipline. We believe there should be budget discipline. We \nbelieve our job as legislators is to prioritize.\n  The first order of business is to defend our Nation with strong and \neffective antiterrorism activity, and we have a President who is doing \nthat. We have aggressively funded that.\n  I happen to believe the second order of business is to fund \neducation. That is why we propose this amendment which basically \nreallocates funds from other accounts into the education account and \nfully funds No Child Left Behind as defined by Senator Kennedy's \ndefinition.\n  I happen to believe No Child Left Behind is getting significant \ndollars, probably more than they can spend, but these additional \ndollars will absolutely guarantee that our local school districts have \nthe money they need.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes \n45 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Dayton, Durbin, Edwards, Kerry, \nCorzine, and Landrieu be added as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will have a chance to vote in a few minutes. One will \nbe for the Gregg amendment. And I hope our colleagues will vote against \nit. Then we will have an opportunity to vote for the amendment I have \nintroduced with a number of our colleagues that will add some $6 \nbillion and achieve what the President had actually committed; that is, \nto begin the real downpayment in reaching all the children who need the \nTitle I funding.\n  If you accept the Gregg amendment, that will result in reducing \nfunding for Head Start by $104 million; NIH by $410 million; highways \nby $501 million, NSF by $64 million.\n  I see our ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. He talked \nabout a 1.3-percent cut. I have indicated what the 1.3 percent would be \nover the year. But as the good Senator from West Virginia knows, we are \ntalking about a budget that is only 9 months. So the 1.3 will mean \ndeeper cuts in each and every one of these programs. If you vote for \nthat, that is what you are voting for in the Gregg amendment.\n  Secondly, on the Gregg amendment, it is basically the block grant \nprogram that will go for any education purposes. I remind my colleagues \nwhat the President of the United States said, and I agree with him. \nThis is in his report from the Department of Education: President Bush \nemphasized his deep belief in public schools, but even a greater \nconcern about too many of our neediest children being left behind.\n\n  That is President Bush.\n  That is what we are trying to get at. The Gregg amendment doesn't \neven address that issue. It doesn't say, look, I\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\nwill take $5 billion; I will just put it toward title I. He says it can \nbe used for anything.\n  President Bush says he is concerned about the neediest children being \nleft behind. Then this amendment really makes very little sense.\n  I see my friend from Florida. How much time do I have totally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 3 minutes \n22 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield a minute to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for the time.\n  Mr. President, I wish to express support. I thought a deal was a \ndeal. Last year, when the Senator from Massachusetts negotiated the \nauthorizing bill with the White House, it was that we would increase \nthe funding level from the Federal Government, which is only 7 percent \nof all of the educational funding, because most of the educational \nfunding is at the State and local level, as it should be, but the \nFederal Government had a unique position, especially for the \ndisadvantaged, to help out the States so that a child would have an \nequal opportunity to learn.\n  So in the minute that the Senator has given me, I wanted to express \nmy support for his position to honor the agreement that was made \nbetween the White House and the Congress last year on educational \nfunding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Gregg has authorized me to yield \n10 minutes to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is always difficult to oppose \nincreases in education funding because education is the greatest \ncapital asset this country has. However, in approaching this \nlegislation today, with an omnibus bill on the floor, an effort is \nbeing made to cram into two days what should have occurred during the \ncourse of a year. Last year the Senate did not have a budget.\n  I have just returned from a trip to Israel where the Palestinian \nAuthority has a budget, but the United States Senate doesn't have a \nbudget. Now, we are being called upon in the course of a few hours to \nmake decisions involving billions of dollars.\n  What we have here, realistically, is an auction, a bidding war, a \npolitical bidding war to see who will look the best, trying to clothe \nthemselves with being the protectors of education. We have a duty to \nthe taxpayers of America to make rational decisions. I am the chairman \nof the Appropriations subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the \nDepartment of Education. I have been on the subcommittee, and I am now \nin my 23rd year. I took over the chairmanship in 1995 and have worked \nvery closely and coordinated with Senator Tom Harkin. On a bipartisan \nbasis, we have added an enormous amount to the Department of Education, \nstarting in my first year as chairman with $23 billion, and now being \nup to $51.5 billion. Since the year 2000, we have had a 45 percent \nincrease in education funding.\n  Now, maybe we do need an additional $6 billion, or maybe we don't \nneed an additional $6 billion. It cannot be rationally decided in the \ncourse of a few hours on the Senate floor. We ought to have hearings \nand have experts and have witnesses come in and define the subject and \ndelineate the subject to allow us to analyze it and to make rational \ndecisions.\n  It is widely noted that the two things you never want to see made are \nsausage and legislation. Well, this legislation is giving sausage a bad \nname. We are being asked to make this decision in a rushed way in the \ncourse of a few hours.\n  Now, on the Pell grants, I agree the Pell grants are very valuable, \nbut take a look at what has happened in the course of the last several \nyears on Pell grants. They have gone from $2,600 in 1997, up to $3,300 \nin 2000, up to $4,000 last year. When Senator Harkin and I put that \n$4,000 figure in, the director of Management and Budget, Mitch Daniels, \ncame to my office and complained bitterly that it was too much money \nand wanted it offset. Senator Harkin and I stood by our guns. This \nyear, they are going to go up to $4,100.\n  We have a budget that has to accommodate a great many factors. One of \nmy other jobs is chairing the Veterans Affairs Committee. This \nafternoon, I sat down with Secretary Tony Principi to go over a program \nhe has to reduce eligibility for VA care. He has to do that because the \nveterans covered were 2.9 million in 1998, when we went to open \nenrollment, and now it is 6.8 million. There simply isn't enough money \nin the VA budget. I would like to see more money in the VA budget. I am \nconcerned about what is going to happen in the National Institutes of \nHealth budget when and if this is adopted. Senator Gregg's amendment is \nthe less irrational of the two amendments on the floor--the less \nirrational. I don't think either is rational. We have to make a \njudgment and a choice about which is the least undesirable. If the \nGregg amendment is adopted, we are going to be cutting the NIH. Why? \nBecause Senator Gregg, realistically, is offering a counterbalance to \nwhat Senator Kennedy is offering, and that is because we are in an \nauction and a bidding war for political cover, because everybody wants \nto look good by adding money to education.\n\n  Maybe we ought to take more money for education from some of the \nother accounts. But, it ought not be done on an afternoon when we are \nracing against time to finish this multibillion dollar omnibus bill so \nwe can get out of here for the weekend and give 600 speeches over the \nweekend that are already committed to, and the Martin Luther King \nholiday is on Monday, and the prospect of being here Sunday, or coming \nin on Tuesday--if people really knew what we did and what the pressures \nwere on spending billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, they would \nthrow all the rascals out. Unfortunately, C-SPAN 2 doesn't have \nsufficient coverage to really tell the American people what is going on \nhere.\n  If you take a look at what Senator Harkin and I have done as we have \nchanged the gavel over the years, raising the education budget from $23 \nbillion in 1996 to $51.5 billion-plus now, at a 45 percent increase \nsince the year 2000, and the way we have raised the Pell grant awards, \nthere has been a tremendous increase.\n  I am prepared, in my capacity as chairman of the subcommittee, to go \nto work and see whether you need more money here so as to not to leave \nany child behind. However, I must protest the way we are conducting the \nbusiness of the Senate because we didn't get a budget last year. It is \njust absolutely inexcusable. The Palestinian Authority has a budget, \nbut the Senate doesn't have a budget. Now we are being asked to \nappropriate billions of dollars under time pressure, which is simply \nnot right. Between the lesser of the irrational amendments, I choose \nSenator Gregg's. I think we ought to go through the hearing process, \nthe legitimate process, and do our jobs for the public interest and not \npass these amendments, which are really a political bidding war to look \ngood under the mantle of backing education.\n  Let me repeat, in the 23 years I have been in this body, I have \nseldom, if ever, voted against increasing money for education, but this \ngoes too far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, let me state I greatly admire the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, who has done an extraordinary job of \nattempting to fund some very complicated issues, with lots of different \npriorities. He has driven increases in special ed funding and has been \na huge player in title I and many other positive efforts as ranking \nmember and chairman of the subcommittee. I congratulate him. I am \nalways happy to be the more rational of the irrational.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk on the floor \nin the last few weeks about the deficits we are facing and about the \nirrational conduct of the President proposing reductions in taxes. I \nwant to point out the exercise we are engaged in right\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\nnow. As the Senator from Massachusetts said, we are talking about real \nmoney. It is real money. What is being proposed in these amendments is \nreal money that will add real dollars to the deficit.\n  I am going to start a process with every amendment we vote on. We are \ngoing to keep a running tally of how much money--over this period of \ntime we are proposing amendments to add spending--we will add to the \ndeficits over the next 10 years. The Byrd amendment, which got 45 \nDemocratic votes, adds $5 billion for this year. People have to \nunderstand when you add $5 billion this year, it becomes part of the \nbaseline, which is $5 billion not just this year but for 10 more years, \nplus inflation and the interest costs it takes to finance that deficit; \nthat is $70 billion over 10 years. That $5 billion you voted for this \nyear is $70 billion over 10 years.\n  We don't know what the vote is yet on the Kennedy amendment, but it \nis $6 billion; over 10 years, it is $84 billion. So these two votes add \nup to $154 billion. And we are just starting, folks. It is $154 billion \nadded to the deficit.\n  So let's look at the folks who are crying about how we don't have \nenough money to let people keep some of it, but we certainly have \nenough to spend more of it. I am going to warn my colleagues that this \nis the starting of a, hopefully, short but presumably long process of \nadding the numbers of how much our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are going to add to the deficit; and when we reach about $600 \nbillion--and I would not be surprised if we do--you will be at the \namount the President wants to give back.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to the beginning of the second \nvote on the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes \n52 seconds.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have 2 minutes. I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  I have difficulty in understanding the argument of my good friend \nfrom Pennsylvania. We debated the No Child Left Behind legislation for \n7 weeks. On May 3, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, voted \nfor an $18 billion increase in No Child Left Behind. This is $16 \nbillion. This comes as no surprise to any of the Members who are \ndebating the issues of Title I.\n  President Bush galvanized the Nation in giving attention to the \nneediest children in this country. He recognized that there are 11 \nmillion children who have been left out and left behind. He talked \nabout a partnership between the Federal Government, the students, the \nStates, the local communities, and the parents; that we were going to \nwork together to enhance academic achievement and responsibility, and \nthat there was going to be tough accountability. We supported that in a \nbipartisan way in this Senate, in the House of Representatives, and all \nacross this country.\n  All this amendment does is make sure we are going to have a real \ndownpayment to that commitment by ensuring that at least 2 million more \nchildren will be included in the No Child Left Behind legislation. Four \nmillion will still be left out. Four million will still be left behind. \nThis amendment is just a downpayment on that pledge made in the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  If my colleagues support this amendment, we are still under the \noverall caps that were agreed to. For anyone worried about the budget, \nI say this is a better investment in the future of our country than the \n$670 billion that the Republicans and the administration are supporting \nin tax breaks. This is what the American families want: Invest in their \nchildren, invest in education. That is what our amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 52 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator from Massachusetts retain any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He is out of time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let us return to the amendments. The \namendment I put forward is a $5 billion increase in educational \nfunding. It is a process of funding, however, that sends the money back \nto the States without strings, gives them the flexibility they need to \nmeet the obligations of the No Child Left Behind legislation. It \naddresses many of the concerns we are hearing from our local educators \nand our communities about whether they are going to have adequate funds \nand whether those funds are going to be free enough for them to \naccomplish what they need to do to bring these children up to speed and \neducated.\n  It is a paid-for amendment. That is probably the most significant \ndifference. This is a paid-for amendment, and in a time of deficits, in \na time of economic concern, in a time of war, we need to be setting \npriorities and be willing to pay for them and make the tough decisions \non those priorities, and this amendment does that.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 19. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Edwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKerry) would each vote ``no''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 4 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Edwards\n     Hagel\n     Kerry\n  The amendment (No. 19) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes evenly divided before a \npending vote on the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Two minutes to each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute on each side.\n  Mr. REID. That wasn't the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There seems to be some disagreement about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield for a question. I don't want to lose the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I was on the floor when the Senator from New Hampshire \noffered a unanimous consent agreement. I understood it would be 4 \nminutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it was 2 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If they want 2 minutes for each side, let's do it. I ask \nunanimous consent it be 2 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thought, since it is my amendment, we \nwould have the opportunity to go last, if that is agreeable to the \nSenator. Can we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the chair please use his gavel and get some \nattention and tell Senators to keep quiet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, although I do not believe it is stated, I \nbelieve it is the proper protocol for me to go first. The amendment is \ndifferent from the one that was just passed. I think it was a good \ndecision by the Chamber to pass the one that was just passed. The way \nthe Kennedy amendment differs is, first, it costs more money; but, \nsecond, it is not paid for; and, third, it comes with strings.\n  Obviously, in a time of fiscal discipline, under which we should be \nfunctioning, it is inappropriate to be passing plus-up amendments \nwithout paying for them. This amendment would take us over the $750 \nbillion number, which is the number at which the President has \nrequested us to stay.\n  Regrettably, we do not have a budget resolution. We should have a \nbudget resolution, but no budget resolution was brought to the floor of \nthe Senate under the leadership of the other party during the 107th \nCongress in the second session. Therefore, we have to sort of self-\ndiscipline around here.\n  We have just done that by passing the amendment I have offered. We \nwill not do it if we pass the amendment the Senator from Massachusetts \noffers.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the overall budget figure we are \nconsidering is $10 million less than what was effectively agreed to \nlast year in a bipartisan way, and which the Appropriations Committee \nmarked up. This would take $6 billion of that, which is the amount the \nPresident signed into law under the authorization. This figure was \neffectively supported by a 79-vote majority here in the Senate when we \ndebated the authorization. It had strong bipartisan support.\n  With all respect to the previous amendment, it is not targeted on the \nneediest children in this country. President Bush, to his credit, \naroused the Nation to give focus and attention to the neediest children \nin this country, that they should not be left out and should not be \nleft behind.\n  We made a commitment with the No Child Left Behind Act that over a \nperiod of 12 years, every child in this country would reach \nproficiency. Now, unless we are going to pass this amendment, we are \ngoing to only include 354,000 more children--and not meet what the \nadministration had committed itself to, and what the President had \ncommitted himself to, and what I think the bipartisan membership \ncommitted itself to. That is to include the 2 million children. We will \nstill have a long way to go.\n  Mr. President, this is about education. This is about teachers. This \nis about parents. This is about local schools. This is about local \nschool boards.\n  This is needed across the country. There isn't a school district in \nthis country that does not have a financial crisis. This will be a \nlifeline to those children who are going to need these resources. The \nStates are $90 billion in debt. A third of that comes from education. \nSo we are seeing enormous cuts in the support of children, and the \nneediest children. This will continue the strong commitment we made to \naccountability, to reliability, to better teachers, smaller class \nsizes, and afterschool programs. I hope the Senate will accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurray now be recognized to offer an amendment regarding Amtrak; I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that there be 90 minutes for debate \nequally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or \nyielding back of time the Senate proceed to a vote in relationship to \nthe amendment without further intervening action or debate; further, I \nask that following the disposition of the above amendment Senator \nHarkin be recognized to offer an amendment regarding the Byrne grants \nand there be 60 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form to \nbe used this evening; provided further that following the debate the \namendment be temporarily set aside and Senator Schumer be recognized to \noffer an amendment relating to port security and there be 60 minutes \nfor debate equally divided in the usual form to be\n\n[[Page S1049]]\n\nused this evening; further, I ask consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the bill tomorrow morning at 9:30, the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to the Harkin amendment, to be followed \nimmediately by a vote in relation to the Schumer amendment, with no \namendments in order to any of the above prior to the votes, with 5 \nminutes for debate equally divided before each vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that the Murray amendment will be accepted by voice vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is our intention that we will accept that amendment \nby voice vote. It is my understanding that 90 minutes will probably not \nbe used.\n  Mr. REID. With both leaders on the floor, it is my understanding \nthere will be no more rollcall votes tonight.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not authorized to say that.\n  Mr. REID. I said to Senator Stevens that with both leaders on the \nfloor, it is my understanding that if this agreement is accepted there \nwill be no more rollcall votes tonight.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The majority leader has agreed that is the case. There \nwill be no more rollcall votes tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wasn't \nhearing so well back here. As I understand it, because I have an \namendment involved in this agreement, there are 60 minutes equally \ndivided but we will not be voting on it tonight; we will vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That request was put forward by your side. We agreed to \nthat.\n  Mr. HARKIN. With 5 minutes of debate before each vote?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Before each of the two votes--your vote and the vote on \nthe amendment of the Senator from New York, and 5 minutes prior to \nvotes on each amendment tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is no objection. I understand we probably will not \nuse that 90 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 30\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), for herself and \n     Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n     Chafee, Mr. Biden, Mr. Specter, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Carper, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered \n     30.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure the continued viability of the National Railroad \n                         Passenger Corporation)\n\n       On page 741, strike lines 3 through 9, and insert:\n       For necessary expenses of operating costs and capital \n     improvements of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation \n     as authorized by 49 U.S.C. 24104(a), $1,200,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended, of which $550,000,000 shall \n     be for operating expenses, $369,000,000 shall be for capital \n     expenses along the Northeast Corridor Mainline, and \n     $281,000,000 shall be for capital expenses along the \n     remainder of the Corporation's national rail network.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise, along with the \nranking member of the full Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and \nmy other colleagues who are in the Chamber tonight, to offer this \namendment to boost funding for Amtrak to a level that was included in \nour Transportation appropriations bill that was reported back in July \nof last year.\n  Six months ago, the Appropriations Committee unanimously reported a \nbill that funded Amtrak at the level of $1.2 billion. That is the same \nlevel that was requested of us by the Amtrak board of directors.\n  Some people seem to believe that the funding level of $1.2 billion \nrepresents a massive funding increase for Amtrak. As all Members know, \nthe appropriations bills that we approved last year have now been \nrewritten by the majority to reflect their priorities, and those new \nbills are now before us. For Amtrak, that means a cut of $374 million \nbelow the level we provided back in July. It also means a $318 million \ncut, or a 27-percent cut, below the level the railroad received in \nfiscal year 2002.\n  I am not familiar with the funding level proposed for every single \nprogram that is funded in this massive bill, but I suspect there are \nvery few, if any, other programs that have been singled out for a 27-\npercent cut below last year's level.\n  There is no question that at this funding level Amtrak is heading \nstraight for bankruptcy. That is not a debatable point. That \nrepresentation is simply not true.\n  We have a letter from Amtrak's new president and chief executive \nofficer, Mr. David Gunn, that makes it clear that Amtrak will be \ninsolvent by spring should this funding level become law.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Railroad Passenger\n\n\n                                                  Corporation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Transportation, Committee on \n         Appropriations, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I appreciate the opportunity to have \n     met with you and your staff yesterday to discuss the crisis \n     that will occur this Spring at Amtrak if the FY03 funding \n     level is below $1.2 billion. Neither the revised Senate level \n     of $826 million nor the House level of $762 million will be \n     adequate. As I said to you yesterday, any level less than \n     $1.2 billion, will leave us with no choice but to begin plans \n     for a total shutdown of the railroad, including all \n     operations in the Northeast Corridor in the Spring. We are \n     into the second quarter of the fiscal year and we are beyond \n     the point where we can make significant changes to avoid a \n     shutdown. None of us want to repeat a financial crisis \n     similar to the one we experienced last year.\n       As I told you, Amtrak's FY03 request of $1.2 billion is, in \n     reality, a small increase of the money made available to \n     Amtrak in FY02. Including $310 million in supplemental \n     funding, Amtrak received a total funding of $1.4 billion last \n     year. The number currently in the Senate bill is a \n     significant cut from the FY02 level.\n       We have taken significant steps to stabilize Amtrak. We \n     have opened our books and made them available to the United \n     States Department of Transportation and the appropriate \n     oversight committees in Congress as you have requested. As I \n     told you yesterday, we are making progress to stabilize the \n     organization. I hope that you will be able to convince your \n     fellow Senators to give me a chance to turn this railroad \n     around by restoring the money to the level that was \n     previously recommended by the full Appropriations Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David L. Gunn,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that this is \nnot one of those situations where we can just make everything OK in \nconference. My colleagues need to know that while the House of \nRepresentatives never passed a transportation bill for the current \nfiscal year, the House Appropriations Committee did report a bill to \nthe floor, and it included only $762 million for Amtrak. So if we do \nnot restore the funding needed to keep Amtrak alive today, Members \nshould not expect this will be rescued later.\n  For those of my colleagues who don't want to accept the word of \nAmtrak's president or even my word on what will happen to Amtrak \nwithout this funding, they can look to the words of the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General. The DOT IG's office conducts an \nannual audit of Amtrak's finances. They are as familiar with Amtrak's \nbooks as anyone in this country.\n  The DOT IG's office was asked to review every element of Amtrak's \nrequest for $1.2 billion. What they concluded, after an extensive \nreview, was that the budget request was indeed flawed. The Inspector \nGeneral concluded the budget request was $12 million too low.\n  One thing we know for sure is that Amtrak is not going to get its \nfinal appropriation level until almost half the fiscal year has been \ncompleted. No observer of Amtrak's financial situation--not the \nSecretary of Transportation, not the Federal Railroad Administrator, \nnot the DOT IG, no one on the Amtrak board of directors, including the \nthree Republican appointees on that board--no one has put forward a \ncredible argument that Amtrak can absorb a funding cut of this size in \nthe\n\n[[Page S1050]]\n\nmiddle of the fiscal year and do anything other than declare \nbankruptcy.\n  So let me remind my colleagues that we are not talking about a \nbankruptcy like we are experiencing with some of our airlines, such as \nUSAirways and United. Amtrak will not keep operating with the benefit \nof bankruptcy protection. It will stop the trains, and they will shut \ntheir doors.\n  Members will recall last summer when we faced an Amtrak crisis. The \nrailroad was days away from running out of cash, and we were still \nworking on a supplemental appropriations bill, a bill that would \neventually provide $205 million in additional cash for Amtrak to \ncontinue operations.\n  It was not just Amtrak service that was at risk; it was not just the \ntens of thousands of Amtrak passengers that were going to be left \nstanding on the platform; there were hundreds of thousands of daily \ntransit riders utilizing commuter rail systems from Boston to San \nDiego, from suburban Virginia to Seattle, WA--systems that depend on \nAmtrak remaining a viable entity in order to continue their daily \noperations.\n  Thankfully, due to the enactment of the supplemental appropriations \nbill, and a $100 million temporary loan that was extended by the Bush \nadministration, we avoided an Amtrak catastrophe last summer. However, \nif we enact the bill currently before us without getting the additional \n$374 million called for under the amendment that is pending, we will \nonce again face that crisis in just a few months' time.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate continue to press their position \nthat Amtrak needs to tighten their belt. Well, Amtrak has been \ntightening their belt. Since David Gunn took control of the company 8 \nmonths ago, hundreds of employees have been let go, certain trains have \nbeen eliminated, and dramatic efforts have been initiated to rid the \ncorporation of unnecessary costs. But we need to recognize that the \nfunding level included in the underlying bill for Amtrak is not an \nexercise in tightening the company's belt. It is a death sentence.\n\n  Those who would impose these cuts on the Amtrak budget may have \nforgotten the experience of September 11, 2001, when our aviation \nsystem was brought to a halt for almost a week and travelers flocked to \nAmtrak trains in order to get to their destinations.\n  The Senate needs to have a meaningful debate about Amtrak. We need to \nhave a debate that is based on facts. We need to focus on the fact that \nAmtrak is burdened with a huge debt. We need to focus on the fact that \nAmtrak has billions of dollars in capital needs on the Northeast \ncorridor and no way to pay for them.\n  We need to focus on the fact that terminating Amtrak's long distance \ntrains effectively saves the railroad almost no money. We need to have \nthat fact-based debate without the distraction of another Amtrak \nfunding crisis every few months due to congressional budgetary \nshenanigans.\n  I was hopeful last year we were going to have that debate. Last year \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, by a vote of 20 to 3, reported an \nauthorization bill for Amtrak calling for funding of just under $4 \nbillion in fiscal year 2003. Not only a majority of Democrats on the \nCommerce Committee but also a majority of the Republicans on the \nCommerce Committee supported that bill.\n  The returning chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator \nMcCain, did not support that bill. However, he did introduce his own \nAmtrak authorization bill calling for Amtrak funding in fiscal year \n2003 to be at the level of $1.3 billion. My amendment would not succeed \nin providing that level of funding. It would only succeed in providing \n$1.2 billion.\n  There is a widely held myth that the principal financial drag on \nAmtrak's finances is the long distance trains that travel across this \ncountry. One of those trains is the Empire Builder which originates in \nChicago but provides service between eastern and western Washington, as \nwell.\n  The fact is, the long distance trains pose a comparatively little \ncost to Amtrak each year because they carry with them extremely small \ncapital costs. These trains run over tracks that are owned and \nmaintained by the Nation's freight railroads. By comparison, the \nNortheast corridor between Boston and Washington, DC, is owned by \nAmtrak and burdens Amtrak with hundreds of millions of dollars in \ncapital costs every year.\n  Using generally accepted accounting principles, Amtrak's Northeast \ncorridor has not yielded profits, as some are fond of saying. It never \nhas and it never will. In fact, just last year, Amtrak's Northeast \ncorridor lost a total of $367 million.\n  It is also estimated that the Northeast corridor has a critical \nmaintenance backlog of between $5 and $6 billion. Even the Bush \nadministration concedes that fact.\n  During a hearing I held on Amtrak's finances last year with the \nadministration and the DOT Inspector General, I asked them about the \ncomparative financial burden of the long distance trains versus the \nNortheast corridor. DOT Inspector General Ken Mead made the following \nstatement:\n\n       Some have suggested that Amtrak's financial woes would go \n     away if you would cut out the trains outside the Northeast \n     corridor. That is not true. In fact, the annual net \noperating subsidy that is required to continue Amtrak's most \nunprofitable trains is less than one-third of the annual capital \nsubsidy that is required to operate the most profitable trains in the \nNortheast Corridor.\n\n  To those who would say that Amtrak just needs to eliminate its long \ndistance trains to get its finances in order, I tell them to look at \nthe numbers.\n  Amtrak's own financial analysis of savings associated with \neliminating 18 of the long distance trains--those are 18 trains that \nare considered the worst performers in the national system--would \neffectively yield zero savings in the first year.\n  In the second year, the net savings of eliminating all 18 of those \ntrains would only be about $18 million. Only after 5 years would the \nelimination of those trains yield savings that exceed $200 million.\n  Let me say that again. If we eliminated all of Amtrak's 18 long \ndistance trains, the railroad would eventually yield savings of $200 \nmillion--only after 5 years.\n  However, the underlying appropriations bill would call on Amtrak to \nabsorb a cut of some $400 million right now, today, with only 9 months \nleft in this fiscal year.\n  These are the unpleasant facts that no one wants to face.\n  So I encourage all Members to support this amendment. I would love to \ntell my colleagues there is an easy way to make significant savings in \nthe Amtrak budget--such as the company could absorb funding reductions \nthis year and next year--but the fact is there is not.\n  So I ask that we provide stability for Amtrak while we debate the \nlarger issues regarding the company's future. I ask that we provide \nsome surety to the millions of Amtrak riders and commuter rail \npassengers across the country who depend on a solvent Amtrak. I ask \nthat we provide sufficient funding so Amtrak can approach the level of \nfunding it received in total in fiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I know there are a number of colleagues who wish to \ndiscuss this amendment as well. I thank Senator McCain, chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, for agreeing to accept this amendment at this time. \nI understand his need to have a reauthorization. I look forward to \nworking with him on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think Senator Hollings controls the time \nfor the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Murray controls the time.\n  Does the Senator wish to yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina such time as \nhe may need.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished chairwoman.\n  Let's talk about the good news with respect to Amtrak. Eight months \nago, the Bush administration worked with the Amtrak board to get a new \ndirector to operate this particular railroad. The selection, of course, \nwas Mr. David Gunn who had operated the Metro system here in Washington \nand up in New York, another particular system, but more particularly, \nthe Canadian railroad, with tremendous success. He had just retired to \nhis home there in Nova\n\n[[Page S1051]]\n\nScotia, and they finally persuaded him to come and take on this task \nbecause he knows railroads. He knows what needs to be done. He is for \nreform, and he set about doing just that in the last 8 months.\n  What has happened is that he has turned around and gotten out of the \nexpress business. If my distinguished colleague from Arizona, the \nchairman of our authorization committee, Senator McCain--if I could get \nhis attention, the distinguished chairman of our authorizing committee, \nSenator McCain, I wanted him to know that our David Gunn, who is \noperating Amtrak, went first right to the heart of the number of \nemployees. And those who were not producing he has already eliminated. \nHe got out of the express business. That wasn't paying at all. And with \na lot of objections and everything else from fruit growers, flower \nfolks, and everything else, he got out of the express business. He took \nthe Kentucky Cardinal line, a passenger line that I think the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona cited several times in the debate \nabout a tremendous waste, and discontinued it.\n  But more particularly, he opened up his books--which has never been \ndone before--to the Department of Transportation. And the budget he is \nnow operating under was OK'd, signed off on by this administration by \nthe inspector general of the Department of Transportation, plus the \nSecretary.\n  That reminds me to thank colleagues who are cosponsors on the other \nside: The distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nwho has been the chairman of our Surface Transportation Committee; \nSenator Olympia Snowe of Maine; Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island; \nand Senator Arlen Specter of Pittsburgh.\n  When I approached Senator Specter earlier today, he said: Let me just \ndo some checking. He wanted to make sure this was in consonance with \nwhat the administration was having done. That is the case today.\n  So the good news is that we are on course with what Mr. Gunn calls \nthe conservative, tight budget. We are not in the red there right now. \nYes, this $1.2 billion allows for the payback to the Department of \nTransportation. In other words, it is just swapping moneys of a $100 \nmillion loan back to the Department of Transportation. But he is \nworking again on the reservation system with the Internet reservations \nand otherwise. Some economies can be had there with the personnel. A \nlot of these reservations now are coming through with the Internet.\n\n  I could list out many other good things. There is a bill in Chairman \nMcCain's committee with 30 cosponsors for reform. I pledge to work with \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona, with whom I have worked during \nthe past few years in perfect harmony. We have agreed on just about \neverything. We wanted reform. He wants reform. I want reform.\n  I was having difficulties from time to time trying to explain what \nthey were doing because I couldn't get the information. But we now have \nan open operation there with David Gunn.\n  What happens is, with the $1.2 billion the Appropriations Committee \njust reported out, they thought they had some carryovers and everything \nelse and cut it back to $826 million. With that cutback to $826 \nmillion--it was not considered by us or anybody on the committee--that \nactually is a 27-percent cut under the present operation. We presently \nare operating on a continuing resolution of 1.1, plus the $100 million \nloan to pay back to the Department of Transportation. So what happens \nis, that is a 27-percent cut.\n  Mr. Gunn comes in in distress and says: Look, if that occurs, we will \nrun out. We are operating very economically, very conservatively. I \nhave some other initiatives that I will put in, but by April, under \nthis particular $826 million amount, I will have to be closing down \nsometime this spring.\n  None of us wants that. I am sure the chairman of the committee and \nall of us want to make sure we do the right thing.\n  Incidentally, we have an operator in Mr. Gunn who is not going to \nplay games. We have had others who evidently liked the job, needed the \njob, or wanted the job, or whatever it was, and so they went along over \nthe last 30 years. To give colleagues some grasp of this situation, \nAmtrak has always come for over $1 billion in requests, and they have \nalways compromised at around $500 million. So at $500 million, on an \naverage, per year, it amounts to about $15 billion in a 30-year period.\n  Now, wait a minute; 9/11; the airlines immediately got $15 billion. \nPlus the airport and airways transportation act is another $15 billion. \nHere comes where we really need some reform, $30 billion in 1 year, and \nwe keep jumping and picking and picking and nagging and fussing at \nAmtrak when we ought to be fussing at each other. We are the ones who \nreally haven't gotten into it.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senator McCain, we are getting into it \nbecause, as chairman, he has said: We are not going to let this one go \nunless we work together on reform.\n  With that in mind, let me yield the floor and thank these particular \nSenators and Chairman Murray here on her leadership also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. May I have 5 minutes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and 5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont, and I ask \nthe Senator from Arizona if he wants to use time before us since he has \nnot had time on his side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Go ahead. I am fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nand commend her and Senator Hollings for their work on getting this \namendment in front of us. And I am pleased to see the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee here because over the years, while this is the first \ntime I have spoken on the floor in a couple of years, nevertheless, the \ntune is similar and we have sung it before. I hope that finally we will \ncome to the realization that Amtrak is not simply a Northeast corridor \nprogram, that it is an essential part of an intermodal transportation \nsystem. That fact was made abundantly clear on September 11, 2001, when \njet-liners crashed into the World Trade Center and shocked America to \nits very core. Aviation--I never believed that it would shut down--was \nshut down across the country as a result of that terrible tragedy. \nHighways were jammed. Thank goodness we had Amtrak still running. It \nkept some semblance of order going between Washington and New York and \nthroughout the Northeast region.\n\n  How quickly this seems to be forgotten when we get to appropriating \nproper funding for Amtrak to continue its operations. Amtrak has been \nstarved almost since birth. We heard the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina talk about the amount of funds that were put into Amtrak \nover a 30-year period--something like $500 to $750 million a year, \nwhich is certainly not peanuts in anybody's vocabulary--but the fact \nis, we have just never spent enough.\n  Last fall, the Senate Appropriations Committee provided $1.20 billion \nfor Amtrak. The bill we are considering tonight cuts that amount by \n$374 million, to $826 million. That's a cut of nearly one-third! Amtrak \nwould be better off under the Continuing Resolution, which at least \nprovides $1.04 billion. Amtrak can't survive on $826 million--it's that \nsimple, that stark.\n  I was with the distinguished Senator from Arizona at a meeting in \nBrussels when there was a NATO gathering there, and I took the train \nfrom Brussels to Paris. The train ride was about 200 miles--roughly the \nequivalent of the ride to Washington from New York, which is 225 \nmiles--and it took an hour and 25 minutes. Can you imagine what would \nhappen to the traffic along I-95 if we could ride like that from \nWashington to New York? Even if the New York to DC trip were 2 hours, \nfrankly, it would not pay to go near the airport--not by the time you \nget out to the airport, finish parking and unloading, and all that. We \ncould avoid so many problems. Two hours, city to city, would facilitate \nso much travel and commerce between these two capitals, New York City, \nthe financial capital of the world, and Washington, DC, the capital of \nour great country.\n  So when we look at what we have done, what we have done is just not\n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\nenough. Amtrak has received $24.2 billion in Federal support since its \ncreation in 1971. To put that in perspective, it's less than we spent \non highways just in 2001 alone. In the 1980s, the Western European \nnations made a push to develop their high speed corridors and spent \n$101 billion in just ten years. That is more than four times what we \nhave spent in 30 years.\n  It is time now to start facing up to the reality. The Federal \nAviation Administration (FAA)--a precious instrument in terms of our \naviation system--got $13 billion worth of funds this year; $3 billion \nof that came from the General Treasury and $10 billion came from \npassenger facility charges and taxes on aviation.\n  What happened after 9/11 with aviation? I think the Senator from \nSouth Carolina made reference to it. The fact is, we had to go to the \nairlines and bail them out further, make sure they got plenty of \nsubsidies.\n  I hope this amendment that is being offered here to restore fiscal \nyear 2003 funding for Amtrak to $1.2 billion is passed--but not only \npassed here. I ask the Senator from South Carolina, can we be confident \nthat this amendment won't fall by the wayside in conference? Can we be \nconfident that we have the full support of the leadership in the \nSenate, especially on the Majority's side, when Committee Members sit \ndown at the table with their House counterparts to discuss this \nfunding? I certainly hope so because it is essential.\n  We spent almost $10 billion on Northeast Corridor infrastructure \nimprovements. About a third of that amount was for the electrification \nof the line from New Haven to Boston to make sure we had continuous \nservice. There has been a real improvement in rail passenger service in \nthe Northeast as a result, and there has been an improvement in rail \npassenger service in the country. But we can and need to do more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask for 1 more minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator. So we have made improvements and \nthey have been popularly received. People could not stop talking about \nwhat a nice ride it is from Washington to Wilmington to New York to--\nyou name it, along the way. What a change from what we used to have.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize that continued investment in \nAmtrak and higher speed rail is essential for our Nation. It is not \njust a Northeast corridor thing, which is often the mythology here. And \nI hope that we will see a positive vote on this amendment, supported \nfurther by an insistence that the conference committee retain the full \nfunding.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \nrestore funding to Amtrak. I just served as chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee and we had a great interest--and still do--\nin the health of Amtrak.\n  Amtrak president, David Gunn, has made clear that failure to \nadequately fund the railroad will lead to its bankruptcy and \nliquidation of its assets. This will cost us far more than the dollar \nvalue of this amendment. That is unacceptable to my State of Vermont \nand to the Nation.\n  Across the Nation, Amtrak carries over 23 million riders a year, or \nroughly 65,000 riders each day. On holidays and other peak times, \nAmtrak is the best option for many of our citizens.\n  An Amtrak bankruptcy will have a devastating effect on employment and \nthe economy. Amtrak alone employs over 23,000 Americans, and roughly \n233,000 commuters will find their daily trip to work delayed and \ndisrupted.\n  In Vermont, as in many rural States, Amtrak is an essential service. \nMy home State provides over $2 million a year to maintain Amtrak \nservice to our towns and villages. If we turn away from Amtrak tonight, \nVermonters will surely lose this very vital service.\n  On September 11, Amtrak kept America moving as our airports were \nidled. I was chairman of the committee at that time and I know the fear \nwe had that Amtrak would not be able to keep going. We need the \nredundancy in our transportation system, especially in light of the \ncontinuing threats.\n  Even when it is Mother Nature who comes calling, as in the blizzards \non the east coast in recent years, the rail mode makes it through while \nour highways and airports are buried and stopped.\n  I have spent the last year examining the state of our Nation's \ntransportation system. The system is hemorrhaging. Our highways and \nairports are congested and unreliable. We need a viable third choice. \nPassenger rail is that choice.\n  The United States stands alone among the world's advanced countries \nin our neglect of the rail mode. Europe, in particular, has a modern \nrail system, a key part of its balanced continental transportation \nnetwork. Europe is developing new and advanced rail technologies and \nexporting these technologies around the world. I have seen \ndemonstrations of those technologies.\n  Our Nation's surface and aviation programs are up for renewal during \nthis session of Congress. So is Amtrak. This is the year to shape \nAmerica's transportation future, and that is a job for Congress, not \nfor the bankruptcy court.\n  As the ranking member on the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks, I don't want to give away a third of our option--our passenger \nrail system--before we even begin.\n  Our choice is clear. We can shortchange Amtrak, throw away its \nassets, disrupt the economy, and forfeit this unique chance to create a \nbalanced transportation system or we can restore Amtrak funding, \npreserve our options, and bring our Nation's transportation system into \nthe 21st century.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, I thank Senator Hollings for his continued efforts on this \nissue. It has been a great pleasure and honor for me to have had the \nprivilege of working with him for the last 16, 17 years as a member of \nthe Commerce Committee, where I find the most interesting and \nchallenging issues.\n  Frankly, this issue of Amtrak, to me, has been one of complete \nfrustration. I say that because time after time after time, until the \npresent administrator of Amtrak became the head of Amtrak, Mr. Gunn, \nwith those who ran this organization, which was put together in 1973, I \nbelieve, and was committed to being financially independent within 3 \nyears, there has been an endless drain of resources, an endless series \nof frustrations, and a continuous battle, which goes on as we speak.\n  I think it is important, particularly in light of the last comments \nmade by my dear friend from Vermont and my newly renewed friend from \nNew Jersey, who rejoins us, about the importance of Amtrak. The fact \nis, Amtrak carries less than 1 percent of the traveling public, and we \ncontinue to pour in billions of dollars.\n  We are subsidizing--it is remarkable--we are subsidizing long \ndistance the Lake County Limited, $1,218.45 per passenger--per \npassenger. You could charter an airplane and fly these passengers from \none place to the other rather than pay $1,200; the Sunset Limited, \n$347.45; the Pennsylvania, $292.34; the Three Rivers, $244.99 per \npassenger. We recently, thank God, canceled the Lake County Limited \nwhich was subsidizing $1,218.45 per passenger.\n  I say to my friends, the reality is that Amtrak is probably a vital \nand important means of transportation for the Northeast corridor. It \nhas the potential to perform that same vital function in the Far West. \nBut to continue with this grandiose vision of a national train system \nwhere you envision someone getting on a train in Dallas and riding that \ntrain all the way to Los Angeles, which takes about 2 days now, where \nthey can go to the airport in Dallas and fly to Los Angeles in about 2 \n\\1/2\\ hours, is crazy. It is crazy.\n  Americans are not interested, even if you have a 200-mile-an-hour \ntrain. I say to the Presiding Officer, at present, they are not going \nto get on a train in Atlanta and go to San Francisco. They may for \nvacation, and they may for recreation, but to think it will ever be\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\nanything close to sustaining just flies in the face of every experience \nwe have had since Amtrak was formed.\n  I am glad to hear of the commitment to reform Amtrak on the part of \nmy distinguished friend from South Carolina who knows as much about \nthis issue as any Member of this body. I am pleased the Senator from \nAlaska who, in negotiations, as this bill goes into conference, will \ninsist that we come up with a reform plan. I am encouraged, I am \nexuberant that Mr. Gunn has taken control, and already, as my friend \nfrom South Carolina has pointed out, has made some very tough decisions \nand increased efficiency rather dramatically.\n  Let me also point out to my friends, despite claims that it is \nessentially the same level, ridership is the same level as it was in \n1979. I remind my friends to read again the August 6 Washington Post.\n\n       The Acela Express, the premium high-speed train that Amtrak \n     has counted on. . . .\n\n  That I heard for years was the panacea; this was the pot of gold we \nwere looking for.\n\n       Amtrak President David L. Gunn said that Amtrak will never \n     order another Acela Express, which is manufactured by a \n     consortium of Bombardier Transportation of Montreal and \n     Alstom of Paris.\n       The train has become highly popular with travelers in the \n     Northeast Corridor but has also become increasingly \n     unreliable. In July, the number of Acela problems spiked. \n     There was an average of one cancellation or en-route \n     breakdown for mechanical reasons every day. The train also \n     has the worst on-time record for any Northeast Corridor \n     train.\n\n  This, I say to my friends, is the train that was going to solve all \nour problems because we would be able to get from Washington to New \nYork in an hour to an hour and a half. Now Mr. Gunn is not going to \norder any more of them. In fact, he is going to go to court and sue \nthem for the lousy product he got.\n\n       But the trains experienced repeated delays and \n     developmental problems. The first one arrived more than a \n     year after the last extended deadline. In a rush to get the \n     trains on line, the manufacturer made modifications to each \n     train set to solve the latest problem, meaning that none of \n     the 18 train sets delivered to Amtrak so far is the same as \n     any other.\n\n  My God.\n\n       That fact complicates maintenance and trouble shooting.\n       Gunn said the problems range from the serious--one Acela \n     electronic braking system froze up and blocked other traffic \n     North of Union Station--to less serious, such as restroom \n     doors that sometimes stick and trap passengers inside.\n       ``You'd think that after 170 years of railroading, you \n     could have a crapper door that works,'' Gunn says.\n\n  Some of this is entertaining, but it is also the investment of \nbillions of taxpayers' money. I urge all of my colleagues to read a \nvery interesting article out of the New York Times Sunday magazine, \n``Amtrak Must Die: A Train Lover's Lament.'' It is a very interesting \nand entertaining article which I will not read because it is at some \nlength. But it talks about an individual who got on a train in Chicago \nand tried to get out to L.A. hours late. It is just a sad story, but it \nis a story that is repeated.\n  My point is, after dealing with this issue for all these years, we \nneed fundamental reform. I wish to point out--and I think all my \ncolleagues should know--we are going to provide them now with enough to \nmeet the $1.2 billion Mr. Gunn says he needs. He also says he needs \n$2.2 billion next year. He needs $2.2 billion next year to keep \noperating.\n  Now remember, we are talking about less than 1 percent of the \npassengers of the traveling public. For less than 1 percent of the \ntraveling public, we are going to spend $1.2 billion this year, $2.2 \nbillion next year, and God only knows when this will stop.\n  We have every right to expect reform, and if that reform means \ncutting long distance lines, then we ought to admit there is a clear \nrecord that some long distance lines do not work and no one wants to \nride them. The facts are overwhelming.\n  When I say we are going to have reform, I mean reform, and that means \nthe Department of Transportation has to come up with a plan, and that \nplan has to be validated by Mr. Gunn, who has already gained great \ncredibility amongst all of us, and then that plan has to be put into \neffect.\n  I wish to point out one other point in my conversation, and I am sure \nSenator Hollings had the same conversation with Mr. Gunn. If the States \nwant to contribute, and admittedly States are in severe difficulty now, \nincluding my own, to maintain these routes, then we welcome it. I think \nit is a fine idea. It may be difficult because when you go through one \nState from another to another, then you have to have participation of \nall the States. But we have to think outside the box.\n  Thirty years ago we were going to have a fiscally independent Amtrak \nin 3 years. Maybe that was unrealistic at the time, but as short a time \nas 2 years ago, Mr. Gunn's predecessor testified before the Commerce \nCommittee and said: We are on the glidepath to fiscal independence. \nThose were his exact words. I looked at him with astonishment and \namazement because nobody who knew anything about Amtrak believed that. \nBut yet we sat there and watched Amtrak deteriorate further and \nfurther.\n  The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, an attempt that \nagain Senator Hollings and I and Members of the Commerce Committee \nmade, provided the operational procurement, labor and liability reforms \nthat Amtrak requested so it could operate more as a legitimate \nbusiness. The reforms were designed to allow Amtrak to run its \noperations based on good business decisions rather than political \npressures. For example, reforms allowed Amtrak to set its own route \nstructure instead of conform to a statutory mandate. Reforms allowed \nAmtrak to contract out work where it decided it would make sense. \nReforms allowed Amtrak to negotiate reasonable labor protection \nagreements. Unfortunately, little, if any, progress was made as a \nresult.\n  As I said, for years after the passage of that bill, Amtrak presented \nglowing reports on its achievement that it was on a glide path to self-\nsufficiency. How many times did members of the Commerce Committee hear \nthose words: We are on a glide path to self-sufficiency?\n  If I sound a bit cynical, it is because we have not been told the \ntruth, but I do believe that Mr. Gunn has. Mr. Gunn's straight talk has \nbeen refreshing.\n  In a letter to me, Mr. Gunn stated:\n\n       Amtrak pretended it was on a glide path to self-sufficiency \n     and maintained that fiction far too long. It took actions \n     such as borrowing money through a variety of means, the \n     primary example being the mortgage of Penn Station last year, \n     and now debt service is a huge cost. This is not a way to run \n     a railroad and not the way I will run the railroad. Too many \n     happy words have hidden some very dismal financial results.\n\n  That really is the first time, in Mr. Gunn's letter to me, that we \nhave had a straightforward and honest depiction of Amtrak's conditions. \nI think that was the day when many of us began having confidence that \nMr. Gunn's stewardship would lead to some beneficial results.\n  Over the past decade, Amtrak spent almost $3 billion in taxpayers' \ndollars on the Northeast corridor to develop higher speed service, as I \nmentioned. Acela was to have been Amtrak's silver bullet for achieving \noperational self-sufficiency, reportedly generating $180 million in \nprofits annually. Instead, it has become another of their many failures \nover the past 5 years and has raised concerns about Amtrak's ability to \nhandle major rail infrastructure projects.\n  Problems with the project, as I mentioned, have included significant \ncost overruns, a year's delay in the introduction of Acela service and \nongoing mechanical problems with the equipment. The latter recently \nbecame so severe that Amtrak was forced to remove the train sets from \nservice for considerable periods of time. Again, we are losing a huge \namount of money per passenger on those routes I mentioned before.\n  So I want to thank my colleagues for their involvement in this issue. \nI really believe we have every right to demand a genuine proposal to \nreform the system. I believe we need a Northeast corridor. I believe we \nmay need them in the West and we may need them in other parts of the \ncountry, but the burden of proof of having to need them lies with \nAmtrak and its proponents, and we should not be asking our citizens to \ncontinue to subsidize routes in the hundreds and sometimes even \nthousands of dollars per passenger that will\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\nnever, ever, become economically viable.\n  So the status quo at $2 billion, in my view, which will be what \nAmtrak will be asking for next year, is not affordable or acceptable.\n  I guess this is a triumph of hope over good sense. I hope it is not, \nbut I have some confidence that Mr. Gunn will work with us and the \nappropriators, as well as the authorizers, and come up with a reform \nplan that will give us a system that Americans can be proud of rather \nthan the shameful history of Amtrak over the last 30 years.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that I be joined as a cosponsor on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from Alaska, the manager of this bill, \nhas been confined to quarters, so to speak, but I wanted to make sure \neveryone understood the snow is starting, and so maybe that will \nshorten some of the speeches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be pleased to go out and see my normal condition \nof life and enjoy the snow this evening.\n  Does the Senator from Delaware expect to speak tonight?\n  Mr. CARPER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time do I have remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen and a half minutes are remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jeffords be listed \nas a cosponsor on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time does Senator Carper need?\n  Mr. CARPER. I would appreciate 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Five or less, and the Senator from Illinois would like 3 \nminutes. And I believe that is all we have.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Delaware and 3 minutes to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nyielding 5 minutes. I also express my thanks to her, and especially \nSenator Hollings, for their work. I say to Senator McCain that I \nappreciate his comments and his willingness to join with the Senator \nfrom Delaware last year as we tried to address the issue of rail \nsecurity.\n  It looks like we will pass, on a voice vote, an appropriation level \nfor Amtrak which will carry Amtrak through the balance of this fiscal \nyear. That sets the stage for a robust debate, which we need to have, \non whether the future of passenger rail service in this country is the \nNortheast corridor and maybe some routes on the West Coast. If there \nare other high speed corridors that make sense, if there are long \ndistance trains such as the Auto Train that make sense, I welcome that \ndebate. The concurrence of reauthorization of T-21, reauthorization of \nour transportation programs along with reauthorization of Amtrak, is a \nvery fortunate confluence of events. I think we will have the \nopportunity to maybe do the right thing not just by Amtrak but by the \npeople of this country.\n  I have said on this floor before and I will say it again tonight, \nwhen Amtrak was created roughly 30 years ago it was created at a time \nwhen private rail companies wanted out of the passenger business. They \ncould not make money carrying passengers. They said to Congress: Let us \nout of that business, and Congress freed them of that responsibility.\n  Amtrak was created with the private railroads, the freight railroads, \ngiving to this new entity their old rolling stock, their old passenger \ncars, their old cafe cars, their old locomotives. Amtrak was given the \nold track bed from Washington to Boston. Amtrak was given the old \nrepair shops, the old train stations. Somehow, given all this old \nequipment and being undercapitalized for 30 years, we said to Amtrak we \nexpect them to make money when nobody in the private sector could make \nmoney.\n\n  There are a number of other countries around the world that have \nterrific passenger rail service. We have talked about some of them \ntonight. The reason why they have good passenger rail service is \nbecause they believe it is in the naked self-interest of their country \nto invest in passenger rail, and that is some of the reason why they do \nit. They want to reduce their reliance on foreign oil. They want to \nreduce the size of their trade deficits that grow out of importing \nforeign oil. They want to reduce the amount of congestion they have on \ntheir highways and at their airports. They are concerned about the \nquality of the air and the kinds of emissions that their cars, trucks, \nand vans put up into the air.\n  As a result, those countries rather generously support passenger rail \nservice. They do not do it for reasons of altruism or nostalgia. They \nthink it is in their naked self-interest, and it is. When we think \nabout it, we have an interest in clean air as well in this country. We \nhave problems with congestion around our airports and our roads as \nwell. We have a huge trade deficit, $400 billion this year. About a \nthird of that is imported oil.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, I do not think it makes sense for us \nto run trains where people do not want to ride them. But today in this \ncountry, 75 percent of Americans live within 50 miles of one of our \ncoasts. Think about that. That provides for a lot of congestion, but it \nalso provides for some wonderful high speed train routes that if we are \nsmart we will figure out how to take advantage of and give people the \nchance to move throughout those densely populated corridors more \nquickly.\n  From time to time, there is going to be a train like the Auto Train \nwhich runs south of Washington, DC, down to Orlando. It leaves every \nday and comes back every day. It basically makes money. A lot of people \nride the train. It is the longest train in the world. They take their \ncars, trucks, and vans, hitch them up to the train and head on south or \nbring them back from Florida. There are probably some other routes like \nthat around the country that would make sense, too.\n  Then there are some States where, frankly, the States would like to \nput in some of their own money in order to have passenger rail service \nto routes that are losing money, but inexplicably, at least to me as an \nold Governor, I was never allowed to use Delaware's Federal \ntransportation money or congestion mitigation money to help provide for \npassenger rail. We could use that money in our State for freight \nrailroads, for bicycle paths, but we could not use it to help pay for \npassenger rail service. That makes no sense. We should give States and \nGovernors the flexibility to use a portion--not all, a portion--of \ntheir Federal transportation money to invest in passenger rail if it \nmakes sense for the States.\n\n  We will have a great debate this year. It is time for that debate. I \nam pleased to participate with all my colleagues on this. I thank \nSenator Murray for her leadership, Senator Byrd and Senator Hollings \nfor their work, Senator Hutchison, Senator Specter, and others who \nbelieve in the cause.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, we look forward to a debate that \nwill lead to better passenger rail service and, frankly, the return of \ncommon sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator from New York if he has a request.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to address the \nbody for 7 minutes after my colleague from Oregon.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes and already yielded 3 to the Senator from Illinois, so there \nare about 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I ask \nunanimous consent to be included as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Arizona is a \nskeptic on Amtrak, and whether there is forbearance or blind hope, \nthank you. And thank you to the Senator from Washington for showing \nleadership because\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\n$1.2 billion means Amtrak has hope and an opportunity.\n  It means a lot when you consider the context of our Federal support \nfor transportation: Over $30 billion for highways each year, over $10 \nbillion for airports, so $1.2 billion for national passenger rail \nservice is not an extraordinary amount of money in that context.\n  People talk about the coastal service. The Senator from Delaware made \nthat point a moment ago. But for the State of Illinois, it means that \n2.6 million passengers last year used Amtrak. If Amtrak disappears and \nwe do not provide the money the Senator from Washington asks for, 2.6 \nmillion trips will be converted into automobile trips, by and large, \nand that means more highway congestion, more pollution, more use of \npetroleum products, and more dependence on foreign oil. None of that is \ngood for my State of Illinois. We value Amtrak. It not only means a lot \nof service, it means a lot of jobs. I think it is important to our \neconomy.\n  My hometown, a downstate city, is the largest user of Amtrak outside \nof the city of Chicago. We believe in Amtrak. We believe investing in \nAmtrak and improving its service so we can have high-speed rail is \ngoing to dramatically increase passenger ridership. I hope those who \nare skeptical of Amtrak will understand we have in this new \nadministrator, Mr. Gunn, a man who has been brutally honest in terms of \nthe future of Amtrak and what it needs, and the Senator from Washington \nis offering him the resources he needs to continue to reform this \nimportant service to our Nation. I thank the Senator from Washington \nfor her leadership on this.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on July 26, 2002, just 6 months ago, the \nCommittee on Appropriations, on a unanimous, bipartisan vote reported a \nTransportation Appropriations bill that included $1.2 billion in \nfunding for Amtrak.\n  At that time, Amtrak had just weathered a severe financial crisis. \nAmtrak's President, Mr. David Gunn, testified before the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, just a few weeks into his tenure, and \ndescribed to us the desperate financial conditions he found when he \nassumed control of the railroad.\n  It was only through a combination of a $205 million supplemental \nappropriation that our Committee approved back in July, as well as a \ntemporary loan by the Bush Administration against the railroad's 2003 \nappropriation, that the railroad survived and continues to run to this \nday.\n  That Amtrak funding crisis served as a wake-up call for many of us in \nCongress as well as for the millions of Amtrak riders and the millions \nof commuter rail riders whose train service depends on a viable \noperating Amtrak system.\n  However, when the new Republican majority drafted its new \nappropriations bill for the Transportation Department, it singled out \nAmtrak for a whopping $374 million cut, a reduction of over 31 percent.\n  Amtrak's new President, David Gunn, has made clear in letters to me \nand to Senator Stevens, Senator Shelby, Senator Murray, and others that \na funding cut of this kind will mean certain bankruptcy for Amtrak by \nthis coming Spring.\n  Now many Senators will speak on this amendment, including a great \nmany that represent the states along the Northeast Corridor.\n  These Members will speak to the impact of an Amtrak bankruptcy on the \nvery fine rail service that we have between Boston and Washington, DC.\n  These Members will speak on what a bankrupt Amtrak means for their \ndaily commuter lines that are either operated by Amtrak under contract \nor operate over Amtrak's property. But as a Senator from West Virginia, \nI want to speak today on what Amtrak means to rural America. Amtrak \ndoes not just stop in cities like Boston, New York, and Washington, DC.\n  Amtrak serves communities like Beckley, WV; Hinton, WV; Alderson, WV; \nCharleston, WV; Huntington, WV; Martinsburg, WV, and, Harpers Ferry, \nWV. These are some of the communities in my state that are served by \nAmtrak.\n\n  I can tell you that for a great many of the citizens in those \ncommunities, the Amtrak train may be the only way into town and the \nonly way out. When you talk about long-distance travel, the situation \nis no different in the great many other communities that are served by \nAmtrak: communities like Pascagoula, MS; Lordsburg, NM; Crestview, FL; \nGilman, IL; Wilson, NC; Libby, MT; Winona, MN; Fort Morgan, CO; White \nSalmon, WA; Sun River, OR; Fulton, KY; Ardmore, OK; and Weaverville, \nCA.\n  Many of the communities I have just named, like so many communities \nacross the United States, were put on the map by the arrival of the \nfreight railroads as they were built across our country east and west, \nnorth and south.\n  Those communities continue to be connected to our national rail \nnetwork and our national economy through Amtrak.\n  The service may not be the kind of high speed, high comfort rail \nservice that people have come to expect in the Northeast, but it is \nservice that gets grandmothers to their grandchildren; it gets soldiers \nhome to see their parents; it gets college students home for the \nholidays; and lest we forget, Amtrak moved Americans all over this \ncountry, immediately after September 11, when our aviation system was \nbrought to a complete halt.\n  We are now faced with a funding proposal to take all of rural America \noff of the national rail map and do away with passenger service in its \nentirety; not just in the heartland of America, but in the Northeast as \nwell.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to talk to the mayors of \ntheir towns on the Amtrak rail map and see how they feel about losing \ntheir daily service. At a time when rural communities across the \ncountry are suffering from economic isolation, ask the people of those \ncommunities if they want even greater isolation by losing their rail \nservice.\n  The Amendment that we have offered here today holds the promise of \ncontinued rail service and the promise that Amtrak's new president, Mr. \nDavid Gunn, will continue his efforts that he just started in getting \nthe railroad's costs under control and creating a national network of \nwhich we all can be proud. I ask all of my colleagues to support this \nAmendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New York \nbe given 2 minutes of my remaining time and the Senator from Delaware \nbe given 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher leadership, the Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from West \nVirginia, and I thank our Senator from Arizona for letting this \namendment go through. If we did not, we would have the same situation \nwe had last August when Amtrak closed.\n  I find it rather perplexing that so many of my colleagues are willing \nto subsidize the basic transportation infrastructure for roads--it is \nthe Federal Government, not the passengers, that pays for roads--we are \nwilling to pay for airports--again, Federal Government money pays for \nairports, both general aviation and commercial aviation--but we are not \nwilling to do it for rail. It makes no sense, no sense whatever. It is \nunfair. It is probably geographic. Every State has airports and every \nState has roads but not every State has Amtrak. So people who do the \nsame thing for air and for roads do not do it for rail.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. On the Senator's time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is a tax fund for roads with the gasoline tax; \nthere is a fund for airports with airplane tickets. How about a program \nthat charges people on trains to pay for whatever you need for trains?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time, that is something we could consider. \nMay I answer on the Senator's time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is not my time now.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is something we should consider, but we should not \nconsider pulling the rug out from Amtrak. Roads are subsidized far \nbeyond the nickel gas tax, and airports are taxed\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\nfar beyond the ticket price. Federal dollars go into each of those; we \nall know that. It is not simply that one is subsidized by the other. It \nmakes no sense if you just believe in air and roads.\n  Before September 11, we had delay after delay after delay in the \nNortheast and then throughout the country in the air. In Europe, where \nthey have as great a density, they do not have it. If you go a short \ndistance, you take a speedy train. If you go from Paris to London, you \ntake the Chunnel. From Paris to Frankfurt, you take the TGV. We will \nhave to have rail in this country because we do not have enough space \nat the airports, we do not have enough space on the roads in the \nNortheast corridor, in California, and in so many other parts of the \ncountry where we have dense populations. So let's all pull together.\n  My good friend from Arizona fights subsidies in a lot of places, and \nI appreciate that. But so many others will vote for subsidies in every \nother place, but when it comes to rail, we say no. That makes no sense. \nIt is unfair.\n  I am glad we have this amendment on the floor. I salute the \nleadership of my colleagues. I hope we will do something about Amtrak. \nThe new head of Amtrak will shut that place down if we do not fund it, \nand then the country will have an economic cataclysm that will affect \neveryone, whether you have Amtrak in your community and in your State \nor not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are once again back here on the Senate \nfloor fighting for the future of passenger rail in this country.\n  Everyone here is well aware of my position on railroads. \nUnfortunately, this is a battle that those of us who believe in \npassenger rail service have had to make over and over.\n  I don't need to tell anyone here that our national rail system is at \na crossroads. Decades of underfunding have finally caught up to us.\n  Amtrak is struggling to stay afloat. They have imposed drastic \nspending cuts in the last 2 years. They have deferred key capital \nmaintenance projects. The have mortgaged Penn Station in New York--\ntheir most valuable asset. The have slashed jobs.\n  These short-term moves have only served to worsen Amtrak's long-term \nfinancial viability and put its future in jeopardy.\n  For 30 years, Congress has dragged its feet. It has taken a back-seat \napproach to dealing with the long-term needs of a national passenger \nrail system. It stalled. It bickered. In the end, it provided only \nenough money to allow Amtrak to continue to limp along.\n  And we broke the deal we made with Amtrak to help it meet its capital \nneeds. Year after year, Amtrak received only $521 million--far less \nthan it was promised--forcing it to turn to private sector loans and \ndramatically increasing it debt burden.\n  No industrialized country in the world operates a rail system that is \ncompletely self-sufficient. Japan, Germany, France--all of the \nsupposedly superior, successful rail systems, received some level of \nsubsidy from their governments, in most cases far more than that sought \nby Amtrak.\n  They understand the enormous capital costs involved in developing and \nmaintaining a national rail system. Why don't we? Why don't we speak \nthe truth: America needs a passenger rail system and it will take a \nnational commitment. It makes sense. It's simple common sense.\n  And yet, though we've made a substantial commitment to highway and \naviation development--over $750 billion since 1971--somehow we don't \nseem to get it. We don't seem to understand the parallel commitment \nnecessary for railroads.\n  Instead, we have starved the rail system. And that's why Amtrak is in \nthis situation today.\n  We have to end that practice. We have to sit down with governors, \nmayors, railroad workers--with everyone who cares about keeping the \nrailroads solvent, safe, and moving.\n  We need to discuss and resolve the kind of passenger rail system this \ncountry deserves. And how much support from Federal, State, and local \nagencies will be needed to sustain it now and over time.\n  And we need to do this in the larger context--taking into account \nincreasing capacity constraints on our highways, at our airports, the \nchronic overcrowding, and the air pollution that comes from that.\n  I commend my good friend, the Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nHollings, because as chairman of the Commerce Committee, he made the \nreauthorization of Amtrak a priority and stepped up to the plate--\nrecognizing the depth of commitment that is needed. I am proud to \ncosponsor his bill.\n  But this is not what we're fighting over today. Today, we are asking \nfor the life-support to keep Amtrak moving until we are able to reach a \nconsensus on its future. If we don't adopt this amendment, if we don't \nfund Amtrak at $1.2 billion this year, this system will die, commerce \nwill be disrupted, passengers will be abandoned, and it will cost us \nmuch more to build a new rail system down the road.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, and the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, for giving Amtrak a \nfighting chance, and to give us the time we need to resolve these \nissues.\n  Last spring, Amtrak got a new president, David Gunn. Right out of the \ngate he was faced with the prospects of shutting down the system \nbecause of the lack of operating funds.\n  We were here less than a year ago, fighting for an emergency $200 \nmillion to keep the trains running.\n  This administration was not especially receptive to the idea of \nhelping, but in the end, after long hours, an agreement was reached and \nAmtrak got the infusion of funds it needed to keep going.\n  But David Gunn made it clear to the Congress even before then that in \nthis fiscal year--the one we are in right now--Amtrak was going to need \n$1.2 billion in this year to stay alive.\n  The administration sent up a budget with just a placeholder number in \nit: $521 million--the same number Amtrak has received in other recent \nyears. But everyone knew that number wasn't real, that it was grossly \ninsufficient.\n  The number in this bill is grossly insufficient as well. Its $374 \nmillion short. Once more, Amtrak is getting underfunded. But this time \nwe can't expect it to keep limping along. This time--if we don't step \nup to our commitment--we're going to strand millions of rail \npassengers.\n  We need to give David Gunn the resources he needs to get Amtrak back \non its feet again. Now--with new leadership at the helm--it is critical \nthat we don't short change Amtrak one more time.\n  Mr. President, this is unusual for me. I thank my friend from \nArizona. I appreciate him. My friend from Arizona is right on one very \nbasic point. We have had such a stark disagreement, he and I, for so \nmany years, as close as we are. It is the only thing ever where we have \ngotten each other's hackles up, and in the middle of these debates we \nhave occasionally felt like walking across and pummeling one another, \nbut we are close friends.\n  But he is right--and I mean this sincerely--about one important \nthing. We should make a decision. We should shut this sucker down or we \nshould fund it. I have been fighting this fight for 30 years as a \nSenator, and it is always a bridge too far. I am not referring to my \nfriend from Arizona because he says: Look, let's figure out how to \nreorganize this sucker; let's chop it, move it, change it, but whatever \nwe are going to do, let's do it.\n  I agree. Let's have the final fight here. Not tonight. Let's this \nyear have a fight over whether or not to reauthorize Amtrak. Let's do \nit. If we do it--whatever we call it, subsidy or not--let's pay for it. \nIf we call them giveaways, whatever it is, let's just be realistic and \ndecide, is it worth the price?\n  It reminds me--and I will end with this--every single year I have \ncome on this floor since the Nixon administration, and said: I will \ntake whatever you can give me; just keep part of it open; just keep it \nopen. It was always less than everyone said was needed to make it run. \nIt kind of reminds me of when we talk about vouchers--I am not talking \nabout my friend from Arizona--we talk about vouchers for school.\n  In my State, the cost of the average private school is about $1,500. \nIf you go to the real private schools, they cost about $13,000 a year, \nlike down here in Washington. If I go to some African-\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\nAmerican or Latino kid in the neighborhood and say: You have $500. Here \nit is. I could give him $5,000, if the cost is $13,000--I could give \nhim $10,000--and he can't get there. That is kind of where Amtrak is. \nThere is no way to get from here to there without funding it, like I \nguess we have basically reached an agreement on. We are going to get, \nat least initially here, a reform.\n  I thank my friend. I really hope this year he and I and others--the \nleader in this deal for me has always been Senator Hollings, and now \nPatty Murray, who has for the last I don't know how many years headed \nup this subcommittee. I think we should just have a knockdown, drag it \nout debate about whether we should have the railroad or not. If we have \nit, fund it. If not, let's get rid of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator from Delaware like to take a couple of \nextra minutes?\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, I am fine. I said all I want to say. I sincerely mean \nwhat I said about let's decide whether we are going to have this system \nor not.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Delaware. I will just take a few \nminutes, I say to my dear friend from Delaware. I just want to point \nout I don't think the decision necessarily has to be to shut it down or \nto fund it. I think it is to reform the system.\n  The Senator from New York just came on and talked about how the \ngeneral funds subsidize aviation. The fact is that $3.08 over the last \n5 years has come out of the general fund per passenger. Compare that \nwith the Sunset Limited, which is $347 per passenger; the Texas Eagle, \nwhich is $258 per passenger; the Pennsylvanian, which is $292 per \npassenger; the Lake County Limited, which has been canceled--$1,200 per \npassenger.\n  The fact is that most of the funding for highways and for air service \nin America comes out of user fees. It comes out of trust funds that are \nfunded by user fees. And we just laid a whole lot more on the airlines \nin the interest of aviation safety.\n  But the fact is that if it is going to cost $347 per passenger, then \nthe Senator from Delaware is right: You either shut it down or you tell \nthe American people that we are going to fund the Sunset Limited for \n$347 per passenger forever. Or we are going to tell the American people \nthat we are going to fund the Northeast corridor, we are going to fund \nthe Far West and other places in the country where it is economically \nviable and, in many cases, as the Senator from Delaware and the Senator \nfrom Vermont have pointed out, vital to have that service.\n  The problem with Amtrak has not been in the Northeast, although the \nmismanagement--I am sorry you were not here while we talked about Acela \nand those incredible failures.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I think I could have guessed \nwhat he said.\n  Mr. McCAIN. They are the words of Mr. Gunn, the new President, not \nmine--the new President of Amtrak, Mr. Gunn, about their failures. I am \nsorry the Senator from Delaware wasn't here:\n\n       Amtrak pretended it was on a glidepath to self-sufficiency \n     and maintained that fiction far too long. It took action \n     such as borrowing money through a variety of means, the \n     primary example being the mortgaging of Penn Station last \n     year, and now debt service is a huge cost. That's not the \n     way to run a railroad and not the way I will run the \n     railroad. Too many happy words have hidden very dismal \n     financial results.\n\n  I come to this floor year after year, talking about these problems \nand, in all due respect to my dear friend from Delaware, he never \nrecognized these problems. These problems were never recognized by the \nproponents of Amtrak. These were serious problems.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to my friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will only take 2 minutes. The Senator is right. It's \nlike going to someone and saying: By the way, we are going to demand \nthat you be self-sufficient within the next 2 weeks or 2 years. By the \nway, we are going to give you half of what you need to be self-\nsufficient. And now you have to promise me you are going to be self-\nsufficient.\n  I know darned well I can't get self-sufficient based on what I have \nto operate with. But what do I do? What has been done--and this is the \nlie of it, in effect--what has been done too long, they say: OK, don't \nshut us down now. We will be self-sufficient--hoping that something \nhappens in the next year and the year after and the year after.\n  So my friend is exactly right. He made a believer out of me. He's \nabsolutely right. That is what I mean by let's not do that anymore, \nlet's shut it down or whatever we want to do.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield an additional 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Delaware if he wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I really appreciate the courtesy, and this is really the \nlast thing I will say. I realize, and I don't think other people here \ndo--I realize my friend is not ``against rail.'' He has said to me, I \ndon't know how many times over the years: Why can't we work something \nout, Joe, that funds the places needed, the dense populations, the \nNortheast corridor? But the rest of this apparatus is bleeding us to \ndeath. And you have inefficiencies even in the corridor. Why don't we \nwork that out?\n  What I am saying to my friend, and I say it sincerely, he is right in \nthis respect. We should either decide what we mean by Amtrak, that it \nis the Northeast corridor and West Coast system and that's it, or we \nshould decide it is a national system and we are going to pay the \nprice. We should decide what it is. He is right about that debate. \nLet's have that debate. Whatever it comes out, in terms of \nreorganization, let's then make sure it can function.\n  I wasn't being smart with my friend. I am sincere when I say I know \nhe is not ``against rail.'' He is against what he believes to be--and \nin many cases is right--total inefficiency and outrageous subsidies. \nThat's the only way we have been able to keep the Northeast corridor \ngoing, because we had to get everyone from Texas to West Virginia and \nMinnesota to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me add one additional point. The thing that \nfrustrated me--and I know my friend from Delaware appreciates this--is \nthat people who are running Amtrak would come before the Commerce \nCommittee and say: We are on a glidepath to self-sufficiency.\n  We have kind of an odd thing, that we have hearings and witnesses \ncome and testify and we take their word for it. We say: Gee, that's \nwonderful. Time after time after time.\n  The reason why we express our frustrations is because, despite the \nassurances that are made, ``glidepath to self-sufficiency,'' it was far \nfrom the truth. That is why I know the Senator from Delaware and I are \nboth very pleased that Mr. Gunn is telling us exactly how it is. That \nis a critical aspect of this whole issue and frankly one of the reasons \nwhy I believe that Mr. Gunn has said he needs this $1.2 billion to \ncontinue operating while he institutes these reforms. That's one of the \nreasons why I am in favor of it and I think the reason why the Senator \nfrom Alaska very reluctantly agreed to allow this amendment to go \nthrough.\n  I am sorry. I want to apologize to my colleagues. I have probably \novertalked this issue. But I do take them at their word, that we will \nsit down this year and work together: First with the Department of \nTransportation, sending over their reform plan. Then working with \nAmtrak and working with all of our colleagues and coming up with a plan \nfor genuine reform of Amtrak so we don't have to go through this debate \non an annual basis. And it will remove the only existing impediment to \nthe friendship and affection that I feel for my friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nMurray's amendment to add $438 million to Amtrak to fund system-wide \nrail security upgrades and to reiterate my unwavering support for \nAmtrak.\n  I believe it is essential to fund Amtrak at $1.2 billion in fiscal \nyear 2003 to prevent our passenger rail system from grinding to a halt \nand stranding millions of commuters coast to coast. In fact, Amtrak's \nPresident David Gunn has said a funding level of only $762\n\n[[Page S1058]]\n\nmillion would ``guarantee insolvency by spring and the shutting down of \nthe railroad at that time.''\n  And as James Jones, California State Legislative Director of the \nUnited Transportation Union, wrote to me in a recent letter:\n\n       This shutdown would end all intercity rail and much of the \n     commuter operations in California. This would cause a serious \n     adverse effect on the general public, the Amtrak employees \n     that would be out of work, as well as the California economy.\n\n  Amtrak's passenger rail service is an essential link in our \ntransportation system and our economy.\n  Every day, Americans use Amtrak and local commuter rail systems that \ndepend on Amtrak to get to and from work. More and more Americans are \nrelying on long distance Amtrak trains for their travel because of \nsecurity changes at our Nation's airports.\n  I cannot think of a worse time to underfund Amtrak.\n  What will happen if Amtrak shuts down? Well, you can be sure the \nroads will jam up even more and air travel will become an even greater \nheadache.\n  Last year, I joined many of my colleagues in a commitment to fund \n$1.2 billion for Amtrak in fiscal year 2003. This is the amount Amtrak \nneeds and it was the amount the Appropriations Committee unanimously \napproved last year despite the Bush administration's paltry budget \nrequest of $521 million for fiscal year 2003.\n  I cannot understand why President Bush continues to stand by his \nbudget request of $521 million.\n  Amtrak needs more funding, not less and last week I was pleased to \nagain co-sponsor Senator Hollings's legislation to fund Amtrak for the \nnext 5 years. The National Defense Rail Act would authorize $4.6 \nbillion annually for passenger rail service. The legislation, which \npassed the Commerce Committee by a vote of 20-3 last April would fund \nrail security improvements, high-speed rail development, and \noperational costs for existing rail routes.\n  I strongly believe that Amtrak is not a failure, it is the government \nthat has failed Amtrak. If we do not properly fund our rail system, how \ndo we expect it to thrive?\n  Since 1971, when Amtrak was founded, only $25 billion has been spent \non passenger rail, compared to over $750 billion that has been invested \nin highways and aviation. The Federal Government has made a commitment \nto fund road construction and expand aviation capacity, but we have \nalways come up short to provide fair funding for our rail system.\n  The Federal Government provided $15 billion in payments and loan \nguaranties to aid the airlines after the September 11th terrorist \nattacks. Why can't we provide $438 million more to keep our trains \nrunning?\n  Imagine the chaos that will ensue if Amtrak does shut down. There \nwill be even more traffic on our roads and air travel will slow down if \ntrains are not an option for commuters heading to work or travelers on \nvacation.\n  Last summer, Senator Boxer and I wrote President Bush to ask him to \napprove Amtrak's $200 million loan guarantee to prevent the rail system \nfrom grinding to a halt. I cannot believe that 6 months later Amtrak is \nagain being denied life support.\n  If Amtrak shuts down, thousands of people in California who depend on \nAmtrak service every day will be stranded. Since most rail lines in \nCalifornia are run by Amtrak or depend on Amtrak, everything is in \njeopardy.\n  These include three Amtrak routes funded by the State and the Federal \nGovernment:\n\n       No. 1, the Capitol Corridor route between San Jose and \n     Auburn;\n       No. 2, the San Joaquin route between Oakland and \n     Bakersfield; and\n       No. 3, the Pacific Surfliner route between San Diego and \n     San Luis Obispo.\n\n  These are three of the most successful routes in the United States. \nIn fact, all three are among the top five intercity rail corridors, and \nthe Pacific Surfliner is the fastest growing route in the Nation. \nOverall the State of California has added 28 new daily trains since \n1995, and over 1.5 million new passengers.\n  But a shutdown will also threaten some of California's largest \nregional transportation systems including:\n\n       No. 1, Caltrain, the rail service between San Francisco and \n     San Jose;\n       No. 2, Metrolink, Southern California's regional transit \n     system; and\n       No. 3, the Coaster, San Diego County's regional train.\n\n  It is clear to me that a shutdown of Amtrak will be devastating for \nrail passengers across the Nation. I believe we must act immediately to \navoid it. I urge my colleagues to approve Senator Murray's amendment to \nadd $438 million to Amtrak to fund system-wide rail security upgrades.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senator Murray to restore funding for Amtrak to \nthe full $1.2 billion level needed to ensure the solvency and continued \noperations of the railroad. I am deeply troubled by this \nadministration's failure to address Amtrak's financial needs.\n  Since it was first established in 1970, Amtrak has been an essential \npart of our transportation network. The railroad currently carries \nnearly 23 million passengers each year including over 1.7 million \ntravelers in Maryland who rely on Amtrak for commuting to work and \nother transportation needs. Amtrak operates 87 trains daily in Maryland \nalone. And these figures do not include the MARC trains or the 1.9 \nmillion passengers annually who use the MARC/Amtrak lines for service.\n  In recent years, we have made great strides toward improving our \nhighway, mass transit, and aviation systems. In 1998, we enacted TEA-\n21, providing record levels of funding for highway and mass transit \nimprovements throughout the country. In 2000, we enacted AIR-21, \nsubstantially increasing funds for needed airport infrastructure. To \nensure a transportation system that is truly intermodal, we need to \ncontinue to invest in Amtrak, doing for inter-city rail what we have \nalready done for highways, transit, and aviation. The level of \ngovernment support for passenger rail in Japan and European countries \nfar exceeds the level of government support in the United States. In my \nview, we cannot afford to be the only industrialized country without a \ncomprehensive national passenger rail system.\n  Across the Nation, congestion and gridlock are taking their toll in \nterms of economic loss, environmental impacts, and personal \nfrustration. According to the Texas Transportation Institute's Annual \nMobility Report, in 1997, Americans in 68 urban areas spent 4.3 billion \nhours stuck in traffic, with an estimated cost to the Nation of $72 \nbillion in lost time and wasted fuel. It is clear that highway and \nairport expansion cannot be our only solution. We need a balanced \napproach, and passenger rail must be a part of that approach. Without \nthe additional funds provided by Senator Murray's amendment, Amtrak \ncannot continue to operate.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Murray to restore funding for Amtrak for the \nremainder of this fiscal year.\n  The underlying amendment before the Senate includes a $374 million \ncut in Amtrak relative to the level approved on a bipartisan basis by \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee last year, and relative to the \nlevel requested by Amtrak. Amtrak tells us that if this cut remains in \nplace, Amtrak would have to shut down as early as March.\n  This amendment would restore Amtrak funding to $1.2 billion, the \nlevel it needs, and the level that originally was approved by the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  It is absolutely critical that we approve this amendment, and save \nAmtrak from bankruptcy. I am sure I don't need to remind my colleagues \nhow important it was to have a national intercity rail system in the \nimmediate aftermath of September 11th. On that terrible day, our \ncommercial aviation system was shut down, stranding thousands of \ntravelers. Meanwhile, Amtrak ridership surged, as thousands of people \ntook Amtrak to get home to their loved ones. It has been clear from \nthat day that we can never afford to let this vital lifeline be shut \ndown.\n  A shutdown of Amtrak would have an especially devastating effect on \ncommuters in my State of New Jersey; that is because Amtrak owns the \nNortheast Corridor, upon which many trains of New Jersey Transit also \ndepend. So an Amtrak shutdown would not only inconvenience the many New \nJerseyans who depend on Amtrak directly, but it would force more than\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\n80,000 riders of New Jersey Transit to find another way to work. The \nend result clearly would be a disaster for New Jersey.\n  Amtrak badly needs a guarantee of the financial assistance that will \nallow it to survive. Senator Murray's amendment would help ensure \nAmtrak's operations for the remainder of the fiscal year. We should \napprove it today. And then, before too long, we should take up and pass \nthe National Defense Rail Act of 2003. That bill would authorize $35 \nbillion to maintain and further develop our passenger rail system. It \nalso would provide more than $800 million for vital safety improvements \nto the tunnels under the Hudson River that connect New Jersey with New \nYork City. These tunnels are used on a daily basis by over 300,000 New \nJerseyans. I was proud to get $100 million to begin work on these \ntunnels in the supplemental defense appropriations bill signed by the \nPresident last year. But we need to do more.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support the Murray Amendment. \nIt is absolutely critical that Amtrak remains a safe and viable \ntransportation alternative in the 21st century. And only by adopting \nthis amendment can we make that happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if the Senator wants me to, I yield back \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to say at this late time \nof the night, that President Lincoln offered a bonus of $1 million and \nevery odd section along the railroad right of way to anyone who \ncompleted the transcontinental railroad. Subsidies to railroads are 150 \nyears old.\n  But the problem is that was not a taxpayer burden. I think we have to \nreally examine this and find out what is the taxpayer burden for the \nfuture as far as Amtrak.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and I urge the adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 30.\n  The amendment (No. 30) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the next order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 60 minutes \non the Harkin amendment. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 32\n\n  (Purpose: To restore funding for nondiscretionary Byrne grants to a \n                         level of $500,000,000)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Nelson of \n     Florida, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 32.\n       On page 101, line 1, strike ``$134,700,000'' and insert \n     ``$634,700,000''.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment which I \nsend to the desk on behalf of myself and Senators Feinstein, Biden, \nLeahy, Murray, Rockefeller, Johnson, Nelson of Florida, Kohl, and \nLautenberg.\n  This amendment will restore the funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial \nGrant Program at the fiscal year 2002 level. The bill before us \nvirtually eliminates this grant program which provides a critical \nresource directly toward our State and local law enforcement \ncommunities.\n  The bottom line is if you eliminate the Byrne grant program, you \neliminate most of the local counterdrug task forces in rural America. \nOur amendment would restore those cuts to fully fund Byrne at $500 \nmillion at the fiscal year 2002 level.\n  I am sure every Senator on this floor on both sides of the aisle has \non more than one occasion talked to their local police departments, \ntheir State sheriffs, or narcotics enforcement agencies in their States \nabout the vital necessity of having this Byrne grant program for local \nlaw enforcement to battle drugs throughout this country.\n  To give you an example of how critically needed this funding is, in \nmy State of Iowa, 25 of the multicounty task forces are funded through \nthe Byrne grant program. Without the Byrne grant, those task forces are \ngone. Iowa receives about $5.4 million a year from Byrne. Believe me, \nwe use every cent of it well and wisely.\n  It is a formula grant program that goes out to States, and basically \nit is based on population. As I said, Iowa gets about $5.5 million, \nTexas gets about $32 million, Alaska gets $2.1 million, Massachusetts \ngets $11.5 million, and California gets $50.9 million, and on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the State-by-State breakdown of the \namount of money for the Byrne grant program listed by State as of \nJanuary 14 of last year be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n         FY 2002 Byrne Formula Grant Program--State Allocations\n\n\n        State                                                    Amount\nAlabama......................................................$7,763,473\nAlaska........................................................2,158,472\nArizona.......................................................8,766,474\nArkansas......................................................5,670,673\nCalifornia...................................................50,933,474\nColorado......................................................7,549,473\nConnecticut...................................................6,235,473\nDelaware......................................................2,388,472\nDistrict of Columbia..........................................2,078,472\nFlorida......................................................24,687,474\nGeorgia......................................................13,249,474\nHawaii........................................................3,016,472\nIdaho.........................................................3,137,473\nIllinois.....................................................19,460,474\nIndiana......................................................10,160,474\nIowa..........................................................5,532,473\nKansas........................................................5,183,473\nKentucky......................................................7,169,373\nLouisiana.....................................................7,795,473\nMaine.........................................................3,109,473\nMaryland......................................................9,009,474\nMassachusetts................................................11,591,053\nMichigan.....................................................15,820,474\nMinnesota.....................................................8,456,474\nMississippi...................................................5,412,473\nMissouri......................................................9,448,474\nMontana.......................................................2,562,472\nNebraska......................................................3,749,473\nNevada........................................................4,170,473\nNew Hampshire.................................................3,052,472\nNew Jersey...................................................13,584,474\nNew Mexico....................................................3,907,473\nNew York.....................................................29,080,474\nNorth Carolina...............................................13,048,474\nNorth Dakota..................................................2,181,472\nOhio.........................................................17,895,474\nOklahoma......................................................6,301,473\nOregon........................................................6,258,473\nPennsylvania.................................................19,257,474\nRhode Island..................................................2,777,472\nSouth Carolina................................................7,125,473\nSouth Dakota..................................................2,346,472\nTennessee.....................................................9,586,474\nTexas........................................................31,831,474\nUtah..........................................................4,515,473\nVermont.......................................................2,344,472\nVirginia.....................................................11,624,474\nWashington....................................................9,886,474\nWest Virginia.................................................3,892,473\nWisconsin.....................................................9,108,474\nWyoming.......................................................1,963,472\nPuerto Rico...................................................6,826,473\nVirgin Islands................................................1,398,472\nGuam..........................................................1,443,752\nAmerican Samoa..................................................953,222\nNo. Mariana.....................................................470,076\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Byrne program is one of the most \nsuccessful Federal anticrime programs ever. It pays for drug \nenforcement task forces, more cops on the street, improved technology, \nand countless other valuable antidrug and anticrime efforts in local \ncommunities. Restoring the Byrne funds is a top priority of law \nenforcement groups who know the impact the program has had on crime and \ndrugs.\n  The National Association of Police Organizations, the National \nSheriffs Association, and the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice have contacted me urging full funding of this program.\n  For example, Iowa and the Midwest have made great strides in reducing \nmethamphetamine production and supply over the last few years. These \ncuts will only set them back in their uphill battle. Without Byrne, \nmost of the small agencies in that region would lack the manpower, \nfunding, and technology necessary to combat this methamphetamine \nproblem.\n\n[[Page S1060]]\n\n  I have heard this story over and over again from my contacts in Iowa. \nThese drug task forces are funded primarily by the Byrne grant, and \nthey are desperately needed to fight our State's uphill battle against \nmethamphetamine. I know that is the case in States across the country.\n  I also want to make one more point. At this crucial time in our \nhistory, we cannot afford to reduce the effectiveness of our Nation's \nState and local law enforcement agencies. It makes no sense to cut this \nsuccessful program that directly benefits our local communities.\n  Today, I received various letters from various organizations I just \nmentioned in support of putting the funding back in for the Byrne \nprogram.\n  I have a letter dated today from the National Association of Police \nOrganizations.\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin:\n       On behalf of the National Association of Police \n     Organizations representing 220,000 rank-and-file police \n     officers from across the United States, I would like to bring \n     to your attention our wholehearted support for your amendment \n     to the Omnibus Appropriations bill currently before the \n     Senate.\n       Under the proposed Omnibus bill, funding of the Byrne Grant \n     Program would be virtually eliminated. In a time when our \n     country is focused on the varied aspects of homeland \n     security, the loss of a key source of Federal funding to \n     State and local law enforcement initiatives would be \n     unacceptable. Your amendment will rightly restore to Fiscal \n     Year 2002 levels this necessary funding.\n       NAPO is proud to stand in support of your efforts and we \n     thank you for your hard work on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  I have another letter from the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice:\n\n       I am writing to express our strong support for your efforts \n     to ensure that the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Program is \n     fully funded in FY 2003. As you know, the IACP is the world's \n     oldest and largest association of police executives \n     representing more than 19,000 members in over 90 countries.\n       Since its inception, the Byrne Grant Program has proven \n     itself an invaluable resource for cooperative Federal, State, \n     and local anti-crime policing strategies, such as multi-\n     jurisdictional drug task forces and DARE training. In \n     addition, the close working relationship--\n\n  I want to make this point very clear--\n\n     between law enforcement agencies that is fostered by the \n     Byrne program is invaluable in law enforcement's efforts to \n     secure our communities and to combat terrorism.\n\n  That letter is signed by Joseph Samuels, president of the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  Now I have a letter here from the National Governors Association to \nboth Senator Frist, the majority leader, and Senator Daschle, the \nminority leader. Basically, they say they would like to express their \nsupport for the following amendments. They mention the Harkin \namendment. The Governors urge support for restoring current funding \nlevels to the Edward Byrne block grant program for State and local law \nenforcement activities.\n  It is signed by Gov. Paul Patton and Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, vice \nchairman, Governor Kempthorne having been a member of this Senate just \na few years ago.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                             Chiefs of Police,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am writing to \n     express our strong support for your efforts to ensure that \n     the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Program is fully funded in FY \n     2003. As you know, the IACP is the world's oldest and largest \n     association of police executives, representing more than \n     19,000 members in over 90 countries.\n       Since its inception, the Byrne Grant Program has proven \n     itself an invaluable resource for cooperative federal, state \n     and local anti-crime policing strategies, such as \n     multijurisdictional drug task forces and DARE training. In \n     addition, the close working relationship between law \n     enforcement agencies that is fostered by the Byrne program is \n     invaluable in law enforcement's efforts to secure our \n     communities and combat terrorism.\n       The IACP believes that at this crucial time in our history, \n     we cannot afford to reduce the effectiveness of our nation's \n     state and local law enforcement agencies. Over the last \n     decade, the funds provided by the Byrne Grant program have \n     dramatically increased the capabilities and effectiveness of \n     these agencies. It is imperative that departments continue to \n     receive this assistance. We have entered a new era for law \n     enforcement; we are faced with new and daunting challenges; \n     we are asking more of our officers; and our communities are \n     turning to us for protection. Only with federal assistance \n     funds that are specifically targeted for law enforcement and \n     its unique role can we hope to successfully meet this \n     challenge.\n       Once again, the IACP strongly urges Congress to maintain \n     current funding levels for the Byrne Memorial grant program.\n       Thank you for your assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Joseph Samuels, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Daschle: On behalf of the \n     nation's Governors, we are writing to express our support for \n     several key provisions of the (FY) 2003 omnibus \n     appropriations bill affecting state programs. First, we \n     appreciate that the bill would maintain the FY 2003 highway \n     program investment level at $31.8 billion. With a sluggish \n     economy and many states facing budgetary difficulties, now is \n     not the time to cut federal highway investment. In addition, \n     Governors strongly support the $1.5 billion provided in the \n     bill to implement the new election reform law. We also \n     appreciate that the bill includes an extension of the \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant \n     and related programs through September 30, 3002. It is \n     critical that states have reliability of funds in order to \n     continue operating their welfare reform programs while \n     Congress considers TANF reauthorization.\n       We would also like to express our support for the following \n     amendments:\n       Dodd amendment. The Governors support Senator Dodd's \n     amendment calling for a $1.5 billion increase in state grants \n     for special education. We are committed to continuously \n     improving the academic performance of all students, including \n     students with disabilities. The nation's Governors support \n     this amendment and urge Congress to continue to work toward \n     enacting legislation that makes the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding a mandatory \n     expenditure with incremental increases towards meeting the 40 \n     percent federal requirement;\n       Murray amendment. The Governors support providing the \n     necessary funding for Amtrak to support the continuation of a \n     national passenger rail system as proposed by Senator Murray. \n     Amtrak must be provided a sufficient level of funding to \n     guarantee there will be no break or threat of a break in \n     service. We must be certain that Amtrak will not encounter \n     the rolling financial crises it experienced during the past \n     year;\n       Chafee-Rockefeller amendment. The nation's Governors urge \n     your support for quick action on a bipartisan compromise to \n     protect resources in the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (S-CHIP). Preserving the S-CHIP funds that have \n     reverted to the federal treasury would keep $1.2 billion of \n     the FY 1998 and FY 1999 allocations within the program until \n     2004; and\n       Harkin amendment. The Governors urge support for restoring \n     current funding levels to the Edward Byrne block grant \n     program for state and local law enforcement activities.\n       Finally, while Governors appreciate the inclusion of $2 \n     billion for first responder grants, we urge support for the \n     President's original request of providing $3.5 billion \n     coordinated through the states. Just as Congress and the \n     President have responded by acting on a far-reaching \n     reorganization and consolidation of federal agencies, so too \n     the President recognized the critical role of states--the \n     first line of defense and the first line of coordination of \n     response to any attack. Thus, this should be meaningful, new \n     resources that respect the diversity, responsibilities, and \n     capabilities of states and the immediate need for resources \n     for national defense. Therefore, we encourage you to add an \n     additional $1.5 billion in first responder grant funds to the \n     $2 billion, so that we meet the President's recognition of \n     the need to be prepared to respond to and recover from any \n     terrorist attacks.\n       We greatly appreciate your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Paul E. Patton,\n       Chairman.\n     Governor Dirk Kempthorne,\n       Vice Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    Police Organizations, Inc.\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Police Organizations\n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\n     (NAPO), representing 220,000 rank-and-file police officers \n     from across the United States, I would like to bring to your \n     attention our wholehearted support for your amendment to the \n     Omnibus Appropriations bill, currently before the Senate.\n       Under the proposed Omnibus bill, funding of the Byrne Grant \n     program would be virtually eliminated. In a time when our \n     country is focused on the varied aspects of homeland \n     security, the loss of a key source of federal funding to \n     state and local law enforcement initiatives would be \n     unacceptable. Your amendment will rightly restore to Fiscal \n     Year 2002 levels, this necessary funding.\n       NAPO is proud to stand in support of your efforts and we \n     thank you for your hard work on this important funding issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Byrne grant program has been a great \nsuccess in rural America. In Iowa, in 2000, we found over 641 \nmethamphetamine laboratories. In 2002, we found over 800. Without the \n25 task forces that I talked about, these laboratories wouldn't be \nfound by law enforcement. But they could have been found by children \nplaying in rural areas around abandoned sheds, barns, and farms.\n  Again, that is the Byrne Grant Program that does this. It goes to the \nStates. It is for law enforcement and also for prevention activities.\n  This program was started under President Reagan, named for Edward \nByrne, who was a police officer, I am told, in New York City, who was \ngunned down and killed while he was actively pursuing drug traffickers \nin the city of New York.\n  At a time when our States are having serious budget problems, at a \ntime when we are making great inroads and strides in the fight against \nespecially methamphetamine, at a time when we need our local law \nenforcement agencies--the sheriffs, the police departments, our DEAs, \nour narcotics law enforcement officers--we need them all working \ntogether, both for combating the scourge of drugs but also, as was \nmentioned in the letter, I believe, from the Police Chiefs Association, \nfor making our communities safe from the threats of terrorism. And to \ncombat terrorism we need coordination and communication among small \ntowns and communities in rural areas. It is vital for tracking and for \nsurveillance.\n  I find it kind of odd that our national drug czar, Mr. John Walters, \nwith Federal money, with taxpayer money, is running ads all over \nAmerica--and those ads are tying drug traffickers and the drug trade to \nthe funneling of money to terrorists; making the point, in these ads, \nthat we have to go after the drug traffickers to keep them from \nfunneling money to terrorists--I find it odd they are running those ads \nand, at the same time, the omnibus bill before us would cut out all \nfunding for the Byrne program, which is the basic funding for local law \nenforcement for combating drug trafficking.\n  I have made this a battle of mine now for going on almost 10 years, \nto make sure we fund the Byrne Grant Program, and, I might add, both \nthrough Democratic administrations and Republican administrations.\n  As I have traveled around the country, I have found local law \nenforcement so grateful for the fact that they are able to get this \nmoney. And it goes down without strings attached. It is not a mandate. \nWhat they have used that money for, as I said, is to combat drug \ntrafficking, with coordination, surveillance, and now for \ncounterterrorism activities.\n  It has been a long battle. We have been successful in keeping the \nfunding up on both sides of the aisle. I might say, this has not been a \npartisan battle at all. We have had great support from both sides of \nthe aisle in continuing the Byrne Grant Program. I am hopeful we will \nfind that same kind of support now. As I said, it is $500 million to \nput back in, just to get it up to the fiscal year 2002 level. At least \nif we have that, we can continue the program. So I hope we will have a \nsuccessful vote on both sides of the aisle.\n  I might just add that if we are not successful on this amendment, it \nwill not go away. I will be back again and again and again because I am \nnot going to let this issue drop. It is too important in a matter of \nminutes, or in a late evening or 1-day rush to judgment on an \nappropriations bill, to just throw out. It is one of the most important \nlaw enforcement programs we have had over the last nearly 20 years in \nthis country.\n  So, again, I guess the vote will be in the morning at 9:30. I will \nsum up my arguments again at that time. But I am hopeful we can have a \ngood, strong vote to reassure our local law enforcement officials \naround the United States that the Senate stands behind them, that we \nare not going to pull the rug out from underneath them, and we are \ngoing to make sure the Byrne Grant Program is fully funded.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. If anybody wants \nto engage in a colloquy or debate, I am prepared to do so. If not, I \nwill yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, does the Senator wish to have any further \ncomments tonight? It would be my intention to yield back the time on \nour side because there is a 2\\1/2\\-minute comment period in the morning \nwhen we take up this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator yield back the remainder of his time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork is to be recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 31\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 31.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 31.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funds for research and development grants to \n               increase security for United States ports)\n\n       On page 723, strike lines 16 through 23, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``$72,000,000, to remain available until expended, of which \n     $3,500,000 shall be derived from the Oil Spill Liability \n     Trust Fund: Provided, That there may be credited to and used \n     for the purposes of this appropriation funds received from \n     State and local governments, other public authorities, \n     private sources, and foreign countries, for expenses incurred \n     for research, development, testing, and evaluation: Provided, \n     further, That, of the total amount appropriated under this \n     paragraph, $50,000,000 shall be available for the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security to award grants to national \n     laboratories, private nonprofit organizations, institutions \n     of higher education, and other entities for the support of \n     research and development of technologies that can be used to \n     secure the ports of the United States: Provided, further, \n     That, the proceeds of grants made under the preceding proviso \n     may be used to develop technologies such as equipment that \n     accurately detects explosives or chemical and biological \n     agents that could be used to commit terrorist acts in the \n     United States, equipment that accurately detects nuclear \n     materials (including scintillation-based detection equipment \n     capable of attachment to spreaders to signal the presence of \n     nuclear materials during the unloading of containers), \n     improved tags and seals designed for use on shipping \n     containers to track the transportation of the merchandise in \n     such containers (including ``smart sensors'' that are able to \n     track a container throughout its entire supply chain, detect \n     hazardous and radioactive materials within that container, \n     and transmit such information to the appropriate authorities \n     at a remote location), and tools to mitigate the consequences \n     of a terrorist act at a port of the United States (including \n     a network of sensors to predict the dispersion of \n     radiological, chemical, or biological agents that might be \n     intentionally or accidentally released): Provided, further, \n     That the proceeds of grants made under such preceding proviso \n     may also be used to develop pilot projects that could be \n     implemented within 12 months at the Port of New York and New \n     Jersey, the port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, \n     and the port of Virginia to demonstrate the effectiveness of \n     a system of radiation detection monitors located throughout \n     the port to detect nuclear or radiological material: \n     Provided, further, That each entity desiring a grant under \n     such preceding proviso shall submit an application to the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security at such time, in such manner, \n     and accompanied by such information as the Secretary may \n     reasonably require.''.\n\n                     Amendment No. 31, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, I have not seen the \namendment yet.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe the majority was given a copy of the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It may have gone to the leader, but I didn't get it.\n\n[[Page S1062]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The only change I am changing, I inform my friend from \nAlaska, is on the second page where it says ``$50 million,'' it should \nsay ``$150 million.''\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object again, \nwouldn't it be necessary to amend this amendment in more than one place \nin order to accommodate that change?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe it would, yes. I believe it would.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding it would have to insert a figure \n``1'' before the ``7'' in the third line.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from Alaska is correct. That is in the \nmodified amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As I understand it, that was a mistake in drafting the \namendment. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 723, strike lines 16 through 23, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``$172,000,000, to remain available until expended, of which \n     $3,500,000 shall be derived from the Oil Spill Liability \n     Trust Fund: Provided, That there may be credited to and used \n     for the purposes of this appropriation funds received from \n     State and local governments, other public authorities, \n     private sources, and foreign countries, for expenses incurred \n     for research, development, testing, and evaluation: Provided, \n     further, That, of the total amount appropriated under this \n     paragraph, $150,000,000 shall be available for the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security to award grants to national \n     laboratories, private nonprofit organizations, institutions \n     of higher education, and other entities for the support of \n     research and development of technologies that can be used to \n     secure the ports of the United States: Provided, further, \n     That, the proceeds of grants made under the preceding proviso \n     may be used to develop technologies such as equipment that \n     accurately detects explosives or chemical and biological \n     agents that could be used to commit terrorist acts in the \n     United States, equipment that accurately detects nuclear \n     materials (including scintillation-based detection equipment \n     capable of attachment to spreaders to signal the presence of \n     nuclear materials during the unloading of containers), \n     improved tags and seals designed for use on shipping \n     containers to track the transportation of the merchandise in \n     such containers (including ``smart sensors'' that are able to \n     track a container throughout its entire supply chain, detect \n     hazardous and radioactive materials within that container, \n     and transmit such information to the appropriate authorities \n     at a remote location), and tools to mitigate the consequences \n     of a terrorist act at a port of the United States (including \n     a network of sensors to predict the dispersion of \n     radiological, chemical, or biological agents that might be \n     intentionally or accidentally released): Provided, further, \n     That the proceeds of grants made under such preceding proviso \n     may also be used to develop pilot projects that could be \n     implemented within 12 months at the Port of New York and New \n     Jersey, the port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, \n     and the port of Virginia to demonstrate the effectiveness of \n     a system of radiation detection monitors located throughout \n     the port to detect nuclear or radiological material: \n     Provided, further, That each entity desiring a grant under \n     such preceding proviso shall submit an application to the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security at such time, in such manner, \n     and accompanied by such information as the Secretary may \n     reasonably require.''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Alaska. I will try to be brief \non this amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment deals with port security, particularly \nport security research and development. And it increases the funding by \n$150 million. I believe this is a bare minimum of what we should be \npassing. First, let me make a point that we have lax security at our \nports. And that has created a terrorist threat that jeopardizes not \nonly the ports themselves but cities near the ports and any city in \nAmerica because so much can be brought in through the ports and then be \ntrucked elsewhere and cause untold damage.\n  The statistics are chilling. Mr. President, 95 percent of U.S. \noverseas trade is conducted at our Nation's 361 ports. The Port of New \nYork and New Jersey, for my home State, in part, is the largest on the \neast coast. Yet in that port less than 3 percent of the total cargo is \nscanned or inspected. Despite the risk we face, despite the threat that \nhangs over our head, ports are receiving an extremely small amount of \nFederal funding--basically nothing. We need to do more.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues what the problem is.\n  What is the greatest danger that we could face here in America? It is \nvery simple. A terrorist group could--it could be a country; it could \nbe a group--smuggle a nuclear weapon into one of the large containers \nthat comes to our ports by the tens of thousands every month.\n  They can put that container on a ship. They can put the container on \na truck as it drives over the Canadian and Mexican borders. If that \nnuclear weapon is successfully smuggled into this  country  and  \ndetonated,  as  bad  as 9/11 was, the damage would be much worse.\n  Right now we have no way to check whether such a nuclear weapon could \nbe smuggled into our country. I have been worried about this. So I did \nsome research. Here is what I found. I talked to scientists at \nBrookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island and at Argonne National \nLaboratory in Illinois. Those are two energy labs that don't produce \nweapons. I asked: What can we do to prevent a nuclear weapon from being \nsmuggled into our ports?\n  They said: There is good news and bad news. The good news is that \nevery radioactive device emits gamma rays which can pass through \nanything except lead and tungsten and some very thick metals. The bad \nnews is, the only way to detect these devices right now in a practical \nway is a Geiger counter, and it has to be held about 3 feet in front of \nthe nuclear source of the radioactive device.\n  You can't go on every container, each of which contains scores of \nthese crates, put a Geiger counter by each one, and hope that you could \ndetect any nuclear weapon that might be smuggled in because that would \nbring commerce to a standstill. They said: However, in that cyclotron \nin their laboratories, the scientists can detect radiation 50, 60, 70, \n80 feet away, but the devices that detect nuclear radiation are big and \ndelicate. They can't be bounced around.\n  The main purpose of this proposal is to make those devices practical, \nto make them smaller and more robust, and then they could be put on \nevery crane that loads or unloads containers of ships, on every toll \nbooth as the container goes through the toll booth, and any nuclear \nweapon smuggled into this country could be detected.\n  Our money here is for research and development. Such a device could \nprobably be developed within a short period of time, as little as a \nyear or two. And I find it totally anomalous that we are willing to go \nto war in Iraq, a war in which I have supported the President, to make \nsure they don't have nuclear weapons, when our whole foreign policy \nestablishment is focused on North Korea, but when it comes to detection \ndevices for al-Qaida or any other terrorist group that might smuggle \nthose weapons in, we say we don't have the dollars.\n  The amendment I originally offered was with my good friend, Senator \nWarner. We were able to get it in the homeland security bill, through \nthe support of former Senator Thompson, Senator Lieberman, as well as \nSenator Hollings and Senator McCain. When it came to the end of the \nday, we were told the administration wanted no spending in the homeland \nsecurity bill. So our amendment didn't have the dollars, although it \nwas authorized by Senator Hollings in the port security bill.\n  This is a relatively small amount of money that could save us from \nthe worst catastrophe possible. One hundred fifty million dollars to \ndevelop such detection devices that could prevent any nuclear weapon \nfrom being smuggled in through our ports is something every one of us \nshould support. Unfortunately, it is not in the bill. I understand \nthere are lots of needs. I am hoping that my colleague from Alaska \nwould examine this amendment and support it and accept it. The ports \neverywhere in America are vulnerable, and this is not just money at a \nrandom purpose. It is not pork. It is designed simply to deal with \nnuclear weapons that might be smuggled into our country.\n\n  We can't do it unless we have such devices. We are not going to be \nable to stop each container and inspect each one. As I said, we inspect \n3 percent. Just as we can have X-ray machines at our airports that can \ndetect explosives, we can have such devices at our ports and at our \nborder crossings that detect an even worse danger--nuclear weapons.\n\n[[Page S1063]]\n\n  In the Hollings port security bill, there was authorizing language. \nSo this appropriation is authorized. It is, again, a small amount of \nmoney that would stop a nuclear weapon from being smuggled into this \ncountry. The shame of it is, this is not a very difficult thing to do. \nThe science is there. The experts say we can create such a device. The \ndanger is enormous. I don't know a single argument against doing this.\n  As I say, it is a bipartisan proposal. The original bill was by \nSenator Warner and myself. It was supported by both Democratic and \nRepublican members of the Homeland Security Committee, but because the \nadministration didn't want any spending in the homeland security bill, \nwe are here.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will look at this amendment and \nsupport it because the safety of our country depends on it. If a \nnuclear weapon were smuggled in a container, put on a truck and \nexploded, whether it be in New York or Los Angeles or Chicago or St. \nLouis or any inland city because they can be put on that truck and \ndriven there, we would rue the day we didn't develop such detection \ndevices. The terrorists know our weaknesses. They know we have done a \npretty good job on airport security. They know our ports are wide open. \nIf they should get hold of a nuclear device right now, we would be \nnaked to them. We can stop that. But we can stop it in a year or two \nfor a small amount of money.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  With that, I don't know if my colleague has any questions or any \ncomments, but I don't have anything more to say. I will only yield any \ntime I might need to answer any of his questions or respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the hour is late, but we have in the \namendment that contains the 11 bills a total of $24.7 billion for \nhomeland security. That is better than $3 billion a month to be spent \nfor homeland security.\n  There is nothing that prevents the homeland security agencies from \npursuing this task that the Senator's amendment would fund. What this \ndoes, however, is add another $150 million to the total of this bill \nand makes it subject to a veto by the President. We have no more room \nfor amendments. We have just used up the balance of the offset that we \nhad available.\n  This amendment, as worthy as it may seem, in my judgment is \nunnecessary because there is plenty of money in this bill. There is an \noverwhelming amount of money. I really stake my reputation on the fact \nthat some of that money will carry over to the next fiscal year. It \njust cannot be spent as fast as people want to spend it.\n  The $20 billion we put up for New York in 2001 has not been spent \nyet. The $20 billion we gave to the President of the United States to \npursue al-Qaida and to prepare our homeland security defenses has not \ntotally been spent yet. Why should we continue adding amounts to this \nbill because people want to assure that their project is going to be \nbuilt before the homeland security agency is even established?\n  I don't want to debate at length here. I do believe it is a matter of \ndiscipline. We do not have a budget resolution. If we had a budget \nresolution, this would be subject to a point of order. But each one of \nthese amendments that is going to come at us now is going to add a \nlittle bit more.\n  This subject was covered in the Byrd amendment which we defeated. \nSenator Byrd wanted to add more money to the $24.7 billion. One of them \nwas this port security project. Now we have this little amendment \ncoming in, $150 million. It has been here too long. One hundred fifty \nmillion dollars is a lot of money, and to add it to this bill is going \nto make it subject to a veto. Tomorrow morning, I shall oppose this \namendment and show that this amount was in the Byrd amendments--both of \nthem--which have been defeated. This is part of it.\n\n  I predict, if this one is passed, we are going to see 50 small \namendments and we will have put the $5 billion back in the bill. So I \nam not prepared to do that. Maybe the Senate is willing to do that. I \ntold somebody else that it is hard for a person to eat a pound of \ncheese unless he takes it a half ounce at a time. That is what we are \ngoing to be looking at--50 amendments to put $5 billion back into this \nbill and make it subject to a veto. Now I am not going to permit that \nwithout a fight.\n  We have reserved the right to table, and I shall make a motion to \ntable this at the appropriate time tomorrow because it is the same \nsubject once again.\n  The money is there. We just don't need redundant money. We do not \nneed redundant money for homeland security. It forces us to go into a \nconcept of how big the deficit is and yet we won't spend the money.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I understand this is a large bill. I just ask my \ncolleague, from what section of the bill could this be funded?\n  Mr. STEVENS. In the homeland security portions of the bill we have \n$24.7 billion, and it is subject to immense discretion as to how the \nmoney is spread. It is spread throughout the bill--$24.7 billion--for \nhomeland security.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might, I understand there is a lot of money for \nhomeland security, and I understand there are huge needs. I appreciate \nthat my colleague said this is an important subject and probably needs \nto be done, but he has been around here much longer than I have. I have \nbeen in the House 18 years and now in the Senate 4. But in my \nexperience, something like this that has no lobby behind it, has no \ninterest pushing for it, no State or city is going to lobby, no group \nis going to lobby, no company is going to lobby, no union is going to \nlobby--in my experience, unless you earmark a certain amount of money--\nand I am not out to increase the budget. If my friend from Alaska would \nbe willing to take a part of that $24 billion and earmark $150 million \nfor this subject, I would be happy to withdraw the amendment. I don't \nwant to increase the budget.\n  My worry is, even though we say we have a lot of money in homeland \nsecurity, in the scheme of things, this may not be funded. I am \nobsessed with this issue. I think this is the greatest danger we can \nface in the country, and I am worried we will not do it. I would wait \nuntil tomorrow morning, but if the Senator could show me a way to take \nit out of some existing pool of money and earmark it so it would not be \ncaught in the political vicissitudes, I would support that. I don't \nwant to add any more money, but I know there is a huge pot of money, \nand this is out there. The odds are that it is not going to be funded, \nas important as it is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator makes a valid request. The staff with whom I \nhave to confer are gone now. We might pursue that. I will be pleased to \nreport to him in the morning precisely if we can do that.\n  I recall the subject, however, because this system has not been \ndeployed yet. If the Senator read his hometown paper the other day, \nthey have accused me of taking this money out, that it was never in \nspecifically. However, the money was in the bill to do it if the \nHomeland Security Department decided to do it. It may be possible for \nus to earmark a portion of that money to pursue the experiment that the \nSenator wishes. Whether we would earmark the money specifically for \nthese specific reports, again, I don't know.\n\n  The Senator's amendment would, in fact, deal with pilot projects for \nthe Port of New York and New Jersey, the Port of Los Angeles and Long \nBeach, and the Port of Virginia, and there is a ``may'' in there.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator would yield, I am not out to specifically \ndo it for any one port. I rather want the research done to develop the \ndevices. Once the devices were developed, we would have to deploy them \nat all our ports.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is the specific question I asked after I read the \narticle. I was told there is money to pursue the development and \ntesting of the system to which I believe you are referring.\n  Let us finish this tonight now, and I will report back to him before \nthe vote tomorrow as to whether or not it is possible to achieve the \nSenator's result without adopting this amendment. I agree. We have a \nlot of ports on the coast of Alaska. We have 25 percent of the domestic \noil coming out of those ports. So I understand port security. I\n\n[[Page S1064]]\n\nam willing to work with the Senator from New York on port security. It \nmay be possible to earmark money to see to it that this pilot project \nis pursued.\n  If the Senator wishes to respond, OK. Otherwise, I am prepared to \nyield back the remainder of my time tonight. We have 2 \\1/2\\ minutes on \neach side tomorrow. I hope we can reach a conclusion that we can adopt \nthe Senator's proposal.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S1064-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    HONORING DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to say a few words to commemorate \nthe life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King. Yesterday was Dr. King's \nbirthday, and on Monday we celebrate the National Holiday of Dr. King.\n  He had a dream: Equal opportunity for all Americans. That dream is \nunfulfilled today. In the 1960s, Dr. King spoke out against segregation \nand dehumanization. He stood up for workers' rights and voting rights. \nHe won a Nobel Prize.\n  I often think what Dr. King would call for today. He would say there \nis still injustice in America; there is still more work to be done. As \nwe look at what we need to do, we need to know that we need an \nindependent judiciary. In order to protect our civil rights, we need to \nmake sure we have judges who respect the 14th amendment and the civil \nrights laws. When someone walks in the courthouse door, they must be \nable to count on everyone being treated fairly. They must be able to \ntrust that the law on the books will be enforced and that their \nconstitutional rights will be respected. Let's make sure we have an \nindependent judiciary. America needs judges on the bench who will \nenforce the laws on the books, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights \nAct. Courtrooms across the country need to protect against redlining \nand discrimination. The courts must not undo, rewrite, or reinvent the \nspirit of our laws protecting America's civil rights.\n  Dr. King fought not only for equality under law but for economic \njustice. When he came for his famous Walk on Washington, it was about \njobs and freedom. In 1968, Dr. King marched with 1,300 sanitation \nworkers in Memphis. Let me tell you what he said that day on that \nmarch. He said he was fighting for decent wages, fair working \nconditions, livable housing. He said that old-age Social Security, \nhealth and welfare measures should be at the top of our national agenda \nand that education for the children and respect for the community \nshould be No. 1.\n  I say to my colleagues, if we choose to honor Dr. King, let's fight \nfor economic justice. I am so pleased we passed the unemployment \ninsurance. Now we need to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is \n$10,700 a year. That means a full-time job still leaves you in full-\ntime poverty. Let's keep the dream alive and raise the minimum wage.\n  The first civil rights battles were over education. At that time, \neducation was separate and unequal. Today, we are still fighting to \nmake sure our children go to good schools with properly trained \nteachers and up-to-date books and technology. We need to make sure we \nback our educational system. This can mean technology training at a \ncommunity college, Ph.D.s or MBAs, but at the same time, while we look \nat higher education, make sure we focus on that elementary and \nsecondary level. Let's leave no child behind but make sure no child is \nleft out of the budget.\n  Dr. King's legacy for America must be a living legacy. We in the \nSenate must continue to fight for the values Dr. King stood for and \nmake sure the American dream is a reality for others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S1064-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred March 25, \n2002 in Dubuque, IA. Elizabeth Tran was assaulted by Carla Kaufman, 17, \nwhile she was walking home from school. Without warning, Kaufman \nattacked the victim, beating her and using racial slurs associated with \nthe victim's Chinese heritage. The victim was treated in a local \nhospital following the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S1064-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WTO DECISION ON THE CDO ACT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, earlier today, a WTO appeals panel \n``ruled'' that the United States violated our WTO obligations with the \nenactment of the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset, CDO, Act, \ncommonly known as the Byrd amendment. This continues a longstanding \neffort by the WTO to systematically undermine U.S. laws that assist our \nbesieged manufacturing sector. The CDO ensures that the U.S. companies \nand their workers can compete against unfair imports from foreign \ncompanies who dump their products in the U.S. If a foreign company \ncontinues to dump its products in the U.S. after having been found \nguilty of that practice, the CDO allows that future penalty tariffs \npayments be made to the companies who are being injured. We would all \nprefer that companies halt their illegal dumping, but if a foreign \ncompetitor chooses to continue the predatory practices, then the \ntariffs assist the U.S. workers and industry to remain competitive.\n  The CDO provides that antidumping tariffs benefit the companies \ninjured from foreign dumping. Previously, this money went to the U.S. \nTreasury. Now the money assists the impacted companies to help them \nremain competitive. invest in new technologies and keep jobs in the \nU.S. In 2001, less than $230 million was paid out to 900 companies. In \nSeptember 2002, a WTO panel ruled that CDO placed the U.S. in violation \nof its obligations. Today, a WTO appellate upheld that decision. It is \nbecoming obvious that the WTO is intruding on U.S. sovereignty and has \nacted beyond the scope of its mandate in this case.

Mr. President, I would like to bring a recent article in \nthe Washington Post to the attention of our colleagues. Michael Kaiser, \nwho is the President of the Kennedy Center, has written a thoughtful \nand articulate article on the serious challenges facing the performing \narts in America.\n  Mr. Kaiser is an impressive leader for the Kennedy Center. In the 2 \nyears he has been its President, the Center has staged a broad range of \nprograms in dance, music and drama and has significantly expanded its \nefforts to reach out through the arts to improve the lives of all \nAmericans.\n  I commend all that Mr. Kaiser is doing so effectively, and I ask \nunanimous consent that his recent article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1065]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 9, 2002]\n\n                    How To Save the Performing Arts\n\n                         (By Michael M. Kaiser)\n\n       The world of the performing arts is sick and needs \n     attention. Several underlying problems currently affecting \n     the ecology of the arts were in evidence long before the \n     stock market collapse and Sept. 11, 2001. They need to be \n     addressed, not simply accepted as an unsolvable result of the \n     environment in which we live.\n       The arts world needs leadership. It needs concerted action. \n     And it needs them fast. There are five key issues that must \n     be addressed if we are to solve the problems arts \n     organizations face today.\n       1. Such organizations must once again be willing to develop \n     and implement large-scale, important projects that are risky \n     and emerging. The arts world used to produce numerous big, \n     daring projects each year; the construction of major arts, \n     facilities from Lincoln Center to the Kennedy Center, the \n     production of large-scale dramatic works, such as ``Nicholas \n     Nickleby,'' the mounting of new Ring Cycles, even by small \n     opera companies. It wasn't so long ago that Alvin Ailey or \n     George Balanchine would create four or five or even six new \n     works in a season. Now a choreographer is lucky to be able to \n     produce one major work a year.\n       We have been scared into thinking small. And small thinking \n     begets smaller revenue that begets even smaller institutions \n     and reduced public excitement and involvement. No wonder so \n     many arts organizations are announcing record deficits.\n       The Sondheim Celebration we mounted this summer at the \n     Kennedy Center is one example of the kind of project I am \n     hoping to see duplicated by others. We took a large but \n     measured risk, and it paid off handsomely. The level of press \n     coverage was phenomenal. The way the Kennedy Center is \n     perceived has changed dramatically. We will never be the same \n     institution again. We must all be thinking large and \n     creatively at this time. That is what the arts are about.\n       2. If arts organizations, large and small, are going to \n     take risks on meaningful projects and maximize their impact, \n     they need entrepreneurial management better suited to the \n     current climate in which they operate. Hundreds of millions \n     of dollars are spent throughout the world each year training \n     young performers, but only a small fraction of that amount is \n     devoted to training the people who will employ and market \n     these performers. While several universities mount arts \n     management programs, they are not sufficient to fill all our \n     needs. There is no shortage of great artists in this world, \n     but there is a shortage of trained, skilled managers.\n       We are operating in a highly challenging environment, and \n     only the most sophisticated managers will be able to acquire \n     the support needed to help their organizations thrive. I hope \n     serious arts funders will begin to pay far more attention to \n     this need; otherwise, we will see a serious decline in arts \n     institutions throughout the world.\n       3. As we train arts managers, we must actively focus on the \n     needs of all kinds of arts organizations.\n       The arts world is moving close to becoming a virtual cartel \n     of a few large mainstream organizations that survive and \n     thrive. This would be catastrophic. A healthy arts ecology \n     demands that we have large and small organizations, \n     mainstream and edgy, and of all ethnic backgrounds. The \n     theater world, for example, has lost many of its minority \n     organizations in the past few years. Those that remain are \n     terribly small compared with their white counterparts.\n       We who run large arts organizations have become so scared \n     about keeping our organizations solvent that we have \n     forgotten we will have a healthy arts environment only if we \n     support the smaller and diverse organizations that create \n     great works, great artists and new audiences. The tradition \n     that created the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Ballet \n     Hispanico and the now-defunct Crossroads Theater is close to \n     evaporating.\n       4. The need for diversity in performers and performing \n     institutions is equally strong with respect to audiences. \n     Alvin Ailey said that ``dance is for everyone.'' I know he \n     meant that ``art is for everyone.'' We are heading toward a \n     world where only white, upper-middle-class people come to the \n     theater, because only white, upper-middle-class children are \n     being exposed to the theater. Public school arts education is \n     virtually dead, not just in the United States but in most \n     countries.\n       The Kennedy Center, like most arts organizations, has \n     jumped into the breach. We spend $15 million each year on \n     arts education, working actively with 5 million children \n     around the United States. But our efforts are not coordinated \n     with those of other arts organizations, and the arts exposure \n     enjoyed by virtually every child is episodic. For some \n     children in some schools, the exposure is tremendous; other \n     children may get no arts programming for years. We owe every \n     child in this nation a chance to experience the joy of self-\n     expression, the power of discipline and the self-fulfillment \n     of achievement that come from the performing arts.\n       5. Finally, we must address the need to record the \n     performances of merit that are mounted each day of the year.\n       The collapse of the recording industry, the lack of \n     resources available to public broadcasting to record \n     performances and the prohibitive costs of producing \n     recordings and videos mean that it is easier to obtain a \n     recording of Enrico Caruso than of most great opera singers \n     today. We need the support of PBS, the unions and all artists \n     to ensure that an entire generation of performances is not \n     lost.\n       This is critical if we are to create the history of \n     performance and creativity that inspires future generations \n     and that allows for performances enjoyed by a few to be \n     available to many. The Kennedy Center broadcasts on the \n     Internet the daily free concerts we give on our Millennium \n     Stage. But so many more performances in our halls and in \n     theaters around the world go unrecorded.\n       If we can take all these necessary steps, we will create an \n     arts ecology that can withstand the horrors of terrorism, \n     economic decline and social unrest. If we don't, even a \n     healthy economic and social climate will not save us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S1065-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ELMO JOHNSON\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, it is my honor to rise today in \nrecognition of an outstanding World War II veteran from Wisconsin, Mr. \nElmo Johnson. Originally from Black River Falls, Mr. Johnson joined the \nArmy in 1945 and was stationed near Guam at Saipan. A trumpet player \nsince the age of 11, he played for the troops as part of the 285th AGF \nBand Unit. Mr. Johnson also organized a band called Swingmasters which \nperformed at local Saipan clubs.\n  Later in his career, while stationed at Iwogima, Japan, he started to \nplay Taps for his unit. Ever since returning from World War II, Mr. \nJohnson has volunteered to play Taps at funerals for other Wisconsin \nveterans. He has been a member of the Black River Falls Miles-Hagen \nAmerican Legion Post for over 50 years, and was named commander in \n1946. Mr. Johnson has played Taps over 950 times, and I praise his goal \nof 1,000 farewells. His band, renamed ``Elmo Johnson and the Johnny \nBrass Band,'' performs extensively throughout Western Wisconsin.\n  I would like to acknowledge the contributions Mr. Elmo Johnson and \nother brave veterans have made to the State of Wisconsin. We honor Mr. \nJohnson as he continues to demonstrate his generous spirit by sharing \nhis musical gift around the State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S1065-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S1065-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S1065-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1065-S1068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n       EC-392.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 161\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Protection from \n     Violent Programming Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences children's perception of the \n     values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) uniquely pervasive presences in the lives of all \n     American children; and\n       (B) readily accessible to all American children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (5) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming have a greater tendency to assume \n     that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and therefore \n     to imitate such behavior.\n       (6) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming have an increased fear of becoming \n     a victim of violence, resulting in increased self-protective \n     behaviors and increased mistrust of others.\n       (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (9) A significant amount of violent programming that is \n     readily accessible to minors remains unrated specifically for \n     violence and therefore cannot be blocked solely on the basis \n     of its violent content.\n       (10) Age-based ratings that do not include content rating \n     for violence do not allow parents to block programming based \n     solely on violent content thereby rendering ineffective any \n     technology-based blocking mechanism designed to limit violent \n     video programming.\n       (11) The most recent study of the television ratings system \n     by the Kaiser Family Foundation concludes that 79 percent of \n     violent programming is not specifically rated for violence.\n       (12) Technology-based solutions, such as the V-chip, may be \n     helpful in protecting some children, but cannot achieve the \n     compelling governmental interest in protecting all children \n     from violent programming when parents are only able to block \n     programming that has, in fact, been rated for violence.\n       (13) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n     shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n     unavailable, unable to supervise their children's viewing \n     behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solutions, or are unable to determine the content of those \n     shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.\n       (14) After further study, pursuant to a rulemaking, the \n     Federal Communications Commission may conclude that content-\n     based ratings and blocking technology do not effectively \n     protect children from the harm of violent video programming.\n       (15) If the Federal Communications Commission reaches the \n     conclusion described in paragraph (14), the channeling of \n     violent video programming will be the least restrictive means \n     of limiting the exposure of children to the harmful \n     influences of violent video programming.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide adequate coverage for immunosuppressive drugs furnished to \nbeneficiaries under the medicare program that have received an organ \ntransplant; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nthis bill I am introducing today with my colleague from Ohio, which \nwill help many Medicare beneficiaries who have had organ transplants.\n  Last year over 4,400 people died while waiting for an organ \ntransplant, including 257 in my home State of Illinois. Currently, over \n80,000 Americans are waiting for a donor organ with 4,349 waiting in \nIllinois. It is this scarcity that has fueled the controversy over \norgan allocation.\n  Given that organs are extremely scarce, Federal law should not \ncompromise the success of organ transplantation. Yet that is exactly \nwhat current Medicare policy does, because Medicare denies certain \ntransplant patients coverage for the drugs needed to prevent rejection.\n  Medicare does this in several different ways. First, Medicare does \nnot pay for anti-rejection drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, who \nreceived their transplants prior to becoming a Medicare beneficiary. So \nfor instance, if a person received a transplant at aged 64 through \ntheir health insurance plan, when they retire and rely on Medicare for \ntheir health care they will no longer have immunosuppressive drug \ncoverage. Transplanation is the only medical condition that Medicare \ntreats as a pre-existing condition so as to deny a Medicare beneficiary \na health care service that would otherwise be covered.\n  Second, Medicare only pays for anti-rejection drugs for transplants \nperformed in a Medicare approved transplant facility. However, many \nbeneficiaries are completely unaware of this fact and how it can \njeopardize their future coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. To receive \nan organ transplant, a person must be very ill and many are far too ill \nat the time of transplantation to be researching the intricate nuances \nof Medicare coverage policy.\n  Finally, Medicare has a special program for End Stage Renal Disease, \nESRD, patients. Medicare pays for their dialysis at a cost of over \n$100,000 per year and provides for all their health care costs. \nHowever, it a transplant becomes available to an ESRD patient, Medicare \nonly provides them with health care for three years post-\ntransplantation. The fact is, however, that they will need to use \nimmunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their life to maintain their \ntransplant. But after the three years are up, their entire Medicare \ncoverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage is terminated. If \nthat person's transplant is rejected because they can no longer afford \ntheir immunosuppressive drugs, then Medicare will again pay for their \ndialysis and all of their health care costs. This is ludicrous. It \nwould make more sense for Medicare to continue to provide them with the \nlifesaving immunosuppressive drugs that they need.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, the ``Comprehensive \nImmunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients of 2000 Act'' \nwould remove these short-sighted limitations. The bill sets up a new, \neasy to follow policy: All Medicare beneficiaries who have had a \ntransplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of \ntheir transplant, would be covered as long as such anti-rejection drugs \nwere needed.\n  I am introducing this bill on behalf of some of the constituents that \nI have met who are unfortunately very adversely affected by the current \ngaps in Medicare coverage.\n  Richard Hevrdejs was a Chicago attorney in private practice until \n1993. Unfortunately, he suffered a debilitating heart attack that year, \nwhich left him unable to work and on disability. In 1997 suffering from \ncongestive heart failure, he was placed on a Heart-Mate machine at the \nUniversity of Illinois Medical Center, UIC. In April of 1998, he \nreceived a heart transplant at UIC but because UIC was not at the time \na Medicare approved facility for heart transplants, Medicare will not \ncover his immunosuppressive drugs. Richard was near death when he had \nhis transplant and was in no condition to research the intricacies of \nMedicare coverage policies. His drug costs are now around $25,000 per \nyear. He gets some assistance from the drug company medical assistance \nplans and he has a Medigap policy that provides a little assistance. \nBut for the most part, he is forced to watch all his savings dwindle \nbecause of Medicare's coverage gaps.\n  Anita Milton was from Morris, Illinois. In 1995, she became so \ndisabled that she was no longer able to work and was forced onto \ndisability. The following year, he lungs gave up and she had to have a \nbilateral lung transplant. Because Medicare is not available for 2 \nyears after a person becomes eligible for disability, Anita was not on \nMedicare when she had the transplant. The huge bills for the transplant \nremained at collection agencies till her death several years ago. \nBecause Anita was not on Medicare when she received her transplant, she \ndid not receive Medicare coverage for the anti-rejection drugs that she \nneeds. She received $940 in disability payments per month. She than \nwent on Medicaid but due to the spend down requirements in Illinois, \nshe had to spend $689 on drug costs to get Medicare coverage for her \ndrugs. In effect she got coverage every second month. Anita couldn't \nafford her anti-rejection drugs and she tried to scale back on them. \nThis caused her to nearly reject the transplant. Consequently, she lost \na third of her lung capacity permanently. As Anita said at a Town Hall \nmeeting in Chicago in January 1998 ``these Medicare and Medicaid rules \nmake no sense.''\n  I am introducing this bill on the same day that another bill the \n``Living Donor Access Act of 2003'', which I am an original cosponsor, \nis also being introduced by my colleague Senator DeWine. The ``Living \nDonor Access Act'' also seeks to improve the lives of transplant \npatients. The ``Living Donor Access Act'' would prohibit insurers in \nthe group market from imposing additional premiums or preexisting \ncondition exclusions on living organ donors. There are currently more \nthan 25,000 living organ donors, but no law protects these individuals \nagainst discrimination in the group health insurance market. The two \nbills are good companions. It is important that we root out all \ndiscrimination against both those who have received transplants and \nthose who are so generous as to donate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, the \n``Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients \nof 2003'', be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 178\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \na prohibition on use of mobile telephones while operating a motor \nvehicle; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nMobile Telephone Driving Safety Act, to enhance highway safety by \nencouraging States to restrict the use of cell phones by drivers while \nthey are operating a motor vehicle.\n  I am introducing this legislation because of the significant threat \nposed by people who use cell phones while driving. According to a study \nby the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis released in December of 2002, \n``the use of cell phones by drivers may result in approximately 2,600 \ndeaths, 330,000 moderate to critical injuries and 1.5 million instances \nof property damage in America per year''. Other studies have reached \nsimilar conclusions. One, published in the New England Journal of \nMedicine in 1997, concluded that the ``use of cellular telephones in \nmotor vehicles is associated with a quadrupling of the risks of a \ncollision during the brief period of a call''. That study went on to \nsay ``this relative risk is similar to the hazard associated with \ndriving with a blood alcohol level at the legal limit''.\n  States, counties and municipalities around the country have \nconsidered bans on hand-held cell phone use while driving. New York \nactually enacted such a ban in 2001. The Governor of New Jersey has \nproposed such a ban and related legislation has been unanimously \napproved by the New Jersey State Senate. A number of New Jersey \nmunicipalities also have chosen to enforce bans within their borders, \nincluding Marlboro, Carteret and Nutley.\n  This patchwork of laws, however, does not take the place of a \nconsistent, nation-wide ban. Congress needs to step forward and pass \nlegislation that will ban the use of hand-held cell phones nationwide.\n  The Mobile Telephone Driving Safety Act of 2003 is structured in a \nmanner similar to other federal laws designed to promote highway \nsafety, such as laws that encourage states to enact tough drunk driving \nstandards. Under the legislation, a portion of Federal highway funds \nwould be withheld from States that do not enact a ban on cell phone use \nwhile driving. Initially, this funding could be restored if states act \nto move into compliance. Later, the highway funding forfeited by one \nstate would be distributed to other states that are in compliance. \nExperience has shown that the threat of losing highway funding is very \neffective in ensuring that states comply.\n  To meet the bill's requirements, States would have to ban cell phone \nuse while driving. However, such a ban\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\nneed not be absolute. It could include an exception where there are \nexceptional circumstances, such as the use of a phone to report a \ndisabled vehicle or medical emergency. In addition, if a State makes a \ndetermination that the use of ``hands free'' cell phones does not pose \na threat to public safety, such use could be exempted from the ban, as \nwell.\n  This is a necessary bill to keep our streets and highways safe.

A bill to establish the National Aviation Heritage Area, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague from \nOhio, Senator George Voinovich, to introduce the National Aviation \nHeritage Area Act, an act to establish a National Aviation Heritage \nArea within our home State of Ohio.\n  For hundreds of years prior to the 20th Century, man dreamt of \nflying. Some of the earliest records of mankind reveal a fascination \nwith birds and the ability to leave the ground. In fact, the \nRenaissance revolution in art showed us many of the first recorded \ndesigns for achieving this feat. By 1903, man succeeded, altering the \ncourse of modern history.\n  This year, we mark the 100th anniversary of manned flight. I am proud \nto say that the famed Wright Brothers, Wilbur and Orville, were native \nOhioans. These two men are important symbols of an evolving age of \ndiscovery, an age beginning with the Wright Brothers' first controlled, \nheavier-than-air flight on December 17, 1903. A mere half-a-century or \nso later, mankind was flying not just above the ground, but above our \nplanet Earth, which was quickly followed by Neil Armstrong's first \nsteps on the moon. It is amazing to just sit back and consider that all \nof these things, all of these incredible achievements have all occurred \nin a very short span of less than one hundred years.\n  There is so much to say about the historical and cultural \nsignificance of the birth of aviation, but I think one of its unique \neducational aspects is its ability to be interactive with students \noutside of the classroom. And, that is one of the main reasons we are \nintroducing our National Aviation Heritage Area legislation today.\n  Our bill seeks to help foster strong public and private investments \nin many of Ohio's aviation landmarks, landmarks that have enormous \neducational value. Some of these landmarks include the Wright Brothers' \n``Wright Cycle Company,'' located in Dayton and the Wright-Dunbar \nInterpretive Center, where students of all ages can learn about the \npainstaking measures the Wright Brothers and many of their predecessors \ntook to achieve what today seems to be so commonplace. Other landmarks \ninclude the Huffman Prairie Flying Field, where, after the Wright \nBrothers' famous flight in Kitty Hawk, NC, the Brothers returned home \nto perfect the design of the world's first airplane and the Paul \nLaurence Dunbar State Memorial, which showcases this great African \nAmerican poet's strong international voice for racial equality and \njustice. The Heritage Area also includes the Neil Armstrong Museum, \nwhich highlights the great achievements of man's first walk on the \nmoon. If I may add also, Neil Armstrong is a native Ohioan.\n  Flight has become a very important square in the patchwork of our \nnation's history, and I am proud that my home State of Ohio has played \nsuch a large role in its evolution. We are reminded of how manned \nflight has changed our history every time we look skyward and see the \ncrisscross of jet contrails. We are reminded of this every time we walk \nthrough the Rotunda of our very own U.S. Capitol and see the last \nfrieze square that depicts the Wright Brothers and their invention. \nAnd, we are reminded of this by one of the great symbols of America, \nthe eagle, a flying bird that represents the freedom of a people.\n  It is vital that we protect the sites that have played such an \nimportant role in aviation. In doing so, we can enhance the education \nand enrichment of our children and our grandchildren for many years to \ncome.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 181. A bill to require a review of accounting treatment of stock \noption plans, and the establishment of an appropriate stock option \naccounting principle within 1 year; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 182. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat corporate tax benefits from stock option compensation expenses are \nallowed only to the extent such expenses\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\nare included in a corporation's financial statements; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today on behalf of myself \nand Sen. McCain two separate bills relating to stock options. Stock \noptions are unfinished business from the last Congress. They are the \n800-pound gorilla that has yet to be caged by corporate reform.\n  Stock options allow a company's employees, usually its top \nexecutives, to purchase company stock at a set price for a specified \nperiod of time, perhaps 10 years. If the stock price rises after the \noption is issued, the executive can exercise the option, buy the stock \nat the set price, and then sell it on the open market at a profit. \nToday, most CEOs of U.S. publicly traded companies receive a large \npercentage of their pay from stock options.\n  Despite their widespread use, stock options remain a stealth form of \ncompensation because, under current accounting rules, they never have \nto appear on the company books as a compensation expense. In fact, they \nare the only form of compensation that companies do not have to book as \nan expense at any time. In addition, stock options are the only form of \ncompensation that a company can claim as a deductible business expense \non its tax return, even when no expense is ever recorded on the company \nbooks.\n  These stock option accounting and tax rules are inconsistent and \nillogical. The two bills we are introducing today, the Stock Option \nAccounting Review Act, and the Ending the Double Standard for Stock \nOptions Act, were introduced in the last Congress to address this \nproblem. Each bill tackles a different aspect of the stock option \nissue. One addresses stock option accounting; the other addresses the \nstock option tax deduction.\n  Last year, Senator McCain and I proposed the accounting provision as \nan amendment to the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reform bill that was \nbefore the Senate in July. There appeared to be sufficient support to \npass it at the time, but we were unable to obtain a vote on it or on \nany other stock option legislation. That is why we are back this \nCongress.\n  Congress failed to resolve the issue last year, even though stock \noption abuses were repeatedly linked to serious corporate abuses and \ndishonest accounting. In fact, virtually every corporate disaster that \nhas struck in recent years has had a stock option component.\n  Enron, of course, was the poster child. Congressional investigations, \nincluding by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on which I \nsit, showed that, at the same time Enron investors and employees were \nlosing their shirts, Enron executives were cashing in their stock \noptions for tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Ken Lay, the \nChairman of the Board, took home $123 million from stock options in \n2000 alone. Jeff Skilling, the CEO, took home over $60 million. Another \nexecutive, Lou Pai, topped them all by cashing in Enron stock options, \nin 2000, for $265 million.\n  Stock options also contributed to Enron's inflated earnings, since \ndespite providing the lion's share of executive pay, this compensation \nnever appeared on the company books as an expense nor was it ever \ndeducted from earnings. And many have blamed stock options for \nencouraging Enron management to rig the company's financial statements \nthrough other accounting deceptions to help boost apparent income and, \nin turn, the company stock price, so they could sell their Enron stock \nat enormous profit.\n  Still others have noted that Enron used about $600 million in stock \noption tax deductions to avoid paying any corporate income taxes in \nfour out of the last five years before its bankruptcy while, at the \nsame time, touting record amounts of corporate income. What is now only \nbeginning to be understood is that Enron's stock option tax deductions \nplayed a central role in much of its wrongdoing, after all, Enron was \nable to inflate its corporate income with impunity, in part, because \nits stock option tax deductions allowed it to avoid paying taxes on any \nof its phony inflated income.\n  Enron was the poster child for stock option abuses, but it was far \nfrom the only company in that category last year. Worldcom, Tyco, Qwest \nCommunications, and many others have stock option stories that are \nequally disturbing.\n  And the problems did not stop with companies engaged in accounting \ndeceptions or other corporate misconduct. Even companies that never \nappeared on the 2002 rollcall of corporate deception have been \nexcoriated in media reports for giving huge stock option pay to \nexecutives while socking employees and investors with lower stock \nprices, mounting losses, and lousy corporate performance.\n  High tech companies that have been the biggest promoters of stock \noptions have been some of the biggest culprits. Company after company \nin Silicon Valley paid their executives big bucks via stock options \nwhile laying off employees, losing money or market share, and stiffing \ninvestors. One example frequently cited in the media is Lawrence \nEllison, CEO of Oracle Corp., who exercised options in 2001 to obtain \nprofits of $706 million, while his company's stock price dropped by \nmore than 50 percent.\n  Aggregate stock option statistics are also sobering. Business Week, \nfor example, has estimated that stock options now account for ``a \nstaggering 15 percent of all shares outstanding.'' Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan estimated that stock options have been used to \noverstate reported company earnings by an average of 6 to 9 \npercent. Perhaps that is why Chairman Greenspan has picked honest stock \noption accounting as his number one post-Enron reform.\n\n  Stock option abuses have been linked to inflated company earnings, \ndishonest accounting, and executive misconduct. These abuses have been \nfacilitated by existing accounting and tax rules which allow stock \noption compensation to never appear on a company's books as an expense, \neven when a company claims this compensation as a business expense on \nits tax return. This double standard is fueling Enron-style abuses, and \nit is time for it to end.\n  Many in the U.S. business community apparently agree and, unlike the \nCongress, have taken direct action on the stock option issue. In fact, \nover the last year, there has been significant movement in the business \nworld to end dishonest stock option accounting.\n  Over 120 companies, including such American giants as Coca-Cola, \nGeneral Motors, General Electric, Dow Chemical, Wal-Mart, and Home \nDepot have announced that they will begin expensing options in 2003, \njoining longtime expensers like Boeing and Winn-Dixie. Standard and \nPoors has created additional pressure for honest stock option \naccounting by announcing a new ``core earnings'' calculation for \ncompanies which requires stock option compensation to be subtracted \nfrom a company's earnings.\n  Accounting experts are also moving. The International Accounting \nStandards Board in London has announced that, by the end of 2003, it \nwill issue accounting standards requiring companies to expense stock \noptions. The U.S. equivalent, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, \nor FASB, has announced that it will decide by the end of the first \nquarter of this year whether it will issue stock option accounting \nstandards similar to those of the International Board.\n  While there has been a major shift in the U.S. business world toward \nhonest stock option accounting, not all companies are on board. Some \ncompanies, especially those in the high tech sector, have announced \nthat they will not expense stock options until forced to do so. That \nmeans, until FASB acts, there will be a discrepancy between those \ncompanies that are voluntarily expensing options and those that are \nnot, when there ought to be a level playing field where everyone plays \nby the same accounting rules. It is this discrepancy that continues to \nmake our stock option legislation relevant and necessary for \nCongressional action this year.\n  Let me describe both bills.\n  First is the Stock Option Accounting Review Act. This bill is very \nsimple. It would direct FASB to conduct a fresh review of the current \naccounting treatment for stock options and, within one year, establish \nwhat it deems to be the appropriate stock option accounting standards.\n  The bill does not specify the stock option accounting standards that \nFASB should issue; that matter is left to the experts where it belongs. \nBut\n\n[[Page S1075]]\n\nthe bill does put the Senate on record as urging FASB to review the \nexisting rules and take appropriate action within one year. This \nlegislative directive is important, because the only other time the \nSenate has spoken on this issue, in 1994, the Senate majority urged \nFASB to keep allowing companies to exclude stock option expenses from \ntheir financial statements. The Senate's position contradicted FASB's \nposition at the time which was to require stock option expensing. It is \nlong past time for the Senate to rescind its mistaken advice.\n  The second bill we are introducing today is the Ending the Double \nStandard for Stock Options Act. This bill would not address the \naccounting treatment of stock options. Instead, it would address the \ntax treatment of stock option compensation, ending the costly double \nstandard in federal law which allows a company to take a tax deduction \nfor stock option compensation, even if the company does not show that \ncompensation as a business expense on its financial statements.\n  Essentially, our bill would prevent a company from claiming a stock \noption expense on its tax return unless the company also includes that \nexpense on its books. It would require companies to be consistent in \nhow they treat stock options, and take a corporate tax deduction that \nmirrors the expense shown on the company books. If a company took the \nposition that it incurred no expense from stock option compensation on \nits books, the bill would allow the company to take that position, but \nwould also require it to take the same approach on its tax return and \nforego any deduction. The bill would stop companies from telling \nstockholders one thing, that it has no stock option expenses, while \ntelling the opposite to Uncle Sam.\n  And to add insult to injury, in 2001, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling \n2001-1 which determined that companies whose tax liability was erased \nthrough stock option expenses were not subject to the corporate \nalternative minimum tax. That revenue ruling meant that our most \nsuccessful publicly traded companies, if they doled out enough stock \noptions to insiders, could arrange their affairs to escape paying any \ntaxes. That absurd result leaves the average taxpayer feeling like a \nchump for paying his fair share when a company like Enron can use its \nsuccess in the stock market to apparently end up tax free.\n  One last point. Some opponents of stock option reform argue that \nreining in stock options would hurt the average worker, but this \ncontention is nothing more than a red herring. While many average \nworkers are eligible for stock options, few actually receive them. \nStock options are overwhelmingly reserved for top corporate executives.\n  A recent Bureau of Labor Statistics survey did the research. This \nnationwide government survey found that in 2000, a banner year for \nstock options, only 1.7 percent of non-executive workers actually got \nany stock options. The BLS survey also looked at corporate executives \nand found that only about 5 percent of these corporate executives \nreceived any stock options. These results are consistent with the \nfindings of a private sector group not associated with the government \ncalled the National Center for Employee Ownership, which favors stock \noptions. Looking at a small sample of companies, the Center reported \nthat 70 percent of all stock options were given to managers rather than \nother employees, and about 50 percent were given to the most senior \nexecutives. The reality is that stock options are a perk mainly \nreserved for a very small group, and neither average workers nor most \nexecutives would be affected by honest accounting or consistent tax and \naccounting treatment for stock options.\n  It is also important to understand that neither of our bills would \nbar any company from issuing stock options. Companies would still be \nable to issue stock options to their executives and other employees. \nThe goal of this legislation is not to stop the use of stock options, \nbut to promote honest accounting and consistent treatment of stock \noptions on federal corporate tax returns.\n  Stock option abuses have damaged investor confidence in American \nbusiness. I hope our colleagues will support enactment of these bills \nto help restore investor confidence and end stock option abuses. I ask \nunanimous consent to have reprinted in the Record after my remarks the \ntext of both bills.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to address Securities and Exchange Commission \nauthority to impose civil money penalties in administrative proceedings \nfor violations of securities laws, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation to \nprovide the Securities and Exchange Commission with stronger \nadministrative authority to detect, investigate, and punish corporate \nand individual misconduct. This legislation, the SEC Civil Enforcement \nAct, among other measures, would provide the SEC with new authority to \nimpose administrative civil fines on those who violate federal \nsecurities laws. The bill is cosponsored by Senators Bill Nelson, \nCorzine, and Biden. \n  The SEC has repeatedly requested the new enforcement tools that this \nbill would provide, and I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record \nafter my remarks a copy of a letter from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt \nsupporting enactment of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1076]]\n\n                                      United States Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin: This letter responds to your letter of \n     August 9th, seeking my views on your proposal to enhance the \n     Commission's authority to seek civil penalties for violations \n     of the federal securities laws, increase the penalties the \n     Commission may seek, and eliminate a procedural requirement \n     that may slow the Commission's efforts to trace and recover \n     misappropriated investor funds.\n       The three additional enforcement tools you contemplate \n     reflect recommendations we have made previously in an effort \n     to facilitate our goal of achieving ``real-time \n     enforcement.'' Especially in light of recent events, I \n     believe these proposals would enhance our efforts and the \n     interest of investors. As you know, during this Congressional \n     session, with the bipartisan support of Congress and the \n     Administration, the Commission already has been given, and \n     has begun to implement, greater authority to pursue and \n     punish corporate wrongdoers and enhance corporate \n     accountability. The additional authority about which you \n     inquire would be a welcome addition to our enforcement \n     arsenal, if the proposals achieve bipartisan support.\n       Again, thank you for your interest in strengthening \n     penalties for securities fraud violations. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact me or Stephen Cutler, Director of the \n     Division of Enforcement, at (202) 942-4500 if we can be of \n     further assistance.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                   Harvey L. Pitt.\n\n  Here is a description of what the bill would do.\n  First, the bill would grant the SEC additional administrative \nauthority to impose civil monetary fines on those who violate federal \nsecurities laws. Under current law, only broker dealers, investment \nadvisers, and certain other persons regulated by the SEC are now \nsubject to civil fines. Our bill would expand SEC authority to allow it \nto impose fines on such wrongdoers as, for example, corporate officers, \ndirectors, auditors, lawyers, or publicly traded companies, none of \nwhich can now be fined by the SEC in an administrative proceeding. \nThese fines would, of course, be subject to judicial review, as are all \ncurrent SEC administrative determinations.\n  Hearings held and reports issued by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which spent the last year investigating Enron's \ncollapse, determined that the Enron Board of Directors and certain \nhighly respected financial institutions helped Enron carry out \ndeceptive accounting transactions or other corporate abuses, misleading \ninvestors and analysts about the company's finances. The latest hearing \nin December also highlighted the fact that the SEC needs additional \ntools to deal with financial institutions. Our bill would give the SEC \nnew authority to impose an administrative fine on any bank or \nindividual banker who violates the federal securities laws including, \nas in Enron, by helping a public company doctor its books or engage in \nmisleading transactions.\n  Second, this bill would significantly increase the maximum civil fine \nthat the SEC could impose on those whom it has authority to regulate. \nThe civil fines that the SEC currently may impose have maximum amounts \nthat range from $6,500 to $600,000 per violation. In a day and age \nwhere some CEOs are making $100 million in a year, and a company like \nEnron reported gross revenues of $100 billion in a single year, a civil \nfine of $6,500 is laughable. Here is what one SEC staff document stated \nin June 2002, explaining why the agency is seeking an increase in its \ncivil fine limits:\n\n       The current maximum penalty amounts may not have the \n     desired deterrent effect on an individual or corporate \n     violator. For example, an individual who commits a negligent \n     act is subject to a maximum penalty amount of $6,500 per \n     violation. This amount is so trivial it cannot possibly have \n     a deterrent effect on the violator.\n\n  Our bill would increase the maximum fines from a range of $6,500 to \n$600,000 per violation, to a range that goes from $100,000 to $2 \nmillion per violation. When we are seeing corporate restatements and \ncorporate misconduct involving billions of dollars, these larger cash \nfines are critical if they are to have an effective deterrent or \npunitive impact on wrongdoers in the corporate world today.\n  Third, the bill would grant the SEC new administrative authority, \nwhen the SEC has opened an official SEC investigation, to subpoena \nfinancial records from a financial institution without having to notify \nthe subject that such a records request has been made. This authority \nwill allow the SEC to evaluate financial transactions, trace funds, and \nanalyze relationships without having to alert the subject of the \ninvestigation to the SEC's actions. Under current law, the SEC either \nhas to give the subject advance notice of the subpoena or obtain a \ncourt order that can delay notification for no longer than 90 days.\n  In the cases we are seeing today, where there are allegations that \nofficers, directors, and companies are using offshore accounts to \ndeposit millions of dollars, enlist foreign investors, and affect the \naccounting and tax treatment of various complex transactions, the SEC \nmust be able to look at financial records without giving the account \nholder an opportunity to move funds, change accounts, and further muddy \nthe investigative waters. This authority is particularly important in \nlight of the Patriot Act, which Congress enacted after the 9-11 \ntragedy, requiring the SEC to be on the lookout for money laundering \nthrough securities accounts. The SEC cannot afford to alert potential \nmoney launderers to the agency's efforts to review their financial \naccounts for possible money laundering. This bill would bring the SEC's \nsubpoena authority into alignment with the subpoena authority of \nfederal banking agencies that are already exempted by statute from \nhaving to notify account holders of agency subpoenas to review their \nfinancial records. Again, the SEC has requested this new enforcement \ntool, and this bill would provide it.\n  This bill is an important compliment to the new Sarbanes-Oxley law \nwhich stiffened criminal penalties for securities fraud, because this \nbill would stiffen enforcement mechanisms on the civil side. Last year, \nI tried to incorporate it into the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but was unable \nto obtain a vote on my amendment. That is why I am reintroducing the \nlegislation this year. Since many corporate and accounting cases \nwarrant civil rather than criminal treatment, strengthening the SEC's \ncivil enforcement authority is another critical step in improving its \neffectiveness as an enforcement agency to deter and punish this \nmisconduct.\n  Given the current disillusionment among the American people and other \ninvestors with American public companies, Congress needs to provide \nleadership to restore investor confidence in our markets, in SEC \noversight, and in company financial statements so that investors can \ntrust them to reflect the true state of a company's financial \ncondition. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nlegislation and winning its enactment during the 108th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full text \nof the bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 401(b)(2) of the Higher Education Act \nof 1965 regarding the Federal Pell Grant maximum amount; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise, and am joined by my colleagues \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Jeffords, Senator Murray, Senator Landrieu \nand Senator Dayton, to introduce legislation to amend the Higher \nEducation Act to improve access to higher education for low- and \nmiddle-income students by doubling the authorized maximum Pell Grant \nwithin six years. This bill has the strong support of the Student Aid \nAlliance, whose 60 organizations represent students, colleges, parents, \nand others who care about higher education.\n  Pell Grants were established in the early 1970s by our former \ncolleague, Claiborne Pell, of Rhode Island. They are the largest source \nof federal grant aid for college students. For millions of low- and \nmiddle-income students they are the difference between attending or not \nattending college. But, unfortunately, they don't make as much of a \ndifference as they used to.\n  In 1975, the maximum appropriated Pell Grant covered all of the \naverage student's tuition, fees, room, and board at community colleges. \nIt covered about 80 percent of those costs at public universities and \nabout 40 percent at private universities. Today, Pell Grant's \npurchasing power has dropped by more than 30 percent at community \ncolleges and been more than cut in half at universities. It covers only \n38 percent of the costs at public universities and 15 percent at \nprivate universities. That's not just a drop, it's a free-fall.\n  For students from the lowest income families, college is getting \nfarther and farther out of reach. Since 1975, as a percentage of the \nfamily income of the poorest 20 percent of families, the cost of public \nuniversities has increased by half and the cost of private universities \nhas doubled. For middle-income families, the cost of college also has \nincreased significantly as a percentage of income.\n  As a result of all this, low- and middle-income students who want to \nattend college are forced to finance their education with an ever-\nincreasing percentage of loans as opposed to grants, which effectively \nincreases their cost of attendance even more and in many cases, keeps \nthem from going to college at all.\n  Of course, the President's budget would have frozen the maximum Pell \nGrant. So, on top of leaving millions of children behind by failing to \nmeet the bipartisan promises of the No Child Left Behind Act, the \nPresident's budget would leave even more children behind who work hard \nand do well in school and want to go on to college.\n  We can't kid ourselves, if we're serious about leaving no child \nbehind, if we're serious about having a society where equal opportunity \nfor all is more than just rhetoric, then we need to reinvigorate the \nPell program.\n  The Student Aid Alliance put it very well, in talking about students, \nwhen they said that ``investing in their future is investing in our \nnation's future.'' We can start investing in our Nation's future by \nsupporting the amendment that will be offered to the Omnibus \nappropriations bill today to increase the maximum appropriated Pell \nGrant to $4,500.\n  That won't bring Pell Grant's purchasing power back to where it was \nin 1975, but it is a critical first step, and I intend to continue the \neffort through this bill and other measures as we reauthorize the \nHigher Education Act this Congress.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 184\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 186. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to provide health insurance protections for individuals who are \nliving organ donors; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to raise further awareness of \nan issue that affects over 22,000 people a year, and that issue is \norgan donation. The sad fact about organ donations is this: We have the \nmedical know-how to save lives, but we lack the organs. We lack organs \nbecause most Americans simply are unaware of the life-giving difference \nthey can make by choosing to become organ donors.\n  Sadly, each day the waiting list for those needing organs continues \nto grow. Today, over 80,000 people remain on the national transplant \nwaiting list.\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\nRight now, more than 56,000 people, alone, are waiting for kidney \ntransplants. That number is expected to double within the next decade. \nAdditionally, close to 6,000 people die each year just waiting for an \navailable organ.\n  To remedy the organ shortage, we must increase public awareness. By \neducating the public and raising awareness, more people will choose to \nbecome organ donors. At the very least, through these efforts, we can \nencourage more families to discuss what their wishes are and whether \nthey would want to be organ donors.\n  But, our efforts must not stop there. We must do more than just \nimplement public awareness campaigns, because the face of organ \ndonation is changing. For the first time ever, the number of living \norgan donors outnumbered cadaver donors. In 2001, there were 6,082 \ndonor cadavers while 6,534 people opted to become living donors, \nusually giving up a healthy kidney to help a family member or friend.\n  Recognizing this, my colleague, Senator Durbin, and I are introducing \na bill today that would help protect living organ donors in the group \ninsurance market. Our bill would ensure that those individuals who \nchoose to be living organ donors are not discriminated against in the \ninsurance marketplace. Our bill builds on the protections provided by \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, so that living \norgan donors are not denied insurance nor are they applied \ndiscriminatory insurance premiums because of their living organ donor \nstatus.\n  Quite simply, a brother who donates a part of his kidney to his \nsister should not be denied health insurance. But tragically, that is \nwhat oftentimes happens. Frequently, individuals who are living organ \ndonors are denied health insurance or restricted from the insurance \nmarket. Instead, we should celebrate living organ donors and remove \nobstacles and barriers for the successful donation of organs. Insurance \nconcerns should not undermine someone's decision to be a living organ \ndonor.\n  Some states are evaluating how living organ donors affect the market. \nStates are amending their Family Medical Leave eligibility so that \nliving organ donors can participate and benefit from the program. The \nFederal Government, with the Organ Donor Leave Act of 1999, offered 30 \ndays paid leave to Federal employees who chose to be an organ donor. \nBut, paid leave and job protection doesn't mean much if people are \ndenied health insurance or are required to pay higher premiums because \nthey donated an organ to save another person's life.\n  The impact of living organ donation is profound. A living organ donor \nnot only can save the life of one patient, but can also take that \nperson off the waiting list for a cadaver donation. That means the next \nperson on the waiting list is ``bumped up'' a spot, giving additional \nhope to the 86,000 persons on the national transplant waiting list.\n  Living organ donors give family members and friends a second chance \nat life and the opportunity to reduce the number of people on the \nwaiting list to receive an organ. It is time for Congress to make a \nsensible decision in support of a person's decision to be a living \norgan donor.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 187. A bill to provide for the elimination of significant \nvulnerabilities in the information technology of the Federal \nGovernment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nCyber Security Leadership Act of 2003, a bill that calls on the Federal \nGovernment to lead by example in shoring up its computers and \nprotecting them against cyber attacks.\n  I introduce this bill because our Nation's computers and networks are \nincreasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks. A week after the September 11 \nattacks, a cyber attack spread across 86,000 computers over several \ndays, causing unknown amounts of financial and economic damage. Two \nmonths before that, a cyber attack called Code Red infected 150,000 \ncomputers in 14 hours. According to cyber security experts, Federal \ncomputers have already been used as weapons in large-scale cyber \nattack.\n  There aren't just amateur teenage hackers. Terrorists, including al \nQaeda operatives, have browsed Internet sites offering software that \nwould help them take down power, water, transport and communications \ngrids.\n  One of the principal reasons that companies do not act to secure \ntheir systems is that the Federal Government does not act to secure its \nown systems. Unfortunately, Federal agencies continue to be among the \nworst offenders failing to protect themselves against cyber attack. \nLast November, a Congressional report card gave 14 agencies a failing \ngrade for their computer security efforts. These vulnerabilities leave \nour Federal agencies exposed to hackers, system shutdowns, and cyber \nterrorist infiltration.\n  Clearly, we need to act now to strengthen our computer systems. I \nbelieve the first step in this process is to have our Federal agencies \nlead by example.\n  The National Cyber Security Leadership Act of 2003 would establish \nhigher standards for Federal Government computer safety. The National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology would establish the standards \nafter individual agencies conduct comprehensive tests of their network \nsystems and report on their weaknesses. These procedures will \nstrengthen our government's resistance to cyber attacks and will \ndemonstrate to the business community the tremendous value in \nconducting comprehensive security tests and monitoring new \ndevelopments.\n  I have developed this important piece of legislation with assistance \nfrom Mr. Alan Paller, Director of Research for the SANS Institute; Mr. \nFranklin S. Reeder, Chairman of the Center for Internet Security and of \nthe Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Committee; and \nseveral computer security experts in the Federal Government.\n  We cannot afford to wait until we experience a computer meltdown. I \nurge my colleagues to join with me in helping our Federal agencies to \nlead by example.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. \n        Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 188. A bill to impose a moratorium on the implementation of \ndatamining under the Total Information Awareness program of the \nDepartment of Defense and any similar program of the Department of \nHomeland Security, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nData-Mining Moratorium Act of 2003. Like many Americans, I was \nsurprised to learn during the last few months that the Department of \nDefense has spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing a data-\nmining system called Total Information Awareness while permitting the \nprogeny of Total Information Awareness to appear in places like the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. The untested and controversial \nintelligence procedure known as data-mining is capable of maintaining \nextensive files containing both public and private records on each and \nevery American. Coupled with the expanded domestic surveillance already \nunderway by this Administration, this unchecked system is a dangerous \nstep forward and threatens one of the values that we're fighting for, \nfreedom. The Administration has a heavy burden of proof that such \nextreme measures are necessary.\n  The Data-Mining Moratorium Act of 2003 would immediately suspend \ndata-mining in the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity until Congress has conducted a thorough review of Total \nInformation Awareness and the practice of data-mining.\n  Without Congressional review and oversight, data-mining would allow \nthe Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and \nother government agencies to collect and analyze a combination of \nintelligence data and personal information like individuals' traffic \nviolations, credit card purchases, travel records, medical records, \ncommunications records, and virtually any information collected on \ncommercial or public databases. Through comprehensive data-mining, as \nenvisioned\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\nwith Total Information Awareness, everything from people's video \nrentals or drugstore purchases made with a credit card to their most \nprivate health concerns could be fed into a computer and monitored by \nthe Federal Government.\n  Using massive data mining, like Total Information Awareness, the \ngovernment hopes to be able to detect potential terrorists. There is no \nevidence that data-mining will, in fact, prevent terrorism. And when \none considers the potential for errors in data, for example, credit \nagencies that have data about John R. Smith on John D. Smith's credit \nreport, the prospect of ensnaring many innocents is real. This approach \nmight also lead to the same kinds of so-called ``preventive'' \ndetentions that are unconstitutional and put more than 1,100 \nindividuals in jail after September 11. Although none of these people \nwere ever charged with orchestrating or aiding the attacks, they were \noften held for months on end, and went for weeks without access to \ncounsel. There is every reason to be concerned that uncontrolled data-\nmining systems would lead to the same abuse of power.\n  The Administration's assurances that a data-mining system will not \nabuse our privacy rights ring hollow, particularly to those of us who \nquestioned the breathtaking new Federal powers in the USA PATRIOT Act. \nWe heard these same assurances when the Administration pressed for \nenactment of that sweeping legislation in the months after September \n11th, that the government would act with restraint to ensure that its \napplication of the Act would not infringe on our liberties. The \nopposite has turned out to be true. In fact, some of the most serious \ninfringements on our personal freedoms in the USA PATRIOT Act can now \ncontribute to the data-mining effort.\n  The USA PATRIOT Act allows the government to compel businesses to \nproduce records about people who had only a remote contact with a \nperson sought in connection with an investigation of terrorism, \nincluding sitting on an airplane with the suspect, or having used the \nsame payphone as the suspect. Under the PATRIOT Act, any business \nrecords can be compelled, including those containing sensitive personal \ninformation like medical records from hospitals or doctors, financial \nrecords, or records of what books someone has taken out of the \nliberary. This information is exactly the kind of data that data-mining \nprograms like Total Infomration Awareness will use when compiling its \nfiles on the American people.\n  The danger of data-mining is compounded not only by provisions in the \nUSA PATRIOT Act, but also by the Administration's loosening of domestic \nsurveillance restrictions for FBI agents last year, restrictions that \nwere put in place following FBI abuses under J. Edgar Hoover. These \nvarious initiatives of the Administration are building on each other to \ngive away more and more of our personal information, and give away more \nand more of our personal freedoms.\n  It is reasonable to ask Americans to sacrifice some personal freedom \nlike submitting to more extensive security screenings at airports. But \nshould we allow the government to track our every move, from what items \nwe purchase online, to our medical records, to our financial records, \nwithout limits and without accountability? I believe most Americans \nwould say that that's a police state, not the America we know and love. \nWe would catch more terroists in a police state. I don't doubt that. \nBut that's not a country in which most Americans would want to live.\n  Each time we have been told that government authorities would use \nrestraint with its new powers, but Congress and the American people \nshould not find comfort in these assurances, especially since they have \nbeen made by an Administration that has been operating in greater and \ngreater secrecy. The Administration must suspend this massive data \nmining project until Congress can determine whether the proposed \nbenefits of this practice come at too high a price to our privacy and \npersonal liberties.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Data-Mining Moratorium Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Use of advanced technology is an essential tool in the \n     fight against terrorism.\n       (2) There has been no demonstration that data-mining by a \n     government, including data-mining such as that which is to \n     occur under the Total Information Awareness program, is an \n     effective tool for preventing terrorism.\n       (3) Data-mining under the Total Information Awareness \n     program or a similar program would provide the Federal \n     Government with access to extensive files of private as well \n     as public information on an individual.\n       (4) There are significant concerns regarding the extent to \n     which privacy rights of individuals would be adversely \n     affected by data-mining carried out by their government.\n       (5) Congress has not reviewed any guidelines, rules, or \n     laws concerning implementation and use of data-mining by \n     Federal Government agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION OF TOTAL INFORMATION \n                   AWARENESS PROGRAM FOR DATA MINING.\n\n       (a) Moratorium.--During the period described in subsection \n     (b), no officer or employee of the Department of Defense or \n     the Department of Homeland Security may take any action to \n     implement or carry out for data-mining purposes any part of \n     (including any research or development under)--\n       (1) the Department of Defense component of the Total \n     Information Awareness program or any other data-mining \n     program of the Department of Defense; or\n       (2) any data-mining program of the Department of Homeland \n     Security that is similar or related to the Total Information \n     Awareness program.\n       (b) Moratorium Period.--The period referred to in \n     subsection (a) for a department of the Federal Government is \n     the period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act \n     and ending on the date (after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act) on which there is enacted a law specifically \n     authorizing data-mining by such department.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTS ON DATA-MINING ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Report.--The Secretary of Defense, the \n     Attorney General, and the head of each other department or \n     agency of the Federal Government that is engaged in any \n     activity to use or develop data-mining technology shall each \n     submit to Congress a report on all such activities of the \n     department or agency under the jurisdiction of that official.\n       (b) Content of report.--A report submitted under subsection \n     (a) shall include, for each activity to use or develop data-\n     mining technology that is required to be covered by the \n     report, the following information:\n       (1) A thorough description of the activity.\n       (2) A thorough discussion of the plans for the use of such \n     technology.\n       (3) A thorough discussion of the policies, procedures, and \n     guidelines that are to be applied in the use of such \n     technology for data-mining in order to--\n       (A) protect the privacy rights of individuals; and\n       (B) ensure that only accurate information is collected.\n       (c) Time for Report.--Each report required under subsection \n     (a) shall be submitted not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONSTRUCTION OF PROVISIONS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preclude the \n     Department of Defense or the Department of Homeland Security \n     from conducting--\n       (1) computer searches of public information; or\n       (2) computer searches that are based on a particularized \n     suspicion of an individual.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Warner, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Levin, and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 189. A bill to authorize appropriations for nanoscience, \nnanoengineering, and nanotechnology research, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, far from the stuff of science fiction, \nnanotechnology has become a reality in the lives of many Americans. \nWhile there is tremendous potential for further study in this field, \nnanotechnology's current impacts range from the pedestrian to the \nextraordinary. A TV commercial demonstrates the practicality of \nnanotechnology through stain-resistant pants. Prosthetic and medical \nimplants have been improved through molecularly designed surfaces that \ninteract with the cells of the body. There is no question that this \nfield will dramatically change the way Americans live.\n\n[[Page S1081]]\n\n  I was pleased that my colleagues in the Commerce Committee in the \nlast Congress recognized the tremendous potential of nanotechnology and \npassed this bill out of committee with unanimous bipartisan support. \nNanotechnology innovations will bring enormous benefits to America's \neconomy and to nearly every aspect of life in the coming decades. My \nown judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to \nchange America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer \nrevolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but \nwill mine the opportunities of nanotechnology. At present, efforts in \nthe nanotechnology field are strewn across a half-dozen Federal \nagencies. I want America to marshal its various nanotechnology efforts \ninto one driving force to remain the world's leader in this burgeoning \nfield. And I believe Federal support is essential to achieving that \ngoal.\n  Legislation I am introducing today will provide a smart, accelerate, \nand organized approach to nanotechnology research, development, and \neducation. In my view, there are three major steps America must take to \nensure the highest success for its nanotechnology efforts.\n  First, a National nanotechnology Research Program should be \nestablished to superintend long-term fundamental nanoscience and \nengineering research. The program's goals will be to ensure America's \nleadership and economic competitiveness in nanotechnology, and to make \nsure ethical and social concerns are taken into account alongside the \ndevelopment of this discipline.\n  Second, the Federal Government should support nanoscience through a \nprogram of research grants, and also through the establishment of \nnanotechnology research centers. These centers would serve as key \ncomponents of a national research infrastructure, bringing together \nexperts from the various disciplines that must intersect for nanoscale \nprojects to succeed and building a network that includes State-\nsupported centers. As these research efforts take shape, educational \nopportunities will be the key to their long-term success. Through this \nlegislation, I commit to helping students who would enter the field of \nnanotechnology. This discipline requires multiple areas of expertise. \nStudents with the drive and the talent to tackle physics, chemistry, \nand the material sciences simultaneously deserve all the support we can \noffer.\n  Third, the government should create connections across its agencies \nto aid in the meshing of various nanotechnology efforts. These could \ninclude a national steering office, and a Presidential nanotechnology \nAdvisory Committee, modeled on the President's Information Technology \nAdvisory Committee.\n  I also believe that as these organizational support structures are \nput into place, rigorous evaluation must take place to ensure the \nmaximum efficiency of our efforts. Personally, I would call for an \nannual review of America's nanotechnology efforts from the Presidential \nAdvisory Committee, and a periodic review from the National Academy of \nSciences. In addition to monitoring our own progress, the United States \nshould keep abreast of the world's nanotechnology efforts through a \nseries of benchmarking studies.\n  If the Federal Government fails to get behind nanotechnology now with \norganized, goal-oriented support, this Nation runs the risk of falling \nbehind others in the world who recognize the potential of this \ndiscipline. Nanotechnology is already making pants more stain-\nresistant, making windows self-washing and making car parts stronger \nwith tiny particles of clay. What America risks missing is the next \ngeneration of nanotechnology. In the next wave, nanoparticles and \nnanodevices will become the building blocks of our health care, \nagriculture, manufacturing, environmental cleanup, and even national \nsecurity.\n  America risks missing a revolution in electronics, where a device the \nsize of a sugar cube could hold all of the information in the Library \nof Congress. Today's silicon-based technologies can only shrink so \nsmall. Eventually, nanotechnologies will grow devices from the \nmolecular level up. Small though they may be, their capabilities and \ntheir impact will be enormous. Spacecraft could be the size of mere \nmolecules.\n  America risks missing a revolution in health care. In my home State, \nOregon State University researchers are working on the microscale to \ncreate lapel-pin-sized biosensors that use the color-changing cells of \nthe Siamese fighting fish to provide instant visual warnings when a \nbiotoxin is present. An antimicrobial dressing for battlefield wounds \nis already available today, containing silver nanocrystals that prevent \ninfection and reduce inflammation. The health care possibilities for \nnanotechnology are limitless. Eventually, nanoscale particles will \ntravel human bodies to detect and cure disease. Chemotherapy could \nattack individual cancer cells and leave healthy cells intact. Tiny \nbulldozers could unclog blocked arteries. Human disease will be fought \ncell by cell, molecule by molecule, and nanotechnology will provide \nvictories over disease that we can't even conceive today.\n  America risks missing a host of beneficial breakthroughs. American \nscientists could be the first to create nanomaterials for manufacturing \nand design that are stronger, lighter, harder, self-repairing, and \nsafer. Nanoscale devices could scrub automobile pollution out of the \nair as it is produced. Nanoparticles could cover armor to make American \nsoldiers almost invisible to enemies and even tend their wounds. \nnanotechnology could grow steel stronger than what's made today, with \nlittle or no waste to pollute the environment.\n  Moreover, and this is even more important given our struggling \neconomy, America risks missing an economic revolution based on \nnanotechnology. With much of nanotechnology existing in a research \nmilieu, venture capitalists are already investing $1 billion in \nAmerican nanotech interests this year alone. It's estimated that \nnanotechnology will become a trillion-dollar industry over the next 10 \nyears. As nanotechnology grows, the ranks of skilled workers needed to \ndiscover and apply its capabilities must grow too. In the \nnanotechnology revolution, areas of high unemployment could become \nmagnets for domestic production, engineering and research for \nnanotechnology applications--but only if government doesn't miss the \nboat.\n  Our country's National Nanotechnology Initiative is a step in the \nright direction. This Nation has already committed substantial funds to \nnanotechnology research and development in the coming years. But \nfunding is not enough. There must be careful planning to make sure that \nmoney is used for sound science over the long-term. That is the reason \nfor the legislation I am issuing today. The strategic planning it \nprescribes will ensure that scientists get the support they need to \nrealize nanotechnology's greatest potential.\n  In 1944 the visionary President Franklin Delano Roosevelt requested a \nleading American scientist's opinion on advancing the United States' \nscientific efforts to benefit the world. Dr. Vannevar Bush offered his \nreply to President Harry S Truman the next year, following FDR's death. \nIn his report to the President, Dr. Bush wrote, ``The Government should \naccept new responsibilities for promoting the flow of new scientific \nknowledge and the development of scientific talent in our youth. These \nresponsibilities are the proper concern of the Government, for they \nvitally affect our health, our jobs, and our national security. It is \nin keeping also with basic United States policy that the Government \nshould foster the opening of new frontiers and this is the modern way \nto do it.''\n  Those principles, so true nearly 60 years ago, are truer still today. \nI propose that the government now accept new responsibilities in \npromoting and developing nanatechnology. I am pleased to be joined on \nthis legislation by Senators Allen, Lieberman, Mikulski, Hollings, \nLandrieu, Clinton, and Levin. I ask unanimous consent that this \nstatement be entered in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 190. A bill to establish the Director of National Intelligence as \nhead of the intelligence community, to modify and enhance authorities \nand responsibilities relating to the administration of intelligence and \nthe intelligence community, and for other purposes; to the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Intelligence \nCommunity Leadership Act of 2003. This legislation creates the position \nof Director of National Intelligence to provide budget and statutory \nauthority over coordinating our intelligence efforts. This will help \nassure that the sort of communication problems that prevented the \nvarious elements of our intelligence community from working together \neffectively before September 11 never happens again.\n  Today there are 14 different agencies and departments which make up \nthe Intelligence Community: the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the National \nReconnaissance Office, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, Army \nIntelligence, Air Force Intelligence, Marine Corps Intelligence, \nintelligence elements of the Departments of State, Treasury, Energy, as \nwell as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Coast \nGuard. Together they make up a huge network, with thousands of \nemployees and a significant, secret, budget.\n  Interestingly, there is no real head of this sprawling Community. In \nlaw the Director of Central Intelligence leads both the CIA and the \nIntelligence Community, but in practice he is unable to exercise \nmeaningful control and leadership. The Community is plagued by acute \nturf battles, incompatible information systems and uncoordinated \noperations. The present structure makes coordination and movement of \npersonnel within the Intelligence Community more difficult than it \nshould be.\n  Last Spring I offered legislation to address this problem, S. 2645, \nwhich created the position of Director of National Intelligence.\n  Since then the Joint Inquiry of the Senate and House Intelligence \nCommittees completed its investigations into the Intelligence Community \nrole in the attacks of September 11.\n  The Joint Inquiries' major recommendation was the creation of a \n``Director of National Intelligence'', DNI, with real authority to run \nthe Intelligence Community, separate from the head of the CIA, and thus \nfree from having to run both the Community and one of its major \nconstituent agencies.\n  Working with those recommendations, I have updated the bill I \nintroduced last year to reflect the Joint Inquiries' findings. The \nchanges include adding specific language to ensure that the new \nDirector of National Intelligence has meaningful and effective budget \nand personnel authority.\n  Specifically this legislation would create the new position of \nDirector of National Intelligence who would head the intelligence \ncommunity, serving at the pleasure of the President, with the proper \nand necessary authority to coordinate activities, direct priorities, \nand develop and execute the budget for our nation's national \nintelligence community.\n  The DNI would be responsible for all of the functions now performed \nby the Director of Central Intelligence in his role as head of the \nintelligence community, while a separate individual would be Director \nof the CIA.\n  Nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the DNI would \nbe empowered to create and execute the national intelligence budget in \nconjunction with the various intelligence agencies within our \ngovernment.\n  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, DCIA, freed from the \ndouble burden as head of the intelligence community, would then be able \nto concentrate on the critical missions of the CIA alone: Assure the \ncollection of intelligence from human sources, and that intelligence is \nproperly correlated, evaluated, and disseminated throughout the \nintelligence community and to decision makers.\n  I recognize that this bill will certainly not solve every problem \nwithin the intelligence community, but I believe it is an important, \nperhaps critical, first step. My hope is that introduction of this bill \nwill move the much-needed debate on Intelligence Community reform \nforward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 191. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide adequate coverage for immunosuppressive drugs furnished to \nbeneficiaries under the medicare program that have received a kidney \ntransplant, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, in introducing a bill to help organ \ntransplant patients maintain access to the life-saving drugs necessary \nto prevent their immune systems from rejecting their new organs.\n  Tragically, today over 86,000 Americans are waiting for a donor \norgan. Those individuals who are blessed to receive an organ transplant \nmust take immunosuppressive drugs every day for the life of their \ntransplant. Failure to take these drugs significantly increases the \nrisk that the transplanted organ will be rejected.\n  We need this bill, because Federal law is compromising the success of \norgan transplants. Let me explain. Right now, current Medicare policy \ndenies certain transplant patients coverage for the drugs needed to \nprevent rejection. Medicare does not pay for anti-rejection drugs for \nMedicare beneficiaries, who received their transplants prior to \nbecoming a Medicare beneficiary. So, for instance, if a person received \na transplant at age 64 through his or her health insurance plan, when \nthat person retires and relies on Medicare for health care coverage, he \nor she would no longer have immunosuppressive drug coverage.\n  Medicare only pays for anti-rejection drugs for transplants performed \nin a Medicare-approved transplant facility. However, many beneficiaries \nare completely unaware of this fact and how it can jeopardize their \nfuture coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. To receive an organ \ntransplant, a person must be very ill and many are far too ill at the \ntime of transplantation to be researching the intricate nuances of \nMedicare coverage policy.\n  End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD, patients qualify for Medicare on the \nbasis of needing dialysis. If End Stage Renal Disease patients receive \na kidney transplant, they qualify for Medicare coverage for three years \nafter the transplant. After the three years are up, they lose not only \ntheir general Medicare coverage, but also their coverage for \nimmunosuppressive drugs.\n  The amendment that Senator Durbin and I are introducing today would \nremove the Medicare limitations and make clear that all Medicare \nbeneficiaries including End Stage Renal Disease patients who have had a \ntransplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of \ntheir transplant, will be covered as long as such anti-rejection drugs \nare needed.\n  In the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and \nProtection Act, Congress eliminated the 36-month time limitation for \ntransplant recipients who both receive a Medicare eligible transplant \nand are eligible for Medicare based on age or disability. Our bill \nwould provide the same indefinite coverage to kidney transplant \nrecipients who are not Medicare-aged or Medicare-disabled.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and help those who \nreceive Medicare-eligible transplants to gain access to the \nimmunosuppressive drugs they need to live healthy, productive lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 192. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \ncriminal and civil liability for permitting an intoxicated arrestee to \noperate a motor vehicle; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould address the serious national problem of drunk driving. This bill, \nentitled ``John's Law of 2003,'' would help ensure that when drunken \ndrivers are arrested, they cannot simply get back into the car and put \nthe lives of others in jeopardy.\n  On July 22, 2000, Navy Ensign John Elliott was driving home from the \nUnited States Naval Academy in Annapolis for his mother's birthday when \nhis car was struck by another car. Both Ensign Elliott and the driver \nof that car were killed. The driver of the car that caused the \ncollision had a blood alcohol level that exceeded twice the legal \nlimit.\n  When makes this tragedy especially distressing is that this same \ndriver had been arrested and charged with driving under the influence \nof alcohol, DUI, just three hours before the crash. After\n\n[[Page S1083]]\n\nbeing processed for that offense, he had been released into the custody \nof a friend who drove him back to his car and allowed him to get behind \nthe wheel, with tragic results.\n  We need to ensure that drunken drivers do not get back behind the \nwheel before they sober up. New Jersey took steps to do this when they \nenacted John's Law at the State level. I am pleased to offer a Federal \nversion of this legislation today.\n  This bill would require States to impound the vehicle of an offender \nfor a period of at least 12 hours after the offense. This would ensure \nthat the arrestee cannot get back behind the wheel of his car until he \nis sober.\n  Further, the bill would require States to ensure that if a DUI \noffender arrestee is released into the custody of another, that person \nmust be provided with notice of his or her potential civil or criminal \nliability for permitting the arrestee's operation of a motor vehicle \nwhile intoxicated. While this bill does not create new liability under \nFederal law, notifying such individuals of their prospective liability \nunder State law should encourage them to act responsibly.\n  John's Law of 2003 is structured in a manner similar to other Federal \nlaws designed to promote highway safety, such as laws that encourage \nStates to enact tough drunk driving standards. Under the legislation, a \nportion of Federal highways funds would be withheld from States that do \nnot comply. Initially, this funding could be restored if States move \ninto compliance. Later, the highway funding forfeited by one State \nwould be distributed to other States that are in compliance. Experience \nhas shown that the threat of losing highway funding is very effective \nin ensuring that States comply.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation would help make our \nroads safer and save many lives. I hope my colleagues will support it, \nand I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res 4. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with profound honor and reverence \nthat I,\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\ntogether with my friend and colleague, Senator Feinstein, introduce a \nbipartisan constitutional amendment to permit Congress to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the American flag.\n  The American flag serves as a symbol of our great Nation. The flag \nrepresents, in a way nothing else can, the common bond shared by an \notherwise diverse people. As a sponsor and long-time supporter of the \nproposed constitutional amendment to protect the American flag, I am \nvery pleased, but not surprised, by the way Americans have been waving \nthe flag as a symbol of solidarity following the September 11 attacks \nof 2001. The emotion that Americans feel when they see the stars and \nstripes confirms my view that the flag is much more than a piece of \ncloth--it is a unifying force that represents the common core ideals \nall Americans share. Whatever our differences of party, race, religion, \nor socio-economic status, the flag reminds us that we are very much one \npeople, united in a shared destiny, bonded in a common faith in our \nnation.\n  More than a decade ago, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens \nreminded us of the significance of our unique emblem when he wrote:\n\n       A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and \n     national unity. It also signifies the ideas that characterize \n     the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the \n     special history that has animated the growth and power of \n     those ideas. . . . So it is with the American flag. It is \n     more than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, \n     and the gifts of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling \n     colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of \n     equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill \n     for other peoples who share our aspirations.\n\n  Throughout our history, the flag has captured the hearts and minds of \nall types of people--ranging from school teachers to union workers, \ntraffic cops, grandmothers, and combat veterans. In 1861, President \nAbraham Lincoln called our young men to put their lives on the line to \npreserve the Union. When Union troops were beaten and demoralized, \nGeneral Ulysses Grant ordered a detachment of men to make an early \nmorning attack on Lookout Mountain in Tennessee. When the fog lifted \nfrom Lookout Mountain, the rest of the Union troops saw the American \nflag flying and cheered with a newfound courage. This courage \neventually led to a nation of free men--not half-free and half-slave.\n  In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt called on all Americans to \nfight the aggression of the Axis powers. After suffering numerous early \ndefeats, the free world watched in awe as five Marines and one sailor \nraised the American flag on Iwo Jima. Their undaunted, courageous act, \nfor which three of the six men died, inspired the Allied troops to \nattain victory over fascism.\n  In 1990, President Bush called on our young men and women to go to \nthe Mideast for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. After an \nunprovoked attack by the terrorist dictator Saddam Hussein on the \nKingdom of Kuwait, American troops, wearing arm patches with the \nAmerican flag on their shoulders, led the way to victory. General \nNorman Schwarzkopf addressed a joint session of Congress describing the \nAmerican men and women who fought for the ideals symbolized by the \nAmerican flag:\n\n       [W]e were Protestants and Catholics and Jews and Moslems \n     and Buddhists, and many other religions, fighting for a \n     common and just cause. Because that's what your military is. \n     And we were black and white and yellow and brown and red. And \n     we noticed that when our blood was shed in the desert, it \n     didn't separate by race. It flowed together.\n\n  General Schwarzkopf then thanked the American people for their \nsupport, stating:\n\n       The prophets of doom, the naysayers, the protesters and the \n     flag-burners all said that you wouldn't stick by us, but we \n     knew better. We knew you'd never let us down. By golly, you \n     didn't.\n\n  The pages of our history show that when this country has called our \nyoung men and women to serve under the American flag from Lookout \nMountain to Iwo Jima to Kuwait, they have given their blood and lives. \nThe crosses at Arlington, the Iwo Jima memorial, and the Vietnam \nMemorial honor those sacrifices. But there were those who did not.\n  In 1984, Greg Johnson led a group of radicals in a protest march in \nwhich he doused an American flag with kerosene and set it on fire as \nhis fellow protestors chanted: ``America, the red, white, and blue, we \nspit on you.'' Sadly, the radical extremists, most of whom have given \nnothing, suffered nothing, and who respect nothing, would rather burn \nand spit on the American flag than honor it.\n  Contrast this image with the deeds of Roy Benavidez, an Army Sergeant \nfrom Texas, who led a helicopter extraction force to rescue a \nreconnaissance team in Vietnam. Despite being wounded in the leg, face, \nback, head, and abdomen by small arms fire, grenades, and hand-to-hand \ncombat with vicious North Vietnamese soldiers, Benavidez held off the \nenemy and carried several wounded to the helicopters, until finally \ncollapsing from a loss of blood. Benavidez earned the Medal of Honor. \nWhen Benavidez was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, the honor \nguard placed an American flag on his coffin and then folded it and gave \nit to his widow. The purpose of Roy Benavidez' heroic sacrifice--and \nthe purpose of the American people's ratification of the First \nAmendment--was not to protect the right of radicals like Greg Johnson \nto burn and spit on the American flag.\n  The American people have long distinguished between the First \nAmendment right to speak and write one's political opinions and the \ndisrespectful, and often violent, physical destruction of the flag. For \nmany years, the people's elected representatives in Congress and 49 \nstate legislatures passed statutes prohibiting the physical desecration \nof the flag. Our founding fathers, Chief Justice Earl Warren, and \nJustice Hugo Black believed these laws to be completely consistent with \nthe First Amendment's protection of the spoken and written word and not \ndisrespectful, extremist conduct.\n\n  In 1989, however, the Supreme Court abandoned the history and intent \nof the First Amendment to embrace a philosophy that made no distinction \nbetween oral and written speech about the flag and extremist, \ndisrespectful destruction of the flag. In Texas v. Johnson, five \nmembers of the Court, for the first time ever, struck down a flag \nprotection statute. The majority argued that the First Amendment had \nsomehow changed and now prevented a state from protecting the American \nflag from radical, disrespectful, and violent actions. When Congress \nresponded with a federal flag protection statute, the Supreme Court, in \nUnited States v. Eichman, used its new and changed interpretation of \nthe First Amendment to strike it down by another five-to-four vote.\n  Under this new interpretation of the First Amendment, it is assumed \nthat the people, their elected legislators, and the courts can no \nlonger distinguish between expressions concerning the flag that are \nmore akin to spoken and written expression and expressions that \nconstitute the disrespectful physical desecration of the flag. Because \nof this assumed inability to make such distinctions, it is argued that \nall of our freedoms to speak and write political ideas are wholly \ndependent on Greg Johnson's newly created ``right'' to burn and spit on \nthe American flag.\n  This ill-advised and radical philosophy fails because its basic \npremise--that laws and judges cannot distinguish between political \nexpression and disrespectful physical desecration--is so obviously \nfalse. It is precisely this distinction that laws and judges did in \nfact make for over 200 years. Just as judges have distinguished which \nlaws and actions comply with the constitutional command to provide \n``equal protection of the laws'' and ``due process of law,'' so too \nhave judges been able to distinguish between free expression and \ndisrespectful destruction.\n  Certainly, extremist conduct such as smashing in the doors of the \nState Department may be a way of expressing one's dissatisfaction with \nthe nation's foreign policy objectives. And one may even consider such \nbehavior speech. Laws, however, can be enacted preventing such actions \nin large part because there are peaceful alternatives that can be \nequally powerful. After all, right here in the United States Senate, we \nprohibit speeches or demonstrations of any kind, even the silent \ndisplay of signs or banners, in the public galleries.\n  Moreover, it was not this radical philosophy of protecting \ndisrespectful destruction that the people elevated to the status of \nconstitutional law. Such an extremist philosophy was never\n\n[[Page S1085]]\n\nratified. Such a philosophy is not found in the original and historic \nintent of the First Amendment. Thus, in this Senator's view, the \nSupreme Court erred in Texas v. Johnson and in United States v. \nEichman.\n  Since Johnson and Eichman, constitutional scholars have opined that \nan attempt by Congress to protect the flag with another statute would \nfail in light of the new interpretation currently embraced by the \nSupreme Court. Thus, an amendment is the only legal means to protect \nthe flag.\n  This amendment affects only the most radical forms of conduct and \nwill leave untouched the current constitutional protections for \nAmericans to speak their sentiments in a rally, to write their \nsentiments to their newspaper, and to vote their sentiments at the \nballot box. The amendment simply restores the traditional and historic \npower of the people's elected representatives to prohibit the radical \nand extremist physical desecration of the flag.\n  Restoring legal protection to the American flag will not place us on \na slippery slope to limit other freedoms. No other symbol of our bi-\npartisan national ideals has flown over the battlefields, cemeteries, \nfootball fields, and school yards of America. No other symbol has \nlifted the hearts of ordinary men and women seeking liberty around the \nworld. No other symbol has been paid for with so much blood of our \ncountrymen. The American people have paid for their flag, and it is our \nduty to let them protect it.\n  This amendment offers Senators, from both sides of the aisle, the \nopportunity to stand united for the protection of the sacred symbol of \nour nation.\n  Restoring legal protection to the American flag is not, nor should it \nbe, a partisan issue. More than 40 Senators, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, have already joined with Senator Feinstein and myself as \noriginal cosponsors of this amendment. I am pleased that this amendment \nhas the unqualified support of our distinguished colleagues: Senators \nTed Stevens; Zell Miller; John McCain; John B. Breaux; Larry E. Craig; \nJohn E. Ensign; Richard G. Lugar; Blanche Lincoln; Max Baucus; \nChristopher S. Bond; Trent Lott; Ernest F. Hollings; Mark Dayton; Jeff \nSessions; E. Benjamin Nelson; James M.

Shelby; Olympia J. \nSnowe; Lindsey Graham; John Cornyn; James Talent; Lamar Alexander; Ben \nNighthorse Campbell.\n  Polls have shown that 80 percent of the American people want the \nopportunity to vote to protect their flag. Numerous organizations from \nthe American Legion to the Women's War Veterans to the African-American \nWomen's clergy all support the flag protection amendment. All 50 State \nlegislatures have passed resolutions calling for constitutional \nprotection for the flag.\n  I am, therefore, proud to rise today to introduce a constitutional \namendment that would restore to the people's elected representatives \nthe right to protect our unique national symbol, the American flag, \nfrom acts of physical desecration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the proposed amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  I am very honored to be a cosponsor with my dear friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein. I appreciate the effort and unwavering \nsupport she has put forth in this battle. I am proud and privileged to \nbe able to work with her.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Res. 22\n\n       Whereas all students, no matter where they live, should \n     receive the highest quality education possible, and Congress \n     and the President enacted the No Child Left Behind Act of \n     2001 (Public Law 107-110) to ensure high academic standards \n     and the tools and resources to meet those standards;\n       Whereas the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 imposes many \n     new requirements and challenges for States, school districts, \n     and individual educators;\n       Whereas many States and school districts are struggling to \n     understand the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act \n     of 2001, even as additional regulations and guidance continue \n     to be forthcoming from the Department of Education;\n       Whereas the small size, remoteness, and lack of resources \n     of many rural schools pose potential additional problems in \n     implementing the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001;\n       Whereas many rural schools and school districts have very \n     small numbers of students, such that the performance of a few \n     students on the assessments required by the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001 can determine the progress or lack of \n     progress of that school or school district;\n       Whereas the small number of students in many rural schools \n     can make the disaggregation of testing results difficult and \n     even statistically unreliable;\n       Whereas some of the options created for students attending \n     failing schools, including the choice to attend another \n     public school and the availability of supplemental tutoring \n     services, simply may not be available in rural areas or may \n     be prohibitively expensive due to the cost of transportation \n     over long distances;\n       Whereas many rural schools already have shortages of \n     teachers in key subject areas, rural teachers frequently \n     teach in multiple subject areas, and rural teachers tend to \n     be older, and lower paid than their urban counterparts;\n       Whereas many experienced teachers and paraprofessionals in \n     rural schools may not meet the definition of ``highly \n     qualified'' in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and rural \n     school districts will have difficulty competing with large \n     school districts in recruiting and retaining quality \n     teachers;\n       Whereas the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 imposes many \n     new requirements on schools and school districts, but the \n     President's budget request for fiscal year 2003 does not \n     provide the level of funding needed and authorized to meet \n     those requirements and in fact cuts funding by $90,000,000 \n     for programs contained in the No Child Left Behind Act of \n     2001; and\n       Whereas a majority of the States are being forced to cut \n     budgets and local governments are also struggling with \n     revenue shortfalls that make it difficult to provide the \n     increased resources necessary to implement the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001 in the absence of adequate federal \n     funding: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Secretary of Education should provide the maximum \n     flexibility possible in assisting predominantly rural States \n     and school districts in meeting the unique challenges \n     presented to them by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 \n     (Public Law 107-110);\n       (2) the President should, in his fiscal year 2004 budget \n     request, request the full levels of funding authorized under \n     the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 for all programs, \n     including the Rural Education Achievement Program (20 U.S.C. \n     7341 et seq.); and\n       (3) it is the sense of the Senate that, if the President \n     does not request and Congress does not provide full funding \n     for the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 in fiscal year 2004, \n     Congress should suspend the enforcement of the implementation \n     of the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 \n     until full funding is provided.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I am submitting a Sense of the \nSenate Resolution that expresses my concerns about the implementation \nof the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  I supported this law when it was passed by the Senate with \noverwhelming bipartisan support, and I still support it. In general, I \nthink it is very appropriate and important for us as a Nation to demand \nvery high standards of performance from our schools and to identify \nthose schools that\n\n[[Page S1086]]\n\nshould be doing better and give them the assistance they need to \nimprove.\n  Having said that, I do have concerns that a lack of adequate funding \nand a potential lack of flexibility in the implementation of this new \nlaw could set out public schools up for failure, and that is wrong. All \nof us have an obligation, as parents, educators, concerned citizens, \nand policymakers, to get the implementation of this law right.\n  Nationwide, about 25 percent of public schools are rural. In North \nDakota, fully 89 percent of our public school districts are rural. The \nNo Child Left Behind Act imposes many new requirements that will be \nchallenging for all States and schools to meet. However, rural school \ndistricts face unique challenges that are compounded by the small size, \nremoteness, and lack of resources facing many rural schools.\n  Rural educators in my State have pointed out a number of unique \nconcerns facing them. For example, many rural school districts in North \nDakota have very small numbers of students. The poor performance of \njust a few students on the tests required by the No Child Left Behind \nAct could result in a school being identified as needing improvement, \neven when most of the students are performing very well.\n  In addition, some of the options created under the No Child Left \nBehind Act for students attending schools identified for improvement \nsimply may not be available in rural areas. For instance, most of the \nschool districts in my State only include one school, so another public \nschool choice is not an option. Likewise, the distance to the next \nnearest school district may be impractical or the cost of \ntransportation may be prohibitively expensive. Similar concerns exist \nwith the availability of supplemental tutoring services.\n  Many rural schools already have shortages of teachers in key subject \nareas, even though rural instructors frequently tech in multiple \nsubject areas. Some of the experienced teachers and paraprofessionals \nin rural schools may not meet the new ``highly qualified'' requirements \nof the No Child Left Behind Act, and it will be very difficult for \nrural school districts to complete with large school districts in \nrecruiting and retaining quality teachers.\n  I believe the No Child Left Behind Law provides States with the \nflexibility that is needed to address these and other concerns, if the \nDepartment of Education allows States to use that flexibility and the \nStates take advantage of it. As President Bush himself said last week, \n``One size doesn't fit all when it comes to public education.''\n  Of course, the other ingredient that is needed is funding. Even with \nthe necessary flexibility, if schools do not have the resources to make \nneeded reforms, they will not be able to improve.\n  When the Congress and the President last year reached bipartisan \nagreement on the No Child Left Behind Act, we agreed on the levels of \nfunding that would be necessary to meet the new expectations and \nrequirements. That law authorizes $31 billion for the No Child Left \nBehind Act in fiscal year 2003, a $9 billion increase over the fiscal \nyear 2002 level.\n  Unfortuantely, barely a month after this legislation was signed into \nlaw, the President sent to Congress a budget that no only did not fully \nfund the increases in the No Child Left Behind Act, it actually cut \nfunding by $90 million.\n  One cut of particular concern to me is the President's proposal to \neliminate funding for the Rural Education Achievement Program, REAP, \nwhich was funded in fiscal year 2002 at $162.5 million. REAP funding is \nparticularly important because it is targeted at small, rural districts \nthat do not receive large enough amounts of money through the \nindividual federal formula ``title programs'' to make substantive \nchanges or investments. In addition, because small rural districts \noften lack the administrative staff to apply for competitive grants \nfrom the State and Federal level, they receive a smaller proportion of \nfederal dollars then their suburban or urban counterparts.\n  For many rural school districts, REAP will mean an additional $20,000 \nto $60,000 in new funding that will help them to meet the challenges of \nimplementing the No Child Left Behind Act. While this may not seem like \nmuch funding to an urban or suburban district, to a small rural \ndistrict it makes a real impact.\n  As Congress completes work on the fiscal year 2003 Education \nappropriations bill, I hope we will provide the $31 billion authorized \nin No Child Left Behind. I understand that Senator Harkin plans to \noffer an amendment to bring the funding level up to the authorized \namount. Given that the No Child Left Behind Act was passed by the \nSenate by an 87-10 vote, I would hope and expect that Senator Harkin's \namendment would receive similarly strong bipartisan support.\n  However, my Sense of the Senate resolution also calls on President \nBush to request the authorized level of funding of $34 billion in his \nfiscal year 2004 budget he will send to Congress next month, and it \ncalls on Congress to appropriate that level of funding in fiscal year \n2004.\n  If full funding is not provided in fiscal year 2004, my resolution \nexpresses the ``Sense of the Senate'' that enforcement of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act should be suspended. A moratorium on enforcement is not \nmy preference. Our children would be much better off if Congress and \nthe President simply lived up to their commitment to provide the level \nof funding and flexibility needed to implement this law correctly. That \nshould be our goal.\n  However, without this funding, we are simply imposing an enormous \n``unfunded mandate'' on states and local school districts. The reality \nis that the budget crises facing just about every state and local \ngovernment make it virtually impossible for states and local \ngovernments to make up for the lack of resources from the federal \ngovernment.\n  Fundamentally, this can be a good law, and I think it would be a \nshame, and irresponsible to our children, if it cannot be implemented \nproperly because Congress did not provide the resources it said it \nwould.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 23--SUPPORTING A DECISION OF THE UNITED STATES COURT \n OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT RELATING TO THE ADMISSIONS POLICY OF \n                       THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Graham of Florida) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 23\n\n       Whereas racial and ethnic diversity has far-reaching \n     benefits for all students, nonminorities and minorities \n     alike;\n       Whereas racial and ethnic diversity increases the range of \n     ideas and perspectives raised in the classroom, generates \n     complex thinking, and prepares students to become \n     participants in a pluralistic democratic society;\n       Whereas racial and ethnic diversity has a positive effect \n     on students' intellectual and personal development because \n     such diversity causes students to challenge stereotypes, \n     broaden perspectives, and sharpen critical thinking skills;\n       Whereas a study done in 2000 by the American College on \n     Education and the American Association of University \n     Professors found that students and faculty believe that \n     having multiracial and multiethnic student populations has a \n     positive effect on students' cognitive and personal \n     development;\n       Whereas in 1955, 1 year after the Supreme Court decided \n     Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), less than 5 \n     percent of college students in the United States were \n     African-American;\n       Whereas by 1990, because of affirmative action and other \n     initiatives, over 11 percent of college students in the \n     United States were African-American;\n       Whereas after the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fifth Circuit ruled, in Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th \n     Cir. 1996), that the University of Texas Law School's \n     affirmative action program was unconstitutional, Latino and \n     African-American admissions to the law school plummeted by 64 \n     percent and 88 percent, respectively;\n       Whereas after California's anti-affirmative action measure, \n     Proposition 209, took affect, law school admissions dropped \n     nearly 72 percent among African-American applicants and 35 \n     percent among Latino applicants;\n       Whereas, even with affirmative action measures there \n     continues to be significant racial disparities between the \n     enrollment rates of minority students and white students;\n       Whereas in 1978, in Regents of University of California v. \n     Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), the Supreme Court ruled that \n     campus diversity is a ``compelling governmental interest'' \n     that justifies race and ethnicity as one of many factors that \n     a university may consider in developing a diverse student \n     body;\n       Whereas the admissions policy of the University of Michigan \n     adheres to the standards set out in the landmark Bakke \n     decision;\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\n       Whereas the University of Michigan does not have racial \n     quotas for admission, and instead uses many factors to select \n     students, including race, social and economic background, \n     geographic origin, athletic ability, and a relationship to \n     alumni, as well as test scores, grades, and essay scores;\n       Whereas all of those factors help the University of \n     Michigan select a diverse well-rounded student body that is \n     not just racially diverse, but economically and \n     geographically diverse; and\n       Whereas the University of Michigan's admissions policy so \n     far has been upheld as constitutional by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in the case of \n     Grutter v. Bollinger, 288 F.3d 732 (6th Cir. 2002): Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate--\n       (1) strongly supports the decision of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in the case of \n     Grutter v. Bollinger; and\n       (2) authorizes and instructs the Senate Legal Counsel to \n     appear as amicus curiae in that case, in the name of the \n     Senate, to defend the constitutionality of the University of \n     Michigan's admissions policy to ensure a diverse student \n     body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/16/senate-section/article/S1087-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Trust in Education to \n     Secure Tomorrow (TEST) for America's Future''.\n\n     SEC. __. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Declaration of Purpose and Policy.--Congress declares \n     the following:\n       (1) The security of the Nation requires the fullest \n     development of the mental resources and technical skills of \n     its young men and women. The present national security \n     emergency demands that additional and more adequate \n     educational opportunities be made available. The defense of \n     this Nation depends upon the mastery of modern techniques \n     developed from complex scientific principles. It depends as \n     well upon the discovery and development of new principles, \n     new techniques, and new knowledge.\n       (2) We must increase our efforts to identify and educate \n     more of the talent of our Nation. This requires programs that \n     will correct as rapidly as possible the existing imbalances \n     in our educational system and will give assurance that no \n     student of ability will be denied an opportunity for higher \n     education because of financial need.\n       (3) Congress reaffirms the principle and declares that the \n     States and local communities have and must retain control \n     over and primary responsibility for public education. The \n     national interest requires, however, that the Federal \n     Government give assistance to education for programs which \n     are important to our defense.\n       (4) To meet the present emergency requires additional \n     effort at all levels of government. It is therefore the \n     purpose of this division to provide substantial assistance in \n     various forms to individuals, and to States and their \n     subdivisions, in order to insure trained manpower of \n     sufficient quality and quantity to meet the national defense \n     needs of the United States.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In fiscal year 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act of \n     2001 (Public Law 107-110) was funded at $22,195,000,000. The \n     Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2003, \n     as submitted to Congress, proposes to fund the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) at $22,105,000,000.\n       (2) The size of the maximum Federal Pell Grant is \n     authorized to be $5,800, but because of insufficient funding, \n     in fiscal year 2002, the maximum Federal Pell Grant was only \n     $4,000.\n       (3) State budget deficits are having a pronounced effect on \n     State education funding and public college and university \n     tuition.\n       (4) In fiscal year 1946, the share of the Federal budget \n     dedicated to education was 10.4 percent. In fiscal year 2002, \n     the share of the Federal budget dedicated to education was \n     2.5 percent. On March 23, 1994, the United States Senate \n     unanimously resolved to increase to 10 percent by 2004 the \n     share of the Federal budget dedicated to education.\n\n     SEC. __. MEET THE PROMISE OF THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT.\n\n       In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated under \n     this Act for part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965, the following sums are \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003, \n     $4,650,000,000 for carrying out such part, to remain \n     available through September 30, 2004: Provided, That \n     $2,325,000,000 of the amount of funding appropriated under \n     this section for part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 shall be distributed \n     according to section 1125 of such Act: Provided further, That \n     $2,325,000,000 of the amount of funding appropriated under \n     this section for part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 shall be distributed \n     according to section 1125A of such Act.\n\n     SEC. __. HELP FOR FAMILIES PAYING FOR COLLEGE.\n\n       (a) Additional Appropriations.--The following sums are \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003, \n     for an additional amount for ``Student Financial Assistance'' \n     for carrying out subpart 1 of part A of title IV of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965, $1,350,000,000 to remain \n     available through September 30, 2004.\n       (b) Maximum Pell Grant.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, the maximum Pell Grant for which a \n     student shall be eligible during award year 2003-2004 shall \n     be $4,500.\n\n     SEC. __. RESTORATION OF FUNDING FOR EDUCATION.\n\n       Section 601 of Division N shall not apply with respect to \n     programs funded under title III of Division G.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 14.
