As I have stated, \nthese amendments are being reviewed, and we will begin the process of \nscheduling votes, as necessary, on some of these amendments. As \npreviously announced, we will have a vote at 5:30 this evening on an \namendment to S. 1. We will alert all Members shortly as to which of \nthose amendments that will be. The managers will be discussing that \nshortly.\n  A number of Members have indicated they will be prepared to offer \nadditional amendments during today's session. The two managers will be \nworking with those Senators to set aside the pending amendments in \norder to consider further amendments over the course of the day. I am \nvery pleased with what we accomplished last week, including last \nFriday, at which time we had a productive day in the offering and \ninitial discussion of these amendments.\n  As we previously said, we will plan on completing action on this bill \nthis week before the recess. We will have full days and, I am sure, \nlate nights with votes until we complete action on this bill. We will \ncomplete this historic legislation prior to adjourning for the July \nFourth recess. I do encourage all Members to prepare themselves for \nwhat will be a very busy and productive week. I do thank all Members in \nadvance for their assistance this week and in participating with the \nmanagers to bring this bill to closure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/23/senate-section/article/S8323-6", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so the Senator from West Virginia \ncan offer his amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 975 and 976\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, before offering my amendments, I am \ngoing to discuss both of them because they are being reviewed, at this \npoint, in the majority cloakroom. But I am going to be offering two \namendments this afternoon in order.\n\n  The first amendment I will offer is to ensure that all Medicare \nbeneficiaries will be eligible for this new drug benefit, including \nlow-income Medicare beneficiaries who are currently eligible for \nMedicaid and Medicare. They are known as dual eligibles.\n  The underlying bill precludes Medicare beneficiaries--makes it \nimpossible for Medicare beneficiaries--who are eligible to receive a \ndrug benefit through Medicaid from, in fact, enrolling in the Medicare \ndrug benefit program.\n  This group is referred to as the dual-eligible group. They are the \npoorest seniors under Medicare. They are below 74 percent of poverty. \nThat is their income level. A disproportionate share of them--to wit, \n42 percent--are minorities. Women make up the majority of them all. \nMany are likely to have a poor education, live alone, and have more \nthan two chronic illnesses.\n  The underlying bill precludes these folks that I have just talked \nabout--these duel-eligible beneficiaries--from receiving the Medicare \ndrug benefit. As a result, this prescription drug benefit is not, in \nfact, at all a universal bill. Now, that is important in a lot of ways. \nOne is philosophical and the other is extremely practical.\n  The philosophical one is that in 1965, when we created Medicare, it \nwas created as a universal benefit to all who qualify. It was the \npromise that society made to our seniors: That if you work, if you make \nyour payroll contributions, then you, at the proper time, qualify for \nMedicare regardless of where you live, regardless of how old you might \nbe, or your income.\n  As I have noted before, the underlying legislation, for the first \ntime in the history of the Medicare Program, would prohibit some \nMedicare beneficiaries from receiving a Medicare benefit.\n  My amendment would make the Medicare prescription drug benefit a \nuniversal benefit by adopting the provisions that were, in fact, \ncontained in the tripartisan proposal introduced last summer.\n  It would eliminate the exclusion of Medicaid beneficiaries and make \nthe new Medicare Part D drug benefit--that is the new part we are \ncreating--available to all Medicare beneficiaries regardless of income. \nMedicaid would be the secondary payer for Medicare beneficiaries \neligible for Medicaid wrapping around this new Part D drug benefit and \nits low-income protections.\n  Again, this is exactly the same construction the majority of my \nRepublican colleagues supported in the Grassley-Snowe-Hatch-Jeffords-\nBreaux Medicare bill that was voted on by the full Senate last summer. \nThe National Governors Association sent a letter to Chairman Grassley \nand Senator Baucus which said the following about the exclusion of some \nof these seniors, that is, the dual-eligible seniors, those at 74 \npercent or below the poverty level, from Medicare:\n\n       The nation's Governors oppose this approach. It is not good \n     health policy. It is not good precedent. A major reason that \n     States currently have a long-run structural problem in their \n     fiscal outlook is that they have absorbed responsibility for \n     dual eligibles.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       This provision will continue to shift appropriate federal \n     costs to the states.\n\n  Governors Patton of Kentucky and Kempthorne of Idaho went on to say:\n\n       If the dual eligible populations continue to be a joint \n     responsibility, states will be forced to cut the optional \n     (Medicaid) benefits and populations--mostly women and \n     children--which are a key investment in the future.\n\n  The President agrees. In a speech he recently gave on Medicare, he \nsaid:\n\n       And all low-income seniors should receive extra help so \n     that all seniors will have the ability to choose a Medicare \n     option that includes a prescription drug benefit.\n\n  The Medicare prescription drug legislation being considered by the \nHouse of Representatives would shift the entire drug bill to Medicare. \nIt is not on a frequent day that Chairman Thomas and I are in full \nagreement. But he does say such a shift ``ensures that all seniors \nacross the country will have access to affordable prescription drugs, \nwhile alleviating much of the burden that states now confront.'' I say \nto my colleagues, as I indicate, I am not always in agreement, but we \nare going forward directly together on this policy, I hope.\n  The current system is uncoordinated and sometimes conflicting in \nterms of coverage policies. It actually creates worse health outcomes \nfor people on both Medicaid and Medicare, either one. Fully integrating \na key benefit for prescription drugs into Medicare is a critical first \nstep toward improving the current system's flaws.\n  It needs to be clearly understood by my colleagues that Medicaid in \nthe hands of Governors, which I had the honor of being at one point, is \nsubject to whatever their whims might be. It is subject to budget \npressures. Remember, they have to balance the budget. We don't; they \ndo. And they frequently do it on the backs of Medicaid beneficiaries--\nthat is, that part of these Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibles--so they \ncan increase the number of prescription drugs which are available under \nMedicaid in their State. They can change it in many ways because the \nprograms vary widely. Not only is it unfair to exclude the poorest \nseniors from part of the Medicare program, it is a raw deal for some of \nour neediest seniors.\n\n  Prescription drugs are, as I said, an optional benefit under \nMedicaid. States can and do limit the number of prescriptions. Some \nStates only cover three drugs or they could charge any copayments they \nwant. Remember, what we are looking at here is a group of people who \nare below 74 percent of poverty which is clearly in single-digit gross \nincome. So the patchwork of the benefits varies tremendously from State \nto State. For seniors who have worked all their lives, paid into the \nMedicare system, it is not fair for them to be at the mercy of State \ncoverage decisions.\n  If you look around the country right now, the fastest growing expense \nof any State is Medicaid, part of this dual-eligible conundurm, and \nthose programs are being cut. You can see it, read about it, and hear \nabout it. So it is highly volatile, and it is not safe health care \npolicy.\n  Medicare has failed in its efforts to provide comprehensive \nprescription drug coverage to seniors ever since the\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\nrepeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Act in 1988. Virtually all advances \nin drug coverage for seniors since then have been delivered not by us \nbut by the States. While at the same time the States have been cutting \nback in recent years, they have also made improvements. We have done \nnothing. They have done whatever has been done.\n  Without some long-term restructuring of the State-Federal partnership \nfor this population, this dual-eligible, 74-percent-of-poverty-minus \npopulation, much of the advances the States have made will be lost. All \nMedicare beneficiaries deserve to receive Medicare benefits. There \nshould be no exceptions for drugs. It would be very bad precedent to \nmake Medicaid pay for items that are clearly the responsibility of \nMedicare except at the present and in this bill for one particular \ndiscrete population.\n  The intention is for this amendment to be budget neutral. I would \nlike to say it is budget neutral, but I cannot in that I asked CBO for \na cost estimate last week and I do not yet have one.\n  This is a concern and an agony shared by many. Once we have this \nestimate, we will either conclude that we can go ahead because we will \nknow it is budget neutral or I will be happy to work with the chairman \nand ranking member on appropriate offsets.\n  I urge my colleagues to provide all the seniors in their States with \nthe benefit of real Medicaid drug benefit by supporting this amendment.\n  I will at the appropriate time ask that it be acted upon. I am \nawaiting a particular series of sheets of paper but in the meantime, in \nthe minute or so that will require, I send to the desk an amendment and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Graham of Florida, Ms. Mikulski, \n     Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered \n     976.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To treat costs for covered drugs as incurred costs without \n regard to whether the individual or another person, including a State \n    program or other third-party coverage, has paid for such costs)\n\n       On page 51, strike lines 15 through 25 and insert the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\n       ``(ii) such costs shall be treated as incurred without \n     regard to whether the individual or another person, including \n     a State program or other third-party coverage, has paid for \n     such costs.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to proceed with the amendment \nI was going to offer first but which will be my second amendment. That \nalso will await the decision of the leadership.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor again to offer an amendment that \nwill ensure that contributions made on a beneficiary's behalf by their \nformer employers count toward that beneficiary meeting the catastrophic \nlimit. Let me just say, as I begin this, in our Finance Committee \ndeliberations, it was this amendment which caused more stir, more \nangst, more sense of, oh, my heavens, we have not really done this, \nhave we? We could not have made this mistake involving this many \npeople. The amendment was handled in Finance--without success, from my \npoint of view. Nevertheless, I was urged by colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to bring this amendment to the floor because it has enormous \nimplications. That will become apparent, hopefully, as I complete my \nstatement.\n  This amendment is needed to protect the existing coverage of \nliterally millions and millions of retirees who have earned drug \ncoverage through their employer. That means they have been employed \nmuch of their lives by their employer and they have now retired and \nthey are Medicare beneficiaries and the employer gave retiree benefits. \nWe are accustomed to this in chemical, steel, and many other \nindustries. But there is a problem that has arisen.\n  As much as we want to provide a new drug benefit for these seniors, \nwe should not disrupt the basically foundational employer-provided drug \ncoverage so many seniors have today. It is the largest source of drug \ncoverage in the country and it is an honorable and a good one. It would \nbe a very great mistake for my colleagues to walk away from this system \nand one that we would all very much regret.\n  Mr. President, in saying that employer-sponsored retiree health \nbenefits are the largest single source of coverage for retirees, I \nsimply say that one in every three Medicare beneficiaries is affected \nby the amendment I am now discussing. They will either lose their \ncoverage or they will not, depending upon how this amendment is \ndisposed.\n  Drug costs constitute 40 to 60 percent of employers' retiree health \ncare costs. That is a lot. And steep price increases are prompting \nemployers to, one, eliminate drug benefits in some circumstances; \nsecondly, cap their contributions; thirdly, drop retiree coverage \naltogether. We all know this is a phenomenon of American life that has \nbeen going on in recent years.\n  Employers need immediate relief for their retiree prescription drug \ncosts. A Medicare prescription drug benefit should relieve some of the \nburden on employers by covering a retiree's cost after a certain \ncatastrophic limit. I recognize this gets technical, but it is \nprofound. Instead, this benefit extends the amount of time before a \nretiree reaches that catastrophic benefit of about $4,000 by not being \nable to count as the employee's contribution--in fact, the employer's \ncontribution toward that end is very substantial. Therefore, the \nemployer receives no real relief from this benefit and is forced to \ndrop the coverage they currently provide their retirees, leaving \nMedicare to pay the entire cost.\n  I think I do not have to explain that that means the Federal \nGovernment has to pick up even more of the cost of Medicare and \nprescription drugs than would otherwise be the case, for example, if \nthis amendment were to pass.\n  The bill we are considering on the floor today exacerbates the \ncurrent downward trend in retiree benefits by extending the amount of \ntime the beneficiary relies on the employer before reaching the \ncatastrophic limit. What does that say? It says if you extend the \namount of time the employee has to keep paying and paying toward his \ncatastrophic limit for a much longer time, there is therefore much more \nout-of-pocket costs to the employee.\n  This legislation discriminates against Medicare beneficiaries with \nemployer-provided coverage with a trick definition--that is what is \nused--of out-of-pocket costs known, uninterestingly, as the ``true'' \nout-of-pocket costs. This plan would not allow any spending by \nemployers to count toward meeting the catastrophic limit. In this way, \nthe underlying legislation limits the overall spending by the Medicare \nProgram at the expense of employers who offer retiree coverage.\n  The result is CBO estimates, as I indicated, that 37 percent of \nbeneficiaries currently receiving a drug benefit from their employee \nwill lose that coverage. Additionally, it extends the amount of time, \nas I have indicated, a beneficiary has to reach the catastrophic limit, \nexposing them to additional and more and more costs. I think we should \nall agree that one of the goals of this legislation should be to \nencourage employers who are currently providing drug coverage to their \nretirees to continue, in fact, to do so. It should reward and \nstrengthen those employers because the benefit they are providing goes \na long way toward helping American seniors afford prescription drugs. \nThe legislation should not force employers to drop their coverage by \nmaking their contribution on a beneficiary's behalf meaningless or, \nrather, by not concluding that the employer's contribution as part of \nthe retiree's expenditures counts toward the catastrophic limit. In \nother words, simply take what the employer contributes to this, include \nthat on top of what the employee contributes, and you have a much \nbetter count toward the money that is spent toward getting to the \ncatastrophic limit and the rate at which you get there.\n  Without adoption of my amendment, this plan penalizes employers who \nare trying to do the right thing by providing retiree health benefits. \nIt is not in anybody's best interest for employers to decide that \ncontributions for prescription drug coverage just keep retirees from \nreaching the catastrophic drug limit. Without modifying how employer \ncontributions are treated under this legislation, we are ultimately \nthreatening retiree coverage and driving millions more seniors to \nobtain Medicare coverage from their employers.\n  My amendment removes the so-called true out-of-pocket concept and \nreplaces it with a real out-of-pocket concept which better reflects the \nseniors' true drug spending. According to CBO, the true out-of-pocket \napproach is a significant component of why employers drop coverage. \nAgain, the underlying bill is the reason why 37 percent of those \ncovered by their employers will be dropped. That I am trying to \neliminate. Therefore, eliminating the true out-of-pocket expenses will \ngo a long way toward keeping employers in the business of providing \ndrug coverage for their retirees.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. I expect \nthat the retirees in our States may well end up with a less \ncomprehensive or more expensive prescription drug benefit as a result \nof this legislation should we fail to adopt this amendment.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia raises an \nimportant point in his amendment. In the underlying bill from the \nSenate Finance Committee, beneficiaries who are enrolled in both \nMedicaid and Medicare--and this is the group we call dual eligibles--\nwould continue to receive drug coverage under the Medicaid Program.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that by having dual eligibles \nremain in the Medicaid Program, Congress is thus treating these \nvulnerable seniors as second-class citizens and subjecting them to \nlower quality benefits. I strongly disagree with that point of view.\n  I have worked closely with my Finance Committee colleagues on the \ndevelopment of this package, and we had an opportunity during this \ndebate to reflect on the concerns that were\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\nraised by the Senator from West Virginia and also by others during the \ndebate last summer of the so-called tripartisan bill, meaning the bill \nthat was before the Senate in 2002.\n  All of us authoring the underlying bill took these concerns to heart. \nWe made the decision that it was most beneficial to these seniors to \ncontinue to build off the existing Medicare and Medicaid low-income \nassistance programs that they know and understand.\n  That said, I remind my colleagues that the intent of this legislation \nis to expand prescription drug coverage to our senior citizens who do \nnot have access to the prescription drugs and who are faced with paying \na large share of their income for their drug coverage.\n  About two-thirds of the citizens of the United States today have some \ncoverage for prescription drugs. Retirees from major corporations have \nprescription drugs paid for in their retirement plans. We have people \nwho are in Medicare plus their Medigap policies that also have some \ncoverage, and then we have lower income people who are dual eligibles \nwho are covered under both Medicare and Medicaid. This makes up 60-some \npercent of the seniors of America who have some drug coverage.\n\n  We want to fill in the gap for those who do not have drug coverage or \nmight have inadequate drug coverage. Quite frankly, for people who \nalready have drug coverage, particularly those who have lower incomes, \nwho are covered by State Medicaid Programs, we felt it was best not to \nupset their coverage, not to give that group any angst about how they \nmight be covered in the future while the debate on this legislation was \ngoing on and how it might be put in motion, so we decided just to leave \nthose as is.\n  The Senator from West Virginia believes it would be better if we \nwould cover them under our plans that are meant for people who have no \ncoverage whatsoever.\n  We are in a situation where coverage experienced by those who are \ndual eligible is the issue before us. These seniors currently have drug \nbenefits through the Medicaid Program. In fact, many advocates and \nbeneficiaries describe these benefits as very generous. Medicaid \nbeneficiaries have come to know their drug benefits, along with its \nnominal levels of cost sharing. We should not require seniors to leave \ncoverage with which they are comfortable.\n  Further, I remind my colleagues that we are discussing populations \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Medicaid was created to assist \nindividuals who do not have the means to pay for their share of health \ncare costs. That is a responsibility that is shared by the Federal \nGovernment and by State governments. Medicaid pays for many benefits \nthat Medicare does not.\n  Is the purpose of the prescription drug bill before us to grant \nfiscal relief to the States, which would be what the amendment of the \nSenator from West Virginia would do? I do not believe that is what we \nshould be doing.\n  We all know the purpose of the prescription drug bill is to provide \nprescription drugs to seniors who do not currently have access to drugs \nor otherwise would be paying extremely high drug costs and, hence, the \nprovisions of our legislation for catastrophic coverage.\n  However, recognizing the costs associated with covering the cost of \nproviding prescription drug coverage to dual-eligible populations, the \nbill before us does provide nearly $18 billion in new Federal dollars \nto compensate States for some of these additional costs, mostly because \nit is a fast growing part of the Medicaid budgets of most States.\n  The funding we provide in this bill will be channeled to States by \nfederalizing the cost of Part B premiums for dual eligibles in a \nsubclass called qualified Medicare beneficiaries. This is because the \nprescription drug bill before us provides minimum standards that ensure \nthe benefit provided through Medicaid is at the same high quality that \nis being provided through Part D of our Medicare Program.\n  As is usually the case, the argument would be made yet that we should \nstill do more and perhaps serve this population differently than we do. \nBut, in fact, we developed the underlying bill to best utilize the \navailability of $400 billion, an absolute figure that we must be in; \notherwise, we are subject to a point of order and, in a sense, instead \nof 51 votes it takes to pass this body, one could argue it would take \n60 votes. If we exceeded the $400 billion, we would have to have 60 \nvotes.\n  Our approach helps to deliver care that is consistent with current \nlaw but, most important, familiar to vulnerable beneficiaries.\n  A prime rationale behind our legislation is it really does not make \nseniors do anything they do not want to do. We set up a new Medicare \nProgram that is closer to what baby boomers have in the workplace \ntoday. They can choose that or they can choose to stay in the 1965 \nmodel Medicare.\n  People who want to stay in the 1965 model Medicare can choose \nvoluntarily to join a prescription drug program. They do not have to. \nWe wanted to help those who are in Medicaid to stay in Medicaid if they \nwanted to. They do not have to go into these new programs.\n  Finally, I remind my colleagues that the adoption of this amendment \nwill not expand coverage at all. It will simply shift the cost to the \nFederal Government and, in time, to other Medicare beneficiaries.\n  So after careful thought, because at one time we did debate \ninternally the substance of the amendment by the Senator from West \nVirginia to federalize all dual eligibles, we thought maybe we should \ninclude that in the program, but we figured it raised a lot of \nquestions from people who are already adequately covered and who seemed \nto be very satisfied.\n  Also, there are some additional costs that would subtract from what \nwe could do for those who have no coverage for prescription drugs \nwhatsoever, and in order to get the most bang for the dollar within the \n$400 billion that is in the budget for this program, we decided to \nleave the dual-eligible program alone. That is why I suggest we defeat \nSenator Rockefeller's amendment when it comes to a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator will try to answer a \nquestion, yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator, and this is in the form of a \nquestion. I fully understand the constraints of the $400 billion, as \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee indicates, and I think we all \nunderstood that to do a full prescription drug benefit, it was going to \ntake substantially more than that, particularly if one included other \nmatters. But would the Senator not agree that there are really two ways \nof looking at dual eligibles and their dependence now upon Medicaid \nwhich is paid by the States?\n  Up until the fairly recent past, States were doing very well and \nMedicaid benefits, to some degree, were expanding. I reflected on that \nas to my State. The other way of looking at it is to look at what is \nhappening to Medicaid now in the States because of the balanced \nconstitutional amendment requirements and because of the fiscal \ncondition of the States, which is getting worse every single day, and \nthe fact that Medicaid is the fastest rising cost in any State \ngovernment budget, and the fact that the States have complete control \nover what happens to the Medicaid benefit.\n  So would the Senator from Iowa not agree that if a State using \nMedicaid, which is a combination of State and Federal funds, \nnevertheless decides to cut--since that is optional within the State, \nunder the Government's control, that the Governor can cut that and \nindeed has done so, as we have been reading and hearing about, and \nindeed can limit coverage, cap coverage and therefore cut back \ntremendously on the so-called drug coverage that the chairman of the \nFinance Committee was extolling?\n  I agree that if we were in a flush time and the States were able to \nafford a good drug benefit under Medicaid and use it for that \nparticular dual-use population, the Senator is right, but I think we \nare looking now at a period of a number of years where we are not going \nto be in that situation. I think that puts the dual eligibles, 74 \npercent or less of poverty, at terrible risk, and that is not something \nI associate with my understanding of the values of the Senator from \nIowa, whom I so much respect.\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I cannot disagree with the Senator from \nWest Virginia, but I think the answer is that there are 50 different \nanswers to his question from the standpoint of there being 50 different \nStates with 50 different budget situations. So there is not just one \nanswer to his question.\n  Another way to say it is I would have to understand the situation in \n50 different States and then, in a sense, give 50 different answers. \nBut there is a recognition on the part of the Congress of what the \nSenator from West Virginia says and a response by the Federal \nGovernment to that, albeit a temporary response, when over a 2-year \nperiod of time we decided to put $20 billion of State aid to the \nStates, and we did that through the tax bill recently signed by the \nPresident of the United States, of which $10 billion was earmarked for \nMedicaid solely because the Congress understood the problems the \nSenator from West Virginia has adequately described, and then another \n$10 billion of other State aid that a State is free to use for Medicaid \nor anything else.\n  I assume some States that have very bad Medicaid fiscal problems \nmight take some more of that additional $10 billion to use for \nMedicaid.\n  In further answer to my colleague's question, what we face is the \nissue of about $16 billion a year just for drug costs. Multiply that \ntimes the 10 years we have to look ahead. That is about $160 billion, I \nbelieve, of the $400 billion which would go then for groups who are \nalready covered, detracting then from the 30-some percent of people who \nhave no prescription drug coverage.\n  We would like to fill in the gap of those who have no coverage as \nopposed to some who have very good coverage. I know it varies from \nState to State how Medicaid might cover certain groups of seniors with \nprescription drugs, but I think the Senator would say they have had a \nbetter program for sure than most people--except maybe those who are on \na corporate retirement plan, which is only about 30 percent of our \npeople--than anybody else, particularly those who have no coverage \nwhatsoever.\n  In further answer to the question of the Senator from West Virginia, \nit is a case of priorities. We have suggested those who already have \nsome coverage, and very good coverage, we would basically leave \nuntouched and then would try to use our resources for those who have no \ncoverage whatsoever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I apologize for not speaking through the Presiding \nOfficer before, but will the Senator from Iowa yield for only one \nadditional question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield for an additional question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator has responded simply by saying he would \nhave to answer it in 50 different ways because there are 50 different \nStates. To that I say yes, and all of them are either in the process of \nor will be in the process of cutting Medicaid and, therefore, the dual \nbeneficiaries.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa, is there not a further consideration, \nand that is when we are dealing with this maximum poor number of people \nunder Medicare, or Medicaid in the case of the dual eligibles, we are \nalso dealing with something which has not been discussed on this floor \nor indeed was not discussed in the Finance Committee at any length at \nall, and that is a really frightening problem of assets that, for \nexample, one can apply, one can be under this program up to 130 percent \nof poverty. Then there is another one that says you can be under this \nPart B plan up to 160 percent of poverty, but if your assets reach over \n$4,000, assets which you maintain, you are then kicked from the lower \nto the upper bracket without any discussion. There is enormous penalty, \nfor example, for owning a car, for owning anything. You would not be \nliving in rural Calhoun in West Virginia without a car. Your home is \nexempted but nothing else is.\n\n  At one point I was thinking of offering an amendment--and I may still \ndo so--exempting burial plots from the asset test that would be applied \nto poor people.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa if he would say a word on this whole \nquestion, adding to the dual eligibles and deciding if--as he said, we \nhave to pick our priorities--we are going to leave it to the States, \neven though I argue that States will cut that. Is it not also bringing \nup this whole subject of the assets of the poor families and the effect \non them if they become ineligible for the bracket in which they belong \nand, therefore, cannot afford prescription drugs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will answer the Senator's question by \ngiving some detail about the issue of the asset test. It is a \nlegitimate point of discussion as we deal with this legislation. Rather \nthan just speaking specifically to his question, I answer it more \ngenerally with how we try to respond to the issues he brought up.\n  The asset test in the underlying bill is the same asset test \ncurrently used for determining eligibilities for the qualified Medicare \nbeneficiaries, specified low-income Medicare beneficiaries, and \nqualified individuals. Those are three separate categories of low-\nincome people that I just described.\n  S. 1 provides a generous low-income subsidy for those who are below \n160 percent of the Federal poverty level. Currently, in order for some \nindividuals under 160 percent of poverty to receive limited Medicaid \nprotections, there must be both an income test and an asset test. In \nthe underlying bill, we simply follow the same rules in order for low-\nincome beneficiaries to see assistance with their prescription drug \ncoverage. By including the Medicaid asset test for Medicare \nprescription drug subsidies, we are providing beneficiaries with \nseamless health coverage. We are not confusing beneficiaries, and we \nare not adding additional administrative burdens to the States.\n  I will give some background on the current asset test included in the \nMedicaid Program. The group called qualified Medicare beneficiaries are \nindividuals below 100 percent of poverty. In 2006, the annual income \nlimit is $9,670 for individuals and $13,051 for couples. This qualified \nMedicare beneficiary group is allowed to have assets below $4,000 for \nindividuals and $6,000 for couples. That is exactly what the Senator \nfrom West Virginia asked me about and implied some limitations because \nof that.\n  Yes, there are limitations because of that, but they are legitimate \nlimitations within the priorities of our $400 billion budget limit.\n  Then we have the category of specified low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries, and then the qualified, and those are people with \nincomes between 100 percent of poverty and 135 percent of poverty. In \n2006, the annual income limits of this group, $13,054 for individuals, \n$17,618 for couples, these two groups are allowed to have assets below \n$4,000 for individuals and $6,000 for couples. Beneficiaries between \n136 percent of poverty and 159 percent of poverty will have annual \nincome limits of $15,472 for individuals and $20,881 for couples in \n2006. Beneficiaries between 136 and 159 percent of poverty would not be \nsubject to those asset rules.\n\n  Current law establishes resource limits for low-income elderly or \ndisabled individuals. Let me emphasize, this is not a newly added \nrestriction on certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries. However, \ncurrent law also provides States with the flexibility to choose to \ndisregard all or part of these resources.\n  The issue of changing this asset test is one that would very \ndrastically increase the number of eligible beneficiaries. Understand \nthat the question the Senator from West Virginia raised about changing \nthe asset test would very dramatically increase the number of people \neligible.\n  Now, again, we get back to the priorities of fitting in the $400 \nbillion in the budget. Give more help to this group of people that \nalready have some help from our legislation, then there is less for \nother people, particularly less for people who have no help whatever.\n  A study was prepared by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating this \ngroup could be as many as 11 million individuals if the asset test were \neliminated and obviously to a lesser extent if it were increased by \nsome amount.\n  S. 1 currently includes a provision requiring the General Accounting \nOffice to conduct a study and make recommendations to Congress by the \nyear 2007 regarding the extent to which drug\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\nutilization and access to covered drugs differs between qualifying dual \neligibles who receive subsidies and individuals who do not qualify \nsolely because of the application of the asset test. This report \nensures that there will be opportunities in the future to debate the \nquestion raised by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  There is a limited number of dollars available for the Medicare drug \nbenefit. In the writing of this bill, we made a conscious decision to \ndevote excess dollars to filling the gap in coverage--which means what \nwe commonly refer to around here as the donut hole--rather than \neliminating or changing to some extent the asset test the Senator from \nWest Virginia is asking me about.\n  This bill already provides generous coverage to low-income seniors. \nThis amendment will not only cost more money, it will add more \nconfusion to both States and Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I hope I have sufficiently explained the rationale behind our bill. I \nmay not have directly answered the question of the Senator from West \nVirginia, but I thought I should take time to explain the rationale \nbehind our bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to say a couple of words \nabout one of the two amendments offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia regarding the true out-of-pocket expenses, where the \nemployers' contributions to retirees' health care plans be considered \nin calculating the out-of-pocket expense that would determine when a \nsenior citizen reaches the stop loss provisions of this bill.\n  This may sound like a fairly arcane point, but it is a very important \none.\n  Let me just describe the provisions of the bill. Under the bill, \nafter a $275 deductible, the provisions of this bill require that \nemployees would receive a contribution from the Government of 50 \npercent of each prescription he or she filled, up to $4,500 in drug \nexpenses. After that amount, $4,500, then seniors would pay 100 percent \nof the costs until the beneficiary's spending reached $3,700. This \nshould not be confused with total spending, of which the beneficiary \nspent $3,700 out of his pocket. It would be $5,812.\n  Anyway, after the beneficiary spends $3,700 out of pocket, the total \nstop loss coverage kicks in and the Government picks up 90 percent of \nthe beneficiary's drug spending and the beneficiary, him or herself, \npays 10 percent.\n  The real question is, What about the employers' contributions? Would \nthey count toward the stop loss coverage? Under the underlying bill, \nall spending must be provided by the beneficiary, not on behalf of the \nbeneficiary. As a consequence, employers' contributions would not \ncount. The CBO estimates up to 37 percent of retiree health coverage \nwould therefore be dropped by employers.\n  Just to recapitulate, the amendment offered by the Senator from West \nVirginia basically provides that the stop loss amounts in the \nunderlying bill should be based on out-of-pocket costs, and the \nemployers' contribution towards retiree health benefits could count \ntowards that stop loss computation.\n  What about this? Frankly, I have a lot of sympathy for the Senator's \namendment. That is, as it currently stands, the beneficiary, a senior \ncitizen, would have to spend $3,700 before the stop loss would be \ncalculated. Under the amendment offered by the Senator from West \nVirginia, that amount would be quite a bit lower.\n  I mentioned earlier that CBO estimates about 37 percent of retirees \nwho now are covered by health plans under their employer health \ncoverage would no longer receive drug coverage because those employers \nwould drop coverage. Or, to say it differently, CBO estimates that, \nbecause the employer's contributions do not now count towards stop \nloss, about 11 percent of the seniors generally would lose their \nemployer-sponsored health coverage.\n  As I mentioned, I share my colleague's desire to prevent the loss of \nemployer-sponsored coverage; that is, to the extent possible. We have \nour work cut out for us because retiree coverage is already on the \ndecline. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation/Hewitt Study, that \nwas released last December, one in five large employers is likely to \neliminate retiree health coverage for future retirees in the next 3 \nyears.\n  That is a lot. That is irrespective of the provisions of this bill \nwith respect to prescription drug coverage. If one out of five large \nemployers in fact does eliminate retiree health coverage for their \nretirees within the next 3 years, it is going to have a huge impact, \nclearly, on those retirees, and also on the portion of the health care \nsystem that is not paid for by larger companies.\n\n  That study also found that nearly 80 percent of large employers are \nlikely to increase the amount paid directly by their employees for \nhealth care. That is, most--four-fifths of all employers--are likely to \nhave their employees pay more than they, the employers, are paying. We \nknow about the negotiations between General Electric and its employees \nnot too long ago, where both agreed to shift more of the rising cost of \nhealth care to employees. Clearly, we should be doing all we can to \nensure that a bad situation does not get worse.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, and I have been \nlooking for ways to address concern about employer-sponsored coverage. \nWe are looking at ways to make employers' participation in the new Part \nD benefit more manageable, so employers have flexibility with respect \nto the offering of these benefits. I, certainly, personally am willing \nto entertain proposals that would allow more employer coverage, and \nalso help address the out-of-pocket situation the Senator from West \nVirginia would like to cover with his amendment.\n  The slight problem we have, as most of us know, is that we are \nworking within the confines of $400 billion over 10 years. If the \namendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia were to be agreed \nto, according to CBO, that would cost approximately $65 billion. That \nis $65 billion, generally, over the $400 billion that has been set \naside for this bill. Senator Grassley and I are working with various \ngroups in and out of the Senate, trying to address the potential loss \nof employer retiree coverage. It is a great concern of ours. There have \nbeen several proposals offered as to how we might deal with that, in \naddition to the ones contained in the amendment by the Senator from \nWest Virginia. I am hopeful that during the next several days, before \nthe final passage of this bill--hopefully before the weekend--we will \nbe able to significantly address this issue. So far, we do not have it \nnailed down. But as you might expect, this and a lot of other issues \nare kind of hovering about as we try to find ways to fit the pieces \ntogether so we can get a very good bill passed.\n  I also remind my colleagues who are slightly concerned about the \ncomplexity of this bill--and this bill is somewhat complex--there was \nan interesting piece in, I think it was today's New York Times; it \nmight have been yesterday's. In any event, it was about the complexity \nof the bill and how bewildered some people are because of the \ncomplexity. I think the article did a good job in explaining why major \nsocial policy, almost by definition, is complex; that is, it is a \nresult of compromises.\n  In this case, the big compromise is between about half of this body, \nwho wants to provide prescription drug benefits under Medicare, and \nabout half of this body, who wants prescription drug benefits to be \nprovided under private competition. It is difficult to put those two \npieces together. It is the attempt to put those two pieces together \nthat has caused a lot of the complexity that does exist in this bill.\n  I might say, however, that Medicare itself is already quite complex. \nThey could come back and say: Why make something complex even more \ncomplex? But it has to be weighed against another factor. That is, do \nwe want to provide a prescription drug benefit to seniors or not? The \nchoice at the end of this week is going to be, do we want something \nthat is a little bit complex but provides prescription drug benefits \nfor seniors--and does a good job doing so? Maybe with not as many \nbenefits as\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\nsome seniors would like and some Members of this body would like, but \nstill does a pretty good job and is a bit complex. Or, on the other \nhand, do we want to do nothing? Do we want to let senior citizens \ntoday, who do not have prescription drug coverage, remain without \ncoverage? That is basically the question we are going to be facing \nlater on this week.\n  To ask the question, I think, is to answer it. Namely, we should do a \npretty good job, trying to get a pretty good bill passed, even though \nthere is some complexity, even though there are some tradeoffs, rather \nthan have nothing.\n  I suspect this body is always going to be somewhat split. I do not \nthink one party is going to be totally in control at one time or the \nother party is going to be totally in control at another time. I think \nit is the nature of the American body politic that people want to hedge \ntheir bets, that they want to have both Democrats and Republicans \nworking together. Certainly, our Founding Fathers set up our Government \nthat way under our Constitution. They absolutely distrusted power. They \ndistrusted it almost absolutely. That is why we have power dispersed by \ndefinition. That means in order to get something of consequence passed, \nthere is going to have to be some compromise. In this bill there \ncertainly is a lot of compromising.\n  A final point contained in that article--and I thought it was a \npretty good article--is that when we, in this country, have passed \nother major social policy--let's say Medicare and Social Security--it \nhas been based somewhat on faith, and we have worked to fix it, to make \nit even better after it has been passed. But you have to start \nsomewhere. And I think, certainly, we have to start somewhere with \nrespect to prescription drug benefits, and certainly, we should provide \nprescription drug benefits for seniors.\n  So I urge my colleagues to keep that in mind as we are working on \namendments, which are designed to make this bill better. We can accept \nsome amendments, but some in this body will not accept others. \nNevertheless, all of us are generally working together toward the same \ngoal.\n  In that vein, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily set aside so the Senator from Hawaii may \noffer two amendments in sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                       Amendment Nos. 980 and 979\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to offer amendment No. 980 to \nrestore Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program \neligibility for children and pregnant women who are citizens from the \nFreely Associated States and reside in the United States lawfully. The \nUnited States entered into a Compact of Free Association with the \nFederated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands \nin 1986, and with the Republic of Palau in 1994.\n  The political relationship between the United States and the FAS is \nbased on mutual support. In exchange for the United States having \nstrategic denial and a defense veto over the FAS, the United States \nprovides military and economic assistance to the RMI, FSM and Palau \nwith the goal of assisting these countries in achieving economic self-\nsufficiency following the termination of their status as U.N. Trust \nterritories. Pursuant to the Compact, FAS citizens are allowed to \nfreely enter the United States and are not considered immigrants.\n  Legal immigrants and FAS citizens lost many of their public benefits \nas a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act of 1996. I appreciate the work done by my colleague \nfrom Florida, Senator Graham, to restore the eligibility for Medicaid \nand SCHIP for legal immigrants who are children and pregnant women.\n  The language that has been included in S. 1, the Prescription Drug \nand Medicare Improvement Act, would give States the option to provide \nthis coverage and allow them to use Federal resources to do so.\n  However, the current text does not restore these benefits to citizens \nfrom the FAS lawfully residing in the United States. Arguably, FAS \ncitizens have strong ties with the United States as they come from the \ncountries that are perpetually bound to the United States in free \nassociation.\n  It is important for Congress to restore these benefits for FAS \ncitizens that were taken away from a relatively small but important \npopulation. The Congressional Research Service estimates that 11,500 \nFAS citizens have migrated to the United States since the Compact was \nenacted. They have come to the United States to seek economic \nopportunity, education, and access health care.\n  The State of Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of \nthe Northern Mariana Islands have supported FAS citizens with necessary \nhealth care services, but not without significant and increasing costs. \nThe Federal Government must provide matching resources to help States \nmeet the health care needs of FAS citizens and to meet the obligations \nof the Federal commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to restore a portion \nof the benefits that were taken away from FAS citizens in 1996.\n  Mr. President, I have another amendment, amendment No. 979, to offer \nto S. 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to offer both \namendments?\n  Mr. AKAKA. The amendments are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be advised, neither amendment \nhas been reported by the clerk.\n  Without objection, the clerk will report both amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] proposes amendments \n     numbered 980 and 979.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                             amendment 980\n\n(Purpose: To expand assistance with coverage for legal immigrants under \n   the Medicaid program and SCHIP to include citizens of the Freely \n                           Associated States]\n\n       On page 636, line 16, insert ``and citizens of the Freely \n     Associated States, which include the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the \n     Republic of Palau, lawfully residing in the United States'' \n     after ``Act''.\n\n\n                             amendment 979\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure that current prescription drug benefits to \n medicare-eligible enrollees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n                    Program will not be diminished)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . NEGOTIATIONS BY THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT.\n\n       The Office of Personnel Management may not negotiate a \n     prescription drug benefit for any health benefits plan under \n     chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, that would provide \n     a prescription drug benefit to a medicare eligible enrollee \n     in that plan that is of lesser actuarial value, based on 2003 \n     constant dollars, than the prescription drug benefit \n     available to a medicare eligible enrollee of such plan on the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, amendment No. 979 would ensure that the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program could not reduce the level of \nprescription drug coverage available to Medicare-covered Federal \ncivilian annuitants. I thank my colleague from Maryland, Senator \nMikulski, for cosponsoring the amendment.\n  I strongly support the creation of a prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare beneficiaries. Thirty-eight percent of Medicare beneficiaries \nreport that they do not have prescription drug coverage. Far too many \nseniors are unable to afford the medications that they need, and the \nestablishment of a prescription drug benefit will provide much needed \naccess to medications that our seniors desperately need.\n  However, the Congressional Budget Office believes that Medicare drug \ncoverage authorized by this bill is likely to act as an incentive for \nemployers to drop their employer-sponsored drug benefits. An estimated \n37 percent of retired workers with employer-sponsored drug benefits \ncould lose their coverage under this bill according to CBO. I am \ntroubled that older Americans who already have earned coverage through \nan employer-sponsored plan could lose their existing benefits. We have \nseen over the past few years that there has been a disturbing trend of \nreducing benefits for retirees. Creating this voluntary benefit could \nonly accelerate this trend.\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\n  The intent of the legislation is to expand prescription drug coverage \nfor seniors, not merely to shift the financial burden of existing \ncoverage to the Federal Government. If Medicare beneficiaries lose \ntheir employer-based coverage, they may have to pay more for a Medicare \ndrug benefit that provides less comprehensive coverage.\n  We must encourage employers to maintain their current coverage, and I \nwill support efforts to do so. We should not shift the existing costs \nof prescription drug coverage to the Medicare program. If this occurs, \nthere will be fewer resources available to pay for the medications of \nthose who currently need insurance.\n  My amendment will ensure that present and future Federal retirees \nretain their current level of prescription drug coverage. They should \nnot face a situation in which they must rely on Medicare. My amendment \nrequires the FEHBP to preserve current-level drug coverage for Federal \nretirees and survivors. The Government health care plan stands as a \nmodel employer-sponsored health care plan, and my amendment protects \nthe Nation's Federal annuitants and their survivors. Accepting this \namendment sends a message to other employer-sponsored plans that the \nFederal Government stands behind its commitment to retired workers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the National Association of \nRetired Federal Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union in \nsupport of my amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      The National\n\n\n                                     Treasury Employees Union,\n\n                                                    June 23, 2003.\n     RE: S.1, Medicare Drug Proposal\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the more than 150,000 federal \n     employees and retirees represented by the National Treasury \n     Employees Union (NTEU), I am writing concerning S.1, \n     legislation to provide prescription drug coverage under \n     Medicare.\n       NTEU believes legislation to provide prescription drug \n     coverage for Medicare beneficiaries is long overdue, however, \n     we have serious reservations concerning the way that this \n     benefit has been structured. The proposed new benefit would \n     provide a substantially less valuable benefit to Medicare \n     beneficiaries than many private sector employers already \n     provide for their retirees. Employers must not be permitted \n     to diminish the prescription drug coverage they provide to \n     former employees as a result of passage of this new Medicare \n     benefit. Although we do not believe that is the intent of \n     this legislation, steps must be taken to prevent this \n     unintended consequence from occurring.\n       The federal government provides health insurance benefits, \n     including prescription drug coverage, to its employees and \n     retirees through the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n     Program (FEHBP). Any proposal that would encourage, or result \n     in, the federal government moving away from its commitment to \n     its employees and retirees in this area would be strongly \n     opposed. The fact that the Congressional Budget Office has \n     reported that as many as 37 percent of retired workers would \n     lose their employer-provided drug coverage as a result of \n     passage of S.1 provides serious cause for concern.\n       Senator Akaka plans to offer an amendment that seeks to \n     address this issue. His amendment would prohibit the Office \n     of Personnel Management (OPM) from negotiating a prescription \n     drug benefit for Medicare-eligible FEHBP enrollees that is \n     less valuable than the benefit available to those enrollees \n     on the date of enactment of the pending Medicare drug \n     proposal. The Akaka amendment makes sense and is consistent \n     with the intent of the Medicare legislation--that employers \n     already providing prescription drug benefits to their \n     retirees continue to offer their existing benefits packages.\n       Our goal is two fold: to provide Medicare beneficiaries \n     with the best possible drug benefit while at the same time \n     ensuring that retirees who enjoy prescription drug coverage \n     through employer-sponsored plans retain that coverage. I urge \n     your support for the Akaka amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Colleen M. Kelley,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    Retired Federal Employees,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the 400,000 member \n     National Association of Retired Federal Employees (NARFE), I \n     am writing to endorse your amendment to S. 1, the \n     Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, that \n     would ensure that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \n     could not reduce the level of Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Program (FEHBP) prescription drug coverage currently \n     available to Medicare-covered Federal civilian annuitants \n     through negotiations with participating carriers.\n       NARFE strongly supports the creation of a Medicare drug \n     benefit for our senior citizens who have no drug coverage. \n     But at the same time, we want to ensure that no harm is done \n     to older Americans who already have earned such coverage \n     through an employer-sponsored plan. As you know, the \n     Congressional Budget Office estimates that 37 percent of \n     retired workers with employer sponsored drug benefits could \n     lose it under S. 1.\n       The CBO believes that Medicare drug coverage authorized by \n     this bill could act as an incentive to employers to drop \n     their employer-sponsored drug benefits. If that occurred, \n     retirees would be forced to pay an additional monthly premium \n     for a Medicare drug benefit that would be limited and more \n     costly than what is currently available through many \n     employer-sponsored health plans, including the FEHBP. The \n     last thing Medicare reform should do is encourage employers \n     to break promises made to their retirees regarding their \n     earned health security.\n       While the Medicare reform bill that is eventually enacted \n     may provide subsidies and tax credits to private employers \n     who retain existing drug benefits for their retirees, such \n     incentives would not apply to the Federal government, and \n     thus provides no guarantee of the FEHBP drug benefit for the \n     government's own annuitants. If FEHBP is the model for this \n     reform, the Federal government itself must not drop or reduce \n     drug benefits for FEHBP enrollees. Your amendment recognizes \n     this principle of fairness and would help to ensure that S. 1 \n     does no harm to those men and women who have served and \n     continue to do so much for our nation. NARFE commends you for \n     valuing the importance of the earned health security of the \n     more than 4 million Federal workers and annuitants and we \n     give our strongest endorsement to your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles L. Fallis,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support my \namendment and look forward to working with them to ensure drug coverage \nfor retirees under other plans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending \namendments be temporarily set aside so the Senator from Arkansas may \noffer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 981\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 981.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide equal access to competitive global prescription \n                medicine prices for American purchasers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EQUAL ACCESS TO COMPETITIVE GLOBAL PRESCRIPTION \n                   MEDICINE PRICES FOR AMERICAN PURCHASERS.\n\n       (a) Definition of Covered Product.--In this section, the \n     term ``covered product'' has the meaning given the term in \n     section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 384).\n       (b) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for the manufacturer \n     of a covered product or any other person that sells a covered \n     product to refuse to sell to any wholesaler or retailer (or \n     other purchaser representing a group of wholesalers or \n     retailers) of covered products in the United States on terms \n     (including such terms as prompt payment, cash payment, volume \n     purchase, single-site delivery, the use of formularies by \n     purchasers, and any other term that effectively reduces the \n     cost to the manufacturer of supplying the drug) that are not \n     substantially the same as the most favorable (to the \n     purchaser) terms on which the person has sold or has agreed \n     to sell the covered product to any purchaser in Canada.\n       (c) Enforcement.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, or any wholesaler or retailer in the United States \n     aggrieved by a violation of subsection (b), may bring a civil \n     action in United States district court against a person that \n     violates subsection (b) for an order--\n       (1) enjoining the violation; and\n       (2) awarding damages in the amount that is equal to 3 times \n     the amount of the value of the difference between--\n       (A) the terms on which the person sold a covered product to \n     the wholesaler or retailer; and\n       (B) the terms on which the person sold the covered product \n     to a person in Canada.\n       (d) Effectiveness of Section.--This section takes effect on \n     the date that is 2 years\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\n     after the date of enactment of this Act, except that this \n     section shall not be in effect during any period after that \n     date in which there is in effect a final regulation \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     permitting the importation or reimportation of prescription \n     drugs under section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 384).\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to address the Chamber about my \nproposed amendment that fits very neatly with an amendment that passed \nlast week 62 to 28. It is a fallback amendment to that Dorgan-Cochran \nproposal.\n  The way I view this amendment--I hope the way my colleagues will \nunderstand it--it is really an antiprice gouging amendment as we go \nthrough the process and hopefully add a prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare that so many people in the country want and deserve.\n  We all know the stories about drugs that are produced in this country \nthat are made at certain plants and certain places. And when they leave \nthe plant, one truck will go to one of our home States and the other \ntruck will go to Canada. Unfortunately, what happens all too often is \nwhen the drugs get to Canada, they are about one-half or one-third or \none-quarter the price that people can buy those drugs in the United \nStates. In my opinion, there is no valid reason for that. There is no \nvalid justification for those drugs to be priced in that way.\n  We also know the Senate has tried to address this problem on at least \na couple occasions--in the year 2000 and in the year 2002. This very \nChamber voted to allow the reimportation of pharmaceuticals from other \ncountries. Of course, the reimportation of drugs would be FDA-approved \ndrugs coming out of FDA-approved facilities. In fact, for the third \ntime in 4 years, the Senate voted this past Friday to allow the same \nthing.\n  Currently, the law is reimportation can come from a list of \ncountries. There is a designated list. That has been somewhat \ncumbersome. And the FDA has not seen fit and has not been able yet to \napprove this process because they can't certify or verify that the \ndrugs are safe. One thing I like about the Dorgan-Cochran amendment is \nit limits the scope of reimportation only to Canada. That is a \nsignificant advancement because we all know that Canada has very high \nmedical standards and that they are very concerned about their populous \nand the veracity of medication in their society.\n  My proposal also is limited just strictly to Canada. One advantage is \nthat they have a very similar, almost identical set of standards for \nhandling drugs to make sure that there is a chain of custody, proper \ntesting, et cetera. They build in the safeguards just as we do. A lot \nof countries don't do that. But with Canada we have a certain degree of \nconfidence--maybe not absolute; I guess you can never have an absolute \ndegree of confidence--that drugs are going to be safe. We have a very \nhigh degree of confidence that the drugs will, in fact, be safe and \nthey will meet U.S. standards.\n  Let me briefly address my amendment. It is only three pages--very \nsimple, very straightforward. In terms of the definition of covered \nproduct, we adopt the existing law. Therefore, there is no surprises, \nno monkey business or games played with the definition. When it comes \nto the prohibition in section B, which is found on page 2 of the \namendment, in summary--I will delete all the commas and the \nparenthetical phrases, but in summary it says: It shall be unlawful for \nthe manufacturer of a covered product to refuse to sell to any \nwholesaler or retailer--and that is key--on terms that are not \nsubstantially the same as that of any purchaser in Canada.\n  Let me run through that very quickly, if I may. One of the keys is \nthat it is for wholesalers and retailers. What that means is that \nwholesalers and retailers in this country can reimport from Canada.\n  We all know if our local pharmacist could somehow work out an \narrangement with wholesalers and retailers in Canada, they could \nactually buy the products in Canada, have them shipped to the United \nStates, and sell them cheaper here than they can buy them wholesale in \nthis country.\n  One of the keys is that American wholesalers and retailers are \nsubject to all the FDA rules and regulations and requirements.\n  Therefore, this amendment will only allow the reimportation of safe \nFDA-approved products made at FDA-approved facilities. When it comes to \nenforcement, this amendment would allow the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, as well as any wholesaler or retailer in this country \nthat is aggrieved by some unfairness--the thing I like about that and I \nhope my colleagues understand--it allows both the Government sanction, \nthe ability to enforce this, but also the free market. We all know the \nfree market works very well, and when a free market can regulate \nitself, I think we are all better off. It has the ability for the \nGovernment to enforce this if necessary.\n  In the last bit, on page 3 of the amendment, it deals with the \ntimeframe. That is a 2-year provision from the enactment of this act \nthat this will take effect. In other words, the way this works is, once \nwe pass this legislation, the President signs it, it becomes effective \n2 years after it is enacted. Then it will trigger this act if the FDA \nhas not issued its final regulations. Then we will be able to purchase \nthese drugs at the same prices they get in Canada. In other words, it \nis an antiprice-gouging mechanism that I think is critical to this \nlegislation and to its long-term success.\n  I very much applaud the leadership in this Chamber, especially coming \nfrom Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, Senator Frist, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Daschle, Senator Graham, and, of course, Senators \nDorgan and Cochran have shown leadership not just on this issue but on \nprescription drugs generally. I thank them for getting this to the \nSenate floor and allowing this very important debate and allowing these \nimportant amendments to be considered.\n  I do believe very strongly that when the bill came to the floor, it \nwas a bill definitely worth our consideration. But I also think and \nbelieve very strongly that the bill has improved since it has been on \nthe floor. I think these amendments are making the bill stronger and \nbetter for the American public.\n  For example, the Enzi amendment, which I like quite a bit, makes sure \nthat people will still have access to use their local pharmacists. Not \nonly are many pharmacists pillars of the community, not only do they do \ngreat things in their communities, but so often patients getting \nprescription drugs need to talk to their pharmacist about drug \ninteractions, expiration dates, and details of how to take it. It is \nvery important for the effectiveness of the drug that people talk to a \nlocal pharmacist and have access thereto. So I thank Senator Enzi for \ndoing that.\n  The Gregg-Schumer-McCain-Kennedy amendment closes loopholes to allow \nname-brand drug manufacturers to unfairly extend their monopolies and \novercharge American patients. This has been going on for a long time \nand it is something, when I was Attorney General, we worked on very \nhard to try to stop from the litigation standpoint. But now Congress \nhas taken action, and I am so pleased that they are stopping this \nlegislatively.\n  We have mentioned the Dorgan amendment, with the Cochran second-\ndegree amendment, and how that has strengthened the bill and how, \nhopefully, that will cause prices to stabilize and, in fact, hopefully, \ncome down over time. I think there is still some work to be done on \nthis bill, and I think during the course of this week there will be a \nlot of great amendments to consider. I hope I can vote for some of \nthose. When I believe it will make this bill better, I will support it.\n\n  Let me run through the chart very quickly. What we see is a graph \nwith two lines. You can see that this lower line says ``health.'' If \nyou were to look at the consumer price index, or one of the other \nindexes, it would be even lower than this green line, but it would go \nup slightly. That is, of course, the inflation rate, and it goes up 2, \n3 percent a year.\n  Right here, we see the health care costs. If you go back to 1994--our \nbaseline year--the price, the cost of health care, in just these 7 or 8 \nyears has gone up 63.6 percent. One thing we all hear from our \nconstituents is how much health care costs are increasing. For a lot of \npeople, they have increased 10, 15 percent--sometimes more--a year. It \nis strangling people.\n  If you look inside the numbers and you look at the No. 1 cause of \nhealth\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\ncare costs going up, it is the cost of prescription drugs. That is what \nthis red line indicates. Again, you can see the rapid growth that is \noutpacing the costs of health care and inflation, and it is pulling \nhealth care costs up and in a very dramatic fashion. I think pretty \nmuch everyone who has looked at this nationally agrees that it is the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs that is the primary reason--there are \nother factors--why health care costs are going up so dramatically.\n  In this proposal--not in my amendment but in the actual bill--we are \ntalking about having a $250 deductible and a stop loss protection that \nkicks in, paying 90 percent of drug costs after $3,700 of out-of-pocket \nspending. Well, one thing the American public needs to understand, and \nall of us Senators need to remember, is that these are percentages and \nthey will go up as the costs of prescription drugs go up. So one thing \nwe need to be very mindful of is, as we watch this red line, the top \nnumbers on this particular chart, go up--in fact, CBO says about 12 \npercent a year, and they are taking average numbers. They have been \ngoing up more than 12 percent per year in the last few years. If we say \nmore than 12 percent a year, after 5 years that deductible of $250 \nbecomes a deductible of $485. In fact, the stop loss threshold goes \nfrom $3,700 to $6,521. Both of these adjust based on cost of \nprescription drugs--not based on the cost of health care or on the cost \nof an increase in inflation but based on the cost of prescription \ndrugs. What that means is that in 10 years the deductible will go to \n$854, and the stop loss in 10 years will be $11,492.\n  Now, what this amendment is designed to do is to try to get ahold of \nthese runaway costs of prescription drugs. As long as these numbers go \nup like this, the problems in this bill--things that we as Senators \ndon't like about this bill, like the gap in coverage, the deductibles, \nand the stop losses--are going to get worse. It is going to do nothing \nbut get worse over time.\n  So what this amendment and what the Dorgan-Cochran amendment are \ndesigned to do is to try to somehow keep prescription drug costs down \nin a very reasonable way. That is why reimportation is so critical \nbecause reimportation, in the strange world of prescription drugs, \nintroduces competition into the marketplace. Suddenly, the drug costs \nhere are competing with the drug costs in Canada, and what that will \nresult in, necessarily, is lower drug costs if free market principles \nare allowed to apply.\n  While I am 100 percent convinced the administration can and should \nimplement Senator Dorgan's and Senator Cochran's amendment, I am not \n100 percent sure they will do it. Recently, we received a letter in the \nSenate from the FDA from one of the Commissioners, Mr. McClellan. Let \nme quote, if I may, from Mr. McClellan's letter. I may have to put on \nmy reading glasses to do this because that is what happens when you get \nold, Mr. President. I know I am quite a bit older than the occupant of \nthe Chair. When you get my age, you need these.\n  This is a letter to Senator Thad Cochran, and it is from Mark B. \nMcClellan, FDA Commissioner, sent earlier this month, on June 19, 2003. \nIt says:\n\n       The overall quality of drug products that consumers \n     purchase from the United States pharmacies is very high, and \n     the American consumer can be confident that the drugs they \n     use are safe and effective.\n\n  That is a key point because we have a very safe marketplace for \ndrugs. In fact, one of the things I did when I was attorney general of \nmy State--and I left there 6 months ago--I sent out periodical consumer \nalerts to Arkansans about being very careful about buying drugs over \nthe Internet, using mail order companies, and toll-free numbers because \nsometimes, under some circumstances, you are not sure what you are \ngetting.\n  We always advise people to be very careful when they do that. I have \na bias and a preference for using a local pharmacist.\n  Let me continue. I am skipping around:\n\n       In FDA's experience, many drugs obtained from foreign \n     sources that either purport to be or appear to be the same as \n     U.S.-approved prescription drugs are, in fact, of unknown \n     quality.\n\n  That is something we found in the attorney general's office in \nArkansas when I was there.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       These outlets may dispense expired, subpotent, \n     contaminated, or counterfeit products, the wrong or \n     contraindicated product in an incorrect dose or medication \n     unaccompanied with adequate direction for use. The labeling \n     of the drug may not be in English and important information \n     regarding doses and side effects may not be available. In \n     addition, the drugs may not have been packaged and stored \n     under proper conditions to avoid degradations.\n\n  That is true. That definitely happens. We have seen that time and \nagain around this country. But that is one of the great points about \nthe Dorgan amendment. In fact, the Dorgan amendment that was adopted \nlast week with 62 votes has a provision--I am not going to read it \nall--on page 3 that makes it very clear that we can only reimport FDA-\napproved drugs at FDA-approved facilities. There has to be \ndocumentation; there has to be testing. The safeguards are there.\n  Also what Mr. McClellan is talking about here is a very serious \nproblem, but by the very same standards he is referring to in his \nletter, he cannot guarantee that American drugs are safe because we all \nknow in the marketplace there are some problems--a very small \npercentage in the United States but there are some problems. He goes on \nto say FDA cannot guarantee the safety of Canadian drugs. As I said, \nreally in a true sense, we cannot guarantee the safety of American \ndrugs either, but the FDA does a very good job.\n  Interestingly enough, my staff, as we were preparing to be here this \nafternoon, went on Lexis-Nexis and did a search to find all the \nreported cases in recent years from Canada related to counterfeit \ndrugs. They could not find one case, one newspaper article, one \nincident, anything that was reported about counterfeit drugs in Canada. \nThat is using the Lexis-Nexis search. The truth is, we found a number \nof those in the United States, but we did not find any in Canada.\n  Lastly, Mr. McClellan's letter to Senator Cochran says:\n\n       At this time, the agency simply cannot assure the American \n     public that drugs imported from foreign countries are the \n     same as products approved by the FDA and that they are safe \n     and effective.\n\n  Again, our bill fixes this problem because my amendment, along with \nSenator Dorgan's and Senator Cochran's amendment, says it only applies \nto FDA-approved drugs and it is only from Canada. We have a much more \nconfident sense about the Canadian marketplace for prescription drugs \nthan we do about a number of other countries.\n  Back when President Bush was running for office in 2000, he had the \nsame impression as most of us when we think about this issue for the \nfirst time. He said ``it made sense'' to allow prescription drugs that \nwere sold overseas to come back. I think he was right about that. It \ndoes make sense, as long as we build in the proper safeguards. Again, I \nthink the amendment Friday and my amendment today will do that.\n\n  Some say that doing anything to make prescription drugs more \naffordable will reduce investment in research and development. I \ndisagree. There are many factors that go into research and development, \nand two of those--and I hope people understand this--two of the major \nreasons drug companies come here to do their research and development \nare:\n  First, we make a huge public investment through the NIH, the National \nInstitutes of Health. They do a lot of the basic research that the drug \ncompanies then build on and actually produce prescription drugs.\n  Second, this country provides a research and development tax credit, \nand the drug companies take advantage of that, and they should. It is \nthere for them to take advantage. That is why we have it. It is good \nfor the country. It is good for the economy. It is good for our health. \nI am supportive of those tax credits.\n  But those are two taxpayer-funded--I do not know if you want to call \nthem subsidies. Call them what you want but those are two taxpayer \nincentives for these big drug companies to do research and development: \nThe huge public investment we make for NIH, and the research and \ndevelopment tax credit.\n  One item I read recently that is a little disturbing to me is that \nthe research and development dollars by the\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nbig pharmaceutical companies went up by 8 percent. That is good. It is \ngood they are increasing their dollars for research and development. \nBut did you know that their lobbying budget went up by 23 percent? \nRight now in this country, in this city, there are more lobbyists for \nthe pharmaceutical industry than there are Members of Congress, and \nthey have increased it another 23 percent. I am a little bit disturbed \nby that. My sense is, the only groups out there, as far as I know--\nmaybe I am wrong; I have not seen anything to the contrary. As far as I \nknow, the only groups out there opposed to reimporting safe drugs from \nCanada, FDA-approved drugs and FDA-approved facilities from Canada, the \nonly group I know opposed to that is the pharmaceutical industry.\n  I read a recent story in the New York Times that said somewhere \nbetween $2 million and $2.5 million the pharmaceutical industry is \ngiving out to research and policy organizations ``to build intellectual \ncapital and generate a higher volume of messages from credible \nsources.''\n  We saw this happen many years ago with the tobacco industry. I give a \nlittle bit of caution here to the pharmaceutical industry. I hope they \ndo not repeat some of what tobacco did that got them into so much \ntrouble. Tobacco actually went out and funded sham research. They \nfunded research that actually said tobacco was not harmful to their \nhealth when they knew it was and they had the research to say it was. \nThey funded research to come out and say to the contrary, even though \nthe research could not be validated. I certainly hope that is not what \nthe pharmaceutical industry is doing today, but it sounds as if they \nare drifting in that direction.\n  It is definitely in the interest of the American public and of \npatients who need medical care in this country that we allow the safe \nimportation of drugs from Canada. I think it will help people afford \ndrugs, and it will help make drugs more affordable in this country.\n  As long as I am talking about the pharmaceutical industry, let me be \nvery clear. I am proud of the pharmaceutical industry. I am proud of \nwhat they do. It is amazing some of the accomplishments we have \nachieved in medicine in the last 100 years. It is even more dramatic \nthan the aeronautics industry. One hundred years ago, the Wright \nbrothers launched at Kitty Hawk. Now, today, you know what we have been \nable to accomplish in the last 100 years.\n  The gains have been even more dramatic in the world of prescription \ndrugs. It is amazing. It is critical for the United States to have an \nindustry that is high tech, such as that industry, and that is on the \ncutting edge, is innovative, and is the world leader.\n  We want to try to be the leader in anything we can. I will continue \nto support NIH funding for research and development of prescription \ndrugs. I think that is critical. I think that helps everybody. It is a \nwin/win. It is not always cheap, but it is a win/win. It helps the \nindustry. It helps the public. It helps medicine.\n  I will continue to support the tax credit for research and \ndevelopment. In fact, I am a cosponsor of a bill that will do that \nbecause I believe very strongly American business should have the \nincentive to invest in research and development because it helps the \neconomy so much in the long term.\n  I see the prescription drug industry as in a little bit different \ncategory than most industries because they have a patent. The fact is \nthat the Federal Government gives them a patent--another word for that \nwould be a ``monopoly''--the Federal Government gives them a monopoly \nfor a certain number of years to sell their drugs, but implicit in that \nmonopoly is a public trust.\n  I think it is incumbent upon the people who hold those patents and \nthe companies which hold those patents that they understand they have a \nspecial relationship with the public, because nothing less than the \npublic's health is at stake.\n  Also, when I am looking at the pharmaceutical industry, I have to \nobserve what Fortune Magazine came out with in the last I think it has \nbeen 3 or 4 years running now, that there are three different ways to \nmeasure the profitability of an industry. All three ways it is \nmeasured, the pharmaceutical industry by any standard is the most \nprofitable industry in America.\n  The other thing about these companies is we talk about them as if \nthey are our own companies but in fact many of them--maybe the \nmajority, the big guys--are actually foreign corporations doing \nbusiness in America. Most of these big companies are huge conglomerates \nthat have different divisions and product lines. We need to remember \nmost of these are global companies. They are doing research all over \nthe world and they are selling these drugs all over the world, not just \nto the American marketplace. I think it is important we not segment the \nAmerican marketplace at the expense of everything else.\n  I will talk about three of my experiences as attorney general for \nArkansas. I know there are 49 other attorneys general who have had \nsimilar experiences, but these were important experiences I had with \nthe pharmaceutical industry. Again, I am proud of the industry. I am \nvery supportive of some of the things they do, but when I was attorney \ngeneral we had one case where we found out they had secured a monopoly \non certain key ingredients to two or three drugs. Without these key \ningredients the drugs could not be made, and even the generic companies \nwere buying these key ingredients from this one manufacturer. They \npurchased that manufacturer and before long, guess what, generic drugs \nwent up because the name-brand company was jacking up the prices to the \ngenerics. That is not fair. That is not right. That is not allowing the \nmarketplace to work in the way it should.\n  We had another case where a pharmaceutical company out and out lied \nabout research. They told the Government they had tests that showed \ntheir name-brand product was better than the generic product. Another \ntest came in later and showed they were absolutely the same. \nUnfortunately, for a number of years they were able to charge more for \ntheir product, much more than the generic, because people were \nconvinced the generic was not as good.\n\n  When I was attorney general, we found there were a few companies that \nwere playing games with the patent laws and with the FDA regulations \nand through various maneuvers they were able to extend the life of \ntheir patents and monopolies. Again, I did not come to name names and \nembarrass companies for some of the wrongdoings. I will be glad to \nvisit with any Senator individually who would like to talk about these \nthings. The pharmaceutical industry is a great industry overall. It \ndoes great things and I am very supportive of most of the things they \ndo, but sometimes we have to call it like we see it. They do not always \ncome into this debate with the cleanest of hands.\n  In my amendment, I am proposing a 2-year period of time in which to \nallow the Health and Human Services Department to establish their \nregulations in final form. I believe that is ample time. In fact, if it \nwere up to me I would give them 30 days, but I think realistically they \nneed time to verify and certify that the Canadian market is safe. I \nthink they have actually been working on this since the year 2000. The \nfact the Dorgan amendment passed last week will really narrow their \nfocus. Now that they only have to focus on Canada, I think that will \nhelp them quite a bit to bring veracity to these tests and to the \nmarketplace.\n  Again, my proposal would not take effect if the regulations are \nfinalized, and even if it does take effect in 2 years and then the \nregulations are finalized at a later time, mine immediately goes out of \neffect. What it would, in effect, do is make sure we are not paying \nmore for drugs in America than they are in Canada. That is really not \ntoo much to ask, considering the U.S. Government will be far and away \nthe largest purchaser of prescription drugs in the world.\n  The amendment says if the FDA has not implemented reimportation \nwithin 2 years of implementation of this law, it will become illegal \nfor drug manufacturers to discriminate against American purchasers \ncompared to our Canadian counterparts. Really, that is what it is all \nabout. It is about price discrimination. I said a few moments ago it is \nabout price gouging. If the prices are justified in Canada, then they \nare justified here, and we need to\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nmake sure we get a price we are comfortable with.\n  In closing, I say that the consequences of not protecting American \npatients are too high. Uninsured patients cannot afford the \nprescription medicines they need today. Drug prices are fueling health \ncare costs in a way we have seen on that previous chart. One thing we \nsee time and time again is employers dropping health care coverage \nbecause they cannot afford prescription drugs. The skyrocketing drug \ncosts have a tremendous potential to make the Medicare coverage we are \nconsidering erode significantly over time. What I mean by that is, as \nthese deductibles go up, as the stop losses go up, as the gap in \ncoverage widens, this proposed prescription drug benefit is going to \nmake less sense over time because it is going to have so many problems.\n  Lastly, I want to show my colleagues this chart. We have seen bits \nand pieces of this already in this debate from last week, but in the \nfirst column this chart lists I believe it is nine of the most popular \ndrugs in this country. It lists what they are used for. There are a lot \nof folks who are looking at this list and seeing big name-brand drug \nnames. They probably use these drugs. Probably a lot of people in this \nChamber use these drugs. This column shows what they are used for and \nthen this third column is really critical. It is the U.S. price. It is \nwhat people pay in the U.S.\n\n  We are basing this on some Web sites. We know these are prices that \ncan be charged here. This next column shows the price in Canada, what \nwe know they can be charged there because we looked at Web sites that \nsell them. We can see the big difference on every single one of these \nnine drugs. The drug in Canada is much cheaper--in fact, 39 percent \ncheaper, 33 percent cheaper, on down the line. This one is 43 percent \ncheaper in Canada.\n  Bear in mind that a lot of these drugs are made in the very same \nplants. They are made in the very same places. One drug goes up to \nCanada and the other goes to Arkansas, Texas, Georgia, or wherever it \nmay be. These are the very same drugs coming out of the very same \nplants. They meet all the same standards. In Canada, they are a lot \ncheaper.\n  What we are trying to do is get these prices in this column to go \ndown to be a lot closer to the price in the Canadian column. It is not \nonly good for the citizens but good for the taxpayers because as we add \nthis prescription drug benefit we want to see these lower prices \nbecause that means tax dollars will go a lot further, and we, as a \nNation, will be able to provide many more drugs through Medicare than \nwe otherwise could.\n  I ask the Senate very respectfully to support this amendment to \nsimply ensure Americans are treated fairly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so the Senator from New Mexico can offer three \namendments in sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Such payment \n     shall be determined in the same manner as the amount of \n     payment is determined under this clause for disproportionate \n     share hospitals.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment deals with the issue of \nsafety net hospitals. That is a label we have put on what are, in fact, \ncalled in the law Medicare disproportionate share hospitals, or DSH. \nThe payments we make for DSH are intended to support these safety net \nhospitals. By adopting my amendment, we ensure we are not \nunintentionally reducing the payments to these safety net hospitals.\n  By ``safety net hospitals,'' in general terms, we are talking about \nhospitals that provide medical services to a great many individuals who \ndo not have health care coverage. That is where the phrase \n``disproportionate share'' comes from, saying they have a \ndisproportionate share of the uninsured coming to their hospitals \nseeking medical treatment. We have set up a system through Medicare and \nalso a separate system through Medicaid to provide additional funds to \nthose safety net hospitals.\n  Since DSH payments are made as add-on adjustments to fee-for-service\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\nreimbursements, those payments to hospitals are reduced as Medicare \nbeneficiaries choose to enroll in private health plans and the money is \ninstead logically wrapped into payments by the Federal Government to \nthe private health plans.\n  We had some testimony before the Finance Committee. Tom Skully \ntestified that he estimates enrollment in private health plans will \nincrease from 10 percent, where it is today, up to 43 percent by the \nyear 2008. Tom Skully, of course, is in charge of administering these \nprograms. His opinion is extremely important in this debate.\n  If he is right, that would result in an average reduction in the \nMedicare DSH payments--that is, the payments to the safety net \nhospitals--of about 37 percent. Clearly, this is not the intent of \nCongress in this legislation. We are not setting out in this \nlegislation, which is intended to provide a prescription drug benefit \nto seniors, to intentionally reduce the payments to safety net \nhospitals. The bill itself, in fact, increases DSH payments to rural \nsafety net hospitals. That is a provision Chairman Grassley and the \nranking member, Senator Baucus, and I very strongly support.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which advises the Congress \non Medicare policy, has said in their report ``plans are overpaid''--\nprivate plans, they are talking about--``to the extent they do not pass \non DSH payments to the appropriate hospitals.''\n  Congress recognized this program in the past and intentionally carved \nout graduate medical education, or GME, payments from health plans and \nmade provisions so those payments would go directly to the teaching \nhospitals. That policy is included in S. 1, but unfortunately the \ndisproportionate share payments were not addressed in the underlying \nbill.\n  Also, in the case of Medicaid, Congress required a carve-out of DSH \npayments under Medicaid to health plans in 1997 when Congress \nauthorized the substantially greater use of managed care in the \nMedicaid Program. The intent was clear, that Congress did not want to \nunintentionally harm the safety net hospitals as they had more people \nmove into Medicaid managed care.\n  We are essentially trying to do the very same thing here. The same \nrecognition and the same policy should apply in the case of Medicare \nDSH payments that we applied in the case of Medicaid DSH payments.\n\n  Our Nation's important public hospitals lost an estimated $527 \nmillion in treating Medicare patients in the year 2001. That was with \n88 percent of those public hospitals reporting losses on Medicare. They \ncannot afford additional Medicare cuts. That would be exactly what we \nwould be enacting if we passed the underlying bill without including \nthe amendment I provide here. Now is the time to protect and carve out \nthe amendments intended to go to safety net hospitals to ensure they \nactually do go to the safety net hospitals even once this program is \nput in place.\n  I hope very much my colleagues will support this amendment. I hope it \ncan be adopted and included in the legislation before it passes the \nSenate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 972\n\n  Mr. President, I have another amendment numbered 972, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As we proceed with this consideration of S. 1--and I \nbelieve firmly that it will be passed through the Senate this week--we \nneed to be very careful not to create unintended consequences as a \nresult of our legislation.\n  The previous amendment I discussed tries to head off some unintended \nand certainly undesirable consequences for safety net hospitals. This \namendment tries to do the very same thing with regard to community \nhealth centers. Let me explain what this amendment does.\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\n  First, I am concerned about the implications that passing this \nunderlying legislation as it now is pending in the Senate could have on \nthe Nation's community health centers. Community health centers have \nenjoyed broad bipartisan support in Congress. They have enjoyed strong \nsupport from the President. The President and the Congress have \ncommitted to doubling the funding for community health centers over a \n5-year period. That is an encouraging development. Health centers \nprovide care to over 13 million people annually, nearly 1 million of \nwhom are low-income Medicare beneficiaries. They receive section 330 \nFederal Public Health Service Act grant funds to support care for the \nuninsured and for low-income patients.\n  To ensure that those grant dollars are spent for the purposes \nintended, Congress has specifically taken action to ensure that both \nMedicare and Medicaid are fully reimbursing the health centers for the \ncosts associated with the care those health centers provide to Medicare \nand Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  Simply put, funding intended for low-income and uninsured people \nshould not be diverted and used to subsidize Medicare \nunderpayments. Therefore, health centers are reimbursed by Medicare \nunder a cost-based system.\n\n  The amendment I am offering, amendment No. 972, would simply extend \nthis same requirement to the new Medicare Advantage Programs by \nensuring that community health centers are provided with a wraparound, \nor a supplemental payment equal to the difference between the payments \nthey now receive under Medicare generally and the payments they would \nreceive from Medicare Advantage plans.\n  This concept is not new. In 1997, when Congress allowed States to \ndramatically increase the number of patients enrolled in Medicaid \nmanaged care, we recognized the potential impact on community health \ncenters, and we required the Medicaid Program to provide this \nwraparound, or supplemental payment, for the difference between the \nmanaged care organization's payment and the health center's reasonable \ncost. We need to do the same thing here, with my amendment, in the \nMedicare Program.\n  According to testimony, again, from Tom Scully, which I referred to \njust a minute ago, the hearing we had in the Finance Committee \nindicated there are widely differing estimates for how many Medicare \nbeneficiaries would actually enroll in private health plans. Those \nestimates range from 9 percent to 43 percent, a fivefold difference.\n  Dr. Holtz-Eakin's words were that:\n\n       These are honest differences in trying to read a very \n     uncertain future.\n\n  All of us want to reduce that uncertainty. If Mr. Scully is correct, \nthen health centers will lose their guarantee of cost-based \nreimbursement to 43 percent of their Medicare patients, and that \npotentially will result in centers having to dip into their Federal \ngrant funds, which is money that was intended to provide care to the \nuninsured to make up for losses to their Medicare patients.\n  The Nation's safety net is already a fragile one. We should take this \naction. We should adopt this amendment to ensure we are not \njeopardizing that safety net even further by passing the underlying \nlegislation without the amendment.\n  Again, this Congress and the President have made a commitment to \nthese community health centers to deal with the growing number of \nuninsured in the country. In light of this, the amendment is, in my \nview, vital to the health of these health centers and ensuring the \nhealth centers are not forced to decide whether to subsidize the \nMedicare Program with their grant dollars or refuse to provide services \nto the 1 million Medicare beneficiaries to whom they currently provide \nthose services.\n  Just as I indicated with the previous amendment, I think this will \nsubstantially improve the bill. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment, and I hope, when we come to consideration of it and a vote \non it, that the Senate will endorse this amendment. It will avoid a \nconsequence that I know is not intended by any of my colleagues here in \nthe Senate.\n  I ask this amendment I have just been discussing, amendment No. 972, \nbe set aside so I may off another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 973\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask amendment No. 973 be called up for \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 973.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide \nfor the authorization of reimbursement for all medicare part B services \n           furnished by certain Indian hospitals and clinics)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. AUTHORIZATION OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR ALL MEDICARE PART \n                   B SERVICES FURNISHED BY CERTAIN INDIAN \n                   HOSPITALS AND CLINICS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1880(e) (42 U.S.C. 1395qq(e)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking ``for services \n     described in paragraph (2)'' and inserting ``for all items \n     and services for which payment may be made under such part'';\n       (2) by striking paragraph (2); and\n       (3) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (2).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to items and services furnished on or after \n     October 1, 2004.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment deals with Indian \nMedicare Part B services. The Indian Health Service, of course, \noperates hospitals and clinics in various parts of the country, several \nin my State. Those hospitals and clinics provide health care to \nAmerican Indians on or near reservations and to Alaska Natives. In many \ncases, those are hospitals and clinics that currently are unable to \nbill for all of the Medicare Part B services they are providing. In \neffect, the Indian Health Service under current law is subsidizing the \nMedicare Program because those services which would otherwise be paid \nfor by Medicare, if it were a different provider other than the Indian \nHealth Service--are having to be paid by the Indian Health Service \nitself.\n  I think we in the Senate are all aware that the Indian Health \nService, year after year, has been substantially underfunded. In 2000, \nIndian Health Service hospitals and clinics were made eligible for \nservices of physicians and certain other practitioners, but there were \nreal limits put on the services that were provided. Specifically, they \nwere denied payment, the Indian Health Service hospitals and clinics \nwere denied payment for the following important items that I will call \nto the attention of my colleagues so they may realize what the Indian \nHealth Service is not permitted to be reimbursed for in the current \nlaw: Durable medical equipment. This includes such items as \nwheelchairs, as well as blood testing strips, blood monitors for \ndiabetes patients--which is a severe problem among Native Americans \nthroughout this country.\n  The second item is home and some institution dialysis supplies and \nequipment. Since the prevalence of diabetes in the Native-American \npopulation and among Alaska Natives is three times the rate in the \ngeneral U.S. population, Indian people experience a high rate of renal \ndisease, including end-state renal disease. Clearly these are expenses, \nthese are supplies, this is equipment that should be reimbursed.\n  Third, cancer screening.\n  Next, Pap smears, glaucoma screening, clinic and hospital-based \nambulance services, prosthetic devices, covered vaccines, including \nhepatitis B, pneumococcal and influenza, chemotherapy and antigen \ndrugs, and clinical laboratory services.\n  The amendment I am offering would simply make these Indian health \nfacilities and providers eligible for payment for all of the Part B \nMedicare-covered items, and individuals, to the same extent other \nproviders are eligible for payment for those supplies and services.\n  The amendment assures that Native Americans would have the same \naccess to health services as any other American. If the Indian Health \nService providers are unable to bill for those services, as they \ncurrently are, then the Indian Health Service budget shortfalls\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\nwind up resulting in the rationing or delaying of treatment to many of \nour Native-American citizens. For some of these individuals, it means \ngoing out of the Indian Health Service system in order to get more \nprompt service because other providers, in fact, do get reimbursed and \ncan get reimbursed on Medicare for providing those services.\n  Native Americans and Indian Health Service providers should not be \nsubject to such barriers to care and to payment. Similarly, they should \nnot be subject to such complexity as they are only prohibited from \nbilling and receiving payment for certain services and not for others.\n  It needs to be noted that the Medicare Advantage payments are based \nin part on fee-for-service expenditures in the defined region. For \nthose areas with large numbers of Native Americans--such as my State--\npayment rates are skewed downward if the Indian Health Service \nproviders are unable to bill appropriately for the full range of \nservices. We have lower reimbursement rates for Medicare in my State \nthan many of the surrounding areas. One of the factors--not the only \none, but one of the factors that is causing that is this problem I am \ntrying to address with the amendment, the problem that the Indian \nHealth Service is unable to be reimbursed. Accordingly, the amount \nMedicare is paying is skewed downward. Accordingly, that affects \nMedicare payments throughout the region.\n  There is absolutely no policy rationale for limiting the payment to \nthe Indian Health Service hospitals and clinics for only certain of the \nMedicare Part B services.\n  I urge the Senate to end this unfortunate discrimination that has \nbeen built into the statutes under which we currently operate.\n  I hope, again, this amendment will be favorably acted upon by the \nSenate when it comes to a vote. I believe it will substantially improve \nthe legislation and will correct an inequity that is in current law \nthat needs to be corrected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 933\n\n  Mr. President, let me at this point move to another amendment. We do \nnot need to move off the current amendment, but I wish to discuss a \ndifferent amendment that is pending that I am not calling up for a vote \nat this time but one I offered sometime earlier.\n  The amendment I wish to speak about briefly now relates to the assets \ntest. It is a proposal I have made to repeal the assets test.\n  First, I compliment Chairman Grassley and the ranking member, Senator \nBaucus, for making significant progress and improvement with respect to \nthe low-income benefit as compared to similar legislation that was \nconsidered last year. The bill, although improving the low-income \nbenefit and reducing the impact of the assets test, still leaves in \nplace an assets test of just $4,000 for an individual and $6,000 for a \ncouple.\n  This assets test has two very important consequences. By explaining \nthese consequences, I think I will be able to explain what I mean by an \n``assets test.''\n  First of all, for those who have incomes below the poverty level, if \nyou own as much as $4,100 in a whole range of different assets \ncombined--it can be savings accounts, bonds, savings bonds, burial \nplots, insurance policies, a car, the net worth of your car, livestock, \nwhatever you happen to own--if the combined value of these categories \nadds up to $4,100, then your cost sharing under the bill increases and \nyou do not get the full benefit of this low-income prescription drug \nbenefit we are talking about as part of this legislation.\n  Your cost sharing under the bill increases by 400 percent if you fail \nthis assets test compared to similarly situated low-income people. If \nyour income is between 100 and 135 percent of poverty, then the assets \ntest increases cost sharing by 200 percent; that is, you have to pay \ntwice as much if, in fact, your total assets add up to more than \n$4,100.\n  The result is, Congress has effectively established a policy that \nencourages low-income seniors or people with disabilities to further \nimpoverish themselves--that is, dispose of their property, sell their \nproperty off--in order to get the full benefit that is advertised.\n  What kind of sense does this really make, to ask low-income and \nvulnerable seniors and people with disabilities to get rid of the very \nminimal savings they have in order to get the full low-income benefit?\n  Let me talk about the other aspect of this that I think is \nparticularly significant and needs to be discussed here. I think more \nand more, as people have been reading this legislation--this \nlegislation goes on for more than 600 pages, so anyone who thinks we \nare doing something simple here by just giving people a prescription \ndrug benefit has not spent the time to try to understand this \nlegislation and read it.\n  One of the aspects of the assets test that is most troublesome is the \nenormously cumbersome and bureaucratic procedure we put in place that \naffects so many of our low-income seniors who want to benefit from this \nprescription drug benefit we are adding. Also, there is a very \nsubstantial invasion of people's lives involved. Let me explain that in \na little more detail.\n\n  Any of you who do not think this is a complex, cumbersome, \nbureaucratic process we are setting up for low-income seniors, I urge \nyou to just read the Pennsylvania 16-page application for low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries who want to qualify for assistance with premiums \nand copayments and deductibles that will also be the basis for \nqualifying for the low-income benefit in this bill. I question whether \nmany of us in Congress would be able to fill out that application.\n  What I have on this easel is not the Pennsylvania 16-page \napplication. This is a much shorter, so-called streamlined 4-page \napplication from the State of Ohio.\n  To comply with the assets test requirement, as shown on this chart, \nin the State of Ohio they ask you to detail in this form all that you \nown in an enormous number of categories. Let me just go through this: \nyour savings accounts, your checking accounts, anything you have with a \ncredit union, any promissory notes, any stocks and bonds, any tax \nshelter accounts, any certificates of deposit, automobiles, 401(k)s, \ntrust funds, Christmas clubs, vehicles of any kind other than an \nautomobile--if you happen to have a pickup--money market funds, life \ninsurance, land contracts, IRAs, Keogh plans, revocable burial \naccounts, irrevocable burial accounts, and other assets.\n  So if you own a cow or you own a horse, whatever you own, they want \nto know about it. Then they add up the total value of those assets to \nsee whether you have $4,100 there. If you do have $4,100 there, you \nhave just failed the assets test.\n  There are some 20 items here for low-income seniors or disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries to report just to apply for the prescription \ndrug low-income benefit. It is a test, as I indicated, which many of us \nin Congress would have trouble passing without the assistance of a \nlawyer or an accountant. It is a major barrier, it is a burden we are \nimposing on these very individuals whom we say we are trying to help.\n  I bring this to the attention of the Senate because I do not think \nmany of us know the extent to which these applications are both \ndifficult--difficult to complete--and also a terrible invasion of \nprivacy.\n  The Georgia application reads--and let me put that provision on the \neasel. We have a blowup of the application, which I am sure very few \ncan read. But just to make the point, we have tried to blow it up so \npeople can see it. I will read from the Georgia application. It says:\n\n       I understand that, by signing this application, I am \n     agreeing to a full investigation or review of my eligibility \n     by state and/or federal officials. This may include inquiries \n     of employers, medical providers, financial institutions, and \n     other business and professional persons and review of any \n     agency records.\n\n  Oklahoma's application goes even further. It reads:\n\n       I authorize the release of any necessary information, \n     documents, or forms to the [Oklahoma department] from \n     individuals, businesses, schools, banking institutions, data \n     brokers, public or private organizations, Oklahoma state \n     agencies, including personal and/or business income tax \n     returns from the Oklahoma Tax Commission, or federal agencies \n     to determine my eligibility for assistance or to determine \n     the accuracy of any payments to vendors on my behalf.\n\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\n\n  The Pennsylvania application--unfortunately, I do not have that blown \nup here; it would take more easels than we have available--requires the \napplicant to consent to:\n\n     . . . fully cooperate in the finger, photo, and signature \n     imaging process.\n\n  It requires the reporting of any changes in the number of people in \nthe household, any changes in the resources of the individual, and it \nadds--and this is a quotation from the report; this is the Pennsylvania \nreport--``you must report any plans to leave the state, even \ntemporarily.'' So if you want to come from Pennsylvania down to \nWashington, DC, to see your Senator, you have to notify the folks in \nPennsylvania that you are leaving the State if you are, in fact, \neligible for this benefit.\n  The burden of the application ought to be something that would scare \noff a lot of individuals. Here is a line that is in the application of \nmany States:\n\n       State and Federal law provides for fine, for imprisonment, \n     or both for any person who withholds or gives false \n     information--\n\n  I note that it does not include anything about intentionally giving \nfalse information.\n\n     in order to obtain assistance to which he or she is entitled.\n\n  The application from Georgia reads:\n\n       I understand the questions on this application--\n\nwhich I would attest is virtually impossible for a lot of folks unless \nthey do get professional help in understanding all of this--\n\n     and I certify under penalty of perjury that the information \n     given by me on this form is correct and complete to the best \n     of my knowledge.\n\n  The result of this assets test, this barrage of paperwork presented \nto people when they come in and ask for the benefits, is what the \nCongressional Budget Office is telling us. Their estimate is that only \n50 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who are eligible for the low-\nincome benefit under this bill will actually get the benefit. I find it \nshocking, after reading these applications, that the number could even \nbe that high. It is a testament to the Nation's seniors and disabled \nthat so many people go through the bureaucratic maze to get the benefit \nwe are talking about.\n  On the implementation of the Children's Health Insurance Program--a \ndifferent program but one that also had a similar assets test--a number \nof States initially imposed assets tests on the families before they \nallowed children to get health care coverage. Over time most of those \nStates have repealed those tests.\n  Our experience with the assets test in the case of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program should be instructive. The Denver Post wrote \nat the time:\n\n       It seems the system is penalizing people for trying to \n     build better lives. The message is that you must stay poor. \n     If you have a decent running car that will get you to where \n     you need to go, you will lose your health care coverage.\n\n  The Rocky Mountain News added:\n\n       Jumping through the hoops might be a whole lot easier for \n     some families than filling out the required forms which rival \n     the renowned handiwork of the Internal Revenue Service for \n     clarity and ease of compliance. The logic of erecting such \n     paperwork obstacles escapes us. Government doesn't have to \n     offer insurance to the children of working poor but having \n     made the decision to do so, it is hardly fair then to smother \n     the program beneath layers of red tape.\n\n  These last two quotes relate to the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, not to the Medicare prescription drug benefit. But the same \nproblem pointed out when we had the assets test applied in the case of \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program is true and exists with respect \nto this prescription drug coverage for our Nation's low-income elderly \nand disabled citizens. We are not only smothering them beneath layers \nof red tape, but the applications threaten their privacy and further \nthreaten fines or imprisonment if those individuals who apply provide \nfalse information even if it is unintentional in some cases.\n  I raise these points because very few, if any, Senators have taken \nthe time to understand the application process, and they would be \nappalled if they really did take the time to understand the \ndifficulties we are placing in the way of a senior getting access to \nthis low-income benefit. I urge each of them to attempt to fill out \ntheir own State's application. Clearly that would be a good way to \nacquaint themselves with the difficulty of the problem we are putting \nin the way of people.\n  Before closing, let me point out the assets test was established in \n1988. It has never been updated for inflation. Nor does the bill update \nthe assets test for inflation.\n  Not only was the assets test established in 1988 at this level of \n$4,000 and $6,000 per couple, and it has never been updated for \ninflation, but it has built in it a marriage penalty. If you get \nmarried, a couple can only have a combined net worth of $6,000. If you \nremain single, you can have a net worth of $4,000. Everyone who gives \nspeeches about the importance of eliminating the marriage penalty will \nwant to support the amendment for that reason.\n  The bill does update the amount of the deductible. The amount of the \ndeductible increases. It does update the catastrophic limit by an \ninflation factor pegged to increases in drug spending which the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates will increase on average 12 \npercent a year over the next 10 years. But we do nothing to index or \nupdate the amount of this assets test.\n  While I completely respect the position of the chairman that he would \nplace a priority on using any additional funds to close the coverage \ngap in the bill--I certainly favor closing that coverage gap myself--we \nneed to protect our Nation's most vulnerable, the poorest and the \nsickest among us first. If we provide a low-income benefit, as the bill \ndoes, it should be unacceptable to us to have only half of those who \nare eligible for that benefit actually access the benefit. This is \nsimilar to the Children's Health Insurance Program in that we are not \nrequired to provide this benefit, but now that we are choosing to do so \nand we are choosing to do so on a bipartisan basis, we need to be sure \nthose who are intended to benefit from it can in fact do so. We are \nabout to impose on these individuals an avalanche of bureaucratic red \ntape when they try to access the benefit.\n  The underlying legislation has contained in it 69 pages of language \nthat is designed to give health care providers a whole range of \nregulatory relief. Here we have some of that detail on this chart. The \nappeals process is being reformed--expedited review procedures, \nprovider ombudsman, a variety of things to try to help providers. But \nwe have nothing to give beneficiaries any relief from the burden I have \ndescribed.\n  One Senator said last week that the amendment I have offered to \neliminate the assets test would cost money. It would increase State \nadministrative costs. Frankly, that statement could not be more \ninaccurate. In fact, if we dramatically reduce the paperwork burden, \nthe bureaucratic paperwork, States would not have to increase \nadministrative costs. They would actually be able to reduce those \ncosts. It is not the amendment that is increasing these costs. It is \nthe underlying bill. It is not the amendment that is imposing the \nburden upon States. It is the underlying bill itself.\n  All the amendment does is significantly reduce the amount of \nbureaucratic paperwork that must be dealt with in order for this \nbenefit to be provided. Some States have actually found that it costs \nmore to administer the assets test than they save by disqualifying \npeople who fail the test.\n  In addition, Senator Hatch's comments on the amendment were right in \nsaying it would increase costs. But the estimate is that it would \nincrease costs by $4 billion over the 10-year period for which the \nCongressional Budget Office calculates.\n  This is well within the budget limitations Congress established for \nthis drug benefit. There are $19.3 billion remaining in the budget for \nfiscal years 2009 through 2013. My amendment provides those are the \nyears that this assets test would be eliminated.\n  The amendment also does so by eliminating the false advertising we \nare engaged in as we tout a low-income benefit when, in fact, only 50 \npercent of eligible beneficiaries are going to receive it. In fact, CBO \nestimates that another 1 million low-income seniors who are eligible \nfor this low-income benefit will in fact be able to access it if this \namendment is adopted.\n  If we eliminate the bureaucratic redtape, who are the 1 million \npeople who would benefit from this assets test? The Commonwealth Fund \nhas studied that. They have said in a recent report:\n\n       Compared to other Medicare beneficiaries, low-income \n     Medicare beneficiaries are older,\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\n     they are more likely to be women, they are more likely to be \n     single, and more than twice as likely to be widowed or \n     divorced or separated. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries are \n     almost twice as likely to report that their health is either \n     fair or poor.\n\n  I think it is these people who need to be our first priority. The \namendment I have to eliminate the assets test will help us to provide a \ngenuine benefit to these people. I hope my colleagues will support this \neffort. It will substantially improve the underlying bill and \nsubstantially simplify the providing of this benefit we are all hoping \noccurs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I \nthink he has a very good point. The current assets test is degrading, \nunworkable. It is just not good policy. It is also extremely \ncomplicated. Currently, assets tests apply to various kinds of \nbenefits--sometimes Medicaid or Medicare, or certain categories of \nMedicare. It defies logic, it is so complicated. Frankly, if this \nSenator had his way, we would repeal a lot of the assets tests which \nhave not been updated for a good number of years--since 1987 or 1989. \nWe are talking about $9,000 a year or something like that. On the other \nhand, we are dealing with $400 billion in this bill. A total repeal of \nthe assets test on drugs only would be--I don't know the cost, but it \nwould be expensive.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, in his good-faith effort to try to deal \nwith unnecessary complications--which is bad public policy--is trying \nto modify a repeal of the assets test to a smaller category. Frankly, \nit has a lot of appeal. But as the Senator knows very well, probably as \nwell if not better than most Members of this body, that would only go \npart way toward correcting some of the inequities caused by the assets \ntest. Even if the Senator's amendment to totally repeal the asset test \napplying to drugs would go into effect, nevertheless, the asset test \nwith respect to the rest of the categories would still apply under \nMedicare. That is low-income categories that are mandatory.\n  It is incredibly complex, which is to say I am very sympathetic with \nthe Senator and I am hopeful we get this score back from CBO on the \nSenator's asset test amendment, that it is one that certainly can work \nwithin the $400 billion limit we are operating under. I, for one, \nbelieve it should pass. I thank the Senator very much for persistently \nand very forthrightly, with a lot of good information, bringing this up \nto be dealt with.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending amendments be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 985\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, those are two amendments which Senators \nhave offered. That means, as a practical consequence, that they are \nmore likely to be considered than amendments that have not been \noffered. These are amendments that I will now call CBO and get scores \non. It is difficult to get scores from CBO on amendments if they are \nnot pending. If Senators have not told me they are going to offer \namendments, I cannot put them on the list. This is a roundabout way of \nsaying to Senators who wish to offer amendments, it behooves them to do \nit now and get them into the queue. Then I can call CBO and tell them \nwe need a score on this or that amendment. CBO cannot score all \namendments that will be potentially filed, because it has limited \nresources. It can only do it as they become real. I urge Senators to \ncome forward with amendments so we can deal with them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 981\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Pryor \namendment which I understand was debated just a few minutes ago. I do \nso in strongest terms. We had a debate last week on the issue of \nreimportation of drugs from Canada. The Senate spoke and said that if \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services would declare that such \nreimportation was safe, we could then bring these drugs across the \nborder at a reimported price.\n  Many on this side of the aisle, and I am sure a few on the other side \nof the aisle, voted for that amendment, as amended, by Senator Cochran \nfor that safety measure basically concluding that the Health and Human \nServices Secretary would never determine that these drugs would be \nconsidered safe, since the Canadian Government itself said they could \nnot guarantee they were safe. We have all sorts of problems today with \ncounterfeit drugs, drugs getting shipped in from other countries, \nleading to a variety of health problems. There was a great amount of \ncomfort.\n  The Pryor amendment goes one step further, according to my \nunderstanding, saying if the Secretary does not say the drugs are safe \nwithin a period of time--I believe it is 2 years--then prices of drugs \nin this country will be set by the Canadian Government, which I find a \nstartling concession of authority of this Government to a foreign \ncountry; that we are going to have a foreign country and a board in a \nforeign country set prices for drugs in the United States of America.\n  It is a remarkable concession for the Senate. I know we have a great \ndesire to control many things in the United States. We would like to \nset prices, I am sure, on lots of different items. We do it in the \nAgriculture bill all the time. Now we are going one step further. If \nyou cannot win price controls by having the Senate pass a price control \nbill, delegate the Canadian Government to control the prices for you.\n  Maybe we should choose different countries. Why Canada? Maybe there \nare other countries that set even lower prices than Canada. I suspect \nthere are countries that would set lower prices than Canada. Why not \nchoose them if we really want to save consumers money?\n  If this amendment is adopted, I would probably offer amendments that \nwe should have chicken prices set by the Canadian Government, wheat \nprices set by the Canadian Government, and lumber and timber prices set \nby the Canadian Government. Maybe it would just be good to have the \nCanadian Government set all our prices in this country for those items \nwe think are important. Obviously, they are very thoughtful in Canada, \nand they know what is best for us here, and we should just go ahead and \nlet them set our prices for us.\n  We are not talking about the Canadian marketplace setting prices. We \nare talking about the Canadian Government. Let me explain how the \nCanadian Government operates. The Canadian Government operates as \nfollows: You want to sell your drug in Canada? Fine, you have to get it \napproved, get it on the formulary.\n  By the way, you have no other place to sell drugs other than drugs \napproved by the Canadian Government. Remember, they have a Government-\nrun health care system up there. My understanding is that the Canadian \nGovernment actually sets their own drug prices. I do not think they go \nto another country to get drug prices set and use those. I think they \nset their own.\n\n  Assuming they are setting their own drug prices, what they do is say \nto the drug company, take Pfizer: OK, you want to sell your drug here? \nGreat. We will pay you $1 a pill.\n  Pfizer says: This costs us $1 billion to research. It is a great \ndrug. It solves all sorts of problems. We sell it in America for $10 \nbecause of the enormous cost of the research and testing to make sure \nit is safe and efficacious, and it cost us a lot of money, and we only \nhave a short patent by which to recoup the investment dollars. We have \na lot of drugs we tested along the way to find a cure for this problem, \nand we have to recoup those costs; otherwise, we cannot stay in \nbusiness, we cannot continue to research. The Canadian Government says: \nThat is nice; a dollar.\n  Pfizer says: No, we can't sell it for a dollar.\n  The Canadian Government says: Fine, you can't sell your drug here.\n  So Pfizer loses out on a market of 16 million people--I do not know \nhow many people are in Canada--16 million people, something like that.\n  Pfizer says: No, we won't sell.\n  Or what they say is: You know what. It only costs us 50 cents to make \nthis pill. Yes, we are not going to make any money on it, but this is a \ndrug that is an important drug so we will make it available in Canada \nfor a dollar.\n  The other alternative is they just say, no, we are not going to sell \nit in Canada. Under Canadian law, the Canadian Government has the right \nto steal Pfizer's patent, issue that patent, that formulary or formula, \nwhatever the drug is, to a generic drug manufacturer in Canada for them \nto produce at the dollar price that Canada is willing to pay for it. So \nthey can steal a patent that a company in this country spent millions \nof dollars, potentially a billion dollars, to come up with and set a \nprice in Canada at the level they so choose.\n  The Senator from Arkansas wants to condone that behavior and say we \nhave to charge the same price in this country.\n  I cannot imagine anything that would be more damaging to an industry \nthat does more than any industry in America to solve our health \nproblems. They spend more on research and development than any group of \ncompanies that exist, and they bring through drug after drug and \ntherapy after therapy to extend lives, to increase the quality of life, \nand to cure diseases.\n  So the reward in the Senate is that we are going to have a foreign \ngovernment set prices for an industry that\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\ndoes not exist in Canada but it does exist in the United States. The \nmajority of the new drugs in the world are researched and developed in \nthe United States.\n  Yes, we do pay more for drugs in this country. I will concede that to \nthe Senator from Arkansas. We pay more for drugs here, and the reason \nwe pay more for drugs here is that we do not regulate prices, as most \nother countries around the world do.\n  I think the Senator from Arkansas is on to something. We need to do \nsomething about those prices around the world, but it is not to adopt \nthem in this country; it is to get the trade administrator to start \nputting these issues on the table when it comes to negotiating free \ntrade deals. They have to put on the table the pirating of our patents, \nwith our free trade partners such as Canada and Mexico. They have to \nput on the table the prices they pay for drugs that are researched in \nthis country that our people in this country subsidize. Yes, we do.\n  In fact, we subsidize the world's research in pharmaceuticals, \nadmitted.\n  So the Senator from Arkansas says we are going to stop doing that. We \nare going to do what Canada does, which is not subsidize one nickel of \nthe cost of researching these new drugs--what Germany does, what \nEngland does, what most of the developed world does. Yes, they \npiggyback on America, and so the Senator from Arkansas is saying let's \njust piggyback on Canada.\n  Well, what are the consequences? I do not think it takes an expert in \npharmaceuticals to figure out exactly what happens. We will squeeze the \nresearch dollars out of the drugmaking industry because we will be \nreimbursing them based on their cost of manufacturing. So the dollars \nfor research to attract investment dollars to spend on research and \ndevelopment for that next generation of drugs will be gone.\n  Maybe that is a good idea. Maybe it is more important to have people \nget their drugs inexpensively today than to find that cure for cancer, \ndiabetes, or Parkinson's, or develop a new drug to ease symptoms of \nHIV. Maybe it is more important for someone to have their drugs a \nlittle cheaper today. But there are millions of Americans, and there \nare even more millions of people around the world, waiting for that \nlittle pill that is yet to be discovered that will extend their life so \nthey can see their daughter or grandchild being born, waiting for \nsomeone to cure that disease they are saddled with today, to give them \njust a few more months or a few more years, and we will say to them, \nanyone who votes for this amendment, when that person walks in their \noffice and says, I am here for NIH research dollars for diabetes, or, I \nam here for NIH research dollars for AIDS, Parkinson's, cancer, or \nheart disease, I want that Senator to say to them, I voted for this \namendment and, yes, we are going to have lots of research dollars, but \nno one is going to take that research and do much with it because we \nhave just squeezed every dollar we can for research and development out \nof the pharmaceutical industry, which would take that research and do \nsomething with it to put it to commercial practice and make that drug \navailable.\n\n  We will say to them that even though we are passing a prescription \ndrug benefit that is going to extend pharmaceutical benefits to make \ndrugs less expensive, that was not good enough. No, it was not good \nenough to cover people's drug benefits. We have to take a bite out of \nthe hide of those nasty pharmaceutical companies that get beaten up \nwith frequency, I understand. They get beaten up a lot, until they are \nneeded, until they extend your wife's life or they save your child's \nlife; then the rhetoric tones down quite a bit.\n  We are shooting with real bullets. This is a Medicare pharmaceutical \npackage that will pass and turn into law, and anybody who thinks this \nis a free vote, that we can go back home and campaign and say, gee, I \nam going to get you cheap drugs, understand what this vote means. When \nthat 7-year-old diabetic walks in your office, understand what you have \ndone. It is as real as denying them the cure that is sure to come.\n  I know this is not a popular issue, to stand up for pharmaceutical \ncompanies. Maybe we should do to them what we have done to a lot of \nindustries that have been successful in America: Beat them up, tax \nthem, take their profits away, until they become dependent upon us, and \nthen we will give them loan guarantees and bail them out. Then it will \nbe a really popular thing because they will be losing money and we will \nhave to help them. I think that is a very bad approach.\n  The right approach is to provide coverage for those who are in need \nof insurance to help them with their prescription drug bills while at \nthe same time allowing one of the most vibrant industries we have in \nthis country to survive and thrive. That is the balanced approach. It \nis not attacking the very organizations, the companies, that are \nproviding lifesaving drugs for millions of Americans and millions \naround the world.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have a lot of respect for my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, but I would like to ask if he is familiar with this \nstatement by Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of Pharmaceutical \nManufacturers Association. He says:\n\n       Canada, in a move away from the system that hindered \n     innovation, improved the patent law for medicines in 1988. \n     Two weeks ago, it further strengthened the law by eliminating \n     compulsory licenses for drugs approved after December 20, \n     1991. Drug research in Canada has increased sharply since \n     1988.\n\n  This is his testimony to Congress dated February 22, 1993.\n  What I ask the Senator is, in view of this statement, is he still \nmaintaining that Canada can steal drug companies' patents?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, I do. I say that because there has been a lot of \nwork that has been done since then. According to many legal scholars I \nhave talked with, they still believe Canada has that ability to \ncontinue to steal licenses and give those patents away to drug \ncompanies in Canada. I will be happy to provide that documentation, but \nI do not have it with me. I had it last week, but the issue did not \ncome up. I will be happy to share that.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If the Senator will yield for another question, Canada \ndoes take the position, as any nation would, that under its national \nsovereignty, it can in extreme situations take over a patent. I am sure \nthe United States has the same provision in its law. I have not looked \nat the law books recently, but I know after September 11 and the \nanthrax scare, Canada did make the statement that it reserved the right \nto produce its own vaccines using existing patents.\n  I am guessing without knowing all the details of your statement, the \npolicy and their intentions--by the way they did not do this--I am \nguessing they would have paid the pharmaceutical industry something \nbased on manufacturing its patent, but they were doing it in their own \nnational interest to protect their citizens.\n  So my question is, you pretty much imply that they routinely have the \nability to steal patents; they routinely threaten that, but as best we \nknow there has only been one example, extreme example after September \n11, where they talk about the possibility of doing this.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What I said in several speeches is as follows: Where \nthere is competition, there are like classes of drugs. They use the \nexclusion, they use a formulary to exclude or drive down prices. If you \nhave 10 arthritis drugs, they pick two or three, which is what a \nformulary is all about, and they will pick those based on the cheapest \nprice available and patent medicines. And they will exclude others so \nthey do not have access to the market.\n  I have never said in those cases the Canadian Government would use \ntheir authority to steal a patent. In fact, I have been very clear. I \nhave said in the cases they would use it is where this is a unique \ndrug. And if this is a unique drug, a breakthrough drug, or something \nthat has no other competition, if you do not go along--we used the \nexample of, I think, Cipro they were using as an example that is \nrelevant to the case I made in the past--where there is a drug that \ndoes not have competition, that is, in fact, what they do. Leverage. In \nthe other cases where there is competition, they have other leverage \nand they will not use the licensing of a patent or the stealing of a \npatent as a recourse.\n  There are two different competitive or anticompetitive maneuvers by \nthe\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\nGovernment of Canada: One having to do with drugs of which there are a \nvariety in that class and a separate, the patent issue having to do \nwhere there is a drug with no real competitor.\n  This is the case I have made repeatedly, not just last week but in \nyears past. If I was not clear on that today, I may not have been in my \nexplanation. I apologize but that is what I have said.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask one additional question. A few \nmoments ago--I know the Senator was being facetious--you talked about \nthe nasty pharmaceutical companies and how easy it is for some to come \nin and impugn them and pick on them and try to punish them in some way. \nI don't know if you heard my comments earlier in the day, but I talked \nabout how proud I was of a lot of what the pharmaceutical industry does \nin this country and around the world. In fact, I compared the advances \nin medicine to the advances in aeronautics in the last 100 years. The \nadvances in medicine have been more remarkable than those of \naeronautics. It is critical to have a robust industry on the cutting \nedge but at the same time two of the reasons the pharmaceuticals like \nto do their research in this country is because of the large amounts of \nmoney we fund to NIH. They do very valuable research that the \npharmaceutical companies operating here can take advantage of, and we \ngive them a very hefty research and development tax credit. I am for \nthat credit. I am a cosponsor to continue that credit. I think it is \ncritical for the industry.\n\n  I hope the Senator was not implying that I am a big critic of \npharmaceutical companies. Bear in mind, I don't think they always have \nclean hands. I have seen in my work as attorney general and reading the \nnewspapers some business practices I wish they would change. We dealt \nwith those at the State level when I was attorney general. The Senate \nis starting to deal with some of those.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I was not in any way suggesting you, individually, with \nrespect to pharmaceutical companies. I was suggesting the amendment is \nvery damaging to that research.\n  The Senator mentioned we subsidized through NIH research, as we do a \nvariety of other fields, not just pharmaceuticals, as well as providing \nresearch and development tax credit, which, of course, we do not just \nfor pharmaceuticals but for a variety of different industries. What we \nalso do is have the FDA process which is the most expensive and \ncumbersome existing in the world. It takes months, and in most cases \nyears, longer to get a drug to market, and that cap starts from the \ntime you file, not from the time of FDA approval. The fact we had a \nyear or 2 or 3 or more, when drugs are available in other countries and \nnot available here, it makes the time to recoup the investment shorter. \nThat is one of the reasons our prices are high, because of the shorter \ntime drug companies have as an opportunity to recoup their investment. \nThey have a longer period of time in places such as Canada, which does \nnot require the testing we do and the trials we do.\n  The other reason is we also have a very expensive litigation system \nin this country. Pharmaceutical companies, not surprisingly, because \nthey deal in the area of health care, are in court a lot for adverse \nreactions to their pharmaceutical products. Other countries do not have \nnearly the lucrative civil justice system, medical liability system, \nthat we have in this country. Therefore, the costs associated with \nselling pharmaceuticals in this country because of our litigation \nsystem are disproportionately higher than they are in places such as \nGermany, Canada, and others that do not have the same kind of rewards \nwe see in this country for harm done to people that ingest the drugs.\n  It is not just what we do to subsidize. Canada would say they \nprobably provide a percentage of money in there to help research, and I \nam sure the other countries would say they do the same; that they \ncontribute a share toward research, too.\n  As much as we subsidize, we probably cost them when it comes to the \nexisting structure of the FDA and the legal system in this country. I \nargue that, yes, we may help, but we probably give with one hand and \ntake with the other.\n\n  The bottom line is, this amendment delegates to the country of Canada \nthe authority to set drug prices in this country. I don't know whether \nthe Senator from Arkansas has considered whether drugs that are not set \nby formulary in Canada, whether those prices would not be set in this \ncountry, or only those on the formulary are set. In the end, if this \nwould pass, you would have a lot of drug companies probably not selling \ndrugs in Canada because by doing that, they give up this market.\n  My guess is the folks who are probably against this more than any \nother U.S. Senator, including myself, are probably the people in Canada \nwho, if this were to pass, we probably would not find one \npharmaceutical company willing to sell the drug in Canada if they would \nlose their market here. That may not be your intention, but I suspect \nthat would be the consequence because it is a pretty small market up \nthere compared to here. It is not profitable up there compared to here. \nMy guess is you would have the undesirable effect of affecting the \nhealth care of millions of Canadians when it comes to the ability to \nget new drugs; or conversely you would be requiring the Canadian \nGovernment, and maybe this would be good, to raise the reimbursements \nfor their drugs. That may be the desirable impact. That is not \nsomething I would be willing to take a chance with, as to whether the \nCanadian Government would respond in a favorable fashion, at least to \nmy understanding, to this amendment by actually increasing drug prices \nover there so they could keep some level of new pharmaceuticals within \ntheir country.\n\n  I understand we are not going to be voting on this immediately, this \nis going to be voted on tomorrow at some point. But I did want to come \nto the floor and just urge my colleagues, even if you are for \nreimportation, this is a fundamentally different thing. This is just \ncompletely changing the drug pricing structure of the United States of \nAmerica and delegating it to a foreign entity. I strongly suggest if \nyou want to do that, if you want to set drug prices, let's have an \namendment to set drug prices. My goodness, let's not delegate it to the \npeople of Canada to set our drug prices. Even if you are for \nreimportation, even if you are for cheaper drug prices, don't let the \nCanadian Government do it. Get the glory of setting it ourselves, if we \nwant to do something.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 933\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect \nto the Bingaman amendment, No. 933.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is amendment No. 933.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and ask \nfor the yeas and nays, to have the vote occur at 5:30 and that the time \nbetween now and 5:30 be evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I ask, now do we have 3 minutes or \nso on each side?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, we do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I have one of the 3 minutes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely. How many minutes does the Senator want?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I have a minute and a half? I see others who want to \naddress this issue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope this amendment will not be tabled. \nFirst, I commend the chairman of the committee and the ranking minority \nmember of the committee. They have made a major step forward in \nreducing what we call the asset test.\n  Under the assets test, any senior who managed to scrape together more \nthan $4,000 in a savings account wouldn't qualify for the most generous \nbenefit. Those elderly persons with a minimum amount of possessions, \neven if they are just above the very minimum wouldn't qualify. We are \neven talking about limits to the amounts that can be set\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\naside for a burial plot or the value of personal items like jewelry or \na car.\n  This bill we have before us has reduced the asset test in a very \nsignificant and dramatic way for seniors who have income above 135 \npercent of poverty. But it still remains for those who are poorest of \nthe poor. The Bingaman amendment costs only about $3 billion, but would \nsubstantially benefit the neediest of our seniors.\n  In addition, the paperwork for the assets test is demeaning and an \nadditional burden on senior citizens. I looked over the form in \nGeorgia, for example, and it is about 10 pages long. In another State \nit is 16 pages long. We are talking about a test which will effectively \nreduce the availability of absolutely needed prescription drugs for the \nseniors who are the poorest of the poor.\n  The bill before us has made very substantial progress in helping our \nneediest seniors. The Bingaman amendment would just finalize it and \neffectively say we are not going to use an asset test as a condition to \nbe able to participate in the prescription drug program.\n  I do not see my friend and colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, \nhere on the floor. But I want the Senator to know that it is a \nthoughtful amendment and it will assure that low income seniors have \naccess to the special assistance they need without pauperizing \nthemselves or undergoing this demeaning procedure. A senior with income \nbelow the poverty line and who didn't pass the assets test under the \ncurrent bill would pay 10 percent of the cost of the drugs, whereas \nunder the Bingaman amendment she will have to pay only 5 percent. That \ndoesn't sound like a lot of money around here but it is a lot of money \nfor some of the most needy senior citizens.\n  I commend the committee for what they have done. I hope we will \ncontinue to make progress in this area and not table the Bingaman \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I ask unanimous consent Senator Murray's amendment be the \nfirst in order after the vote, and that any other amendment in order be \nlaid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I understand the point which the Senator \nfrom New Mexico is trying to accomplish. We do this in Pennsylvania. We \ndo not have an asset test for our PACE Program. If you asked anybody up \nthere now, Pennsylvanians dealing with this PACE Program, with the \nbudget shortfall, one thing they would like to have put back in the box \nis this asset test.\n  You could have, conceivably, somebody who has a $1 million house and \nhas all their investments in a house or has other assets that are not \nincome producing and they could qualify for a very rich drug benefit \nunder this amendment. It really does encourage people to put their \nmoney into nonproducing assets to qualify, particularly those who are \nsick, to qualify for a drug benefit. I just think these asset tests are \na way of recognizing that income is not the only measure of what you \ncan afford to pay when it comes to drugs. We have to look at what \npeople own and the assets they have.\n\n  You can have someone who has very high asset value and very low \nincome. We run into that all the time. That is the reason we have a \nvariety of different taxes, to make sure we get at different ways in \nwhich people accumulate wealth and hold assets or live off income.\n  So I just say while this is well intentioned, it opens up a Pandora's \nbox to have people who have, frankly, lots of resources--potentially \nlots of resources to be able to provide for themselves and also would \nlead, I would argue, to unwise public policy to encourage people toward \nplanning when they retire to put their assets in nonperforming or \nnonincome-producing assets at a time when they probably should do \notherwise.\n  While it is well intentioned, it could lead to a variety of problems. \nIt is also a very expensive amendment and opens it up to millions more \npeople, and this is already a bill that many believe is very generous \nto people who have a substantial amount of money. We should not be \nexpanding this program in the subsidies to people who have a lot of \nassets that may not be income producing.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if there is no one else on our side I \nwould like to speak for another minute, if I could. Do we have the \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the author of the amendment is not here. I \nthink he was caught a bit off guard when it was announced the vote \nwould be on his amendment at 5:30. I understand he is on his way over \nhere. I think it is only fair he be allowed to speak for a couple or 3 \nminutes at least on his amendment.\n  I ask consent the vote on the Bingaman amendment not be at 5:30 but \nat 5:40, and the remaining 10 minutes be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, might I inquire of the \nChair what is the procedure after the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the first amendment \nwill be that of the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I ask the floor manager, if Senator \nBingaman is not here, could I have the remaining minute?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts, but inform \nSenators when the time has expired I am going to suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are not talking about individuals who \nhave $1 million homesteads. We are talking about seniors who have \n$10,000 in income. We are talking about poorest of the poor of our \nsenior citizens. This idea people are going to be able to circumvent it \nbecause they have $1 million and $10,000 in income is ridiculous on its \nface. Perhaps that individual is saving $5,000 in order to fix the roof \nin 2 or 3 years. They will not be eligible to be able to qualify under \nthe program here.\n\n  This is really the poorest of the poor, and we are talking about \nincomes of $10,000 or less. That is what this amendment is about. At \nleast I hope it would not be tabled. And if there is some kind of \ncondition in terms of the value of their home, as the Senator from \nPennsylvania has outlined, we can work that out. But we are talking \nabout the poorest of the poor. If that is the kind of protection the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is interested in, Senator Bingaman is \ninterested in, we are interested in, let's work it out, but let's not \ntable the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if the Senator wants to focus on the \npoorest of the poor, he should leave the assets test in place because \nthat is exactly what it does. It says that you have low income and low \nassets. So we have, in fact, covered exactly what the Senator from \nMassachusetts is attempting to do.\n  What the Bingaman amendment does is leave open the possibility of the \npoorest of the poor not being the most heavily subsidized, that people \nwho do have a big house, or other property, or amassed antiquities of \nsome sort that may be very valuable--a coin collection, who knows that \nthey would be focused in on as much as people who simply have nothing, \nhave no place else to turn. So the assets test is very important for \nthese scarce resources to be focused on those who need them most.\n  If you really do care about focusing on the poorest of the poor, and \nnot just opening this up to people who may not need the assistance as \nbadly, you would vote against the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBingaman be allowed to speak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for 2 minutes.\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I thank the \nSenator from Montana.\n  First, Mr. President, I understand there is an intent to try to table \nthis amendment at this point. Obviously, I would object to that. And I \nbelieve there are others who want to speak. I would like to try to \naccommodate any real concerns the majority has. So at this point, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to withdraw the amendment until it \ncan be perfected in a way the majority would support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not know if the motion is going to be \nto table this. I assume so. If it is, it is our recommendation we all \nmove to table this, and Senator Bingaman will just offer this again \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, do I still have any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for 30 seconds to explain my vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am going to go ahead and vote with the \nmanager of the bill to table my own amendment now in order that we can \nbring this back here tomorrow. I will plan to reoffer the amendment, \nand hope that if there are real problems with it, those can be brought \nto my attention before we reoffer the amendment tomorrow. It is a very \nimportant issue. It is one we need to deal with in a responsible way. I \nurge all colleagues to go ahead and vote to table at this time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 933 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I renew my request that I be allowed to \nwithdraw the amendment that I have related to the assets test at this \ntime and reoffer it tomorrow after I have had a chance to consult with \nmore of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Domenici as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for information of our colleagues, because \nwe initially set a vote for 5:30 tonight, for clarification, we will \nnot have any votes tonight. We will not be voting because the amendment \nwas just withdrawn. That decision was just made in the last 15 minutes. \nI know a lot of people had planned the course of the day to be voting \ntonight. Right now, other amendments have been introduced in the last \nfew hours, and suggestions have been made, well, let's go to those \namendments. In truth, a lot of people are showing up right at 5:30. I \nam uncomfortable having Senators come in and all of a sudden voting on \nthose amendments.\n  I think the best thing, after talking to the managers, is not to have \na vote tonight at this juncture but to have people continue to offer \ntheir amendments. We will continue the debate, and we will begin the \norderly voting on amendments under the direction of the two managers \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that under the \nunanimous consent request, it is in order for the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray, to offer an amendment. Accordingly, I ask \nunanimous consent that all pending amendments be temporarily laid aside \nso she may offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I did not hear the \nrequest.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I might repeat the request, that all \npending amendments be temporarily set aside so the Senator from \nWashington may offer her amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have no objection. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to offer my amendment which will only take \na few minutes after the Senator from Washington finishes her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 990\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. MURRAY] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 990.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Congress is about to update Medicare to \nfinally help seniors with prescription drugs, and while I have some \nreal concerns about the way this bill would provide drug coverage, I am \nconvinced that after 5 years of stalemate, it is time to pass a drug \nbenefit now to begin to get seniors the help they need.\n  Mr. President, I have been working to improve this bill by providing \nadditional funding in the Budget Committee, by supporting various \namendments, and by offering my own amendment.\n  I want to make sure that the drug benefit we create will help as many \nseniors as possible. Before we add a new benefit to Medicare, we have \nto remember that there's a serious problem with Medicare today that \npenalizes seniors based on where they live. The problem is in the \npayment formula that Medicare uses, and it hurts many seniors.\n  Today under Medicare, some seniors can get fewer services--and pay \nhigher premiums--just based on where they live. Every senior pays the \nsame amount into Medicare, but some seniors get much fewer benefits \nbased on geography. That's not fair to seniors in my State and in other \nStates.\n  For the past few years, I've been working to fix that problem. Last \nyear, I introduced the MediFair Act to bring all States up to the \nnational average in Medicare payments. We are still working to fix this \ndisparity in Medicare today. The problem is that this new drug benefit \nwould follow that same old, unfair formula. It means that seniors in \nStates such as Washington will have few choices and pay higher \npremiums.\n  That's why I'm offering my amendment today--to give seniors more \nchoices and lower premiums as they get healthcare and prescription \ndrugs.\n  As we improve Medicare, we shouldn't build on the unfair polices of \nthe past. While I am still working to fix the underlying formula that's \nhurting seniors in my State, we can at least avoid perpetuating an \nunfair system in this new benefit. I am proud to report that we have \nmade some progress recently to fix the regional disparity that \npenalizes many Medicare patients. I am pleased to have joined with \nSenators Grassley and Baucus in closing the rural versus urban gap in \nreimbursements.\n  And, earlier this year, the Budget Committee unanimously adopted the \nFeingold-Murray-Johnson amendment, which modified the Medicare reserve \nfund to allow legislation to promote geographic equity in Medicare \npayments.\n  Back in 1997, when we expanded Medicare+Choice, we took some steps to \nmake it fairer. Since the Medicare+Choice rate was based on the fee-\nfor-service rate, it was important to provide some guaranteed level for \nstates with low reimbursements. We did two things. First, we set a \nminimum payment--known as a floor--so that no county would fall below a \ncertain level. Second, we tweaked the funding formula to provide \ngreater equity across the country for everyone on Medicare. That \napproach is known as a ``blend'' because it takes the regional formula \nand blends it with the national average. Those were both good steps. \nThere was only one problem: Congress never provided the funding to \nrevise the formula. So we put a fix in the law, but we never funded it. \nWe have not been able to fund it until now because it has to be budget \nneutral.\n  Today, my amendment would finally fund that technical correction and \ngive seniors better access to care. Specifically, my amendment fully \nfunds the Medicare+Choice blend formula starting in 2006 for \ndetermining the Medicare Advantage benchmark. If we don't fix this \nproblem, we will deny many seniors access to coordinated care.\n  PPO's and HMO's will only go into those regions already at the higher \nend of per beneficiary reimbursement. We should--at the very least--try \nto create a level playing field for all regions of the country. It is \nunfair to talk about competition when some regions will receive \nhundreds of dollars more per beneficiary than others.\n  During this debate, I have listened to my colleagues talk about the \nbenefits of PPO's and HMO's as part of their new Medicare Advantage. \nSenator Frist has spoken several times on the benefit of a coordinated \ncare approach for improving disease management and keeping seniors \nhealthier longer. While I still have some concerns about how these new \nplans will operate, I want to be sure that seniors in Washington State \nand other States with low Medicare reimbursement can take advantage of \nMedicare Advantage. I also want to point out that is not about \nincreasing payments to insurance plans. It's about ensuring that \nseniors in all regions of the country have access to competitive \nMedicare Advantage plans.\n  My amendment is similar to language adopted in the House Ways & Means \nCommittee mark. However, I do not fully fund the blend in my amendment \nuntil 2006. The House proposes the change starting in 2004. I also \npoint out that my amendment doesn't force plans in any State or region \nto do anything. If they want to base Medicare Advantage on either the \ncurrent fee-for-service rate--or the Medicare +Choice rate--they are \nfree to do so. My amendment gives plans a third option that could be \nmore fair and could help more seniors.\n  Finally--in an effort to truly measure the cost of providing care to \nall seniors--my amendment directs the Department of Health and Human \nServices to determine the costs of care provided to Medicare \nbeneficiaries at DoD or VA facilities. Since Medicare assumes the \nreimbursement, these beneficiaries should be counted in the equation.\n  Failing to account for the cost of this care has resulted in lower \nfee for service per beneficiary costs. Those lower fee-for-service \nrates means significant inequities in Medicare reimbursement. We should \ncorrect this existing flaw before we build a new drug benefit around \nit.\n  I have been trying to get HHS to take this step since 1997 and \nsupported language in BIP A2000 directing HHS to report to Congress on \nrecommendations for correcting this inequity. Unfortunately, HHS \nremains unwilling or unable to properly determine the actual cost of \ncare in any given region or State.\n\n\n                            self-injectables\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take just a moment to update my colleagues \non another amendment that I will be offering soon with Senator Conrad \nand Senator Smith. It relates to a new, exciting group of drugs known \nas self-injected biologics, and it's a chance to give Medicare patients \naccess to the benefits these new drugs offer. Senator Conrad offered a \nsimilar amendment during the Senate Finance Committee mark up and \nreceived a commitment from the Chair to work with us on this effort. As \na result of this commitment, Senator Conrad withdrew the amendment. We \nhave been working with CBO and Senator Baucus' staff to address any \nconcerns.\n  Currently, Medicare will only cover biologics if they are \nadministered in a physician's office or clinical setting. That means \npatients must travel to the physician's office to receive treatment. \nThat's not easy for many patients who have Rheumatoid Arthritis or MS--\ntwo diseases that can severely limit a person's mobility.\n  Fortunately, there are versions of these drugs that a patient can \ntake in their own home. It's a great innovation that will improve a \npatient's access. Unfortunately, Medicare won't cover biologics that \nare administered in the home. That just doesn't make sense. I have been \nworking to correct this inequity for the past two Congresses. The \nMurray-Conrad-Smith amendment would provide two years of coverage, \nunder Part B, for those self injected biologics that replace treatments \ncurrently available only in a physician's office. We allow for two-year \ncoverage to bridge the gap to implementation of a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  We have received a CBO score for the two years and believe that we \ncan find room in 2004 and 2005 to provide this important coverage for \nMS and RA patients. This legislation is strongly endorsed by the \nArthritis Foundation and will provide additional coverage to all four \nMS self-injected or self-administered treatments. For MS, only one\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\ntreatment is covered under Medicare, provided in a physician's office.\n  I am hopeful that the managers of this legislation will be able to \naccept our amendment and end this discriminatory practice in Medicare.\n  Let me close by returning to the amendment currently before the \nSenate. For those Senators concerned about the inequities in the \ncurrent Medicare reimbursement rates, I urge you to support this \namendment. Fully funding the blend--as a third option in determining \nthe Medicare Advantage benchmark--will provide greater equity and \nensure that all seniors in all regions have access to a competitive, \nmanaged and coordinated care approach. Let's finally stop an unfair \nsystem and give seniors the access they deserve. It's the right thing \nto do, and I urge its immediate passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set \naside the pending amendment so Senator Harkin can offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 991\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a demonstration project under the Medicaid \n   program to encourage the provision of community-based services to \n                     individuals with disabilities)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 991.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proposing this amendment, which would \nenact into law the ``Money Follows the Person'' rebalancing \ndemonstration project. This project was part of President Bush's 2004 \nbudget request. It is a critical component of President Bush's new \nfreedom initiative.\n  This really is about freedom. It is about the freedom of people with \ndisabilities to enjoy the same opportunities for employment and \ncommunity living that are available to all Americans.\n  A number of years ago after the passage of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, a number of us began working on what we considered to \nbe the next step in trying to provide for a more open environment for \npeople with disabilities. And that was to get more people out of \nconfined living--nursing homes and institutions--and put them into \ncommunity-based living arrangements.\n  The bill we have been working on to do that is called MiCASSA, which \nis the shorthand for the Medicaid Community Attendant Services and \nSupport Act. I have been working on the bill for 10 years. In fact, I \nnote for the record that the first introduction of this bill took place \nin the House in 1997 and was introduced by none other than the Speaker \nof the House Newt Gingrich. It was first introduced in the Senate in \n1999, and I was the chief sponsor of it at that time.\n  My amendment basically would take what the President suggested in his \nbudget and make it operable. My amendment would take the President's \nproposal for giving grants to States to transition individuals into \ncommunity-based living under the existing Medicaid program.\n  Under the President's proposal, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare \nwould give out to States $350 million per year for 5 years. This money \nwould pay 100 percent of the cost for community-based services for the \nfirst year after individuals with disabilities move out of an \ninstitution or a nursing home. After that time, the Federal Government \nwould pay its regular Medicaid rate.\n  This amendment and the President's proposal was for a demonstration \nprogram for 5 years. So the total cost of this will be $1.75 billion \nover 5 years, and it will end because then the States would go back to \ntheir normal process and procedure. The idea behind this is to give \nStates the upfront money they needed to get people with disabilities \nout of nursing homes and get them into community-based living.\n  I believe the President proposed this initiative because he \nrecognized that, unfortunately, under current Federal Medicaid policy, \nthe deck is stacked in favor of living in an institution. For example, \nright now under Medicaid, States are required to provide nursing home \ncare, but they are not required to provide home and community-based \nservices.\n  Data from 2001 indicates that 70 percent of Medicaid funds are now \nbeing spent on institutional care and only 30 percent for community-\nbased care. That is a shameful statistic that needs to change. As the \nadministration's documents state, this initiative would ``level the \nplaying field.''\n  Some might argue this is a Medicare bill and we should not include a \nMedicaid initiative. However, there are other Medicaid provisions in \nthis Medicare bill, presumably because they are important to some of \nour colleagues.\n  This amendment, I believe, is just as worthy, and I would argue more \nso because it helps fulfill our goals in passing the Americans with \nDisabilities Act 13 years ago. In fact, the 13th anniversary of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act is coming up on this July 26. Thirteen \nyears ago we made specific findings about institutionalization and the \ncontinued segregation of individuals with disabilities.\n  I was one of the leading sponsors of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, and I know firsthand the effects of segregation of people with \ndisabilities. I told the story often about my brother Frank. When he \nwas a young boy, he became deaf because he had spinal meningitis. He \nbecame totally deaf. They picked him up, took him away from home, and \nsent him halfway across the State to a segregated school for the deaf. \nThe people referred to it as a school for the deaf and dumb. As my \nbrother always said, I may be deaf, but I am not dumb. That is what it \nwas like in those days. It continues on today, that people with \ndisabilities are segregated and sent to live in institutions.\n\n  A couple of years ago, 1999, a very famous case made its way to the \nSupreme Court. It is referred to as the Olmstead case. The Supreme \nCourt ruled in 1999 that confinement in an institution is \ndiscrimination. The Supreme Court stated that when you segregate \nsomeone, as was being done in Georgia--and this case just happened to \noriginate in Georgia. I am not picking on that State, but it happens in \nall other States. This Olmstead case just happened to originate in \nGeorgia. When the Supreme Court looked at the case, they said when you \nsegregate someone, you are telling them they are ``unworthy to \nparticipate in community life.'' That is the Supreme Court decision.\n  That Supreme Court decision said that States must offer the least \nrestrictive environment to people with disabilities. The problem is, 4 \nyears later after the Supreme Court ruling, there are still countless \nAmericans with disabilities institutionalized, needlessly \ninstitutionalized.\n  This amendment is a win-win program. It would not only help offer \nmore choices to people with disabilities, it would provide the \nresources to States during a very difficult fiscal time. Studies have \nshown States that rebalance their long-term services system can realize \nsubstantial savings. The Lewin Group did a study of three States that \nincreased their use of home and community-based waivers instead of \nnursing homes in the early nineties. In one year, Colorado saved $42 \nmillion, Oregon saved $49 million, and Washington saved $74.5 million.\n  The researchers explained these States were able to get such high \ncost savings by targeting people with disabilities who were very likely \nto go into a nursing home. In our amendment, we are targeting those who \nare already in an institution or nursing home. So States are already \nspending large sums of money on these people.\n  Based on data provided by the Congressional Research Service, nursing \nhomes cost approximately $57,000 per year per person. Institutions for \nindividuals with mental retardation cost $88,000 per person per year. \nHome and community-based waivers are roughly $30,000 to $50,000 cheaper \nper person than these institutional cases.\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\n  The problem is States cannot afford the upfront costs that are needed \nto move people out of institutions and into community-based living. For \nexample, housing may need to be modified to be accessible. That costs \nmoney. An individual may need some education and services to get ready \nto move out of an institution, especially if they have been there a \nlong time, say, 20 years or more. The State may need resources to \ndevelop sufficient community providers and rebalance its long-term \nservice program.\n  There are a lot of upfront costs a State would have to do to get \nsomeone with a disability out of a nursing home, out of a State \ninstitution, and into a community-based living environment.\n  The amendment I am offering implements President Bush's own budget \nrequest for 2004. It will be an upfront investment to help these States \ndo that transition. It is a demonstration program for 5 years to those \nStates that need the help.\n  I applaud the President for proposing this program as part of his new \nfreedom initiative because it really is about freedom: The freedom to \nlive with family and friends, not with strangers; the freedom to take a \nwalk in one's own neighborhood, not just on their ward; the freedom to \nbe a person and not a patient.\n  No one should have to sacrifice their freedom to participate in \nsociety because they need help getting out of the house in the morning \nor assistance with personal care or some other basic service. Think \nabout it. That is what happens to people with disabilities. They \nsacrifice their freedom to participate in society because they may need \na little help in the morning, a little bit of help at night, or a \nlittle bit of attendant services.\n  As taxpayers, we know it is cheaper for us to provide that kind of \nhome-based, community-based service rather than putting people in \ninstitutions. But back when we built the institutions, when we started \nthe nursing home care for people with disabilities that is what we \nbelieved, that people ought to be segregated.\n  We have changed as a society, and I think we have changed for the \nbetter. It is not unusual now to see people with disabilities in all \nwalks of life, working on the Senate floor, in our court systems, on \nthe shop floor, running businesses, shopping in the store, eating in a \nrestaurant, going to an amusement park. I argue what is unusual is that \nin the year 2003, to say we are going to take taxpayer money and we are \ngoing to institutionalize someone with a disability who does not want \nto be institutionalized, who would rather live in the community, who \nwould like to go out for a walk in the daytime, who might want to go \ndown to the corner store and purchase some things, who might want to go \nto a movie now and then.\n  Recently, I received a letter from someone who had been moved to \ncommunity-based living. She said she went to a movie for the first time \nin 3 years. Think about that. It was the first time in 3 years because \nshe had been in an institution and she could not go to the theater. Now \nshe can go to the movie theater.\n  I hope Senators will think about this. As I said, it is in the \nPresident's budget. He has requested it. I have offset it. So I can see \nno reason we should not take this step to make sure people with \ndisabilities can get back into the community where they belong and \nwhere they want to be, with their family and friends, and not shut up \nwith strangers, with people they may not know, segregated from society.\n  I urge my colleagues to act now. Freedom does not need a lot of \ndebate and discussion. The freedom for people with disabilities ought \nto be happening right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They will be voted on later this \nweek, and we will be calling them up for that purpose at that time.\n  During my campaign for the Senate in 2000, I promised a good \nprescription drug coverage program for senior citizens would be one of \nmy very first priorities. In December of 2000, after my election but \njust before I took office, I went up to Duluth, MN, up in the \nnortheastern part of our State, and met with a group of senior \ncitizens. At the end of the meeting, an elderly woman, who was about \nhalf my size and twice my age, stood up and said: Mr. Dayton, if you do \nnot keep your promises, I am going to take you out behind the woodshed \nfor an old-fashioned thrashing.\n  It has been then with some trepidation that I have visited Duluth in \nthe months that followed, and it is not just Duluth. Everywhere in \nMinnesota our elderly citizens, and actually all of our other Medicare \nbeneficiaries who stand to benefit from this legislation, have been \nwaiting. They have been waiting patiently and they have been waiting \nimpatiently for the Senate, the House, and the White House to reach an \nagreement on a bill, pass it, and then have the President sign it into \nlaw.\n  During the last several years, our seniors have watched the Senate \npass a bill but not the House; the House act but not the Senate; both \nbodies fail to pass anything; both the House and the Senate pass a bill \nyet be unable to agree on one and nothing passed. Meanwhile, every year \nthat Congress and the President did nothing, our senior citizens paid \nthe price, and then they paid another price and then another.\n  Prescription drug prices have risen higher and higher in this country \nwhile nothing was being done to help. The financial burdens then fell \nharder on people with limited and fixed incomes. People who worked hard \nall of their lives, saved up a bit, retired, and did not have many \nother earning opportunities, were literally destroyed by the rapid \nescalation of prescription drug medicine, medicines they cannot afford \nnot to have, medicines they cannot afford to have.\n  People's peace of mind was shattered. Hopes and plans had to be \nabandoned, ones that had been months and years in the making. Even \nmodest comforts and simple enjoyments had to be sacrificed to pay this \nravaging beast of the pharmaceutical industry that wanted more profits \nout of pockets, out of the sweat and blood of senior citizens and other \nAmericans.\n  The financial security and the protections from destitution and \ndespair, which Social Security and Medicare have provided our elderly \nfor several decades and which was one of the great accomplishments of \nthis society, was being rapidly eradicated by drug companies' greed and \nCongress's and the administration's inaction.\n  I thought on the day when we finally acted and passed a prescription \ndrug coverage bill for senior citizens and other beneficiaries it would \nbe cause for real celebration and satisfaction, and I could go back to \nDuluth. Well, it appears that this Friday may very well be that day \nwhere we will pass in the Senate prescription drug legislation, but the \nway it looks now I will not be celebrating the passage of the bill that \nis before us right now.\n  It is usually true that something is better than nothing, and the \nbill that is before us now is barely enough of something to be better \nthan nothing. I will probably vote for it for that reason, but I will \nnot be celebrating because there is not enough in this bill to be \nworthy of celebration. For starters, it does not even begin until \nJanuary 1 of the year 2006. It is unbelievable there would be a 2\\1/2\\ \nyear delay from the time this bill is signed into law before it is \noperational.\n\n  To let that stand is a violation of the Constitution which prohibits \ncruel and unusual punishment for American citizens. It is cruel and \nunusual punishment for the senior citizens of Minnesota and their \ncounterparts of this country who have waited this long, year after \nyear, waiting for this legislation, bills mounting. Finally something \nis passed and they are told they have to wait another 2\\1/2\\ years for \nthe Federal Government and the insurance industry to set up this \nprogram. Shame on us if we do not move the development of this program \nfrom the sleepwalking mode into overdrive.\n  Proponents of this bill say the approach using subsidized insurance \nplans to provide this coverage is one of the advantages--they have \npostulated in the Senate and committee--because it is more efficient. \nThe insurance companies are in the business of designing and selling \ninsurance policies. How could they need 2\\1/2\\ years to develop this? \nIf they do, it seems to me that is a very compelling reason to look for \na different delivery system. Some believe that would be good for other \nreasons, as well.\n  My first amendment is named the bureaucracy booster to require \nwhatever program we pass and whatever the President signs into law to \nbe fully operational by January 1 of 2004, 2 years earlier than the \nPresident's schedule calls for. It would be 6 months after we pass our \nbill later this week. It took 6 months for our armed services to \nassemble their forces and prepare for the war against Iraq. They were \nready to go when General Franks gave his order. If this country can get \nready to win a war in 6 months--and actually the war against the \nTaliban in Afghanistan was assembled in about 6 weeks--it certainly can \nstart to save our senior citizens in that same amount of time.\n  I am also troubled by the quality of the program which will hopefully \nbe available to everyone on Medicare, if my amendment passes, next \nJanuary 1. The coverage in the bill before the Senate is not very good. \nI don't fault the leaders of this bill who took it through the \ncommittee process. It was a very difficult task, with Members from all \nover the country. They were constrained by the budget this body passed \nearlier this year. You can slice and dice the programs and the delivery \nand the structuring but the bottom line is you will get what you pay \nfor. Maybe it is better one way or the other but the bottom line is you \nget what you pay for. The Finance Committee had $400 billion over 10 \nyears and they did the best they could, but the fact is that is not \nenough to provide the kind of coverage the senior citizens of this \ncountry have a right to expect. It provides only half the coverage we \nMembers of the Senate and our colleagues in the House get through the \nFederal employees plan.\n  The bill before the Senate requires a $35 a month premium and a $275 \ndeductible, so an enrollee pays $695 each year before receiving a \nsingle dollar of assistance. From that point, for all of his or her \nnonreimbursement prescription drugs above the $275 deductible, up to \n$4,500 in 1 year, the program would pay half. At that point, \nincredibly, the program pays nothing then for drug costs that exceed \n$4,500 for one person in one year, all the way up to $5,800. I \nunderstand that was done for the purpose of fitting within this budget \ncap. But it seems unfair to have a 50 percent program up to one point, \nthen have the program disappear entirely for $1,300 of expenditures, \nbut come back after $5,800, for the balance of the year, when the \nprogram pays 90 percent. The next year it starts all over again. For \nthe first $5,800 in annual prescription drug costs out-of-pocket \npayments, nonreimbursed, a senior citizen of Minnesota or America has \nto pay $3,688 plus they have to pay $4,200 in monthly premiums. So the \ntotal payment for the senior citizen is $4,108 and the program will pay \n$2,012. The senior pays almost twice as much as the program assistance. \nSo hundreds and thousands of dollars of expenses will be paid by a very \nlimited and fixed-income senior citizen.\n\n  It is not a good deal. It is not what we ought to be providing for \nour seniors. It is not as generous as the alternative bill which our \ncolleague, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has offered as an \nalternative amendment which I am proud to work on and cosponsor. That \nis the kind of program I would want my mother or father to be on. It is \nas good a program as members of the Senate have. It would have no \ndeductible and pay for 70 percent of the costs from the very first $1 \nowed up\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\nuntil $5,000 and 90 percent above that. That is a much better \nadministrative feature.\n  What the pharmaceutical industry wants to the death to oppose is the \nFederal Government CMS, the Medicare administrators getting involved in \nnegotiating down the prices. They have free and clear now, unlike \nvirtually any other country in the world, ability to just raise prices \nfor prescription drugs and raise them and raise them. They are making \nhuge profits. Most of their worldwide profits are made in the United \nStates of America not only with our seniors but all citizens because \nthis body and the House and White House will not stand up and do \nsomething about it. Senator Durbin's amendment would do something. I \nexpect the pharmaceutical industry to oppose it to the death.\n  I have a second amendment which I call the taste of our own medicine \namendment which says if the program we pass for Medicare beneficiaries \nis less advantageous than the one we receive under the Federal \nemployees health plan, the coverage for all Members of Congress, the \nSenate and the House, will be reduced to the same level as the coverage \nprovided for senior citizens and others under Medicare. If it is good \nenough for the seniors of America, it is as good as we should do for \nourselves.\n  My third amendment is what I call my bureaucracy buster. Earlier I \nhad bureaucracy booster to get the program operating early. This \napplies to all of Medicare. It would apply, I am told by the CEO of \nMayo Clinic, to 130,000 pages of rules and regulations that make up the \ngovernance of Medicare. I was going to bring 130,000 pages over here as \na graphic illustration, but it is a violation of Senate rules for \ndecency and decorum. If anyone ever saw 130,000 pages piled up, they \nwould agree. It is bigger than all the Harry Potter books, a lot bigger \nthan anyone involved in Medicare had a chance to look at either to \napply to their hospital or clinic or to enforce, and it is one piece of \nthis epidemic of verbiage, duplicative regulation, multiple reporting \nrequirements we have placed on doctors, hospitals, administrators, \nspecial education teachers, school superintendents, small business, \nlarge business, this plague of ever more and more and more regulations, \nmore complicated, more lengthy, more time consuming. We are burying our \nsociety, burying our economy, burying our delivery systems to other \npeople and we have to start turning that around.\n  This amendment requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ncome back to Congress by October 1 of 2004 with a revision to the \nMedicare regulations and rules that amounts to two-thirds of all the \nwords that are now being used for those purposes. It would be a two-\nthirds reduction in the amount of regulation and reporting. That means \nwe have to squeeze everything down into 45,000 pages. It will just have \nto be done.\n\n  If my colleagues will join me in agreeing to this amendment, once it \nhas proven to be a viable idea, it is something I would like to apply \nto other regulatory and reporting mechanisms in the Federal Government \nas well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

This is the Drug Competition Act of 2003. I filed it as \nan amendment to S. 1. I do it in a bipartisan way with Senator Leahy \nand many others.\n  Our amendment will help Federal regulators ensure that antitrust laws \nare not being violated and that there is full and unfettered access to \ncompetition for prescription drugs under the law.\n  What I want to do is make sure American consumers--and in the case of \nprescription drugs for Medicare, senior citizens--are able to get the \nlifesaving drugs they need and to do it in a competitive manner with \nresulting lower prices.\n  Our patent laws provide drug companies with incentives to invest in \nthe research and development of new drugs,\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\nbut the law also provides that generic drug companies have the ability \nto get their own drugs on the market so there can be price competition \nand lower prices for prescription drugs. We have a legal system in \nplace that provides such a balance; that is, the Hatch-Waxman law. \nUltimately, we want consumers and seniors to have more choices and to \nget drugs at lower prices.\n  So I was concerned when I heard reports that the Federal Trade \nCommission had brought enforcement actions against brand-name and \ngeneric drug manufacturers that had entered into anticompetitive \nagreements, resulting in the delay of the introduction of lower priced \ndrugs. Our amendment targets this problem.\n  I would like to explain in a little more detail the problem. Under \nthe Hatch-Waxman Act, manufacturers of generic drugs are encouraged to \nchallenge weak or invalid patents on brand-name drugs so that consumers \ncan benefit from lower generic drug prices. Current law gives temporary \nprotection from competition to the first generic drug manufacturer that \ngets exclusive permission to sell a generic drug before the patent on \nthe brand-name drug expires. This gives the generic firm, then, a 180-\nday head start on all other generic companies.\n  However, the FTC discovered that some companies were exploiting this \nlaw by entering into secret deals, which allowed the generic drugmakers \nto claim a 180-day grace period, and to block, then, other generic \ndrugs from entering the market, while at the same time getting paid by \nthe brand-name manufacturer for withholding sales of generic versions \nof the drug. Quite a sweet deal.\n  This meant, then, under this sweet deal, that consumers continued to \npay high prices for drugs rather than benefiting from more competition \nand consequently lower prices.\n  The Federal Trade Commission brought antitrust law enforcement \nactions against the brand-name and generic drug companies that had \nengaged in this anticompetitive behavior. In addition, the Federal \nTrade Commission conducted a comprehensive review of agreements that \nimpacted the 180-day exclusivity period. The FTC found that there are \ncompetition problems with some of these agreements that potentially \ndelayed generic drugs entering the market--just the opposite of what \nthe FTC wanted to happen. So the FTC made this recommendation:\n  Given this history, we believe that notification of such agreements \nto the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice is \nwarranted. We support the Drug Competition Act of 2001, introduced by \nSenator Leahy, as reported by the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  As the Federal Trade Commission has indicated in its report, the \nGrassley-Leahy amendment, the Drug Competition Act of 2003, is a simple \nsolution to the 180-day exclusivity period and the problems the FTC has \nidentified. Our amendment would require drug companies that enter into \nagreements relating to the 180-day period to file documents, those very \ndocuments with the FTC and the Department of Justice. Our amendment \nwould impose sanctions on companies that do not provide timely \nnotification. This process would facilitate agency review of the \nagreements. It would do it to determine whether they have \nanticompetitive effects. Making sure the agreement between the generic \nand brand-name drug companies is in compliance with the law is good for \nthe American consumer because it guarantees free, full, and fair \ncompetition.\n  Both Senator Leahy and I worked with the Federal Trade Commission and \nthe Department of Justice, the generic and brand-name drug companies, \nand other interested groups in crafting the language contained in this \namendment, and I think we have a very good work product that I am \noffering the Senate. We tried to address everyone's concerns and we \ntried to limit the scope of the act. We also made every attempt to \nensure that the notification requirement did not unnecessarily burden \nindustry.\n  I am not aware of any opposition to this language. In fact, the Drug \nCompetition Act, passed out of the Judiciary Committee and the full \nSenate last year by unanimous consent, and the Federal Trade Commission \nreport came out in full support of the Grassley-Leahy amendment as a \nway to help preserve healthy and open competition in the drug markets.\n  The Grassley-Leahy amendment will ensure that consumers ultimately \nare not hurt by secret, anticompetitive contracts, so the consumer can \nget competition and lower drug prices almost immediately. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Grassley-Leahy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding a number of \nSenators have offered amendments. I assume they have been sending them \nto the desk and setting them aside. Is that correct?\n  That is what I would like to do before we adjourn this evening.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 994\n\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment I have discussed with my \ncolleagues and have spoken about on the Senate floor a few times. It is \nin the nature of a substitute to the underlying bill.\n  Let me say, though I have had many differences with my friend from \nIowa about a variety of different matters we have worked on over the \nyears, I congratulate both him and Senator Baucus for their leadership. \nI think what they have done is bring the Senate to this moment in our \nhistory where we are seriously considering a prescription drug program \nthat will benefit the tens of millions of seniors across America. And \nthis conversation is long overdue.\n  I think what they have proposed is a worthy start for a commitment \nthat needs to be made. I think there isn't a Senator who comes to this \nfloor who has not been back to his or her State to hear of the tales \nand stories of families and the struggles they are going through in \npaying for prescription drugs.\n  I was back in my hometown of Springfield, IL, over the weekend for a \nwedding, and out of nowhere people started coming up to me and talking \nabout prescription drug costs: I know you are debating this in \nWashington.\n  I think this is a timely discussion. I hope, at the end of the \ndiscussion, we will have a bill that really does achieve what we hope \nto achieve. I think making a national commitment to a prescription drug \nprogram under Medicare is the right thing to do, but I think we need to \ndo it with our eyes wide open.\n  There are several facts we should consider. Let me give you \nillustrations. One of them is the cost of prescription drugs is going \nto continue to rise dramatically unless we address it, and address it \nhead on. They say the cost of prescription drugs goes up 10 to 20 \npercent a year. You can ask any senior or family and they can tell you \nthat story.\n  What troubles me about the underlying bill is it does not have \ncompetitive forces that will bring these costs down. It provides for a \npercentage helping hand to seniors to pay for their prescription drug \nbills, but that percentage becomes less and less as the overall cost of \nprescription drugs continues to grow out of hand. The substitute \namendment which I am offering is going to address this, I hope, in a \nmeaningful way.\n  Just last Friday--I guess a surprise vote to some--we decided to \nallow America's seniors to import drugs from Canada. Why did we do \nthat? Because everybody knows the story: The very same American drug \ncompanies that make these products in America, when they turn to sell \nthem in Canada, give them a deep discount. Why? Because the Canadian \nGovernment says to them: If you want to sell drugs in Canada, then you \nhave to discount the cost to Canadian citizens.\n  So here we are, in our States bordering Canada, just a few miles away \nfrom pharmacies in Canada selling identical drugs to those sold in \nAmerica at a fraction of the cost. Now, of course, that is a benefit to \nCanadian citizens. And we decided last Friday we would make certain \nthat benefit was there for American citizens.\n\n  We can reimport drugs--in other words, made in the United States, \nshipped to Canada for sale. We will now, under the amendment we adopted \nby Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, allow Americans to repurchase the \ndrugs from Canadian pharmacies to bring them back into the United \nStates. Isn't that an awkward, clumsy,\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\nand convoluted way to provide a discount to America's seniors? It \ncertainly is. But we voted for it on a pretty substantial rollcall. I \nthink over 60 Senators supported it because we understand for many \nseniors that Canadian discount makes all the difference in the world.\n  Unfortunately, this reimportation from Canada is temporary, and it is \nnot a permanent part of what we are debating here. In fact, there are \nfew, if any, elements in this underlying legislation that give seniors \nin America a fighting chance to get anywhere near the discounted prices \nbeing offered to families in Canada for the prescription drugs they \nneed. In other words, we are offering a helping hand from the \nGovernment to pay for your prescription drugs, but offering no force or \nno element--certainly very little--within this bill to try to reduce \nand control prices.\n  You may think: Is Canada that powerful that they can dictate to the \nAmerican drug companies they have to discount their prices? Well, I can \ntell you, the Canadian market represents about 2 percent--2 percent--of \nthe sales by American drug companies, whereas the United States market \nrepresents 53 percent. If we, as a nation, turned to these same drug \ncompanies that have bargained with Canada and said: ``We want the same \nthing for Americans,'' you can bet we would achieve it. But this bill \ndoes not do that. The Grassley-Baucus bill does not do this. It does \nnot create this force for competition and this force for bringing down \ncosts.\n  Some will come to the floor and say: Durbin, this amendment is \nnothing short of socialism. You are trying, with a radical idea, to \nchange the market structure in America, take away the free market \ncompetition, and dictate prices, and that is just unfair. We should not \ndo it. And that is not American.\n  Well, I would ask them to place a call to the Veterans' \nAdministration because the Veterans' Administration already does the \nsame thing. The Veterans' Administration bargains for our veterans so \nthe prescription drugs they receive are at a reduced cost. Why, if our \nGovernment will stand up for our veterans to get reduced costs for \nprescription drugs, is that any different than saying, under this bill, \nwe should also be bargaining to make certain we can bring down \nprescription drug costs across the board? It will mean the program is \nmore affordable for seniors. It will also mean the money we dedicate to \nthe program will be with us for a while, a lot longer than as proposed \nunder this bill.\n  So we do several things in this substitute amendment. I am not going \nto take any further time other than to just say a few words about this \namendment, who supports it, and what it stands to achieve.\n  It is being offered on my behalf, as well as Senators Corzine, \nHarkin, Boxer, Stabenow, Dayton, and Byrd. It has been endorsed, to \nthis point--we think other endorsements will come--by the Alliance for \nRetired Americans as well as the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n\n  Here is what it does. It defines the benefits in statute. The \nunderlying bill does not. It eliminates the coverage gap. The \nunderlying bill has a coverage gap, where, after a senior has spent a \ncertain amount of money for prescription drugs, there is no coverage \nuntil it reaches a catastrophic level over $5,000. It eliminates the \ndeductible of $275 proposed by this bill because we found with price \ncompetition we can bring down the overall cost. It increases cost \nsharing. It guarantees a stable fallback. In other words, if there is \nnot a private prescription benefit pharmacy manager offering \nalternatives to seniors, we allow Medicare itself to offer a \nprescription drug plan. That is a fallback always available under our \nbill. You do not have to be eliminated from the one to offer the other. \nThis is always a fallback. And it allows employer coverage to count \ntoward out-of-pocket spending.\n  The average cost for prescription drugs for seniors in this year is \nexpected to be approximately $2,300. Under this bill we are considering \non the floor today, seniors could get back maybe one fourth of that, \n$600. Every dollar counts and I commend my leaders in the Finance \nCommittee for bringing this to us, but it is $600. Under the MediSAVE \nplan, my substitute amendment, seniors will have no deductible, lower \ncost-sharing, and face no coverage gap. The average senior can save up \nto 50 percent of the cost of those $2,300 in drugs, almost double what \nis offered by the underlying bill.\n  There is no guaranteed benefit for seniors in the underlying bill, \nand premiums are left up to insurance companies to decide. Under the \nMediSAVE plan, which I will offer, the Medicare-delivered benefit is \noutlined in statute so all seniors who choose to receive their benefit \nthrough Medicare will be guaranteed the same package, the same premium, \nno matter where they live in America.\n  As I said before, we address skyrocketing drug prices whereas the \nunderlying bill does not. Incidentally, the Veterans' Administration \nhas saved about $943 million in the past 6 years because it has \nbargained with the drug companies on behalf of seniors.\n  We also maintain choice. I see some of my Republicans friends have \nsent a letter to the President saying: We have to allow for innovation. \nWe have to allow for competition. Agreed. We say: Fine, private groups \nand insurance companies can offer the prescription drug benefit as an \noption, seniors get to choose. But they always have a Medicare fallback \nthey can choose.\n  Some say: We don't want this Government agency running this. Why do \nwe want a Government agency in charge of it? Well, because Medicare has \nno profit motive. Medicare has a low administrative cost. If the VA \nruns the program for veterans and we don't consider that socialism, \nwhat is wrong with the idea of having Medicare in here competing with \nthese private insurance companies. Eighty-nine percent of seniors today \nstick with Medicare rather than going to some HMO choice plan and/or \nprivate plan under Medicare. That tells you they like Medicare better. \nWhy should we deny them this chance under prescription drugs.\n  MediSAVE creates a reliable fallback that is Medicare, and I think \nthat is good for seniors. And MediSAVE will incentivize employers to \nmaintain benefits. This is a fear we have. We don't want to do anything \nthat will hurt the employers currently helping retired seniors, and we \nwant to make certain we encourage their continued participation.\n  Under S. 1, funds employers put toward retiree costs don't count \ntoward the retiree's Medicare out-of-pocket cost. Under MediSAVE, they \nwould count.\n  Mr. President, I know it is late. I know a number of amendments have \nbeen offered. But at this point I would like to send my amendment to \nthe desk and ask that it be read and then held at the desk.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I assume \nhe asked unanimous consent to set the amendments aside.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Which I will do. I will send the amendment to the desk. I \ndon't know if it should be reported at this moment, but I ask it be set \naside.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Could I say this: If you would allow me, rather than \nreserving the right to object, when he asks unanimous consent to set \naside an amendment to offer his amendment, I am not going to object to \nthat. But the leader has asked we have no more amendments tonight. So I \nwould then be forced to object to any other amendments from either side \nthat would come up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator from Iowa and my colleagues.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator yields the floor, would the Senator \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. This is a little off point, but we are talking about jobs. \nIs the Senator from Illinois aware that the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nissued its latest unemployment figures today?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I did not see those.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator be surprised that under this \nadministration, which is always talking about what a great job they are \ndoing with the economy, we now have the highest unemployment rate in \n106 months; it has jumped up now to over 6 percent? Is the Senator \nsurprised at that number?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish I was, but we have lost 2 million jobs under this \nadministration already. So it is no surprise we continue to lose jobs \nin America. I am sure it is tough in Nevada. It is tough in Illinois. \nWe have lost good paying jobs. I run into a lot of people who, frankly, \nhave no place to turn in this economy.\n  Mr. REID. Highest unemployment in 106 months.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would just suggest to the Senator from Nevada, it is \ncurious to me that the President, with his tax cut program for \nstimulating the economy, had his first chance at it. The Senator can \nrefresh my memory. Two years ago didn't we cut taxes, as the President \nsuggested, primarily for the higher income individuals?\n  Mr. REID. For job creation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Wasn't that about $1 trillion or more in tax cuts we were \nproposing for job creation?\n  Mr. REID. I would respond to my friend, if the last tax cut we had \ncreates as many jobs as the first tax cut, we are in big trouble.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say there is that old adage that once you are in \na hole, the first thing you do is stop digging. If I am not mistaken, \ndidn't this administration come back and want to dig that tax cut hole \ndeeper within the last few months, and still we see these job \nstatistics telling us this is a failed economic policy?\n  Mr. REID. My friend is right. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found \nthat national unemployment had increased in April to more than 6 \npercent, highest unemployment in 106 months.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada, was he aware \nof the fact we are now proposing the creation of jobs in Iraq, and some \npeople have said we are going to create jobs where frankly we will give \nmoney to the people of Iraq, but they don't to have show up for work \nfor a while? That might go over pretty well in my State if we would \nlike to create a program like that. But I would like to ask\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\nthe Senator, we are talking about the fact that this President took \nover after the economy had grown at a record pace for 7 or 8 years \nunder first his father and then under President Clinton.\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend there is some dispute as to what the \n10-year surplus was when he took office. Some say $7.1 trillion. Some \nsay 6.2. But trillions of dollars over 10 years. And in fact, the last \n3 years of the Clinton administration we had been spending less money \nthan we were taking in. We were retiring the debt. But we are not \nworried about that anymore. We will have this year, some say, a debt as \nmuch as $600 billion, of course, not counting the Social Security \nsurpluses which are used to disguise this. So I don't know where all \nthis great economy is. It is not in Nevada.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, would that $600 billion debt, if that \nis what we end up with, would that break the record under the Reagan \nadministration which I believe was in the hundred billion dollar range?\n  Mr. REID. The debt this year will be the largest in the history of \nthe world, not only the United States.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada, a lot of the \nfiscal conservative Republicans used to say you had to have fiscal \ndiscipline, get your house in order. Is he hearing the same thing I am \nhearing from those same fiscal conservative Republicans now, that \ndeficits don't count, debt doesn't count?\n  Mr. REID. We not only have statements that would fill volumes about \nhow bad the deficit was. And, in fact, I can remember Alan Greenspan \ntelling us the most important thing we could do--he appeared before the \nAppropriations Committee--was get rid of the annual deficits. We \nfollowed his advice and did that. He is still chairman of the Federal \nReserve. I wonder why he is not talking now along those same lines.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is a curious thing. I recall when President Clinton \nwas preparing to take office, that same Chairman Greenspan came to \nLittle Rock in the transition and said: The most important thing you \ncan do for the long-term economy is to reduce the long-term interest \nrates which means get serious about the deficit. President Clinton took \nthat to heart. I think the Senator, was in the Senate, and I was in the \nHouse when President Clinton came in with his budget, which didn't get \na single Republican vote in the House or the Senate. It passed in the \nSenate with the tie-breaking vote by Vice President Gore and then, \nbecause the Democrats stood up and did what was right for the economy, \nwe saw this dramatic period of economic growth where people's savings \nwere growing, retirement plans were growing, where we created some 22 \nmillion new jobs, inflation was under control, new housing starts, new \nbusinesses. And we are not talking about the deep dark recesses of \nAmerican history. This was just a few years ago.\n  Now in 2\\1/2\\ years, it is amazing what this President has achieved. \nHe has managed to lose jobs at a faster pace than any President in \nhistory and create the largest deficit in the history of the United \nStates, all in the name of fiscal conservatism. It is really hard to \nimagine anyone can say with a straight face that is a conservative, \ndisciplined approach to dealing with the budget.\n  I am sure in Nevada and Illinois the people don't like this economic \npolicy and what it has meant.\n  Mr. REID. This is something I can't understand, why there is so much \nsilence on the other side of the aisle about these huge annual deficits \nhe has created, especially since when he took office we were spending \nless money than we were taking in. To think that the country is in such \ndeep trouble. Does the Senator realize parts of our national parks are \nactually closing because of a state of disrepair, our great national \nparks? We have money in our highway trust fund that people pay when \nthey go to the gas pump, but this money is not being used for highways. \nWe are trying to come up with a highway bill, but the President is not \nallowing us to spend the money on highways. He wants to spend it on \njobs in Iraq. I don't know what he wants to spend it on.\n  I didn't answer the one question the Senator asked about Iraq. Not \nonly are they trying to create jobs in Iraq, they are now talking about \npaying Saddam Hussein's army for back pay while they were fighting \nAmericans. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was not aware of that. I certainly want to see \nstability in Iraq. We all do, because otherwise it could disintegrate \ninto another vacuum, a terrorist training ground. We don't want that to \nhappen.\n  But it is curious to me, when it comes to the military cost of that \nwar and the cost of reconstruction, there is no end in sight. It \ndoesn't seem to bother people from the administration to continue to \ncall for billions of dollars for this purpose.\n  But I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada this. He was serving \nhere, as I was, when this President came in with something called No \nChild Left Behind, where we were going to send money to the schools \nacross America for accountability and testing and upgrading of teacher \nskills. If I am not mistaken, this President had a White House bill \nsigning ceremony, with Democrats and Republicans all applauding his No \nChild Left Behind. Yet when we look at the budget that was sent to us \nby this President, he is not providing the resources that we know will \nbe needed for these schools. The Senator's State, I think, may be \nleading the Nation in the growth of school enrollment. In my State, we \nare struggling with our own deficit and cutbacks of State assistance to \nschool districts.\n  So here we have President Bush's new mandates in No Child Left \nBehind, with no money to pay for them, while the local sources of \nrevenue, from State sources and local property taxes, cannot keep up \nwith demand. So what the President has done by saying we are going to \nfocus this money on other things and tax cuts is shortchange education.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I spoke to our State legislature and I said \nthe President's No Child Left Behind Act is leaving lots of children \nbehind. There was a little criticism for my having said that. But I was \nright.\n  In the State of Nevada, as we speak, the Clark County School \nDistrict, which is the fifth largest school district in America, is \ntalking about cutting back the school week to 4 days. Some of the good \nprograms, such as the athletic programs, which I believe in, and \nprograms dealing with the band and drama they are talking about \neliminating, and they are talking about doing away with the programs \nfor the academically talented. In fact, unless the legislature can get \nsome resources from the State of Nevada--they don't expect anything \nfrom the Federal Government--the Clark County School District is \ntalking about stopping all-year-around school. We have a year-round \nschool district. They have been talking about closing schools. Well, \ntalk about leaving some kids behind; that is it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't think many Americans would argue that our \nchildren are overeducated. I know the State of Oregon closed their \nschools earlier this year, and the idea that we would eliminate part of \nthe school year, afterschool programs, and summer school programs, to \nme, means these young people are not going to be given the chance they \nneed to improve themselves.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada, probably more than anybody in this \nChamber, has focused on the dropout issue. If we don't really have a \nsensitivity to the number of kids dropping out, we should not be \nsurprised at what is happening to them. They end up with lives that are \nnot as productive as they could be, and sometimes they end up in \ntragedy. If you are going to cut back on the school year, a child who \nreally needs a helping hand to be a good student is more likely to be \ndiscouraged and less likely to be educated. How can that be good for \nour Nation? I know the Senator has focused on the dropout rate in the \npast.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Bingaman and I worked for a number of years to try \nto create within the Department of Education an education czar because \nchildren who drop out of school are never what they could be. We have \nso many students dropping out of school, and it is a shame. Those \nchildren who drop out of school will be relegated to menial work for \nthe rest of their lives--if they are fortunate to be able to have any \nkind of work.\n\n  So the afterschool programs, which the Senator from Illinois and \nSenator\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nBoxer have worked on for years, are programs that, in most States, they \nare not even considering anymore.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it unfair, then, to bring this together and say if we \nare going to see this President continue to put unfunded mandates on \nschools and not put the Federal dollars into education, and we are \ngoing to see education cut back at the State and local level, that is \ngoing to lessen the opportunity for children to pick up the skills and \neducation they want? This is no way to deal with an unemployment \nproblem. Frankly, it is a way to guarantee that that problem is going \nto become chronic and long term because we are not investing in making \nyoung people productive and educated.\n  So the No Child Left Behind program and the unfunded mandate by the \nBush White House really was lost to this whole argument about tax cuts. \nThe President says we need tax cuts for jobs and growth. It just hasn't \nworked. As the Senator from Nevada reported today--I forget the \nnumber--it has been over 100 months since we have had such high \nunemployment.\n  Mr. REID. It has been 106 months.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So that is somewhere a little less than 9 years to go \nback to a period of time with the unemployment that high.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMrs. Beverly Richardson of Hancock County, KY, for her legacy of \nservice to others. Her contributions to our Commonwealth as director of \nthe Hancock County Career Center have made all the difference in the \nlives of countless Kentuckians.\n  In 1997, when the Hancock County Career Center was initially \nestablished, Beverly Richardson, who is a proud Western Kentucky \nUniversity graduate, took on the role as director, enabling her the \nopportunity to shape the lives of many unemployed individuals who are \nnow working. Throughout her tenure as director, she has improved the \nlives of a variety of people from high school dropouts seeking to earn \na general education degree, to unemployed workers in need of greater \njob skills to increase their competitiveness in the job market. The \nvalues and beliefs Beverly brought to the Hancock County Career Center \naided her in facing the challenges she met and the opportunities each \nday brought as a coordinator of the center's activities.\n  While assisting Kentucky residents in gaining more job skills and \ngreater confidence was a wonderful accomplishment in her life, no \nachievement was more notable than that of raising her four children \nwith her husband Wendell. Together, they raised four college graduates \nwho have paved career paths of their own and given her and Wendell many \ngrandchildren.\n  Beverly Richardson's devotion to education and job training has \nimproved the vitality of Kentucky's economy, enhanced the capabilities \nof so many workers, and strengthened the character of individuals and \nfamilies. Employers and employees alike throughout Kentucky owe her a \ndebt of gratitude. Her example should be emulated across America. I \nthank the Senate for allowing me to recognize Ruth and voice her \npraises. She is Kentucky at its finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/23/senate-section/article/S8356-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred at Fort \nCampbell, KY. A little after 3 in the morning on July 5, 1999, PFC \nBarry L. Winchell was forced outside his barracks where he was \nstationed and brutally beaten with a baseball bat by another Army \nprivate. Winchell died of his injuries the following day. Army \nofficials and sources close to Winchell believe that his death was \nmotivated by antigay bias.\n  I believe Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/23/senate-section/article/S8356-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8356-S8357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING FRANK A DuBOIS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise before you today to pay \nrespect and to commend the accomplishments of a great New Mexican.\n  Frank A. DuBois has given the past 30 years of his life serving the \nagricultural producers and citizens of New Mexico. His vision and \nphilanthropic attitude is clear when looking back to the deeds \naccomplished by this great man.\n  On June 1st, Mr. DuBois retired from his position as director of the \nNew Mexico Department of Agriculture after 15 years. During this time, \nMr. DuBois also served as cabinet secretary for four Governors. \nThroughout his tenure with the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, \nFrank worked as a field inspector, agricultural policy specialist, \nassistant director and, finally, director.\n  In addition to these great accomplishments, Frank also worked as my \nlegislative assistant and then went on to serve as the Deputy Secretary \nfor Land and Water Resources with the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n  Frank has also dedicated a large part of his life to the rodeo. In \nfall 2000, Frank set up the Dubois Rodeo Scholarship to help aspiring \nrodeo athletes at New Mexico State University. To date, 18 students \nfrom NMSU have received financial aid to help them focus more on school \nand their rodeo activities, rather than having to worry about meeting \nthe financial burdens of college life.\n  The most amazing aspect of Frank DuBois is that for the past 13 \nyears, he has been living with multiple sclerosis. And yet this \ndebilitating disease has not stopped Frank from accomplishing so much. \nIn December 2000, Frank received the DreamMaker Award from the Going \nthe Distance for MS Research Foundation. He was diagnosed with MS in \n1990 but has not wavered in his dedication to the people he serves.\n  Frank's life should be an inspiration to us all. Even living with MS, \nFrank refuses to give in. He has received six prestigious awards for \nhis unwavering dedication to New Mexico since 1995.\n  I could not stand here and talk about Frank without also honoring his \nloving wife Sharon, who has been on my staff for many years in my Las \nCruces office. Sharon has stood beside her husband through the toughest \nof times. She has devoted her love and time to help Frank realize his \ndreams and\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\nthose who know her personally are greatly appreciative.\n  Frank's retirement from public service will most definitely be felt \nby New Mexico, and he will be greatly missed. He has dedicated a great \nportion of his life to the advancement of the heritage of New Mexico, \nand even in his retirement, Frank has committed to help develop his \nRodeo Scholarship and to focus on his own personal health.\n  Frank, although your retirement will be felt by many, I thank you for \nyour past dedication and your promise for a continued commitment to the \nyouth of NMSU.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/23/senate-section/article/S8357-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2818.

This provision would treat our State's Native Hawaiians \ncomparably with Alaskan Natives and American Indians under the current \nMedicaid law.

A bill to establish the Congaree Swamp National Park in the \nState of South Carolina, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nis particularly important to me, in that it culminates nearly 30 years \nof efforts to preserve the wilderness of South Carolina for future \ngenerations of Americans. This legislation proposes to raise the \ndesignation of the Congaree Swamp National Monument to the Congaree \nNational Park, and to increase its size by 20 percent.\n  I still remember when my friend, Harry Hampton, enlisted my help to \nprotect the big trees that were being destroyed 500 acres a year in the \ncentral part of my State. In 1976, Congress set aside 15,000 acres to \nestablish the Congaree Swamp National Monument. In the late 1980s, we \nexpanded it by another 7,000 acres. More recently, we've invested in a \nvisitor center and this investment has far exceeded this Senator's \nexpectations.\n  The attendance has ballooned to 120,000 visitors every year, \nincluding some 12,000 students, who use the forest as their classroom \nto nature. It has awakened an interest in the environment for these \nchildren. They cruise the Congaree, learning how to identify trees, \nbirds, animals, and everything like that. All kinds of groups take \nhikes, nature walks and canoe trips to see the almost 1,000 different \ntypes of trees, plants, animals, and birds in the forest.\n  This is home to some of the tallest and rarest trees in the Eastern \nUnited States--some are 400 years old. It is home to the largest \nexample of old growth southern hardwood forest in North America. All \neight species of woodpeckers can be found here, including the \nendangered red-cockaded variety.\n  Yet had Congress not acted back in 1976, none of this may be around \ntoday. We were able to save at least a few thousand acres of what once \ncovered vast portions of the east coast, so future generations of \nAmericans can enjoy it. There is a lesson here. The Government can do \ngood for the environment. It is in the interest of our nation to \nprotect our nation's treasures.\n  My legislation, the Congaree National Park Act of 2003 continues the \nprogress we have seen the last 25 years. It would add another 4,576 \nacres of ecologically rich land; and it would redesignate the Monument \ninto a fullfledged National Park, which would be the first in South \nCarolina. The Congaree Swamp is widely recognized as one of the most \nunique and rare ecological habitats in the country. This designation \nnot only recognizes the significance of this area but the wonderful job \nthe National Park Service is doing to make this a growing attraction \nfor local, State, national, and international visitors.\n  The project has received support from a number of organizations, and \nI ask unanimous consent that these letters of endorsement be printed in \nthe Record. I hope to work on a bipartisan basis with my colleagues to \npass the legislation this session.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      South Carolina Department of\n\n\n                                            Natural Resources,\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, June 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I want to take this opportunity to \n     endorse the proposed legislation to establish the Congaree \n     Swamp National Park in the State of South Carolina (Congaree \n     National Park Act of 2003). We are delighted to see your \n     continued commitment to the protection of important \n     environmental properties in our State. The expansion of the \n     Congaree National Monument to a ``National Park'' certainly \n     continues the habitat protection vision that is embraced by \n     the Board of the South Carolina Department of Natural \n     Resources.\n       I have been in routine contact with your staff and many of \n     our natural resource conservation partners as this important \n     legislation was developed by your staff. We appreciate your \n     staff's professional courtesy to us in seeking our agency's \n     input. The expansion of this significant natural resource \n     area certainly parallels the stated mission of our agency in \n     proactively protecting the State's natural resources for the \n     use and enjoyment by future generations of South Carolians.\n       Again, thank you for your commitment to our natural \n     resources and to improving the quality of life of our \n     citizens. You have been a strong supporter of our \n     conservation initiatives and our citizens are certainly \n     indebted to you for your leadership and vision.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John E.

Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I am writing today on behalf of The \n     Trust for Public Land in support of legislation to expand the \n     boundaries of the Congaree Swamp National Monument and \n     designate it as a National Park in the State of South \n     Carolina.\n       As you know, the Congaree Swamp National Monument was \n     authorized as a unit of the National Park Service in 1976. \n     The park rests on a floodplain of the Congaree River and is \n     recognized as an International Biosphere Reserve, National \n     Natural Landmark, Wilderness Area, and ``Globally Important \n     Bird Area,'' with over 90 tree species including old growth \n     loblolly pines and bald cypress. The Congaree hosts the \n     nation's largest tract of old-growth bottomland hardwood \n     forest, and contains some of the tallest trees in the eastern \n     U.S., with some pines reaching over 160 feet. The Congaree's \n     outstanding natural resources are frequented by outdoor \n     enthusiasts who enjoy canoeing, kayaking, picnicking, \n     camping, and fishing.\n       In 1994, the expansion area was the subject of a biological \n     and hydrological evaluation to determine its resource value \n     for protection and addition to the Congaree Swamp National \n     Monument. The report concluded that expanding the National \n     Monument to include this area would conserve a unique \n     hydrological system integrally connected to the hydrology of \n     the Congaree River and that of lands currently within the \n     Congaree Swamp National Monument. Once protected, these lands \n     would from a conservation corridor connecting the Congaree \n     with other protected state and Federal lands further \n     downstream.\n       Additional protection of the Congaree Swamp National \n     Monument would not only play a critical role in enhancing \n     South Carolina's recreation needs, it would further enrich \n     South Carolina's impressive historic and cultural resources \n     as well as its significant wildlife and ecological resources.\n       The Trust for Public Land commends your leadership on this \n     matter and looks forward to working with you on enacting such \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Alan Front,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Columbia Audubon Society,\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, June 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings; I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     700+ members of Columbia Audubon Society. We want to express \n     our full support for your legislation to change the Congaree \n     Swamp National Monument to National Park and to expand the \n     boundary.\n       No other area in the Southeast is of comparable geological \n     and biological significance. The park has been recognized as \n     a National Natural Landmark, an International Biosphere, \n     Globally Important Bird Area, and a Wetlands of International \n     Importance. Anything that can be done to raise awareness of \n     this important resource and to protect it by boundary \n     expansion is a positive step that we support.\n       Thank you once again for your efforts on behalf of our \n     natural and national heritage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Daniel L. Tufford,\n     President and Conservation Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Sierra Club,\n\n\n                                       South Carolina Chapter,\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, June 22, 2003.\n     Re Congaree Swamp National Monument.\n\n     Senator Ernest Hollings,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: The South Carolina Chapter of the \n     Sierra Club supports your legislation to expand and \n     reclassify the Congaree Swamp National Monument. We thank you \n     for your preservation efforts regarding the Congaree Swamp \n     and for your support of the environment generally.\n       The Congaree Swamp National Monument on the meandering \n     Congaree River is a tranquil setting of world champion trees, \n     primeval forest landscapes, and diverse plant and animal \n     life. This 21,479-acre intact old-growth bottomland hardwood \n     forest is a remnant of what much of the Southeast looked like \n     200-plus years ago. The opportunity to add 4,526-acres to \n     this living ecological museum cannot be ignored.\n       We also believe that Congaree Swamp is more appropriately \n     identified as a national ``park.'' This designation, within \n     the Park Service, will accord the ``swamp'' its appropriate \n     status and possible funding within the Department of \n     Interior.\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\n       The South Carolina Chapter of the Sierra Club was formed 25 \n     years ago as a result of citizen involvement to form the \n     Congaree Swamp National Monument in 1976. Our Sierra Club \n     chapter could receive no better gift on our 25th birthday \n     than the expansion and redesignation of this sanctuary for \n     plants, animals, researchers, and hikers.\n       On behalf of the 5,200 Sierra Club members in South \n     Carolina, again, we thank you and support your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dell Isham,\n     SC Chapter Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    South Carolina\n\n\n                                          Wildlife Federation,\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, June 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: The South Carolina Wildlife \n     Federation (SCWF) applauds you for your continued commitment \n     to the environment and to the rare and precious habitats \n     found both nationwide and in South Carolina. It is your \n     continued dedication to these valuable habitats and our \n     mission to support conservation efforts that prompts us to \n     write to you. The purpose of this letter is to express our \n     position on your ``Congaree National Park Act of 2003.''\n       The SCWF considers this bill, to change the designation of \n     the Congaree National Monument to the Congaree National Park \n     and to expand the park to include the 4,576 acres, a \n     profitable proposal. As is evidenced in the text of the bill, \n     there are numerous reasons to protect, preserve and expand \n     this area. The rarity of this wilderness area boasts the last \n     and largest example of virgin, old-growth southern hardwood \n     forest in North America. The Congaree National Monument and \n     adjacent private land provide valuable opportunities to \n     experience and learn about our natural, biological, \n     geological, and cultural history. This wilderness is home to \n     over 900 species of plants and animals, including rare, \n     threatened and endangered species. Since habitat size plays \n     such an important role in maintaining healthy communities and \n     diverse gene pools of plant and animal species, this \n     expansion and designation as a National Park are wonderful \n     ways to preserve such an ecologically rich area.\n       In addition, Mr. Harry Hampton, the founder of this \n     Federation, was also responsible for the recognition of the \n     Congaree Swamp as a National Monument. In keeping with the \n     vision of our founder it is with great eagerness that we \n     support your efforts to have this bill enacted. The South \n     Carolina Wildlife Federation commends you for introducing the \n     ``Congaree National Park Act of 2003.'' Please use this \n     letter freely in the public record.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Angela Viney\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            South Carolina Coastal\n\n\n                                          Conservation League,\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, June 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I am writing to give the Coastal \n     Conservation League's full support for the Congaree National \n     Park Act of 2003. The Congaree Swamp National Monument is a \n     tremendous asset for South Carolina and the nation, and has \n     enjoyed ever-increasing numbers of supporters and visitors. \n     It is definitely worthy of the level of protection that a \n     National Park designation would provide.\n       This area has regional, national, and international \n     significance. Regionally it stores waters that reduce \n     downstream flooding, and improves water quality in the \n     Congaree and Santee rivers. It is important on a national \n     scale because it includes the largest intact tract of old \n     growth area of virgin floodplain forest in the United States. \n     And 20 years ago it earned global recognition as an \n     International Biosphere Reserve. Because of its significance \n     it has attracted visitors ranging from Richland County to \n     around the world.\n       The expansion of the National Monument area by over 4,000 \n     acres will greatly advance state conservation goals, as it \n     will link two core areas identified by the South Carolina \n     Landscape Mapping Project's Ecological Vision, namely the \n     Congaree Swamp National Monument and the Upper Santee Swamp. \n     In addition, the proposed expansion to include Fork Swamp \n     within the proposed National Park boundaries accomplishes the \n     objective of the Heritage Trust Board of the Department of \n     Natural Resources. This body has recommended protection for \n     Fork Swamp, where the Wateree and Congaree rivers from the \n     headwaters of the Santee River.\n       The Congaree Swamp is indeed a national treasure that will \n     be enjoyed by visitors from around the country for years to \n     come. The Congaree National Park Act of 2003 is a fitting \n     tribute to its importance. Thank you for all you continue to \n     do to preserve South Carolina's unique natural treasures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dana Beach,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           The River Alliance,\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, June 16, 2003.\n     Senator Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Russell Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: Your guiding hand led the effort to \n     protect the unique national treasure of the Congaree Swamp \n     National Monument. We believe the addition of an additional \n     4,500 area and its redesignation as a National Park is a \n     continuation of this stewardship. The River Alliance strongly \n     supports the expansion of the Congaree Swamps' boundaries and \n     its designation as the Congaree Swamp National Park.\n       As you may recall, the River Alliance is a public benefit \n     organization tasked with connecting citizens to the region's \n     rivers. The Congaree Swamp is the crown jewel of our region's \n     90 miles of river system. The Alliance sees this physical \n     expansion as a high value environmental and recreational \n     addition. It allows protection of the Running Lake Creek, \n     Bates Old River and Fort Swamp areas. The Wateree River is \n     the logical southern boundary for the expansion. It also \n     allows inclusion of the Congaree's River's edge between the \n     existing federal boundary and the confluence with the \n     Wateree. This brings the primary river access at South \n     Carolina Highway 601 inside the park boundary. The expansion \n     allows protection of additional cultural and environmental \n     resources. It also provides a solid boundary for park \n     management.\n       In 1997, the River Alliance initiated a major program to \n     assist the Congaree Swamp in reaching its potential for \n     visitation. With your help, physical outcomes were an \n     improved access road, parking, and the Harry Hampton Visitors \n     Center. Visitation has increased dramatically, but our \n     analysis revealed an issue with its current designation as a \n     ``Monument.'' An inaccurate, but very real, public perception \n     is ``A Monument is less worthy of visitation than a National \n     Park.'' The Congaree Swamp deserves the ``National Park'' \n     designation, not only for its inherent national and \n     intentional value, but to fully reach its potential to \n     attract visitors. Congaree Swamp visitors leave with an \n     embedded imprint of natural beauty. We wish that every \n     citizen can have this experience. Visitors become advocates \n     for the Swamp and for the National Park Service.\n       From the Alliance perspective, public ownership of the \n     river's edge of the Congaree Swamp is a valuable commodity, \n     the more the better. It allows public access by boat, canoe \n     or kayak to the Swamp's bluffs, banks and creeks from the \n     waters of the Congaree River. This offers visitors an \n     unparalleled view of the ecosystem and access to the true \n     wilderness. The record trees accessible from the water, are \n     an awesome demonstration of the value of federal park \n     protection. The expansion will extend the edge to the Wateree \n     River. It will also allow the current Highway 601 access to \n     become a true entry point to the Swamp with an opportunity \n     for river-focused education and interpretation. As with the \n     Harry Hampton Visitors Center project, the River Alliance is \n     committed to assist in the creation of a visitor experience \n     worthy of the environmental resource. The increased Congaree \n     frontage sets the stage.\n       We know your action is forthcoming and we strongly support \n     the expansion and redesignation. We will be happy to answer \n     any questions, provide additional information, or testify to \n     Congress as you desire. If you have any questions, feel free \n     to contact me at (803) 765-2200.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T. Dawson,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Friends of Congaree Swamp,\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, June 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Ernest Hollings,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Congaree Swamp--Boundary Expansion and National Park \n         Designation\n       Dear Senator Hollings: For more than 25 years, you have \n     provided outstanding leadership for Congaree Swamp National \n     Monument. You were instrumental in establishing the monument \n     in 1976 and expanding the monument in 1988. You have obtained \n     funding for Congaree land acquisition, the entrance road, the \n     Harry Hampton Visitor Center, and, recently, the maintenance \n     facility.\n       Congaree Swamp's significance is affirmed by many studies \n     and by its designations as a National Natural Landmark, a \n     National Monument, and an International Biosphere Reserve. A \n     nomination is prepared to recognize Congaree Swamp as \n     Wetlands of International Importance.\n       The Friends of Congaree Swamp are delighted by your \n     introduction of legislation to expand Congaree Swamp National \n     Monument and to change its designation from National Monument \n     to National Park.\n       Congaree boundary expansion is a significant step toward \n     implementing several visions:\n       It implements part of the South Carolina Conservation \n     Vision Map by linking two major core areas: Congaree Swamp \n     National Monument and the Upper Santee Swamp Natural Area;\n       It implements part of the Fork Swamp Large Area Project, a \n     landscape-scale conservation project approved more than two \n     years ago by the SC Heritage Trust Advisory Board of the SC \n     Dept. of Natural Resources; and\n       It supports legislation you introduced in 2002, and again \n     in 2003, regarding a Southern Campaign of the Revolution \n     Heritage Area in South Carolina.\n       ``Timing is everything.'' This boundary expansion was \n     proposed and studied extensively in 1994, but one of the two \n     key landowners was hesitant at that time to include the tract \n     in legislation. Now, in 2003, both key landowners (Riverstone \n     Properties and the Beidler family) are willing to sell their \n     tracts for addition to Congaree Swamp National Monument.\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\n       However, both key landowners will sell these tracts to \n     other buyers if the Congaree expansion languishes. Both key \n     landowners recognize the potential to subdivide and sell \n     their tracts as smaller parcels. On such parcel has \n     already been sold. This situation underscores the urgency \n     to authorize Congaree's expanded boundary and appropriate \n     funding to purchase both key tracts before they are \n     subdivided and sold as multiple parcels, especially if the \n     new owners of the multiple parcels are unwilling to \n     include their land in the Congaree boundary.\n       We support Congaree's designation as a National Park. \n     Congaree Swamp National Monument has received visitors from \n     more than 90 countries. Visitation--from throughout the \n     United States as well as internationally--will surely \n     increase if Congaree's significance is further recognized by \n     National Park status.\n       Currently, Congaree's old-growth forest is the principal \n     theme interpreted by the National Park Service. We understand \n     Congaree's cultural/historical resources would be interpreted \n     as the second theme if Congaree becomes a National Park. \n     Friends of Congaree Swamp can provide historical information \n     for lands within this Congaree boundary expansion.\n       We recall your tremendous efforts in 1988, when you secured \n     FY 1989 funding for Congaree land acquisition while \n     simultaneously authorizing Congaree's 7,000-acre expansion. \n     How wonderful if your Congaree expansion/park legislation can \n     be authorized in 2003 and funding obtained promptly \n     thereafter to purchase these Congaree tracts!\n       On behalf of our members and our Board of Directors, we are \n     grateful for your continued leadership. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact us for additional information and \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                LaBruce Alexander,\n                             President, Friends of Congaree Swamp.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 1314. A bill to expedite procedures for hazardous fuels reduction \nactivities on National Forest System lands established from the public \ndomain and other public lands administered by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, to improve the health of National Forest System lands \nestablished from the public domain and other public lands administered \nby the Bureau of Land Management, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing comprehensive \nlegislation to expedite forest thinning and improve forest health on \nour national forests and public lands. I am pleased that Senator \nDaschle is a cosponsor of this bill.\n  Everyone in the Senate wants to do what we can to reduce the threat \nof catastrophic wildfire. We all agree on the need to accelerate fuels \nreduction activities because the risk of severe fire is so high. \nOngoing drought, past fire suppression policies, and overly-excessive \nharvesting of timber have all contributed to the problem. All of us \nalso agree that it is much better to devote limited resources to \nproactive efforts to reduce fire risk rather than paying to fight fires \nonce they occur.\n  I have tried for years to improve the Federal agencies' forest \nthinning program in a variety of ways. I am also a vocal proponent for \nspending Federal dollars conducting proactive forest restoration. \nAlthough some may contend that restoration costs too much money, over \nthe long-term, it is much less expensive than fighting fires.\n  Every year, the Forest Service borrows funds from other accounts to \npay for firefighting. It is clear that this practice substantially \ncontributes to project delays and cancellations. For example, in 2002 \nalone, the Forest Service states that:\n\n     some critical projects in New Mexico were postponed for up to \n     one year as a result of fire borrowing. These include \n     wildland-urban interface fuels projects on the Carson, Gila, \n     Lincoln, and Santa Fe National Forests. A contract for \n     construction of a fuelbreak around a community at risk on the \n     Cibola National Forest was postponed for six months.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today eliminates the current fire \nborrowing practice by authorizing the Forest Service, during years in \nwhich the agencies' firefighting costs exceed its budget, to borrow \nfunds directly from the Treasury. I urge my colleagues to reject any \nbill purporting to decrease on the ground delays if it does not address \nthis problem.\n  A 2002 report by the National Academy of Public Administration, and a \nletter to Congress from the Society of American Foresters dated \nNovember 2002, confirms that the main obstacle constraining us from \nincreasing our efforts to reduce fire risk is a lack of adequate \nfunding. Clearly, the Forest Service's fire borrowing practice \ncontributes to this lack of funding. Ever since Congress first funded \nthe National Fire Plan more than two years ago, I have continually \nemphasized the need to sustain a commitment to the FY 2001 funding \nlevels over a long enough period of time to make a difference--at least \n15 years.\n  Important programs that are part of the National Fire Plan, including \neconomic action programs, community and private land fire assistance, \nand burned area restoration and rehabilitation have been drastically \ncut--and some have been zeroed out--by the Administration over the last \nthree budget cycles. For some accounts included under the National Fire \nPlan, but not all, Congress has made up the difference. However, it \nwould certainly be much easier to fully fund the National Fire Plan \nwith the Administration's support.\n  Beyond funding constraints, some allege that administrative appeals \nand lawsuits limit our ability to reduce fire risk across the country. \nAs set forth in my legislation, I am willing to provide new legal \nauthorities and exemptions from administrative appeals to address this \nconcern.\n  Let me briefly describe the expedited procedures provisions of our \nbill. We propose to exempt from National Environmental Policy Act \nanalysis all forest thinning projects located near communities or in \nmunicipal watersheds that remove up to 250,000 board feet of timber or \none million board feet of salvage timber. We prohibit administrative \nappeals on these projects, thereby saving 135 days in the process. In \naddition, we eliminate judicial review granted under NEPA for thinning \nprojects within one-half mile of at risk communities or within certain \nmunicipal watersheds. The combination of these provisions would save \nbetween one and one-half to three and one-half years of process.\n  Targeting the expedited procedures to areas near communities and in \nmunicipal watersheds is consistent with a 2002 National Academy of \nPublic Administration report recommending that the Federal Government \nconduct fuels reduction treatments near communities and municipal \nwatersheds before treating more distant areas. We also require that \nseventy percent of forest thinning funds be spent within these critical \nareas.\n  We agree with, and included, some provisions similar to ones found in \nH.R. 1904. For example, our bill covers the same amount of Federal \nland, namely, up to 20 million acres. H.R. 1904 requires the \nSecretaries to select projects through a collaborative process and give \npriority to protecting communities and municipal watersheds. Moreover, \nH.R. 1904 requires that projects be consistent with applicable forest \nand resource management plans. I agree with all of these provisions.\n  Both bills establish systematic programs, in cooperation with \ncolleges and universities, to gather information on insect infestations \nthat can be applied to forest management treatments. However, our bill \nprovides actual funds, $25 million annually, to implement the program \nwhereas H.R. 1904 does not.\n  This bill differs from H.R. 1904 in some other important aspects. Our \nbill comprehensively addresses the issue of on the ground delay by \ndoing away with the Forest Service's fire borrowing practice and \nexempting the Forest Service from the Competitive Sourcing Initiative.\n  Our legislation provides $100 million annually to reduce fire risk \nand restore burned areas on non-Federal lands. Forest Service \nresearchers state that seventy-seven percent of all high risk areas are \non non-Federal lands. In addition, the National Academy of Public \nAdministration's 2002 report notes that forty-seven percent of acres \nburned each year are non-Federal lands and stated that decreasing fuels \non all owners' lands is needed to address the large scope of the fire \nhazard problem. Moreover, given that the Administration has zeroed out \nfunding for burned area restoration and rehabilitation, the secure \nfunding provided by our bill is desperately needed to protect \ncommunities from landslides and other adverse effects of catastrophic \nwildfire.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today recognizes the role that forest \ndependent\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\ncommunities play in restoring our lands by requiring that at least \nthirty percent of hazardous fuels reduction funds be spent on projects \nthat benefit small businesses that use hazardous fuels and are located \nin small, economically disadvantaged communities. In order to provide \nrobust monitoring of new authorities, we require that an independent \ncommission report to Congress on the results of the program and that \nthe agencies establish a multiparty monitoring program. H.R. 1904 does \nnot contain similar provisions.\n  Most fuel reduction projects will take several years to implement. It \nis critical that the agencies have reliable funding to complete the \nprojects they start. If funding is obtained to thin trees the first \nyear, but not to complete the slash disposal and reintroduce fire \nthrough prescribed burning the following years, short-term fire risk \nwill be increased. Moreover, slash that is left on the ground increases \nthe likelihood of beetle infestations. The bill I am introducing today \nensures that agencies address long-term fuels management whereas H.R. \n1904 does not contain any similar provision.\n  At this point in time, I do not believe we need to expedite judicial \nreview beyond what we offer in this bill. The judicial review \nlimitations in H.R. 1904 are excessive. In May 2003, GAO completed an \nanalysis of Forest Service decisions involving fuel reduction \nactivities. In the first two years of activity under the National Fire \nPlan, GAO found that only three percent of all of the decisions were \nlitigated covering 100,000 acres. Decisions affecting the remaining 4.6 \nmillion acres treated in those two years proceeded without any \nlitigation.\n  H.R. 1904 provides new legal authorities and judicial review \nlimitations without regard to many independent analyses that have \ndiscovered numerous flaws with the agencies' existing implementation of \nthe National Fire Plan. In November 2001, the Inspector General for the \nDepartment of Agriculture found that the Forest Service was \ninappropriately spending its burned area restoration funds to prepare \ncommercial timber sales. Similarly, it was recently discovered that the \nForest Service ``misplaced'' $215 million intended for wildland fire \nmanagement due to an accounting error.\n  Finally, another GAO report concluded that, because the Forest \nService relies on the timber program for funding many of its other \nactivities, including reducing fuels, it has often used the timber \nprogram to address the wildfire problem. GAO states, ``The difficulty \nwith such an approach, however, is that the lands with commercially \nvaluable timber are often not those with the greatest wildfire hazards. \nAdditionally, there are problems with the incentives in the fuel \nreduction program. Currently, managers are rewarded for the number of \nacres on which they reduce fuels, not for reducing fuels on the lands \nwith the highest fire hazards. Because reducing fuels in areas with \ngreater hazards is often more expensive--meaning that fewer acres can \nbe completed with the same funding level--managers have an incentive \nnot to undertake efforts on such lands.'' GAO/RCED-99-65.\n  The parameters set forth in our bill will ensure that the agencies \nconduct forest thinning in a way that truly reduces the threat of fire \nand improves forest health. For example, we require the agencies to \nfocus on thinning projects that remove small diameter trees. Too often, \nthe Forest Service has cut large trees because of their commercial \nvalue instead of removing small-diameter trees that tend to spread \nfire. A group of respected forest fire scientists recently wrote \nPresident Bush a letter stating that, ``thinning of overstory trees, \nlike building new roads, can often exacerbate the situation and damage \nforest health.''\n  Our bill prohibits new road construction in roadless areas whereas \nH.R. 1904 contains no similar provision. The National Forests already \ncontain 380,000 miles of road, as a comparison, the National Highway \nSystem contains 160,000 miles of roads, and the deferred maintenance \nneeds on these existing roads totals more than $1 billion. Forest \nService analysis reveals that roads increase the probability of \naccidental and intentional human-caused ignitions.\n  Returning receipts to the Treasury is consistent with a provision in \nSenator Wyden and Senator Craig's county payments legislation enacted \ntwo years ago and avoids existing perverse incentives. Numerous GAO \nreports reveal that existing agency trust funds provide incentives for \nthe agency to cut large trees because it gets to keep the revenue. \nCutting large trees will not reduce fire risk, therefore, we should \ndirect receipts back to the Treasury. Jeremy Fried, a Forest Service \nResearch specialist at the Pacific Northwest Research Station, states, \n``If you take just big trees, you don't reduce fire danger.''\n  The provision in our bill stating that seventy percent of hazardous \nfuels reduction funds be spent within one-half mile of at risk \ncommunities or within municipal watersheds is necessary because GAO \nrecently found that more than two-thirds of the Forest Service's \ndecisions involving fuels reduction activities were targeted \nexclusively at lands outside of the wildland/urban interface. H.R. 1904 \ncontains no similar provision.\n  In conclusion, our bill represents a comprehensive and balanced \napproach to expedite forest thinning and improve forest health. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Collaborative Forest Health \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, today I join Senators Bingaman, Murray, \nCantwell and others to introduce the Collaborative Forest Health Act to \nexpedite forest thinning and improve forest health on our national \nforests and public lands. I thank Senator Bingaman for his leadership \non this important issue.\n  Everyone in the Senate wants to do what we can to reduce the threat \nof catastrophic wildfire. There is agreement on the need to accelerate \nfuel reduction activities because of the risk of severe fire is so \nhigh. Ongoing drought, past fire suppression policies, and past \nforestry practices have all contributed to the problem. These problems \nhave made fire management much more expensive for American taxpayers. \nIt is important to devote limited resources to proactive efforts to \nreduce fire risk rather than paying to fight fires once they occur.\n  The risk of damage to human life and property from severe wildfires \nhas increased in areas where rapidly expanding populations are \nintermingled with forested wildlands, and a primary purpose of the \nNational Fire Plan is to reduce the risks of such fires. Last week, \nGovernors Judy Martz of Montana, Bill Richardson of New Mexico, Janet \nNapolitano of Arizona, and Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho issued a letter to \nthe Agriculture Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee endorsing this approach stating that ``priority in project \nselection should be given to projects that reduce fire risk in \ncommunities at risk and the watersheds that supply them.''\n  This comprehensive legislation will assist communities from the \nthreat of wildfire by expediting fuel reduction in high risk areas and \ntarget resources near communities and municipal watersheds. We propose \nto exempt from environmental review and analysis all forest thinning \nprojects located within one-half mile of at risk communities or within \ncertain municipal watershed. While these targeted exemptions from \nenvironmental review are warranted, the Senate should proceed with \ncaution in considering any comprehensive changes to judicial review. On \nMay 14, 2003, the General Accounting Office, GAO, issued a report on \nthe Forest Service's fuel reduction activities. For fiscal year 2001 \nand fiscal year 2002, the GAO found that hazardous fuel reduction \nactivities were conducted on 4.7 million acres. Only 3 percent of all \nthe fuel reduction projects, covering only 100,000 acres, faced any \nlegal challenge during this period.\n  In 2002, the National Academy of Public Administration issued a \nreport recommending the Federal Government conduct fuels reduction \ntreatments near communities and municipal watersheds before treating \nmore distant areas. We also require that 70 percent of forest thinning \nfunds be spent within these critical areas. Our bill authorizes \nprojects on up to 20 million acres over 5 years.\n  The bill also recognizes the role that forest-dependent communities \nplay in restoring our lands by requiring that at least 30 percent of \nthe hazardous fuels reduction funds be spent on projects that benefit \nsmall businesses that use hazardous fuels and are located in small, \neconomically disadvantaged communities.\n  It is widely known that approximately 80 percent of the land \nsurrounding homes and communities is non-Federal land. Our legislation \nprovides $100 million annually to States, tribal and private lands to \nreduce wildfire risk and restore burned areas.\n  In addition, our bill establishes a $25 million research program, in \ncooperation with colleges and universities, to gather information on \ninsect infestations that can be applied to forest management \ntreatments.\n  Our bill promotes wildfire management activities that maintain the \nintegrity of our national forests and public lands. The bill requires \nprotection of old and large trees, prevents new road construction in \nroadless areas, and protects municipal watersheds.\n  In conclusion, our bill represents a comprehensive and balanced \napproach to expedite forest thinning and improve forest health. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1315. A bill to amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \nof 1976 to provide owners of non-Federal lands with a reliable method \nof receiving compensation for damages resulting from the spread of \nwildfire from nearby forested national Forest System lands or Bureau of \nLand Management lands, when those forested Federal lands are not \nmaintained in the forest health status known as condition class 1; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Enhanced \nSafety from Wildfire Act of 2003. I am joined by my colleagues Mr. \nCrapo and Mr. Smith.\n  This morning, I awoke to the news that the Aspen fire near Tucson, \nAZ, made a significant run yesterday and damaged or destroyed an \nestimated 200 structures. The report also said firefighters could do \nnothing to stop the wall of fire from ripping through the middle of \ntown. Sadly, this report is one of several such stories today and it is \nfar from being the last.\n  It is only the middle of June and already the wildfire season is in \nfull swing throughout the West. The loss of property as a result of \nwildfires on Federal land is unacceptable. I believe that our homes and \nthe safety of our communities should never be put in harms way because \nof the mismanagement of our Federal land.\n  In short, the legislation we are introducing would amend the Federal \nLand Policy and Management Act of 1976 to make it possible for non-\nFederal land owners to receive compensation for a loss of property as a \nresult of wildfire spreading from Federal land that has not been \nmanaged as Condition Class 1.\n  As we all know, in recent years, there has been a significant amount \nof injury and loss of property resulting from the spread of wildfire \nfrom Federal forested lands to non-Federal lands. Recent wildfires on \nFederal forested lands have shown that lands managed under approved \nforest health management practices are less susceptible to wildfire, or \nare subjected to less severe wildfire, than similarly forested lands \nthat are not actively managed.\n  There is a continuing and growing threat to the safety of \ncommunities, individuals, homes and other property, and timber on non-\nFederal lands that adjoin Federal forested lands because of the \nunnatural accumulation of forest fuels on these Federal lands and the \nlack of active Federal management of these lands.\n  The use of approved forest health management practices to create \nforest fire ``buffer zones'' between forested Federal lands and \nadjacent non-Federal lands would reduce the occurrence of wildfires on \nforested Federal lands or, at least, limit their spread to non-Federal \nlands and the severity of the resulting damage.\n  This legislation requires the agencies to manage a ``buffer zone'' on \nFederal land, greater than 6,400 acres, that is adjacent to non-Federal \nland. When forested Federal lands adjacent to non-Federal lands are not \nadequately managed with a ``buffer zone'' and wildfire occurs, the \nlegislation states the owners of the non-Federal lands are eligible for \ncompensation for damages resulting from the spread of wildfire to\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\ntheir lands. The legislation sets minimum criteria for non-Federal land \nto be eligible for compensation.\n  Our Federal land management agencies need to take responsibility for \nthe fatal impacts that occur on non-Federal land as a result of a lack \nof management on Federal land. As a society, we have come to expect \nthat our neighbors take responsibility for their actions and I feel the \nFederal land management agencies should not escape this responsibility \neither.\n  In the next few weeks, the weather will continue to heat up, the \ndrought ridden West will become drier, wildfire will continue to plague \nthroughout, and the number of reports regarding the loss of property \nwill continue to escalate. At the same time, the forest health debate \nwill also heat up as the Senate considers the President's Healthy \nForest Initiative.\n  I know this legislation may not be the answer to solving our Federal \nland management problems and I am willing to discuss other options, but \nI know that until we address the heart of this issue, homes, private \nland, and communities will continue to be at risk because of poor \nFederal land management. Being a good neighbor means being responsible \nfor your actions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act maybe cited as the ``Enhanced Safety from Wildfire \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. HARKIN proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1, to amend \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act to make improvements in the \nmedicare program, to provide prescription drug coverage under the \nmedicare program, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n     At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n               TITLE __--MEDICAID DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Money Follows the Person \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In his budget for fiscal year 2004, President George W. \n     Bush proposes a ``Money Follows the Person'' rebalancing \n     initiative under the medicaid program to help States \n     rebalance their long-term services support systems more \n     evenly between institutional and community-based services.\n       (2) The President, by proposing this initiative, and \n     Congress, recognize that States have not fully developed the \n     systems needed to create a more equitable balance between \n     institutional and community-based services spending under the \n     medicaid program.\n       (3) While a few States have been successful at achieving \n     this balance, nationally, approximately 70 percent of the \n     medicaid funding spent for long-term services is devoted to \n     nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the \n     mentally retarded. Only 30 percent of such funding is spent \n     for community-based services.\n       (4) As a result, there are often long waiting lists for \n     community-based services and supports.\n       (5) In the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, \n     Congress found that individuals with disabilities continue to \n     encounter various forms of discrimination, including \n     segregation, and that discrimination persists in such \n     critical areas as institutionalization.\n       (6) In 1999, the Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. LC (527 \n     U.S. 581 (1999)) that needless institutionalization is \n     discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990, noting that institutional placement of people who can \n     be served in the community ``perpetuates unwarranted \n     assumptions that persons so isolated are unworthy of \n     participating in community life.'' (Id. at 600). The Court \n     further found that ``confinement in an institution severely \n     diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, \n     including family relations, social contacts, work options, \n     economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural \n     enrichment.'' (Id. at 601).\n       (7) Additional resources would be helpful for assisting \n     States in rebalancing their long-term services support system \n     and complying with the Olmstead decision.\n\n     SEC. __03.

Reserving the right to object, a lot of progress has been \nmade on this Medicare bill in the past week. The two managers have done \nan excellent job of administering this piece of legislation. But the \nkey part of this whole procedure is going to be the next few days. I \nhope the two managers who get along so well understand the difficulty \non both sides. They are going to have to use maturity and skills and \nexperience in working us through these next few days. I hope everyone \nunderstands this legislation, even though we have had some speeches \ntalking about how good it is--since it is as good as everyone \ncontemplated it was, I hope that no one would try to make any drastic \nchanges to the underlying legislation. It would take away a lot of the \ngood work and good will that has been built up.\n  I know the senior Senator from Iowa and the senior Senator from \nMontana both understand that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for the benefit of the distinguished \nDemocratic whip, I just came from a meeting with Senator Baucus \ndiscussing some of the issues the Senator has suggested. When I am done \nhere serving as acting leader, I will return to that same meeting and \nwe will try to get some of these things worked out tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They suggested that the intelligence might have come \n     from an intercepted telephone conversation or an informant. \n     The attack took place Wednesday near the Syrian border in \n     western Iraq.\n       There was no evidence so far, the officials said, to \n     support the idea that Mr. Hussein or his sons might have been \n     killed in the raid, and some officials were doubtful that \n     they were. But they said intelligence teams, including DNA \n     experts, were at the site to review the wreckage and assess \n     the evidence.\n       Officials declined to say how many people, or vehicles, \n     were in the convoy, but they said it had been completely \n     destroyed. If DNA evidence was the only method of determining \n     who had been killed, it could take days to get the results.\n       A British newspaper, The Observer, disclosed the attack in \n     today's issue and said it had been an attempt to kill Mr. \n     Hussein. The Pentagon and the United States Central Command \n     declined today to discuss that report, and American officials \n     who agreed to discuss it on the condition of anonymity said \n     the United states had never been certain that Mr. Hussein or \n     his sons were in the convoy.\n       Still, administration officials said the strike underscored \n     a growing belief among American intelligence officials that \n     Mr. Hussein and his sons were not killed during the war and \n     have remained in Iraq. The attack on the convoy showed the \n     pressure of a stepped-up manhunt after information provided \n     by a Hussein confidant who was detained last week.\n       The aide, Abid Hamid Mahmoud al-Tikriti, 46, who had served \n     as the Iraqi leader's secretary and bodyguard, told his \n     American interrogators that Mr. Hussein and his sons, Uday \n     and Qusay, survived the war, and that he himself traveled to \n     Syria after the conflict with Mr. Hussein's sons before being \n     expelled, according to Defense Department officials who have \n     said they have not been able to corroborate those claims.\n       A senior administration official said tonight that \n     President Bush had been aware of the strike before it \n     occurred but did not have to approve it. The official said a \n     team was moving in to try to recover the DNA of those in the \n     convoy, but it was unclear if they had yet arrived at the \n     scene.\n       Some American officials described the attack as having been \n     in the same category as the March 19 and April 7 attacks on \n     compounds where Mr. Hussein and his sons were believed to be \n     hiding. American intelligence analysts now believe that Mr. \n     Hussein and his sons probably survived both those attacks.\n       A senior administration official described the intelligence \n     that led to the Wednesday attack as a good lead. But another \n     administration official said, ``I have no information that \n     leads us to believe we got Saddam.'' A military officer said \n     intelligence reports that Mr. Hussein or his sons might have \n     been in the convoy might have been based more on hope than \n     evidence.\n       ``There might be people crossing their fingers, but it's \n     just like a year ago, when they were crossing their fingers'' \n     in the hopes of capturing Osama bin Laden, one military \n     official said, Mr. bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, is still \n     believed to be alive after 21 months in which he has been the \n     target of an intense manhunt.\n       In a television interview today, King Abdullah of Jordan \n     said he had heard reports several days ago that Mr. Hussein \n     and his sons were in Iraq's western desert region. But he \n     said he had heard many reports of their whereabouts in recent \n     weeks and months and did not know if this one was accurate.\n       ``It's like Elvis,'' King Abdullah said on the ABC News \n     program ``this Week.'' ``There's a lot of sightings of him \n     all over the place.''\n       Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, including the \n     chairman, Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said in \n     television appearances today that they had not been informed \n     of any new missile strike aimed at the Iraqi leader. Still, \n     Senator Roberts, speaking on ``Fox News Sunday,'' said, ``I \n     will not be surprised at any military action that would lead \n     to the possibility that we have now finally killed Saddam \n     Hussein.''\n       Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, the \n     ranking Democrat on the committee, said on the same program \n     that any confirmation of the death of Mr. Hussein would serve \n     to undercut the morale of fighters who are staging hit-and-\n     run attacks on American soldiers and at the same time instill \n     confidence among the broader Iraqi public.\n       The search for Mr. Hussein has been led by Task Force 20, a \n     secret military organization that is working closely with \n     American intelligence agencies and whose members include\n\n[[Page S8382]]\n\n     special Army and Navy counterterrorist teams.\n       The United States is flying U-2 spy planes and RC-135 \n     electronic eavesdropping aircraft over Iraq on a regular \n     basis. Both are able to scoop up electronic emissions and \n     pinpointing locations for strike aircraft or Predator drones, \n     which are piloted by remote control and can be either armed \n     or unarmed; they are being flown from an air base in Iraq.\n       One senior administration official noted that Hellfire \n     missile attacks on convoys by the Predators were rare and \n     would not have been carried out except on the basis of good \n     intelligence about an important target.\n       Other officials said that the United States had obtained \n     good reconnaissance photos showing that the convoy had been \n     destroyed, but that those photographs did not clarify who had \n     been in the wreckage.\n       ``Although we do have good intelligence, you don't know if \n     you have someone until you've seen the analysis from the \n     ground,'' said one senior American officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 23, 2003]\n\n            Israelis and Palestinians Pressed to Compromise\n\n                         (By Steven R. Weisman)\n\n       Shuneh, Jordan, June 22.--Secretary of State Colin L. \n     Powell joined with top European, Arab and United Nations \n     diplomats today to press for concessions in peace talks \n     between Israel and the Palestinians, but their efforts were \n     punctured by violence in the Gaza Strip that left four \n     Palestinians dead.\n       In an illustration of the frustrations of the Middle East, \n     diplomats here reported that before the latest deaths in \n     Gaza, negotiators had made some progress in their talks over \n     transferring security in most of the Gaza Strip from Israel \n     to the Palestinian Authority. There was no telling tonight \n     whether that progress would be set back.\n       The four Palestinians from the Aksa Martyrs Brigades were \n     first said to have been killed today by Israeli tank fire, \n     though other reports said they might have died when a bomb \n     they were planting exploded prematurely.\n       The day's events lent a surreal cast to the scene here at \n     the World Economic Forum in a resort on the Dead Sea, where \n     more than 1,200 envoys, officials, business leaders and other \n     conferees hailed recent progress in the Israeli-Palestinian \n     situation even as the bitterness of that dispute coursed \n     through countless conversations.\n       Coming to the end of one of his longest trips as secretary \n     of state, Mr. Powell started in the morning by expressing \n     mild but unmistakable criticism of Israel's killing of a top \n     Hamas leader on Saturday night.\n       ``I regret we had an incident that could be an impediment \n     to progress,'' Mr. Powell said, referring to the killing of \n     Abdullah Qawasmeh, a leading Hamas figure. ``I would much \n     rather on a Sunday morning wake up to find that we are moving \n     forward, and it was not necessary to have this kind of \n     activity on either side.''\n       The secretary's terse reference to Israel's latest strike \n     against suspected Palestinian terrorists marked the second \n     time in two weeks that the United States felt compelled to \n     criticize Israel, if only obliquely. The week before last, \n     President Bush rebuked Israel for an attempt to kill a Hamas \n     leader, saying it had undercut peace talks.\n       But the rebuke for Israel was mixed today with exhortations \n     directed at the Palestinians by Mr. Powell and others to take \n     action to stop attacks on Israeli soldiers and citizens so as \n     to fortify Middle East peace efforts that have looked more \n     promising recently than at any time in the past two and a \n     half years.\n       Two diplomatic tracks were underway in Israel that were the \n     focus of much of the discussion here on the Dead Sea. One was \n     Israel's negotiation with the Palestinians on Gaza. The other \n     was the Palestinian Authority's negotiations to achieve a \n     cease-fire with Hamas.\n       A cease-fire with Hamas is supported by the Palestinians' \n     leadership and by its main Arab backers, Saudi Arabia, Egypt \n     and Jordan. All of them say they would prefer such an \n     arrangement to a civil war between the militant groups and \n     the shaky security forces under Mahmoud Abbas, the \n     Palestinian prime minister.\n       American and Israeli officials say they are less impressed \n     with the cease-fire talks, explaining that if there is a \n     cease-fire, it almost certainly will have to be followed by \n     aggressive actions by Palestinian security forces against \n     Hamas, including arrests, forced disarmament and potential \n     clashes.\n       For now, the negotiations on the Gaza Strip and the Hamas \n     cease-fire talks, while not officially connected, appear to \n     be intertwined, making progress on both even more difficult. \n     Arab, European and American diplomats all say, for example, \n     that Mr. Abbas may be waiting for a cease-fire before \n     reaching an accord to take over the Gaza area.\n       On the other hand, Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, \n     may be holding up approval of a deal on the Gaza Strip until \n     he sees how Mr. Abbas is going to handle Hamas. Some here \n     speculate that Mr. Sharon may also be waiting to close the \n     Gaza deal when Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national \n     security adviser, visits Israel late next week.\n       Arab diplomats attending the economic forum here assailed \n     Israel for the killing of Mr. Qawasmeh and for its policy of \n     pinpoint killings of militant leaders. Mr. Abbas's son said \n     here that he thought Israel was deliberately trying to \n     sabotage the cease-fire negotiations.\n       Mr. Powell, who left Washington a week ago for Cambodia and \n     then traveled to Bangladesh before arriving here on Thursday \n     night, made an emotional appeal for restraint by both \n     Palestinians and Israelis at a news conference and in a \n     speech this afternoon.\n       No less significant, Mr. Powell joined with Secretary \n     General Kofi Annan of the United Nations and the foreign \n     ministers of the European Union and Russia to sound the same \n     theme. The four officials, sometimes referred to as the \n     quartet, devised the staged peace plan for a Palestinian \n     state known as the road map.\n       In a statement read by Mr. Annan, the four officials said \n     they ``deplore and condemn the brutal terror attacks against \n     Israeli citizens'' carried out by Palestinian militants, \n     citing not only Hamas but Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Al \n     Aksa Martyrs Brigades. ``All Palestinian individuals and \n     groups must end acts of terror against all Israelis, \n     anywhere,'' the group said.\n       But there was also tough talk directed at Israel, including \n     ``deep concern over Israeli military actions that result in \n     the killing of innocent Palestinians and other civilians.''\n       Mr. Annan, going beyond the statement, called on Israel \n     ``not to use disproportionate force in civilian areas,'' to \n     stop demolitions of Palestinian homes and to stop engaging in \n     ``extra-judicial killings.''\n       The talk in the corridors here was about the Hamas and Gaza \n     negotiations next door in Israel, however. A diplomat close \n     to the negotiators said they seemed ``pretty close'' to \n     resolving the Gaza dispute, which has centered on Israel's \n     demand that it be allowed to maintain a security presence \n     along the main road that runs the length of the Gaza Strip.\n       Israel maintains that is must keep some forces on the road \n     both to protect Israeli settlers in several pockets of Gaza \n     and to make sure that Hamas and other groups do not regroup \n     and arm themselves to carry out attacks in Israel itself.\n       A source of surprise to many Arab and European diplomats \n     here is the increasing evidence of the United States' \n     willingness to make demands on Israel to take parallel \n     actions--not only by giving up the Gaza Strip, but also by \n     dismantling ``outposts'' of settlements and releasing \n     prisoners.\n       The American demands on Israel are thought to be based on \n     the belief that without such actions, Mr. Abbas will not have \n     the political support to act against Hamas, diplomats say. \n     ``The Americans are not really letting the Israelis off the \n     hook on this,'' said a diplomat. ``We all realize that time \n     is running out.''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The first article from the New York Times is \nheadlined ``After Missile Raid on Convoy, U.S. Hunts for Hussein's \nDNA.''\n\n       An American Predator drone aircraft firing Hellfire \n     missiles destroyed a convoy last week that was believed to be \n     carrying fugitive Iraqi leaders, and experts are trying to \n     determine whether those killed might have included Saddam \n     Hussein or his sons, United States government officials said \n     today.\n       The officials said they had obtained intelligence \n     indicating that senior Iraqi leaders were traveling in the \n     convoy. They suggested that the intelligence might have come \n     from an intercepted telephone conversation or an informant. \n     The attack took place Wednesday near the Syrian border in \n     western Iraq.\n       There was no evidence so far, the officials said, to \n     support the idea that Mr. Hussein or his sons might have been \n     killed in the raid, and some officials were doubtful that \n     they were. But they said intelligence teams, including DNA \n     experts, were at the site to review the wreckage and assess \n     the evidence.\n       Officials declined to say how many people, or vehicles, \n     were in the convoy, but they said it had been completely \n     destroyed. If DNA evidence was the only method of determining \n     who had been killed, it could take days to get the results.\n\n  The other article is printed almost side by side on the front page of \nthe New York Times today. I read the first paragraph of the second \narticle:\n\n       Secretary of State Colin L. Powell joined with European, \n     Arab and United Nations diplomats today to press for \n     concessions in peace talks between Israel and the \n     Palestinians, but their efforts were punctured by violence in \n     the Gaza Strip that left four Palestinians dead.\n\n  Further on:\n\n       Coming to the end of one of his longest trips as Secretary \n     of State, Mr. Powell started in the morning by expressing \n     mild but unmistakable criticism of Israel's killing of a top \n     Hamas leader on Saturday night.\n       ``I regret that we had an incident that could be an \n     impediment to progress,'' Mr. Powell said, referring to the \n     killing of Abdullah Qawasmeh, a leading Hamas figure. ``I \n     would much rather on a Sunday morning wake up to find that we \n     are moving forward, and it wasn't necessary to have this kind \n     of activity on either side.''\n\n  The Secretary's reference to Israel's latest strike against suspected \nPalestinian terrorists marked the second time in 2 weeks that the \nUnited States felt compelled to criticize Israel, if only obliquely. \nThe week before last, President Bush rebuked Israel for an attempt to \nkill a Hamas leader, saying it undercut peace talks.\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\n  I call attention to the two stories that appeared side by side on the \nfront page of today's New York Times with the headlines they were \ncarrying. I was struck by the fact that officials are still trying to \ndetermine how many people were killed in the missile attack. The U.S. \nmilitary struck the convoy that they believed carried wanted \nterrorists. And I support that, by the way. We are still waiting for \nCIA and Department of Defense corroboration that, indeed, regime \nmembers rather than civilians were hit in the attack.\n  The other story reports, as I mentioned before, how Secretary Powell \nexpressed mild but unmistakable criticism of Israel's killing of a top \nHamas official this past Saturday.\n  It just so happens that this past weekend, the Israeli Defense Forces \ntargeted a Hamas leader by the name of Abdullah Qawasmeh who \nmasterminded the death of 52 Israelis. If this number were converted to \nAmerican lives on a proportionate basis, he would have killed more than \n2,400 of our citizens. How would we react to that?\n  There is a curious inconsistency between how this administration is \nconducting its global war against terrorists--which, again, I support, \nincluding operations against remnants of the Iraqi regime--and how we \nexpect our ally, Israel, to deal with its terrorist threats.\n  I support a roadmap to peace, and I am pleased to see the \nadministration live up to its responsibilities by reentering as a \nmediator in one of the world's most intractable conflicts. But I also \nbelieve that no peace process or roadmap will ever work when terrorists \nare placated or appeased. The roadmap can only go forward when all \nparties uniformly denounce and resist Hamas, Jihad, and the other \nenemies of peace.\n  So I believe we must support Israel in its war against terrorists and \nact consistently in conducting our foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/23/senate-section/article/S8383-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
