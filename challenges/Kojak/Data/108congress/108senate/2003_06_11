Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business until 10 a.m. At 10 o'clock, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. Pending is the Reid second-\ndegree amendment to the Feinstein first-degree amendment on the issue \nof derivatives.\n  There are a number of Members who are reviewing those amendments at \nthis time. It is a complicated issue. I know that a number of people, \nincluding the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, will want to speak \non the amendment.\n  In the interim, it is my hope that we will continue to make progress \non the bill and work through other amendments that may be offered. \nAlso, as we have discussed over the course of this week, we would like \nto be able to lock in a list of the remaining amendments to the Energy \nbill during today's session.\n  I remind my colleagues we will vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination of Richard Wesley to be a Circuit Court Judge for the Second \nCircuit at 11:15 this morning.\n  In addition, there are a number of other Executive Calendar \nnominations ready for votes, and we will attempt to set a time certain \nfor votes on those as well.\n  Also, with respect to the schedule, Senator McConnell has continued \nto work for a vote on the Burma sanctions bill. I am very hopeful that \nover the course of the morning we will be able to address this very \nimportant and timely issue and bring this to closure. As I indicated \nyesterday, I fully support his efforts and we will work for a \nresolution today. The Senate, I believe, should speak loudly and \nclearly on the recent actions in Burma.\n  We would also like to consider and complete the FAA reauthorization \nthis week, and we will continue to look for a way to schedule that \nmatter.\n  In addition, there are other issues I have mentioned each morning on \nwhich we are working. It is important for our colleagues to come \ntogether so we can address them in a straightforward and timely manner, \nincluding the issue surrounding the bioshield bill.\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield for a comment on the \nschedule?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, we will have for the leader \nsometime today a finite list of amendments from our side. Also, Senator \nFeinstein, when she left last night, said she was not going to agree to \nhave her amendment set aside. The reason for that is somewhat based on \nlast year when she worked with Senator Gramm for more than a week \ntrying to get something on that amendment and she never did. She kept \nsetting it aside, but she said she would not do that this time.\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the majority leader for raising again the \nissue of the Burma sanctions bill. I say to him and our colleagues in \nthe Senate that we have now been working for 2 days to try to get this \nmatter cleared.\n  While we are involved in the minutia of the clearing process, Aung \nSan Suu Kyi is still, in effect, in prison. We need to send a message \nto the military in Burma, and we need to send it this week.\n  I am not going to propound another unanimous consent request at the \nmoment, but I want to put colleagues on notice that later in the day I \nwill be doing that once again. In the meantime, the discussions \ncontinue. We hope we will be able to resolve this matter. I thank the \nmajority leader very much for bringing that up.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7652-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise now to thank Rabbi Bernhard \nRosenberg for his stirring innovation this morning. This is only the \nlatest honor to be conferred on Rabbi Rosenberg for his lifetime of \ndistinguished service. He is a pillar in New Jersey's vibrant religious \ncommunity, serving as a spiritual leader and educator, and his \naccomplishments speak for themselves.\n  If I might be personal, Rabbi Rosenberg is a terrific human being, \nwhom I know personally. I am very pleased he joined us.\n  As the son of Holocaust survivors, Rabbi Rosenberg has taught \nnumerous youngsters the importance of reflecting on that awful period \nin world history, a period which led to the deaths of more than six \nmillion Jews, as well as countless others. He has written many books on \nthat subject, including ``Contemplating the Holocaust'' and ``What the \nHolocaust Means to Me: Teenagers Speak Out.''\n  Rabbi Rosenberg has served New Jersey in many capacities, including \nas a member of the New Jersey State Holocaust Commission, an appointee \nto the New Jersey Parole Board, and as the chairman of the Edison Human \nRights Commission. For his years of commitment to the Jewish community \nand his humanitarian spirit, he has received a number of awards, \nincluding the Rabbi Israel Moshowitz Award by the New York Board of \nRabbis, the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Humanitarian Award, and the \nChaplain of the Year Award for his work relating to the September 11 \nattacks.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Rabbi Rosenberg for his years of \nservice to the State of New Jersey, to the Jewish Community, and to the \nNation. He has earned the profound respect of the people of New Jersey \nand this Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, since 1789, every session of the \nSenate has been opened with prayer. I am proud that the Senate's guest \nChaplain today, Rabbi Dr. Bernhard H. Rosenberg, is from my home State \nof New Jersey. Rabbi Rosenberg is the spiritual leader of Congregation \nBeth-El in Edison, NJ.\n  As the only child of Holocaust survivors, the late Jacob and Rachel \nRosenberg, Rabbi Rosenberg has spent his life teaching the history and \neffects of the Holocaust.\n  In 1933, there were over 9 million Jews living in Europe. Almost 6 \nmillion were killed in the next 12 years. ``Holocaust,'' translated \nfrom Greek, means ``sacrifice by fire.'' The systematic persecution and \ngenocide of millions of innocent people in Europe was a ``sacrifice'' \nthe civilized world must never forget. I have met with Holocaust \nsurvivors, and I have seen the concentration camps. It was a hideous \ntime in our world's history. But it is vital to learn about it, and it \nis vital to talk about it.\n  Rabbi Rosenberg serves his community as a leader, teacher, writer, \nand spiritual adviser. He is an impressively educated man, with \nmultiple degrees in communication and education, and his ordination and \ndoctorate of education from Yeshiva University in New York.\n  Rabbi Rosenberg teaches Holocaust Studies at the Moshe Aaron Yeshiva \nHigh School of Central New Jersey, and has taught at Rutgers University \nand Yeshiva University. Rabbi Rosenberg has authored four books, with \n``Theological and Halachic Reflections on the Holocaust'' now in its \nsecond printing.\n  He is the spiritual leader of Congregation Beth-El and a model \ncitizen in New Jersey.\n  Rabbi Rosenberg has dedication and commitment that is unparalleled. \nHe is the editor of a Holocaust publication distributed by the \nRabbinical Assembly and editor of the New York Board of Rabbis \nNewsletter. As Interfaith Chairman of the New Jersey State Holocaust \nCommission, Rabbi Rosenberg is associate editor of the State-mandated \ncurriculum on Holocaust and Genocide.\n  Rabbi Rosenberg is chairman of the Human Rights Commission and \nchaplain of the Department of Public Safety, police and fire, of \nEdison, NJ. He is president and founder of the New Jersey Second \nGeneration Holocaust Survivors' Group.\n  The work of Rabbi Rosenberg has not gone unnoticed. He recently \nreceived the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Humanitarian Award. He also \nreceived the Chaplain of the Year Award from the New York Board of \nRabbis for his efforts during and following 9/11.\n  On June 10, 2002, Rabbi Rosenberg was presented with the annual Rabbi \nIsrael Mowshowitz Award by the New York Board of Rabbis.\n  We are privileged to have Rabbi Rosenberg of Edison, NJ, to lead the \nSenate in prayer today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity in morning \nbusiness to comment on issues of current events but also tied to the \nevents of the last several years. The issues relate to the natural and \nthe unnatural emergence and use of biology and microbes that have \nresulted in a convergence of two issues. One is this natural occurrence \nand one is the use of microbes, bacteria, viruses potentially as \nbioterror agents, all of that coupled with another nexus, \nglobalization, the realization and evolution of a much smaller world in \nwhich we all live.\n  Globalization is generally addressed in the context of economics, \neconomies of countries, information technologies, coffee shop \nfranchises, luxury hotels, luxury clothing--what labels are on the \nbacks of those sweaters and shirts--Internet surfing, instant messages.\n  Globalization has helped democratize faraway countries. It has \nbrought wealth and comfort to many of the world's peoples. But it has \nalways exposed us to new vulnerabilities which we have read about in \nrecent years and, indeed, we read about each day in the papers. \nSpecifically, globalization has brought us much closer to the threat of\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nnatural disease as well as disease used potentially as an instrument of \nterror.\n  We can take, for example, the outbreak of monkeypox about which we \nare reading and listening today. We know monkeypox causes fever, \nheadache, cough, and an extremely painful rash with pus-filled sores \nthat can spread across the body. We know in children and those \nindividuals who have a suppressed immune system, whether it is because \nof cancer or treatment for cancer or other autoimmune diseases, it can \ncause death.\n  Monkeypox is suspected to have originated with the importation of an \nexotic pet, actually a rather popular exotic pet called the Gambian \ngiant rat. Then the monkeypox virus apparently jumped to infect the pet \nprairie dogs, and then jumped to infect human beings. We know there are \n37 suspected or confirmed cases of monkeypox that are currently being \ninvestigated by the Centers for Disease Control. Public health \nofficials, we learn, fear the prairie dog owners will release their \ninfected pets into the wild and, thus, spread the disease through \ncommunities, regions, and, indeed, throughout North America.\n  Some also believe that this outbreak of monkeypox is the tip of a \ngrowing problem of infectious diseases being brought into the country \nthrough the importation of exotic animals.\n  Not too long ago--and, in fact, even right now--we focused on SARS. \nAs we have seen with SARS, international travel by humans is also \nproving to be a conduit of disease. As I speak, Toronto is struggling \nwith yet another suspected outbreak of SARS and at any point could go \nback on the World Health Organization's travel advisory list.\n  The SARS epidemic continues to disrupt international travel, \ncontinues to affect and, indeed, depress national economies.\n  Monkeypox, SARS, West Nile virus, which we know is seasonal--it has \nbeen 4 years since it first arrived in New York, and it has claimed 284 \ndeaths and 4,156 infections. Several years ago, people did not know \nwhat West Nile virus was. Several months ago we did not know what SARS \nwas, and several days ago we did not know what monkeypox was. Last \nyear, just in this region of Maryland, Virginia, and the District, the \nWest Nile virus killed 11 people. After what has been a wet spring in \nthis region, where mosquito breeding is facilitated, officials fear--\nagain not to be an alarmist--there will be another explosion of \ninfections this summer. West Nile has spread across the United States \nof America. It is now firmly established, entrenched as a North \nAmerican disease. West Nile, SARS, and now monkeypox--we will see \nemerging infections continue to appear, at least at this rate. These \nare the natural health threats.\n  Equally alarming is this whole arena of bioterrorism, the use of \nmicrobes, viruses, bacteria, and other microbes as biological weapons \nto threaten others. This very body, the Senate, has been attacked with \nanthrax. We know there is an entity called the plague which, indeed, \nwiped out about a third of Europe in the 1300s.\n  We know the risk of smallpox. We know one gram of botulinum toxin, if \naerosolized, has the potential for taking the lives of a million and a \nhalf people.\n  I mention all of this not to be an alarmist but to give some \ndefinition to what I think we all know today but we did not think very \nmuch about 3 or 5 years ago, and that is these threats, those of \nbioterrorism and the naturally occurring, are real.\n  With regard to bioterrorism, I do commend President Bush for \nsuccessfully leading America and indeed the world to face these new \nrealities of terrorists. We have disrupted terrorist networks. We have \nfrozen terrorist assets. We have removed terrorist leaders and indeed \nhave arrested more than 3,000 individual terrorists worldwide. We have \ntoppled two of the world's most notorious terrorist regimes in \nAfghanistan and Iraq with decisive victories.\n  With regard to our domestic response, we are finally rebuilding our \npublic health system after a long period of neglect. As a nation, this \nhas enabled us to respond, in an appropriate way, to the potential \nspread of SARS much more effectively than other countries. We must \ncontinue to invest in and enhance our public health system to detect \nand respond to such emergencies, for, as I said earlier, we will see \nmore.\n  We must actively lead the way to develop new treatments in vaccines, \nand that is why when I come to the floor each morning and mention the \nimportance of vaccine research, vaccine development, and specifically \nbioshield legislation, which is sitting before this body perched and \nready for us to act upon it, but there are certain problems we have had \namong ourselves in coming to an agreement, how best to bring that to \nthe floor--but that bioshield legislation is in exact response to these \nissues I mention today.\n  I should also add that we, and our friends and allies across the \nworld, must not allow other countries to pursue biological weapons \nprograms. President Bush has set the United States, with the help of \nour allies, along a proper course to ultimately win the war on terror. \nI, for one, am grateful he and his national security team have answered \nthe call to serve in this perilous time. We will defeat the forces of \nterror. We must take our enemies seriously, but because of \nglobalization they are closer than ever. I am optimistic. We have an \nobligation in this body to respond and indeed prepare for and prevent, \nwhether it is those naturally occurring infections or any attempt of \nothers to use these biological agents as weapons of mass destruction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We are in morning business, is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7653-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7653-S7654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REFORM OF OUR GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will make a couple of comments that are \na little different than the subject we have been talking about. It is \nsomething that I do not have the recommendation as to how we resolve it \nparticularly, but I am persuaded we need to spend a little more time on \nit, which I intend to, and that is government activities we are \ninvolved in. Of course, the many government activities we are involved \nin are probably the largest combined organizational thing we do in this \ncountry. It would be interesting to know, and I intend to see if there \nis not a way for all of us to do so, to get a look at all the kinds of \nprograms and different activities the Federal Government is involved \nin. It is massive, of course.\n  We spend trillions of dollars on activities in the Federal \nGovernment. I do not suggest that is not legitimate. The Federal \nGovernment has a job to do and we need to do it. What I do believe is \nthat because of the nature of it and because of the nature of this \nbody, frankly, we do not really work very hard at ensuring that the \ndelivery of these services is done as efficiently as it could be. We \nare a little different, of course, than the private sector in that \nthere are some inherent barriers in the private sector. If one is not \nvery efficient, they are not able to continue to compete with others \nand they are not able to go on. That is not true in the Government, of \ncourse. There is not that kind of limitation.\n  So it seems to me we ought to give a little more thought to how we do \nthings. It is quite natural that when there is a need somewhere, \nthrough the political process we bring up some resolution to the need, \nsome way to work on the need, and it usually creates a new agency or \ncreates a new department within an agency or a new function, and there \nis no real way to ensure that that blends in to what is already being \ndone in an efficient way.\n  There certainly must be lots of opportunities within this huge \norganization we have to be able to blend one thing in to another to do \nit more efficiently, to deliver it more efficiently. I think clearly \nthere is reason to believe that activities that were begun 30 years ago \nmay need to be reviewed to see if they still are needed, and if they \nare needed that they are done in a way that is most effective and \nefficient.\n  I am really not critical of the people who are doing these things. I \nam critical, I guess, or at least inquisitive about the system, because \nthe system is set up in such a way that it does not have a way to even \nconsider change\n\n[[Page S7654]]\n\nvery often. As I say, in the private sector, people are forced to \nchange from time to time in order to continue to be effective and to \ncontinue to modernize. I do not think it is reasonable to think that a \nprogram that started in the 1950s, and it is now 2003, that that \nprogram is being done as efficiently as it might be. I frankly \nsometimes think it would be a good idea if the various things we pass \nthat go into some kind of services, some kind of activity, should \nexpire and we should have to go through the process of reexamining what \nthat operation is doing and if it is still needed--and it may or may \nnot be--then see if it is being done in the most efficient way \npossible.\n\n  There are operations in the Government, of course, that are designed \nto do that, such as OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, but it is \nvery difficult.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has a modernization program going, \nbut there is all kinds of resistance. The resistance can be political: \nIf it does not happen to suit one's particular community as a \npolitician, why, they are opposed to that. I think it is fair to say \nclearly that the labor union leaders who are involved with Government \nunions are overreacting to the idea that some things ought to be made \navailable to be done in the private sector, which I think is a very \nreasonable thing to do.\n  We now have sort of an overstatement of things that are trying to be \ndone in the National Park Service. Well, there should be a few things \nthat are competitive with the private sector, but the whole Park \nService is not going to be turned over to the private sector. No one \nhas suggested that, but that is the kind of thing we get.\n  I do think we ought to pay a little more attention to how we could \nmake the delivery of services more efficient and how we could review \nthe services that are being delivered to see if indeed they are in \nkeeping with the times. That has to be done in a special way because it \njust does not happen automatically. Politics keeps it from happening. \nThe complexity keeps it from happening. Sometimes labor unions are \nresistant to any change. I think it is our responsibility, and I intend \nto continue to look for opportunities, to examine, evaluate, and try to \nmove forward in making the delivery of essential services more \nefficient whenever possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand we are to resume debate on S. \n14 at 10?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

The Senator from the great State of \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are now resuming debate on S. 14, the \nnational energy policy for our country. I have been on the floor \nseveral times over the last number of weeks as we have debated \ndifferent amendments. Yesterday, there were a couple of critical votes \nas it related to nuclear. We have a derivatives amendment at this time \nby the Senator from California, and I think the Senator from Nevada has \na second degree on it.\n  A fundamental question again emerges, and emerged yesterday at a \nhearing on the Hill, with the statement of our Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan as to the importance of a national energy policy.\n  Why is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is interested in the \nprime rate and the management of monetary supply of our country, \nconcerned about energy? It is fundamental why he is concerned about \nenergy. He is concerned about the economy of our country and its \nstrength, stability, and ability to grow and provide jobs for the men \nand women who currently do not have them, and to strengthen and \nstabilize those jobs for the men and women who currently do have jobs.\n  What was he talking about yesterday? He was talking about one of the \nprimary feed stocks for energy in our country, natural gas; the \nproblems that we currently have with the supply of natural gas because \nthis country has not effectively explored and developed, for a variety \nof reasons, our natural gas supply.\n  In the context of not providing supply, we have provided \nextraordinary demands on the current supply. Under the Clean Air Act, \nto meet those clean air standards, and out in the Western States and \nthose air sheds specifically, the only way you can meet those standards \nand bring a new electrical generating plant on line is to choose to use \ngas to fire a turbine, to generate electricity. That is a tremendously \ninefficient way to use the valuable commodity of natural gas, but that \nis exactly what the Federal Government has told our utilities over the \nlast two decades: If you are going to bring a new generation on line, \nit will be a gas-fired electrical turbine. Coal has problems; we are \nworking on clean coal technology. This legislation embodies trying to \nget us to a cleaner technology to fire the coal electrical generation \nin our country.\n  As a result, what are we talking about? What has been said and what \nwe believe to be true is that there is now rapidly occurring a major \nshortage in natural gas. As a result, that is not only going to drive \nup the cost to the consumer in his or her individual home--and I will \nread from an article: Another witness, Donald Mason, head of the Ohio \nPublic Utilities Commission, predicted that the average residential \nheating bill next winter will be at least $220 higher per household \nthan last winter.\n  That is a real shock to an economy and to a household and why Alan \nGreenspan is obviously worried that you spread that across a consuming \nnation, and we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars pulled \nout of the economy to go to the cost of heating when it had not been \nthe case before. That was one of the concerns.\n  The other concern is the tremendous price hike we are seeing at this \ntime and the impact that will have. Gas prices have nearly doubled in \nthe past year to about $6.31 per Btu, and there is a 25-percent change \nexpected. We expect prices to peak and we have seen one instance, about \n3 months ago, over a 200-percent increase in the price of natural gas \nas a spike in the market.\n  S. 14 is legislation to help facilitate the construction of a major \ndelivery system out of Alaska. In Alaska at this moment we are pumping \nbillions of Btu's of gas back into the ground because we simply cannot \ntransport it to the lower 48 States, and we do not want to flare it \ninto the atmosphere as has been the approach in the past in gasfields. \nIt is too valuable a commodity, and we do not want to do that to the \nenvironment.\n  We have also looked at other opportunities for access. Part of the \ndifficulty today is delivery systems and building gas pipelines across \nAmerica. This legislation has provisions to help facilitate more of \nthat as it relates to right of way and, of course, the recognition of \nthe environmental need and the consequence and appropriate adjustment \nthere.\n\n  What Alan Greenspan underlines in his comments, what Donald Mason\n\n[[Page S7655]]\n\nfrom the Ohio Public Utilities Commission underlines, was what Spence \nAbraham said last Friday when he called for a June 26 meeting of the \nNational Petroleum Council to talk about this impending gas shortage \ncrisis: Our country needs a national energy policy.\n  I hope all of my colleagues rally to that reality. Why should we \nforce upon the American consumer a $200- or $300-increase in their \nenergy costs next year simply because this Senate and this Congress \nwill not do its work or can't do its work? We debated mightily a year \nago an energy policy. We got it to a conference. The differences were \ntoo great. Ultimately, we could not arrive at a final product to go to \nour President's desk.\n  What Senator Domenici has done as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee is craft a broad-based national energy policy that \nis as much production as it is conservation. It is as much new \ntechnology as it is the advancement and the improving of existing \ntechnology. It is truly a broad-based national energy policy for our \ncountry. More gas? Yes. More coal usage? Yes. More wind usage? Yes. \nMore photovoltaic or sunlight usage? You bet. The development of new, \nsafe, clean, more effective utilization of nuclear? Absolutely. Why shy \naway from any energy source at this moment when we are forcing them on \nthe American consumer and the economy of this country is increasing \ncosts in the area of energy?\n  Lastly, when we do all of that and we drive up the costs of the job \nitself and the cost of the product produced by that job, we make \nourselves increasingly less competitive around the world.\n  I was out in the Silicon Valley this weekend. I met with 50 CEOs of \nhigh-technology companies in San Jose. They are interested in a lot of \nissues, but their No. 1 issue is energy and the ability to know that \nwhen they build a plant in this country, whether it is in California or \nin any other State, they are going to be guaranteed a supply of high-\nquality constant energy. The reality is when they do not have it, they \nwill shop elsewhere to build that plant. If they can't get quality \nsustainable energy in this country, then they will go elsewhere. That \nmeans U.S. jobs go to some other country.\n  Shame on us as a country for having failed for the last decade to \nproduce a national energy policy, and in failing to do so, bringing \nAlan Greenspan to the Hill to talk about an impending energy crisis \nagain in domestic supply of gas, and to have a utility commissioner \ntalk about a $220-per-year increase in the cost of heating the average \nAmerican home by natural gas.\n  Less food on the table, less money in the college trust fund for the \nchildren--all of those could be the consequence of a home that is \nunemployed, a home that has to choose between staying warm and doing \nother things. In a cold winter, ultimately, they will want to stay warm \nand they will have to pay their heating bill. We should not ask \nAmericans to make that choice if it is our failure to produce a \nnational energy policy and to produce energy that has caused them to \nhave to make that choice. That is the issue.\n  I hope the Senate will expedite the passage of S. 14. We have been on \nit now nearly 4 weeks, 3 weeks to be exact. We are being told there are \nhundreds of amendments out there. There are not hundreds of amendments \non this side of the aisle. There are a few. We ought to ask, and I hope \nwe can get by the end of business this week, a finite list and a \nunanimous consent that will bring this issue together so we can say to \nour colleagues and to the American people: The Senate is ultimately \ngoing to vote on this legislation, help produce a national energy \npolicy, get it into conference with the House, and get it on the \nPresident's desk as soon as we possibly can.\n  Not only does the absence of a national policy have a negative impact \non our economy, the presence of one--this legislation--could have a \ntremendously positive impact. Many have said in the analysis of S. 14, \nthere are 500,000 new jobs in this legislation alone. That could be \nmore jobs that would be created over the next 10 years by this \nlegislation than could be created by the economic stimulus package, \nalthough we believe that will have a tremendously positive impact.\n  That is why we are here in the Chamber debating it. I am frustrated \nby those who say: Oh, no, not now; we can't do this; we can't do that; \nor we have hundreds of amendments; or we are obstructing or dragging \nour feet.\n  Let's get a unanimous consent agreement. Let's get Senators to bring \nthose amendments to the floor. I am certainly willing to debate them. I \nthink we ought to vote on them. The American people ought to sort us \nout and see who is for energy production in this country, who is for \ndriving down the projected costs to the average home when it comes to \ntheir heating bill, who is in favor of creating hundreds of thousands \nof new jobs in clean technology, environmentally sound technology, and \nmaking this Nation once again self-reliant in the area of energy.\n  S. 14 is critical legislation. We ought to be voting on it now. We \nought not be dragging our feet or, in some instances, obstructing. The \ndebate is critical. Senators, bring your amendments to the floor. The \nchairman has pleaded with us time and time again to craft a unanimous \nconsent agreement. The Senator from Nevada, the whip for Democrats, has \nworked with us to try to get a unanimous consent agreement. If, on \nFriday, we cannot produce a unanimous consent agreement of the body of \namendments that will finally be offered and debated on this bill, then \nit begins to look as if somebody is obstructing this process, somebody \nsimply does not want it to go forward in an effective way to finalize \nand produce for this country a national energy policy.\n  I certainly hope we can get on with the business that the Senate does \nbest--get to the floor, debate the issues, offer the amendments, vote \non them, and ultimately get this legislation to our President's desk so \nour country can once again stand tall and strong in the field of \nenergy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, we will, as I indicated to the majority leader today, have a \nlist sometime today, a finite list of amendments on our side. I would \nalso say the holdup, the slowdown on this bill in the last 24 hours is \nnot anything that we on this side have done. Senator Feinstein has \noffered an amendment. That amendment needs to be disposed of before we \nmove forward. I hope the majority will make a decision in the near \nfuture as to what they want to do with that amendment.\n  As indicated, I filed an amendment--I am confident my friend from \nIdaho would agree with it--to exempt from her amendment minerals, which \nare such an important part of the American West. They have agreed to \naccept that amendment. Senator Feinstein has agreed to accept the \namendment--not, I am sure, because she likes the amendment a lot but \nbecause she realizes what happened when there was a vote on this last \nyear.\n  I hope that amendment will be accepted, the majority will allow that \namendment to be accepted, and we can move forward on the Feinstein \namendment with an up-or-down vote or move to table, whatever they \ndecide to do on it, but let's move on.\n  Senator Feinstein, for example, has other amendments she wishes to \noffer. She has one dealing with CAFE standards. That was debated last \ntime, but I am sure we will have to debate it this time. But we should \nmove forward on this legislation.\n  I want the record simply to reflect we are not holding up this \nlegislation. I have made public statements here, with the full \nknowledge of the Democratic leader, that we are cooperating on this \nEnergy bill in the very best way we can. As we know, last year when we \nhad this bill up, there were 8 weeks of debate, approximately 125 \namendments, and we had 35 recorded votes. I hope we need not do that \nthis time. I hope we can condense things and do it in fewer than 8 \nweeks.\n  I also said publicly I appreciate very much how Senator Frist has \nhandled the bills generally since he has taken the leadership of the \nSenate--not filing cloture immediately. As long as we are cooperating, \nwhich we are on this, offering substantive amendments, he has been very \ngood about allowing debate to go forward.\n  We continue, on this measure, to cooperate with the majority. We will\n\n[[Page S7656]]\n\nmove forward with this most important legislation. I agree with the \nSenator from Idaho, this country needs an energy policy. I underline, \nunderscore this. I didn't hear all his remarks, I was called off the \nfloor, but I did hear some of his statements regarding alternative \nenergy. The State of Nevada is the Saudi Arabia of geothermal. We are \nwaiting for that development. We need certain tax incentives included \nin the tax portion of this bill.\n  We would thrive on more solar energy production. That can be done \nwith tax incentives that are in the underlying tax part of this bill. \nOf course, the Senator from Idaho and I know how much the wind blows in \nparts of Idaho and Nevada, and we should be using that wind to our own \nbenefit. It is renewable energy.\n  Even though there are certain things in the bill the Senator from New \nMexico produced that I was not wild about, that is what the process is \nabout. Amendments are offered. The Senator from New Mexico had strong \nfeelings about the nuclear portions of this legislation. We had a good \ndebate on that yesterday and a very close vote. That is what the Senate \nis all about. There are other parts of the bill we are going to try to \namend. No one at this stage is trying to stall--I should not say no \none. I am sure some people would love this legislation never to come \nabout, but the general belief of the people on this side of the aisle \nis we should have an Energy bill, and we are going to work toward that \nend.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate those comments. I think we are all \nfrustrated, when we have an issue as mature as this issue is, not to be \nable to define an arena of amendments and get a unanimous consent \nagreement that sets a course of action for us. To me, that is what \ndefines progress and ultimate conclusion of what we do on the floor.\n  As I said earlier, I welcome all amendments that Senators want to \nhave come to the floor. Let's get at the business of debating them and \nvoting on them. When I see an hour quorum call because we cannot get \nsomebody to come to the floor to offer an amendment--and I know the \nmanager of the bill, the chairman of the Energy Committee, has worked \nmightily to get that done--I have to begin to question what is our \nintent here.\n  I am extremely pleased that the Senator from Nevada has recognized \nthe possibility of getting a unanimous consent with a group. I did \nmention in my remarks that I know the Senator worked to accomplish \nthat, and I appreciate that. But in the absence of doing that, it \nappears we are wandering a bit in a wilderness of undefinable \namendments and no determination as to when we can conclude this \nprocess.\n  It is extremely pleasing to hear we may ultimately get that done \nbecause this is a critical issue.\n  Mr. REID. I will respond to my friend from Idaho. No. 1, we hope to \nhave a list of amendments today sometime before the close of business. \nNo. 2, as the Senator from Idaho knows, as the Senator from New Mexico \nknows, the lull in the proceedings here is not any fault of the \nminority. We are waiting for the majority to make a decision as to what \nthey are going to do on the derivatives amendment filed by the Senator \nfrom California and the Senator from Illinois.\n  We are here to do business. We are simply waiting, until a decision \nis made on derivatives, as to what is the next amendment before us. We \nhave lots of people willing to offer amendments on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho for his remarks this morning and for his assistance on this \nbill. I thank him very much.\n  This morning I want in particular to thank the distinguished minority \nwhip, the Senator from Nevada, for his comments on the floor and his \ncommitment. We are working on a list on our side. We will certainly be \nready at the same time or sooner, which means whether we finish by this \nFriday or not, although we will try mightily once we have the list to \nwean them down and to move with dispatch. Obviously, we will be on a \ncourse to get an Energy bill this year, which is clearly what we want \nto do. From listening to the minority leader, I have no doubt \nwhatsoever that is what the minority desires to do. I thank him very \nmuch for the comments here this morning.\n\n  As far as the pending amendment is concerned, it is in our hands at \nthis point. The Senator from California has her prerogative of not \nwanting to set it aside. We have an obligation to decide what we are \ngoing to do with it. We ought to do that pretty soon. Our leadership \nwill make that decision. It is not directly within the jurisdiction of \nthis committee, or I would be making decisions with the leadership. It \nis more within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee, and the \nleadership is taking a look.\n  I understand we have a vote this morning on a judge. Is that correct? \nThat will give leadership a chance to be here in the Chamber, I say to \nmy friend from Nevada, after which time we will make a decision on what \nwe want to do with the pending amendment.\n  In the meantime, the Senator from New Mexico yields the floor knowing \nthere are others who want to speak to this issue. The junior Senator \nfrom Idaho desires to speak. I will yield at this point so he may \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 876\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to address the Feinstein amendment \ndealing with derivatives. I think it is a very bad idea. It is one we \ndebated last year and one which is dangerous to our economy.\n  In order to understand, we have to go back 2 years. Several years \nago, Congress wanted to know exactly how our country should approach \nthe regulation of derivatives. As a result of that, and after a few \nyears of study and debate in which a precise time was put together to \nevaluate the issue, that team came back with recommendations. Those \nrecommendations were enacted by Congress in the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act of 2000. This landmark legislation provided certainty \nwith respect to the legal enforceability and regulatory status of swaps \nand other off-exchange derivatives--what we call over-the-counter \nderivatives--under the Commodity Exchange Act. The Feinstein amendment \nwould undermine that certainty for OTC derivatives and would impose a \nnew persuasive and unnecessary regulatory regime with respect to OTC \nderivatives based on energy or on other nonfinancial, nonagricultural \ncommodities.\n  This act gets complicated, but these commodities are called ``exempt \ncommodities.'' The term is a little bit confusing because it creates \nthe impression sometimes that these commodities are not regulated at \nall. They are covered fully by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act \nand by the Commodity Exchange Act. The point is that they are not \nregulated in the same way that other securities are regulated.\n  OTC derivatives, including those based on energy, are critical risk \nmanagement tools. Congress, key financial regulators and others \nrecognize that OTC derivatives are critical tools that are used by \nbusinesses, government, and others to manage the financial, commodity, \ncredit and other risks inherent in their core economic activities with \na degree of efficiency that would not otherwise be possible.\n  It is important to state at the outset as we are discussing this \nissue that we are not talking about transactions that many people think \nof in securities where they think about investing in a stock in the \nstock market, a stock that may be regulated under our securities \nregulations system. These are not transactions that are engaged in by \nunsophisticated buyers or sellers. These are very sophisticated \ntransactions. Those engaging in these transactions are sophisticated \nbuyers and sellers. They are not the kinds of transactions most people \nthink of when they think of investing in the stock market.\n  OTC derivatives based on energy products are an especially important \ntool, allowing market participants to manage risk. In fact, last year \nwhen we had Alan Greenspan testify at the Banking Committee, I asked \nhim directly about whether he believed the management of derivatives, \nthe regulation of derivatives, was being properly handled today and \nwhether there was any aspect of our approach to regulating derivatives \nthat led to the Enron\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\ndebacle or any of the other problems California faced.\n  At that time, the answer I got from Mr. Greenspan was that he was not \naware of any evidence that indicated the problems we faced in the Enron \ncircumstance were as a result of our regulatory regime for derivatives, \nand also that it was his opinion the use of derivatives was a very \nimportant tool to help to allocate risk in our economy in such a manner \nthat it helped us stabilize and strengthen our economy.\n  In fact, he even went so far as to say he believed that one reason \nour economy had not dipped further as we faced a lot of the economic \ntrials and tribulations we have faced in the last couple of years was \nbecause of our ability to utilize derivatives and to share and allocate \nrisk in these complicated transactions.\n  Today, for example, airlines use over-the-counter derivatives to \nmanage their risks with respect to the price and availability of jet \nfuel. Energy-intensive companies such as aluminum producers use OTC \nderivatives to hedge their risks of change in the cost of electricity, \nand energy producers likewise use OTC derivatives to minimize the \neffects of price volatility.\n  Again, I reiterate the point that these are complicated, \nsophisticated transactions being engaged in by very sophisticated \nparticipants in the market.\n  A Wall Street Journal article dated March 10, 2003, entitled ``U.S. \nAirlines Show Disparity in Hedging for Jet-Fuel Costs,'' illustrated \nthe impacts of using derivatives to hedge in the U.S. airline industry. \nThe article noted that jet fuel, now more than twice as expensive; as a \nyear ago, is emerging as a major factor in survival and bankruptcy for \nairlines, as several carriers, including some of the weakest, find \nthemselves with few protective price hedges in place.\n  In other words, these airlines did not effectively utilize the \nhedging tool, and now they are facing a doubling in the cost of their \nfuel prices against which they could have hedged. They could have \nspread that risk if they had used these hedging tools.\n  Congress should avoid actions that unnecessarily deter the use or \nincrease the cost of these risk management tools.\n  Key financial regulators also oppose legislation such as this \namendment. As I indicated earlier, Alan Greenspan indicated his \nopposition to increasing or changing the regulatory regime with regard \nto transactions in OTC derivatives. We are expecting anytime today to \nget a brandnew response from all of our financial regulators. But last \nyear when this same debate was held, the Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury, the \nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Chairman of \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, collectively known as the \nPresident's Working Group on Financial Markets, opposed the earlier \nversions of the amendment we debated.\n  In a September 18, 2002, letter to Senators Crapo and Miller, these \nregulators highlighted the benefits of OTC derivative noting that ``the \nOTC derivatives markets in question have been a major contributor to \nour economy's ability to respond to the stresses and challenges of the \nlast two years.'' The President's working group also observed ``while \nthe derivatives markets may seem far removed from the interests and \nconcerns of consumers, the efficiency gains that these markets have \nfostered are enormously important to the consumers and to our \neconomy.'' They urged Congress to protect these markets' contributions \nto the economy and to be aware of the potential unintended consequences \nof legislative proposals to expand regulation of the OTC derivatives \nmarkets, and changing the President's working group proposals which we \nenacted into law in 2000.\n  Federal Reserved Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate Banking \nCommittee in March of last year that there was:\n\n       a significant downside if we regulate [OTC derivatives \n     based on energy] where we do not have to . . . because if we \n     step in as government regulators, we will remove a \n     considerable amount if the caution that is necessary to allow \n     these markets to evolve. [W]hile it may appear sensible to go \n     in and regulate, all of our experience is that there is a \n     significant downside when you do not allow counterparty \n     surveillance to function in an appropriate manner.\n\n  The CFTC does not need new authority to address acts of manipulation \nthat appear to have occurred in California.\n  One of the arguments we often hear in favor of jumping in and \nincreasing the regulatory scheme with regard to derivatives is that \nEnron destroyed the energy markets in California and if we had had a \ntough regulatory regime, that wouldn't have happened.\n  The CFTC's recent enforcement action against Enron demonstrates that \nit has adequate tools under the CFMA to address situations such as \nthose, which arose in California. The following enforcement actions \nhave been brought forth by the CFTC this year: No. 1, CFTC charges \nEnron with price manipulation, operating an illegal, undesignated \nfutures exchange and offering illegal lumber futures contracts through \nits internet trading platform; No. 2, energy trading company agrees to \npay the CFTC $20 million to settle charges of attempted manipulation \nand false reporting; and No. 3, former natural gas trader charged \ncriminally under the Commodity Exchange Act with intentionally \nreporting false natural gas price and volume information to energy \nreporting firms in an attempt to affect prices of natural gas \ncontracts.\n  The point here is, there is law in place prohibiting the kinds of \nthings that happened in the Enron situation, and those laws are being \nenforced with criminal penalties being imposed. The fact they are \nalready regulated is apparent. The fact that the acts that occurred in \nCalifornia are the subject of intense regulatory review and criminal \nenforcement conduct shows we do have regulatory protections in place. \nThe fact there are bad actors who violate the law does not always mean \nwe should necessarily increase the regulatory burdens we face in this \ncountry, that our economy deals with in this country.\n  The CFTC's Division of Enforcement continues to work closely with \nother Federal law enforcement officers across the country on \ninvestigations of possible round-trip trading, false reporting, and \nfraud and manipulation by energy companies, their affiliates, their \nemployees, or their agents. Again, the point is, there is no evidence \nthat any aspect or lack of aspect in our regulatory regime for the \nregulation of derivatives had anything to do with the actions of Enron \nand the occurrences in California that caused such a difficult problem \nin their energy economy.\n  There is no evidence that enactment of the CFMA, for example--the \n2000 reforms, the modernization of our regulatory system--contributed \nto the collapse of Enron. Enron's collapse was caused by a failure of \ncorporate governance and controls which, when it became public, led \nothers to refuse to do business with them. As in the case of \nCalifornia, neither the CFTC nor any other key financial regulators has \nsuggested more restrictive regulation of derivatives or derivatives \ndealers would have prevented the fall of Enron or is needed to prevent \nfuture similar events in the future.\n  The Feinstein amendment would cause more problems than it would cure. \nThis amendment, among other items, would create jurisdictional \nconfusion between the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. It would impose problematic \ncapital requirements to facilities trading in the OTC energy \nderivatives markets. It would require futures-like reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements.\n  It would create both legal and regulatory uncertainty for brokered \ntrading in OTC energy derivatives, as well as OTC derivatives based on \nother nonfinancial, nonagricultural commodities. It would subject to \nnew regulation a broad range of market participants that have not \ntraditionally been subject to the more intensive CFTC regulation. It \nwould allow the CFTC to regulate any exempt commodity transaction and \npresumably any market participant that engages in such a transaction in \na dealer market. Again, I repeat, these are sophisticated transactions \nbetween sophisticated actors in these markets. This proposal would \ncreate the very sort of uncertainty that Congress and the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission have worked for more than a decade to avoid.\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\n  This amendment, in my opinion, is a solution in search of a problem. \nSince the collapse of Enron and the actions of some market participants \nto improperly exploit the weaknesses in the California energy price \nderegulation scheme, remedial actions have occurred on all fronts. The \nCFTC, the FERC, and others have initiated civil and criminal actions. \nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has aggressively pursued \nnecessary changes in accounting rules, and private-sector groups have \ndeveloped and implemented ``best practices'' rules and improved the \ntechniques of managing credit and other risks in the OTC energy \nderivatives transactions.\n\n  The lessons of Enron and of California have been learned. The \nmisdeeds and regulatory violations involving Enron and California have \nchallenged regulators under the existing regulatory structure. Law \nenforcement agencies and private litigants are dealing with it under \nthe existing regulatory structure. The energy markets are beginning to \nrebound, and they are becoming less volatile, notwithstanding the \ncurrent uncertain economy. As a result and because of all this, the \nFeinstein amendment is little more than a solution in search of a \nproblem, but for reasons I have already mentioned, it is a solution \nthat is dangerous and unnecessary and will put more rigidity into our \neconomy at a time when we need the flexibility and the resilience that \nwill make our economy more dynamic in these difficult times.\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of other aspects of this debate we \nneed to review before we vote on this amendment. I am hopeful by the \nend of the day we are going to be in a position where we can, as a \nSenate, deal with this amendment, as we dealt with it last year, by \nrejecting it and telling our energy derivatives markets, and all of our \nOTC derivatives markets, that the current modernized regulatory \nstructure we put into place in 2000, as we follow the President's \nworking group recommendations as to how to deal with these issues, will \nbe maintained and will not be changed, and they can continue to utilize \nthese important financial tools to keep our economy strong and dynamic.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the matter now before the Senate? Is \nit the Reid amendment to the Feinstein amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Reid amendment is the pending question.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 877, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a modification to my amendment which \nI send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 877), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 18, strike line 1 and insert the following:\n       ``(10) Metals.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     subsection, an agreement, contract, or transaction in \n     metals--\n       ``(A) shall not be subject to this subsection (as amended \n     by section ____04 of the Energy Policy Act of 2003); and\n       ``(B) shall be subject to this subsection and subsection \n     (h) (as those subsections existed on the day before the date \n     of enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2003).\n       ``(11) No effect on other authority.--\n\n  Mr. REID. I state, Mr. President, I did this with no one from the \nmajority being here, but it does not take unanimous consent, so I was \nnot trying to take advantage of anyone.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to address the overlying amendment \npending before us concerning the issue of energy derivatives. I know \nthere is a second-degree amendment to that. I am a little disappointed \nthere is a second-degree amendment to it. I understand why it was done. \nI know the Senator from California wants to separate off those people \nwho are interested in metals derivatives from those who are interested \nin energy derivatives. She knows there is considerable interest on both \nof those parts. So this is a divide-and-conquer strategy, where later \nthey will pick up the metals folks, thinking it will probably work \nbetter, because we debated this last year. We debated the same issue. \nWe are back to an amendment that is slightly revised but still not good \nenough to make it through this body before.\n  We voted on this and we defeated this. One significant change is the \nsecond-degree amendment that takes the metals derivatives out of it. \nThat is clever, but I hope the metals folks don't fall for it because \nthey are next on the list.\n  The proponents of the amendment believe the trading of derivatives--\nespecially in the energy area--was the cause of energy problems faced \nby Western States in recent years. The proponents believe energy \ntrading of derivatives by Enron contributed significantly to the energy \nproblem. Unfortunately, the problems that caused Enron to fail were \nbased upon failures in corporate governance and outright fraud. \nChairman Greenspan has testified several times before congressional \ncommittees that derivatives did not cause the collapse of Enron.\n  Last year we debated the same issue and we voted it down. The issue \nof derivatives trading is one of the most complicated and detailed \nissues to come before us. I have been tempted to see how many of us \ncould even spell derivatives, and we are being called on here to make \nsome major judgments on the issue. If you are a derivatives dealer or a \nsmall company that uses derivatives to stabilize revenues, or you are a \npurchaser of derivatives, this would probably be a stimulating debate. \nBut it is one of those detailed ones, and I think that is why I get to \nspeak on it. It is more the accounting type of thing. Consequently, \nmost people will not be able to understand the implications or even how \nit operates other than in general details, and I am including myself in \nthat.\n  I must admit that as chairman of the Securities and Investment \nSubcommittee of the Banking Committee, I have encountered especially \ncomplex market structure orders. However, the issue of derivatives goes \nbeyond those issues. This may have been the most complicated matter I \nhave looked at since I have been in the Senate.\n  Nobody really knows what a derivative is, including myself. They are \nvery complicated, tailored instruments, each one being unique, which \nexplains why, from the beginning of the trading of derivatives, it has \nbeen deregulated. It has never been regulated. In very basic terms, the \nselling of derivatives is a way for companies that cannot afford risk \nto pass it on to companies that are willing to accept the risk, to buy \nthe risk. It is a form of corporate insurance. However, beyond this \nsimple definition, the experts should be left to structure and \nnegotiate the instruments. I want to mention that each instrument is \nunique. That is why it is not traded on the stock market. However, \nbeyond this simple definition, we do need to leave it to the \nprofessionals, the ones who understand how this works. And there are \nprofessionals out there working on it.\n\n  While the amendment before us is very similar to last year's \namendment, the changes made to the amendment do not completely solve \nthe underlying problems. In fact, the amendment may have cause for \ngreater confusion as to the jurisdiction of derivatives between the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  In 2000, during the debate on the Commodity Futures Modernization \nAct, we discussed extensively the oversight and regulation of energy \nderivatives. We concluded that the proper amount of oversight for a new \nand emerging business had been put into law. I believe we took the \nproper course. That law gave the Commodity\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\nFutures Trading Commission additional powers to regulate market \nmanipulation where appropriate.\n  One argument that was made over and over during the debates last year \nand is being made this year is that somehow the 2000 legislation \nexempted these derivatives and swaps from regulation. That argument is \nnot true. They never have been regulated. In fact, Congress acted in \npassing the Futures Trading Practice Act in 1992 to give the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission specific power to exempt these derivatives \nand swaps as being inappropriate for regulation under the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, which has the job of regulating futures--\nnot regulating tailored swaps between sophisticated customers.\n  The Congress passed the Futures Trading Practice Act in 1992 that \ndirected the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to grant these \nexemptions. Those exemptions were granted in the previous \nadministration, and the issue was not controversial until we started \nlooking for a scapegoat. Nor have these swaps and derivatives ever come \nunder Federal regulation in terms of an ongoing regulatory process.\n  Taxpayers take a dislike to the addition of programs to increase tax \nburden or regulation. This one is regulation. I am reminded of a poem \nfrom the play ``Big River'' that describes the emotions of a taxpayer. \nIt goes:\n\n     Well you sole selling no-good\n     Son-of-a-shoe-fittin' firestarter\n     I ought to tear your no-good\n     Perambulatory bone frame\n     And nail it to your government walls\n     All of you, you Bureaucrats.\n\n  There is a concern across this country for bureaucrats setting up \nregulation, particularly regulation if it is not needed and regulation \nthat is not understood by the regulators.\n  During his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last March, \nChairman Greenspan reiterated it was crucially important that Congress \nand Federal regulators permit the derivatives market to evolve amongst \nprofessionals who are the most capable of protecting themselves far \nbetter than Congress, the Federal Reserve, CFTC, or the Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency. Unfortunately, there is a considerable \ndownside for the Federal Government to get involved where the \nindividual private parties are already looking at the economic events \nof their trading partners.\n\n  With respect to the Enron matter, there is no indication that the \ntrading of energy derivatives contributed in any way to the collapse of \nEnron. Proponents of the amendment argue that Enron had such a large \nmarket share of this business that they were able to have undue \ninfluence over energy trading. However, to the contrary, during and \nafter Enron's collapse, there were no interruptions of trading. If it \nhad been a disaster, there would have been interruptions, but there \nwere no interruptions of trading. The market continued.\n  One fear that existed in earlier debates, and still exists today, was \nthat the CFTC did not have the regulatory power to correct abuses in \ntrading of derivatives. However, on page 43 of the Senate companion \nbill, S. 3283, to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, \nparagraph (4)(B) gives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the \npower to intervene and enforce any action where fraud is present.\n  In listening to proponents of this amendment, one would believe that \nFederal regulators were powerless in the energy trading markets. Not \nonly does the power exist, but it was strengthened in the 2000 \nlegislation by a provision written into the energy section of the bill \nin the House of Representatives. In paragraph (4)(C) is a provision \nrelating to price manipulation and that grants the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission the power to intervene in cases where price \nmanipulation occurs.\n  It should be noted that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on \nApril 9 of this year issued a ``Report on Energy Investigations,'' \nwhich details civil and criminal enforcement actions brought in energy-\nrelated markets since the passage of the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act in 2000. The powers granted to the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission appear more than sufficient to oversee market \nmanipulation and, therefore, make the unwieldy regulatory scheme \nproposed by this amendment unnecessary.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire ``Report of the Energy \nInvestigations'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Report on Energy \n                     Investigations--April 9, 2003\n\n       The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the Commission or \n     CFTC) has launched an extensive investigation of alleged \n     misconduct in energy-related markets. To date, the Commission \n     has investigated over 25 energy companies, including Enron \n     and its affiliates, interviewed or taken testimony from over \n     200 individuals and reviewed in excess of 2 million \n     documents. The Commission's efforts have already resulted in: \n     the filing of three major enforcement actions, two of which \n     were settled with civil monetary penalties totaling $25 \n     million (see discussion below in Section I); related criminal \n     filings (Section II); cooperative enforcement with Federal \n     law enforcement officers; and public outreach efforts \n     (Section IV).\n       The Commission has devoted significant resources to this \n     investigation, including committing the full-time efforts of \n     30 staff members, which represents 25 percent of its total \n     enforcement program staff. Through the first six months of \n     fiscal year 2003, above and beyond its human resource costs, \n     the Commission has spent $122,000 on expenses for its energy \n     investigation, which is 30 percent of its enforcement \n     program's total expenses during this time period. The \n     Commission estimates its total energy investigation costs for \n     the entire fiscal year should likely exceed $250,000.\n       Commission Chairman James E. Newsome, who is a member of \n     the President's Corporate Fraud Task Force, remarked in \n     connection with the commission's filing of an action against \n     two energy companies in December 2002: ``My philosophy has \n     been, and will continue to be, that the Commission has a \n     responsibility to investigate alleged wrongdoing in a \n     comprehensive and timely fashion. And, when violations are \n     found, the Commission will come down hard. Over the course of \n     the past year, the news has been peppered with admissions, \n     accusations, and speculation of wrongdoing in the energy \n     markets and, as a result, I have committed the Commission's \n     resources to finding and punishing the wrongdoers. It is my \n     belief that with the filing and simultaneous settling of this \n     enforcement action, the Commission sends a clear message to \n     all companies that engaged in similar behavior . . . a \n     message that their actions will not be tolerated and that \n     they will be prosecuted and subjected to the full \n     consequences of the law.''\n\n          I. Civil Injunctive Actions Filed by the Commission\n\n\n  A. Enron and Former Enron Vice President Charged With Manipulating \n Prices in Natural Gas Market; Enron Charged Further With Operating an \n  Illegal, Undesignated Futures Exchange and Offering Illegal Lumber \n        Futures Contracts Through Its Internet Trading Platform\n\n       On March 12, 2003, the Commission filed a complaint in \n     federal district court in Houston, Texas, charging defendants \n     Enron Corp. (Enron), an Oregon Corporation headquartered in \n     Houston, and Hunter S. Shively (Shively) of Houston, Texas, \n     with manipulation or attempted manipulation, and charging \n     Enron with operating an illegal futures exchange, and trading \n     an illegal, off-exchange agricultural futures contract.\n       Until its bankruptcy in December 2001, Enron was one of the \n     largest energy companies in the United States. Its natural \n     gas trading unit was based in Houston and managed several \n     natural gas over-the-counter (OTC) products. Enron's natural \n     gas trading unit was divided into geographical regions and \n     included a natural gas futures desk. Shively was the desk \n     manager for Enron's Central Desk from May 1999 through \n     December 2001.\n       From November 1999 through at least December 2001, Enron \n     Online (EOL) was Enron's web-based electronic trading \n     platform for wholesale energy, swaps, and other commodities, \n     including the Henry Hub (HH) natural gas next-day spot \n     contract that was delivered at the HH natural gas facility in \n     Louisiana. The HH is the delivery point for the natural gas \n     futures contract traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange \n     (NYMEX), and prices in the HH Spot Market are correlated with \n     the NYMEX natural gas futures contract. During its existence, \n     EOL became a leading platform for natural gas spot and swaps \n     trading.\n       The complaint charges that on July 19, 2001, Shively, \n     through EOL, caused Enron to purchase an extraordinarily \n     large amount of HH Spot Market natural gas within a short \n     period of time, causing artificial prices in the HH Spot \n     Market and impacting the correlated NYMEX natural gas futures \n     price.\n       The complaint also charges Enron with operating EOL as an \n     illegal futures exchange from September through December \n     2001. According to the complaint, in September 2001, Enron \n     modified EOL to effectively allow outside users to post bids \n     and offers. Enron listed at least three swaps on EOL that \n     were commodity futures contracts. The complaint further \n     alleges that with this modification, Enron was required to \n     register or designate EOL with the CFTC or notify the CFTC \n     that EOL was exempt from registration. Enron\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\n     failed to do either of these things, and the complaint \n     charges that, because of this failure, EOL operated as an \n     illegal futures exchanged.\n       Finally, the complaint charges Enron with offering an \n     illegal agricultural futures contract on EOL. According to \n     the complaint, between at least December 2000 and December \n     2001, Enron offered a product on EOL it called the US \n     Financial Lumber Swap. The complaint alleges that the EOL \n     lumber swap was an agricultural futures contract that was not \n     traded on a designated exchange or otherwise exempt, and \n     therefore was an illegal agricultural futures contract. The \n     CFTC is seeking against each defendant a permanent \n     injunction, civil monetary penalties and other remedial and \n     ancillary relief.\n\n\n  b. el paso merchant energy, l.p. settles claims under the commodity \nexchange act that it intentionally reported false natural gas price and \n volume information to energy reporting firms in an attempt to affect \n                    prices of natural gas contracts\n\n       On March 25, 2002, the Commission issued an administrative \n     order settling charges of attempted manipulation and false \n     reporting against energy company El Paso Merchant Energy, \n     L.P. (EPME), a division of El Paso Corporation (El Paso). The \n     CFTC settlement order finds that from at least June 2000 \n     through November 2001, EPME reported false natural gas \n     trading information, including price and volume information, \n     and failed to report actual trading information, to certain \n     reporting firms. According to the order, price and volume \n     information is used by the reporting firms in calculating \n     published indexes of natural gas prices for various hubs \n     throughout the United States. The order finds that EPME \n     knowingly submitted false information to the reporting firms \n     in an attempt to skew those indexes for EPME's financial \n     benefit. According to the order, natural gas futures traders \n     refer to the published indexes for price discovery and for \n     assessing price risks. The CFTC found that EPMS's false \n     reporting conduct violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).\n       The order also finds that EPME's employees provided false \n     trade data because they believed it benefited their trading \n     positions or derivative contracts. In addition, the order \n     finds that EPME did not maintain required records concerning \n     the information that it provided to the reporting firms or \n     the true source of the information related to those firms, as \n     required by Commission regulations. As a result of its \n     actions, EPME violated the CEA and Commission regulations.\n       The order further finds that EPME specifically intended to \n     report false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate market \n     information concerning, among other things, trade prices and \n     volumes, and withheld true market information, in an attempt \n     to manipulate the price of natural gas in interstate \n     commerce, and that EPME's provision of the false reports and \n     failure to report true market information were overt acts \n     that furthered the attempted manipulation. According to the \n     order, EPME's conduct constituted an attempted manipulation \n     under the CEA, which, if successful, could have affected \n     prices of NYMEX natural gas futures contracts.\n       The CFTC order imposed the following sanctions: required \n     EPME to cease and desist from further violations of the EA \n     and Regulations; required EPME and El Paso, jointly and \n     severally, to pay a civil monetary penalty of $20 milliion--\n     $10 million immediately and $10 million plus post-judgment \n     interest within three years of the entry of the order; and \n     obliged EPME and El Paso to comply with various undertakings, \n     including an undertaking to cooperate with the Commission in \n     this and related matters, including any investigations of \n     matters involving the reporting of natural gas trading \n     information.\n       EPME provided significant cooperation in the course of the \n     Commission's investigation by, among other things, conducting \n     an internal investigation through an independent law firm, \n     waiving work product privilege as to the results of that \n     investigation, and compiling and analyzing trading data \n     which detailed all reported and actual trades in the \n     natural gas markets. The Commission took that significant \n     cooperation into consideration in its decision to accept \n     EPME's settlement offer.\n\n\nc. dynegy marketing & trade and west coast llc settle claims under the \n commodity exchange act that the intentionally reported false natural \n   gas price and volume information to energy reporting firms in an \n           attempt to affect prices of natural gas contracts\n\n       On December 19, 2002, the Commission issued an \n     administrative order settling charges of attempted \n     manipulation and false reporting against energy companies \n     Dynegy Marketing & Trade (Dynegy) and West Coast Power LLC \n     (West Coast). The CFTC settlement order finds that from at \n     least January 2000 through June 2002, Dynegy and West Coast \n     reported false natural gas trading information, including \n     price and volume information, to certain reporting firms. \n     According to the order, price and volume information is used \n     by the reporting firms in calculating published surveys or \n     indexes (indexes) of natural gas prices for various hubs \n     throughout the United States. The order finds that Dynegy \n     knowingly submitted false information to the reporting firms \n     in an attempt to skew those indexes for Dynegy's financial \n     benefit. According to the order, natural gas futures traders \n     refer to the published indexes for price discovery and for \n     assessing price risks. The CFTC found that Dynegy's false \n     reporting conduct violated the CEA.\n       The order further finds that in an effort to ensure that \n     its reported information would be used by the reporting \n     firms, Dynegy caused West Coast to submit information \n     misrepresenting that West Coast was a counterparty to \n     fictitious trades. In addition, the order finds that Dynegy \n     did not maintain required records concerning the information \n     which it provided to the reporting firms or the true source \n     of the information relayed to those firms, as required by \n     Commission Regulations. As a result of their actions, \n     Respondents violated the CEA and Commission Regulations.\n       The order further finds that Respondents specifically \n     intended to report false or misleading or knowingly \n     inaccurate market information concerning, among other things, \n     trade prices and volumes, to manipulate the price of natural \n     gas in interstate commerce, and that Respondents' provision \n     of the false reports and their collusion, which was designed \n     to thwart the reporting firms' detection of the false \n     information, were overt acts that furthered the attempted \n     manipulation. According to the order, Respondents' conduct \n     constitutes an attempted manipulation under the CEA, which if \n     successful, could have affected prices of NYMEX natural gas \n     futures contracts.\n       The CFTC order imposed the following sanctions: required \n     Dynegy and West Coast to cease and desist from further \n     violations of the CEA and Regulations; required Dynegy and \n     West Coast, jointly and severally, to pay a civil monetary \n     of $5,000,000; and obliged Dynegy and West Coast to comply \n     with their undertakings, including an undertaking to \n     cooperate with the CFTC in this and related matters.\n\n                      II. Related Criminal Actions\n\n\n  a. enron's former chief energy trader pled guilty to conspiracy to \n        commit wire fraud in scheme to manipulate energy market\n\n       On October 17, 2002 the Office of the United States \n     Attorney for the Northern District of California announced \n     that Timothy N. Belden, who was Enron's Chief Energy Trader, \n     had agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud \n     in a scheme with others at Enron to manipulate California's \n     energy market. Specifically, Belden admitted that beginning \n     in approximately 1998, and continuing through 2001, he and \n     others at Enron conspired to manipulate the energy markets in \n     California by: (1) misrepresenting the nature and amount of \n     electricity Enron proposed to supply in the California \n     market, as well as the load it intended to serve; (2) \n     creating false congestion and falsely relieving that \n     congestion on California transmission lines, and otherwise \n     manipulating fees it would receive for relieving congestion; \n     (3) misrepresenting that energy was from out-of-state to \n     avoid federally approved price caps, when in fact, the energy \n     it was selling was from the State of California and had been \n     exported and re-imported; and (4) falsely represented that \n     Enron intended to supply energy and ancillary services it did \n     not in fact have and did not intend to supply. A sentencing \n     date has yet to be scheduled for Belden, but a status hearing \n     in his case is set for April 17, 2003. In announcing the plea \n     agreement, the efforts of the Commission, Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation (FBI) were recognized.\n\n\n  b. former head of enron's short-term california energy trading desk \npled guilty to criminal charges based upon his and other enron traders' \n         criminal manipulation of the california energy markets\n\n       On February 4, 2003 the Office of the United States \n     Attorney for the Northern District of California announced \n     that Jeffrey S. Richter, who was the head of Enron's Short-\n     Term California energy trading desk, had agreed to plead \n     guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a scheme with \n     others at Enron to manipulate California's energy markets and \n     also to making false statements to investigators. \n     Specifically, Belden admitted to making false statements to \n     the FBI and U.S. Attorneys Office during the continuing \n     investigation into fraudulent trading practices in those \n     markets. Specifically, Richter admitted his participation on \n     behalf of Enron in two fraudulent schemes devised by Enron \n     traders, known internally within Enron as ``Load Shift'' and \n     ``Get Shorty.'' Enron's ``Load Shift'' trading scheme \n     involved the filing of false power schedules to increase \n     prices by creating the appearance of ``congestion'' on \n     California's transmission lines, which permitted Enron to \n     profit through its ownership of transmission rights on the \n     lines and by offering to ``relieve'' the congestion through \n     subsequent schedules. Enron's ``Get Shorty'' trading scheme \n     involved the company's traders fabricated and sold \n     emergency back-up power (known as ancillary services) to \n     the California Independent Service Operator, received \n     payment, then cancelled the schedules and covered their \n     commitments by purchasing through a cheaper market closer \n     to the time of delivery. In announcing the plea agreement, \n     the efforts of the Commission, FERC, FBI, and the \n     Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice were \n     recognized.\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\n   C. Former Dynegy National gas Trader Charged Criminally Under the \n Commodity Exchange Act With Intentionally Reporting False Natural Gas \nPrice and Volume Information to Energy Reporting Firms in an Attempt to \n                 Affect Prices of Natural Gas Contracts\n\n       On January 27, 2003 the Office of the United States \n     Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, Houston \n     Division, unsealed a seven count federal indictment charging \n     Michelle Valencia, a former Senior Trader at Dynegy, with \n     three counts of false reporting under the CEA. Additionally, \n     Valencia was charged with four counts of wire fraud. The \n     indictment alleges that on three separate occasions in \n     November 2000, January 2001 and February 2001, Valencia, \n     responsible for trading natural gas through Dynegy's ``West \n     Desk'' caused the transmission of a report which include \n     price and volume data to certain publications knowing that \n     the trades had not actually occurred. In announcing the \n     indictment, the efforts of the Commission and the FBI were \n     recognized.\n\n   III. Cooperative Enforcement--Commission Seminar With Federal Law \n                 Enforcement Officers on Energy Markets\n\n       On February 12, 2003 the Commission hosted forty federal \n     criminal law enforcement officers at a cooperative \n     enforcement session on current issues in energy \n     investigations. Attending were Assistant United States \n     Attorneys, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, and United \n     States Postal Inspectors. The Commission's Division of \n     Enforcement, which coordinated the program, has been working \n     closely with other federal law enforcement officers across \n     the country on investigations of possible round-trip trading, \n     false reporting, and fraud and manipulation by energy \n     companies and their affiliates, employees and agents. The \n     meeting was designed to share expertise, and to discuss ways \n     for federal enforcers to cooperate in these inquiries.\n\n                          IV. Public Outreach\n\n       In carrying out its regulatory and enforcement \n     responsibilities under the CEA, the Commission relies upon \n     the public as an important source of information. A \n     questionnaire, available by clicking on the Enron Information \n     link on the CFTC's homepage at www.cftc.gov, has been \n     prepared by the CFTC's Division of Enforcement to assist \n     members of the public in reporting suspicious activities or \n     transactions involving Enron, its subsidiaries, affiliates, \n     or related entities. The Division is also interested in \n     receiving information relating to suspicious activities or \n     transactions that may have affect West coast electricity or \n     natural gas prices, particularly in January 2000 through \n     December 31, 2001. Interested person can also call the \n     Commission's toll-free voice mailbox and leaving relevant \n     information at (866) 616-1783.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I believe the amendment is overly broad and, \nif adopted, will likely decrease market liquidity because of increased \nlegal and transactional uncertainties. Additionally, energy companies \nmay be discouraged from using derivatives to hedge price risks, \nresulting in increased volatility in the energy markets. In the end, I \nbelieve this will hurt the very consumers the legislation seeks to \nhelp.\n  The amendment appears to grant the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission primary jurisdiction over energy derivatives, but if the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission determines that the derivative or \nfinancial instrument is not under its jurisdiction, then the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission should refer the derivative or financial \ninstrument to the appropriate Federal regulator. Unfortunately, this \nwill create great uncertainty for market participants as to which \nagency's regulatory scheme the derivative would fall under.\n  I recently was involved in some pipeline questions and ran into the \ncircular path of fingerpointing where each agency said the other agency \nand the other agency and the other agency was responsible until it \npointed back to the first agency, and nobody would look at the problem. \nThat is the kind of circular problem we are creating with this \namendment.\n  In addition, it goes without saying that Federal agencies want to \nexpand their jurisdiction and get bigger. It should be noted that while \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks to expand its authority \nto regulate these energy derivatives markets, other Federal agencies, \nparticularly the financial regulatory agencies, believe such a \nregulatory scheme would be detrimental to the market.\n  The amendment also would subject to regulation a broad class of \n``covered entities,'' including both electronic trading facilities and \n``dealer markets'' that are not otherwise trading facilities. As \ndiscussed above, this definition may be too broad as to deter \nparticipants from entering the trading markets.\n  In addition, the amendment would permit CFTC to impose notice, \nreporting, price dissemination, recordkeeping, among other \nrequirements. Not only would these requirements apply to dealer \nmarkets, but also to exemption commodity transactions on such an \nentity.\n  The secondary amendment that would exempt metals from the proposed \nregulatory scheme of the underlying amendment is not a good idea. \nCongress should be very cautious about carve-outs without fully \nunderstanding the implications. With regard to metals, Congress may \nstart down a slippery slope where this initial carve-out is for the \nmetals industry and then move on to other industries. I believe we need \nto explore this in the committees before having it considered on the \nfloor. Therefore, I urge Members to resist the free vote without \nknowing all the consequences.\n  Letters were recently sent to the Senate Energy Committee by the \nChicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the New \nYork Mercantile Exchange opposing legislation introduced this Congress \nthat is very similar to the amendment before us.\n  Various other groups have been outspoken about this amendment, \nincluding the National Mining Association, the International Swaps and \nDerivatives Association, and the Bond Market Association, just to name \na few. In addition, during last year's debate on the Energy bill, the \nPresident's working group, comprised of the Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Department of \nthe Treasury, the Chairman of the SEC, the Chairman of the CFTC, \nopposed a similar amendment and we defeated it. Individually, the \nChairman of the CFTC and the then-Chairman of the SEC sent letters \ndirectly to me opposing the energy derivative amendment.\n  On the overall topic of derivatives, Chairman Greenspan stated:\n\n       Although the benefits and costs of derivatives remain the \n     subject of spirited debate, the performance of the economy \n     and the financial system in recent years suggests that these \n     benefits have materially exceeded the costs.\n\n  If the proponents of this amendment are attempting to remedy the \nproblems caused by Enron, I do not believe this amendment will make a \ndifference to prevent future Enrons. However, if last year's Sarbanes-\nOxley Act had been in place sooner, then the corporate governance \nrequirements of the act may have served as an early warning system to \nEnron's audit committee and have covered the fraudulent activities \nearly in the process.\n  What I am saying is, we corrected the fraudulent problem. I am very \nconcerned that if we adopt this amendment, we may fundamentally change \nthe emerging derivatives market. Once the structure is in place, it may \nplace such a burden on the market participants that it may not be \nworthwhile to pursue. In addition, the amendment may have caused \nunintentional confusion as to which regulator may or may not oversee \nindividual participants or components of the marketplace. Before we \nmake any fundamental change, we should, at a minimum, try to understand \nthe ramifications first.\n  I am afraid this amendment might fit under the congressional precept \nthat if it is worth reacting to, it is worth overreacting to, and that \nis something we have to avoid if we want to make sure that the markets \ncontinue to exist. Like Chairman Greenspan, I believe the derivative \ntrading, even in the energy derivative area, has been extremely \nbeneficial to our economy and I hope we continue it.\n  I request that Members vote against the overlying amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Jack Gerard of NMA be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  National Mining Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2003.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: The National Mining association opposes \n     attempts by Senator Feinstein or Senator Levin to further \n     regulate the derivatives OTC market. Over the Counter \n     derivatives including those based on energy and metals are \n     critical risk management tools.\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\n       We appreciate Senator Reid's positive work to exclude \n     metals from the pending amendment, but continue to oppose the \n     Feinstein or Levin amendments which unnecessarily increases \n     regulation of the OTC energy derivatives.\n       Attached are additional talking points generated by us and \n     our partners in the financial community. Thank you for your \n     interest.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jack Gerard.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       The Honorable Bill Frist and the Honorable Tom Daschle: We \n     urge you to oppose any financial derivatives, energy \n     derivatives, metals derivatives and energy trading market \n     provisions contained in S. 509 that may be offered as \n     amendments by Senator Feinstein to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy \n     Act of 2003.\n       The provisions of S. 509 (introduced by Senator Feinstein \n     in March and referred to the Senate Agriculture Committee) \n     include, in addition to other problematic provisions, \n     language that would expand FERC jurisdiction, creating \n     uncertainty and unnecessary jurisdictional confusion between \n     the FERC and CFTC for financial and energy derivatives \n     transactions. The amendment also contains specific provisions \n     to expand FERC jurisdiction over ``other financial \n     transactions.'' In addition to creating legal uncertainty \n     within the OTC derivatives markets, this provision would \n     potentially call into question the CFTC's exclusive \n     jurisdiction over futures and options on futures.\n       Provisions contained in S. 509 are similar to the Feinstein \n     amendment, which was offered to last year's Senate energy \n     bill. The amendment was defeated in a cloture motion on April \n     10, 2002. In addition, key financial regulators have also \n     opposed these types of provisions. The Chairman of the Board \n     of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission, collectively known as the President's Working \n     Group on Financial Markets (PWG), all opposed earlier \n     versions of the proposed legislation.\n       We ask that you preserve the legal activity achieved with \n     passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 \n     and oppose any amendments relating to financial derivatives \n     and the energy trading markets.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Bankers Association, ABA Securities Association, \n           Association for Financial Professionals, The Bond \n           Market Association, Emerging Markets Trade Association, \n           Financial Services Roundtable, The Foreign Exchange \n           Committee, Futures Industry Association, International \n           Swaps and Derivatives Association, Managed Funds \n           Association, National Mining Association, Securities \n           Industry Association.\n\n\n                        1. what are derivatives?\n\n       The term ``derivatives'' refers to a wide array of \n     privately negotiated over-the-counter (``OTC'') and exchange \n     traded transactions. Over the last decade, OTC derivatives \n     transactions have grown to include not only interest rate and \n     currency swaps, but also interest rate caps, collars and \n     floors, swap options, commodity price swaps, equity swaps, \n     credit derivatives, weather derivatives and other financial \n     derivative products.\n\n\n                2. what is the over-the-counter market?\n\n       The OTC market is the principals' market whereby business \n     is transacted directly between the buyer and seller. There is \n     no middleman, exchange or clearinghouse involved. The OTC \n     market now sees most of the derivative activity, and dwarfs \n     the exchanges.\n\n\n                  3. why do companies use derivatives?\n\n       Companies use derivatives to manage risk and enhance profit \n     potential. Derivatives have been around since the 1970s and \n     generally have been regarded as efficient tools that lend \n     stability to business operations. Corporations typically use \n     them to reduce risk from swings in currency values or \n     interest rate movements.\n\n\n          4. are derivatives important to the mining industry?\n\n       Since 1974, when the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) was \n     enacted by Congress, derivatives have become very important \n     to the metals mining industry as a method to protect against \n     market volatility. Many of these products did not exist when \n     the Act was first adopted. These derivatives play a key role \n     in the metals hedging programs that gold producers have used \n     in periods of declining gold prices to sell their production \n     forward. Miners of other metals commodities also use \n     derivatives to manage the risk of fluctuating prices. Since \n     their creation, these metals derivatives products have always \n     been sold over-the-counter, mainly because the transactions \n     occur between or among large institutions and high worth \n     companies and the products can be customized for the \n     particular needs of the parties.\n\n\n         5. how have derivatives benefited market participants?\n\n       The growth of the derivatives market has been of \n     considerable benefit to users individually. In the gold \n     sector, central banks have been able to earn income on gold \n     holdings, while gold fabricators have been able to insulate \n     themselves from the impact of fluctuations in the price of \n     gold on their inventory holdings. Hedging has enabled \n     producers to develop new mines using project finance.\n\n\n 6. how would a company use derivatives to hedge their mine production?\n\n       A hedging program will typically include a mix of over-the-\n     counter derivative products, including ``Forward Sales'' and \n     ``Spot Deferred Contracts.'' For example, in a spot deferred \n     contract a bullion dealer borrows gold from a central bank, \n     and sells it into the spot market at a price of $350 per \n     ounce. The proceeds are placed on deposit and earn interest \n     of 4%. A fee of 1% is paid by the bullion dealer to the \n     central bank. The interest difference of 3.0% is called \n     ``contango.'' The mining company receives the original \n     proceeds from the spot sale ($350) plus the five years of \n     accrued interest ($56) for a total amount of $406 per ounce.\n\n      Talking Points for Feinstein Amendment to Senate Energy Bill\n\n       Senator Feinstein is offering an amendment to the \n     comprehensive energy bill which is now being considered on \n     the Senate floor. This amendment would subject OTC energy \n     derivatives to comprehensive, exchange-type regulation \n     including capital requirements.\n       Although Senator Feinstein has made some changes to her \n     original legislation as introduced, these are not significant \n     and do not address the concerns we have raised with you and \n     others.\n       The legislation still contains inappropriate layers of \n     regulation, including capital requirements for electronic \n     exchanges that only bring parties together and have no role \n     in any resulting transactions. This amount of regulation \n     sends the business offshore.\n       The legislation creates legal uncertainty by giving the \n     CFTC vastly expanded and undefined jurisdiction over all \n     types of commodities transactions, not just futures \n     contracts. The clarity of CFTC jurisdiction, and accompanying \n     legal certainty that transactions will not be deemed illegal \n     and voidable, created by the CFMA enacted in 2000 is \n     destroyed.\n       Legal uncertainty is compounded by the fact that FERC now \n     has a role that is supposedly dependent on whether energy is \n     actually delivered. However, the decision whether to deliver \n     energy may be made years after the transaction is entered \n     into, leaving the parties uncertain during the life of the \n     contract which agency has jurisdiction.\n       Message: Oppose the Feinstein Amendment. If action needs to \n     be taken, it should be done in a thoughtful, deliberate \n     manner through the Committee process, not as a floor \n     amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7662-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7662-S7665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF RICHARD C. WESLEY TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                           THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 220, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Richard C. \nWesley, of New York, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Second \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself time.\n  As the two distinguished Senators from New York are in the Chamber, I \nwill yield my time to them adding only this: This is a nominee to one \nof the most important courts in the country. It is actually my circuit. \nIt is a Republican nominee, nominated by a Republican President. I \npredict that the nominee is going to go through easily because, \ncontrary to the normal procedure on some of these nominees, the White \nHouse has sent up somebody who can unite us, not divide us. Usually \nthey send nominees who divide us and not unite us. This is an example \nof what happens when a nominee to a powerful court is sent up who will \nunite us and not divide us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Vermont and my \ncolleague from New York in supporting the nomination of Judge Wesley.\n  I rise in enthusiastic support of Richard Wesley's nomination to the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Like most of the nominees we see, Judge Wesley has a top-flight legal \nmind and experience. He graduated from SUNY-Albany summa cum laude\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\nand from Cornell Law School. He worked in private practice for several \nyears, worked as a staffer to the minority leader of the New York State \nAssembly, and from 1983 to 1987, represented the 136th District in the \nassembly.\n  That was just after I left the assembly, so I never had the privilege \nof actually serving with him, but my former colleagues in the assembly, \nmany of whom disagreed on policy with Judge Wesley, all have spoken \nvery highly of both his capabilities and his integrity.\n  Judge Wesley has served on the State trial court in New York, the \nintermediate appellate court, and for the past 6 years on New York's \nhighest court, the court of appeals. He has the distinction of being \nappointed to the bench by both Governor Cuomo and Governor Pataki. \nClearly there is a serious history of bipartisan support.\n  His nomination has been examined by his good friend and my friend \nCongressman Reynolds, as well as by Bill Paxon. They have known him for \na very long time and vouch for him as well. I do not think Judge Wesley \nwould have gotten where he did without the push from Tom Reynolds, and \nI think we all appreciate it because we are adding a qualified person \nto the bench.\n  There is no question Judge Wesley is well-qualified, but as my \ncolleagues know, legal excellence is only one of the three criteria I \nuse when evaluating judicial nominees. I also look at diversity and \nmoderation.\n  Judge Wesley is the third Second Circuit judge we have considered \nunder the Bush administration.\n  Judge Barrington Parker, who we confirmed in 2001, is African-\nAmerican, and Judge Reena Raggi, who we confirmed in 2002, is a woman. \nSo we are doing quite well on diversity when it comes to recent \nnominations to that court.\n  Our experience with the Second Circuit on excellence and diversity is \nsimilar to our experience with the President's nominations to the other \ncircuit courts. By and large, he has done a good job bringing us well-\nqualified nominees who are not exclusively white males.\n  It is on that third prong, moderation, where we have had some \nproblems. I am pleased to say that Judge Wesley fits quite well with \nJudge Parker and Judge Raggi as being well within the mainstream.\n  I would like to read what Judge Wesley said about his own judicial \nphilosophy:\n\n       I consider myself a conservative in nature, pragmatic at \n     the same time, with a fair appreciation of judicial \n     restraint. I have always restricted myself to what I \n     understand to be the plain language of the statue and not \n     gone beyond that [because] public policy is made by the \n     legislature.\n\n  That is an honest and candid assessment of how Judge Wesley judges.\n  It is not just words. We have had nominees who have come before us \nand said that, but this is what he has done because he has a record. He \nhas had 16 years on the bench to back it up. We know Judge Wesley has \ncertain positions in which he personally believes. He has an ideology. \nThat is clear from several of the votes he took in the assembly. For \ninstance, in the assembly he voted the pro-life point of view. That is \ndifferent from mine. And, of course, I do not have a litmus test. Most \nof us do not.\n  What is abundantly clear from his record on the bench is that he can \ncheck his personal beliefs at the door and judge fairly and honestly.\n  Unlike, some of the nominees we have seen, including Bill Pryor, the \nFifth Circuit nominee whose contentious hearing is going on in the \nJudiciary Committee as we speak, there is nothing controversial about \nJudge Wesley.\n  He is best known for his thoughtful, scholarly approach that unites \njudges behind unanimous opinions.\n  He is truly a uniter, not a divider. He is a judge, not an activist. \nHe will be a credit to New York, to the Second Circuit, and to the \nSenate when we confirm him.\n  It would be my wish that this would be the character of the \nPresident's nominees. I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from \nJudge Wesley's hometown paper, the Rochester D, Democrat and \nChronicle, be printed in the Record. It says: ``Bipartisan Support?'' \nAnd then it says:\n\n       If only more judicial nominees would go as smoothly as this \n     one.\n\n  Well, I wish that would happen.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Rochester D, June 4, 2003]\n\n                          Bipartisan Support?\n\n       If only more judicial nominations would go as smoothly as \n     this one.\n       In an era in which partisan bickering over judicial \n     nominations has become almost routine, it's significant that \n     New York Appeals Court Judge Judge Richard Wesley has \n     bipartisan backing for his nomination to a federal court.\n       For the sake of the nation's judiciary, hope that Wesley's \n     easy confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee last week will become a model for handling \n     presidential nominations to federal judgeships. Wesley, a \n     resident of Livonia in Livingston County, is now virtually \n     assured of winning confirmation by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee and the full Senate when they vote on the \n     nomination.\n       Wesley's smooth sailing had a lot to do with the strong \n     support he had from Sens. Charles Schumer and Hillary \n     Clinton, both Democrats, and Republican Rep. Tom Reynolds, \n     who represents parts of this region. Wesley, appointed to \n     state courts by former Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo and \n     Republican Gov. Pataki, is a GOP conservative, who Schumer \n     described as having ``moderate views.''\n       Maybe if the Bush administration selected more judges of \n     Wesley's caliber there'd be less of the antagonism that \n     typically surrounds too many judicial nominations.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It will happen if the President truly consults with us \nand nominates judges in the mold of Judge Wesley, clearly conservative \nbut also clearly within the mainstream. It would be my hope that we \nwould not have 51 votes for many of the nominees but 100 for most all \nof the nominees, or close to it. If this President should decide to \ntreat the nominees and the rest of the country the way he is treating \nnominees in the Second Circuit, that is what would happen. That is my \nhope. That is my prayer.\n  I urge every one of my colleagues to vote for this fine addition to \nthe bench. We are all proud of him in New York State, and he will make \na great addition to the Second Circuit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from New \nYork in expressing my very strong support for the nomination of New \nYork State Court of Appeals Judge Richard C. Wesley to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  A few weeks ago, I was honored to testify before the Judiciary \nCommittee in support of this nominee because I believe then, as I do \ntoday, that he will make a fine addition to the Second Circuit and will \nserve that court with distinction. I was also pleased to see supporting \nJudge Wesley's nomination, his mother Beatrice, ``Betty'' Wesley and \nhis children Sarah and Matthew. They and his wife Kathryn are all very \nproud of him, and have every reason to be so proud.\n\n  The calls and letters of support I have received about Judge Wesley \nfrom a wide variety of distinguished members of the legal profession \nare a testament to his qualities of high intellect, judicial \ntemperament, caring for the profession and, most importantly, \ncommitment to justice.\n  Having a significant public service record is not a requirement for \nserving on our Federal judiciary. But it is very significant to note \nthat Judge Wesley has spent most of his career serving the public \ntrying to make New York a better place for our children and families.\n  He has had a distinguished academic career, graduating summa cum \nlaude from Cornell University Law School. He did have the experience in \nprivate practice and in the legislative body, the New York State \nassembly. He has served on trial and appellate New York courts.\n  In addition to performing his professional duties to the highest \nstandards, he has taken an interest and taken the time to become \ninvolved in other significant pressing problems. As a trial court \njudge, Judge Wesley instituted a felony screening program in Monroe \nCounty that reduced the delays in processing felony cases by over 60 \npercent. The program proved so successful that it served as a model for \njudicial districts across our State.\n  In 1993, he created the JUST Program, which for a decade has provided\n\n[[Page S7664]]\n\nservices to court and criminal justice agencies, again in Monroe \nCounty, to monitor preplea and presentence defendants and to provide \nalternatives, where appropriate, to incarceration.\n  I am also very impressed that Judge Wesley has been a champion for \nvictims of domestic violence. He has been in the forefront for years in \nproviding shelters for victims of domestic violence, primarily women \nand their children. He has championed their rights in court and he has \nsought to help provide the resources that would give these victims \nanother chance.\n  After 7 years on the trial court, he was appointed to the appellate \ndivision and then to New York's highest appellate court, the New York \nState Court of Appeals. Judith Kaye, the Chief Judge of that court, \ncannot say enough about Judge Wesley's contributions. I am sure he will \nbe greatly missed as he starts his new career on the Second Circuit.\n  This is a very positive nomination. He will not only make his former \ncolleagues proud and he will certainly make lawyers everywhere proud, \nbut he will especially make Western New York proud because once \nconfirmed, Judge Wesley will be the first Western New Yorker--for those \nwho are not from New York, that includes places such as Rochester, \nBuffalo, and Jamestown, places on the other end of our very diverse, \nlarge State--to be confirmed as an associate judge of the Second \nCircuit since 1974.\n  Although it is very clear that Judge Wesley and I do not agree on \nevery policy or legal issue, and I have no way of knowing how Judge \nWesley will vote when these important issues come before him, I have \nevery confidence in his professional preparation, in his temperament \nand demeanor, in his commitment to justice. He may be a conservative \nRepublican, but he is a judge and an American first.\n  I join my colleague, the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, \nin expressing the very strong wish that we could have more nominees \nlike Judge Wesley, someone who comes from a Republican President, who \nis easily confirmed by a bipartisan majority, proceeded by a unanimous \nvote in the Judiciary Committee. I predict he will be confirmed on this \nfloor unanimously. Why? Because although Judge Wesley is not of my \nparty, he may not be of my judicial philosophy, he already in his \njudicial career decided cases differently than I would have, had I been \nsitting on that bench, he is a person whom we always know will put the \ninterests of justice first, and will preside in a totally \nnonideological, nonpartisan manner. That is what every judge should be \ndoing.\n  It is certainly the responsibility of the Senate to advise and \nconsent so that our Federal judiciary, which consists of lifetime \nappointments, will be filled by people of the caliber of Judge Wesley.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are considering the \nnomination of Richard C. Wesley, who has been nominated by President \nBush to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit. He has an outstanding record of distinguished public service \nand will be a great addition to the Second Circuit.\n  Judge Wesley currently serves as an associate judge on the New York \nCourt of Appeals, the State's highest court, having been unanimously \nconfirmed by the State senate in 1997. His 16 years on the trial and \nappellate bench, plus prior service as a member of the New York State \nAssembly, has given him the experience and background to make an \noutstanding Second Circuit Judge.\n  In addition to his judicial experience, Judge Wesley has had a \ndistinguished legal career. After graduating from Cornell Law School, \nhe began his legal career in 1974 as an associate at the Pittsford, NY, \noffice of Harris, Beach and Wilcox. He achieved a partnership at Welch, \nStreb, Porter, Meyer & Wesley in Geneseo, NY, in 1977 and in 1979, \nbecame assistant counsel to the minority leader of the New York State \nAssembly in Albany. In 1983, he was elected to the New York Assembly \nhimself, representing his home district in western New York.\n  Judge Wesley began his judicial career in 1987, when he was elected \nto the Seventh Judicial District of the Supreme Court of New York. From \n1991 to 1994, he served as the supervising judge for the Criminal \nCourts within the Supreme Court, and in 1994 Governor Cuomo appointed \nhim to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in Rochester, where \nhe heard appeals of Supreme Court trial decisions from central and \nwestern New York. On December 3, 1996, Governor Pataki nominated Judge \nWesley to the New York Court of Appeals. Judge Wesley was confirmed by \na unanimous vote of the New York State Senate on January 14, 1997, and \nhas served with distinction on the State's highest court ever since. \nHis 16 years as a judge at both trial and appellate levels, plus prior \nservice as a State assemblyman in New York, have given him the \nexperience and background to make an outstanding Second Circuit judge.\n  Judge Wesley is a native of Livonia, NY, and has served his \ncommunity, State, and Nation in a variety of ways. Not only has he \nserved in his professional capacity, but also he believes in community \nservice and has been involved in community service organizations such \nas the United Church of Livonia, Chances and Changes, a community-based \norganization in Livingston County that provides safe housing to \nbattered women, and the Myers Foundation, a foundation based in his \nhometown that helps needy families in the area. Judge Wesley is also \nactive in a number of local youth sports programs and serves as a \ndriver for the Livonia Volunteer Ambulance.\n  In addition to his public and community service, Judge Wesley has \nbeen actively involved in efforts to improve the legal and judicial \nprocess. He has been a leader in numerous bar associations and law-\nrelated organizations. For example, he serves on the Cornell Law School \nAdvisory Council and the Cornell University Council, and is a Fellow of \nthe New York State Bar Foundation. In January of 1991, Judge Wesley was \nappointed by the chief administrator of the courts to be the \nsupervising judge of the Criminal Courts in the Seventh Judicial \nDistrict, and in this capacity developed case management systems that \ngreatly improved the efficiency of the court's criminal docket. These \nreforms have since served as models for other jurisdictions with heavy \ncriminal caseloads.\n  Judge Wesley comes to us highly recommended and warmly endorsed by \nhis colleagues and former colleagues on the New York State courts, \nlitigants who know him personally and have practiced in his courtrooms, \nthe president of the New York State Bar Association, community leaders \nin his hometown of Livonia, NY, Gov. George Pataki, and New York's \nattorney general, Eliot Spitzer. Let me read a few statements made by \nsome of his many supporters. Jonathan Lippmann, chief administrative \njudge of the State of New York, writes that Judge Wesley, ``has been a \nmodel of the wisdom, temperament, craftsmanship, and personal qualities \nthat make for the most outstanding judges.'' Joseph Bellacosa, dean of \nthe St. John's University Law School and a former colleague on the New \nYork Court of Appeals, writes that Judge Wesley ``is intellectually \ncurious and open to fresh ideas and insights of others, respectful of \nthe great strength derived from collegial shared wisdom of others, yet \nconfident and resolute in his personal conviction on values and \nfundamental principles. He is also a tireless worker and seeker of \nequal justice for all. He loves being a Judge and is devoted to the \nfair administration of justice under the rule of law.'' And Governor \nPataki has also written, praising Judge Wesley's excellence as an \nappellate jurist and specifically noting his ``wealth of experience, \nintellect, integrity and judicial temperament.''\n  The legal bar's wide regard for Judge Wesley is further reflected in \nhis evaluation by the American Bar Association. The ABA evaluates \njudicial nominees based on their professional qualifications, their \nintegrity, their professional competence, and their judicial \ntemperament. The ABA has bestowed upon Judge Wesley its highest rating \nof Unanimously Well Qualified.\n  The record is clear that Judge Wesley is worthy of confirmation for \nthis position of high responsibility on the Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit. I strongly support his confirmation and urge my \ncolleagues to do likewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains?\n\n[[Page S7665]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Today, we vote to confirm Richard Wesley to serve on the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Federal circuit \ncovering Vermont, New York, and Connecticut. With this confirmation we \nwill have filled the sole vacancy on this circuit court. I remember \nwhen President Clinton had multiple nominees pending before the Senate \nfor the five simultaneous vacancies that then existed. The entire \ncircuit was declared a judicial emergency by the chief judge, and he \nhad to resort to three-judge panels with only one Second Circuit judge. \nRepublicans were not moving those nominations at that time. All of the \nSenators from the Second Circuit joined together to work for their \nconfirmation, and we were finally able to confirm them all, including \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor, after significant efforts. This nomination did \nnot suffer those needless delays. With the support of Senator Schumer \nand Senator Clinton, this nomination has been considered expeditiously.\n  The Senate has already confirmed 129 judges, including 26 circuit \ncourt judges, nominated by President Bush. One hundred judicial \nnominees were confirmed when Democrats acted as the Senate majority for \n17 months from the summer of 2001 to adjournment last year. After \ntoday, 29 will have been confirmed in the other 12 months in which \nRepublicans have controlled the confirmation process under President \nBush. This total of 129 judges confirmed for President Bush is more \nconfirmations than the Republicans allowed President Clinton in all of \n1995, 1996, and 1997--the first 3 full years of his last term. In those \n3 years, the Republican leadership in the Senate allowed only 111 \njudicial nominees to be confirmed, which included only 18 circuit court \njudges. We have already exceeded that total by 15 percent and the \ncircuit court total by 40 percent with 6 months remaining to us this \nyear.\n  Today's confirmation makes the ninth court of appeals nominee \nconfirmed by the Senate just this year. That means that in the first \nhalf of this year, we have exceeded the average of seven per year \nachieved by Republican leadership from 1995 through the early part of \n2001. The Senate has now achieved more in fewer than 6 full months for \nPresident Bush than Republicans used to allow the Senate to achieve in \na full year with President Clinton. We are moving two to three times \nfaster for this President's nominees, despite the fact that the current \nappellate court nominees are more controversial, divisive, and less \nwidely supported than President Clinton's appellate court nominees \nwere.\n  If the Senate did not confirm another judicial nominee all year and \nsimply adjourned today, we would have treated President Bush more \nfairly and would have acted on more of his judicial nominees than \nRepublicans did for President Clinton in 1995-97. In addition, the \nvacancies on the Federal courts around the country are significantly \nlower than the 80 vacancies Republicans left at the end of 1997. We \ncontinue well below the 67 vacancy level that Senator Hatch used to \ncall ``full employment'' for the Federal judiciary.\n  Indeed we have reduced vacancies to their lowest level in the last 13 \nyears. So while unemployment has continued to climb for Americans to \n6.1 percent last month, the Senate has helped lower the vacancy rate in \nfederal courts to an historically low level that we have not witnessed \nin over a decade. Of course, the Senate is not adjourning for the year \nand the Judiciary Committee continues to hold hearings for Bush \njudicial nominees at between two and four times as many as he did for \nPresident Clinton's.\n  For those who are claiming that Democrats are blockading this \nPresident's judicial nominees, this is another example of how quickly \nand easily the Senate can act when we proceed cooperatively with \nconsensus nominees. The Senate's record fairly considered has been \noutstanding--especially when contrasted with the obstruction of \nPresident Clinton's moderate judicial nominees by Republicans between \n1996 and 2001.\n  I hope the White House would note the strong support for this \nconservative Republican nominee to the Second Circuit. I know my good \nfriends from New York are aware this is a case where the White House \nactually worked with them and consulted with them on a nominee. That \nhas not been the case of other parts of this country that has brought \nabout divisiveness.\n  Again I urge, and I have been urging for a little over 2 years, the \nWhite House might start a new course, one of seeking to unite and not \ndivide our judicial nominees, to have consultation, not arbitrariness, \non judicial nominees.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Richard C. Wesley, of New York, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Second Circuit? On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, my colleagues, the Senate will begin, this \nweek in the Finance Committee--on Thursday, tomorrow--marking up a \nhistoric reform piece of legislation dealing with the subject of \nMedicare and prescription drugs for our Nation's older Americans. I \nthink it is a historic opportunity for the Senate, in a bipartisan \nfashion, to come together and produce a product that is something of \nwhich we can all be proud.\n  Many Members of the Senate, when you talk about Medicare, would like \nthe Federal Government to do everything and the private sector to not \nbe\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\ninvolved at all. There are other Members, on the other hand, who would \nlike the private sector to do everything and the Federal Government to \nnot be involved at all. The answer to how we craft this legislation \nreally is by trying to combine the best of what Government can do with \nthe best of what the private sector can do.\n  My colleagues, the bill that will be brought before the committee \ntomorrow, in a bipartisan fashion, under the leadership of Chairman \nGrassley and Ranking Member Baucus, does exactly that. I would like to \ntake just a minute to try to explain what the bill will do in more \ngeneral terms so everybody can get an idea what they are going to be \nlooking at next week.\n  A Medicare beneficiary, beginning next year, will have the \nopportunity to have a prescription drug discount card. That will be \nsomething they will start with at the beginning of the year. They will \nbe able to take that card to their local drugstore and get anywhere \nfrom a 20-, 25-percent discount on the drugs they buy. In addition, we \nwill provide a subsidy to low-income seniors, in addition to that \ndiscount card, to help them buy drugs.\n  While that is happening, the Government will be engaged in trying to \nset up a process whereby, in the year 2006, Medicare beneficiaries will \nhave more choices than they would otherwise.\n  Under the principle of saying the Government should do what it does \nbest and the private sector should do what it does best, we have \nestablished in the legislation a Medicare Program that says to seniors, \nif they want to stay right where they are in traditional Medicare, they \nwill have the opportunity to do that, and they will also have the \nopportunity to get prescription drugs under their traditional Medicare \nProgram.\n  If they think that a new program being offered will be a better \nopportunity for them, they can voluntarily move into what we call \nMedicare Advantage, where they would also have access to a prescription \ndrug plan.\n\n  It is important to note that both of these opportunities, both of \nthese choices, are Government-run programs. Both of those programs will \nbe under HHS, Health and Human Services. Both of them will have the \nFederal Government supervising how the program is being run, to make \nsure no one in the private sector is scamming it or is not capable of \nproducing the programs they are saying they can produce. That is what \nGovernment can do best--as well as help pay for them.\n  If you are in traditional Medicare fee-for-service, all your doctor \nand hospital programs will be just like they are today. Then you will \nhave the opportunity to have a prescription drug program which will \nhave a standard benefit package spelled out in law. What we are talking \nabout is a program with about a $35-a-month premium, with about a $275 \ndeductible and a 50 percent coinsurance for seniors for the drugs for \nwhich they pay.\n  That is a generous plan that is very similar to what we have as \nMembers of Congress and Members of the Senate. That drug program, \nunlike the hospital and doctor benefits, will be provided by the \nprivate sector to bring about competition, to have companies come in \nand say: We will provide it at this amount. They can vary the premiums \nas long as the Federal Government would approve it. For example, \nsomeone may like a higher deductible, someone may like a lower \ndeductible. They could make those adjustments within a range, but the \nGovernment would have to make sure that is acceptable and that is \napproved by HHS.\n  If a senior--for example, most younger seniors and seniors going into \nthe program in the future--would like to go into that type of program \nfor everything--for doctors and hospitals and for drugs--if they think \nthat is the good program for them, that gives them choice, they will \nstart selecting the Medicare Advantage Program where they will get \ndoctor coverage, hospital coverage, and prescription drug coverage.\n  This will still be in HHS, but it will be run by a new, competitive \nagency within HHS--not micromanaged, not price fixing, as we have now, \nbut a new, competitive agency within HHS which will be created in order \nto make sure that the new program is being run properly. It will be run \nvery similarly to how our program is run that is for Federal employees. \nWe have Federal health insurance, but they use a private delivery \nsystem, and the Government makes sure everybody follows the rules and \nthat there is competition, there is choice--that some plans may be \nbetter than others--and they have an opportunity, every year, to take a \nlook at what is being offered; and sometimes they will pick this plan, \nsometimes they may pick another plan, but they will have the choice to \npick the plan that is best for them.\n  So I think, in summary, what we have before the committee is a plan \nthat combines the best of what the Government can do with the best of \nwhat the private sector can do. The programs will still be under Health \nand Human Services, whether you take this plan or that plan.\n  I think when you have private companies competing, you will have \nprivate companies that will be more involved in doing risk management \nand preventive medicine, preventive health services for the individuals \nwho are involved. The Federal Government does not do any of that.\n  We simply fix prices and we do nothing with regard to risk management \nor preventive health care. So we will have an intense debate. We will \nhave a markup in the Finance Committee on Thursday. Then this bill will \ncome to the floor.\n  I think we will have an opportunity to do something that I think, for \nthe first time, gives seniors an opportunity to have a federally run \nprogram that provides private sector delivery, with choices that will \nbenefit seniors. I think in the long term it will benefit all of us who \nare concerned about this.\n  I commend Senator Baucus for his work and for working with the \nchairman, Senator Grassley, in putting together this package. The only \nway it is going to get done is bipartisan. Some will argue it is not \nenough, and I understand that, but this is 100 percent more than \nseniors have today. Congress should not walk away from a $400 billion \nprogram for providing prescription drugs to seniors because it is not \nmore money, because that simply is not looking at what is possible and \nwhat is likely to happen in the real world.\n  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I encourage my colleagues \nto work with us to produce this package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate a moment to have a chance \nto give an alternative view. I thank my colleague from Louisiana. He \nhas worked diligently on the issue of prescription drug coverage for \nmany years, as have other of my colleagues on the floor regarding this \nissue. I wish to take this moment following his presentation to speak \nto the fact that there is much work left to be done by this body before \nwe have prescription drug coverage that in fact meets the needs and the \ndesires of the seniors of America.\n  The plan being put forward tomorrow in the Finance Committee \nbasically does two things. It offers two structures. The majority of \nthose supporting it will openly indicate that they would prefer that \nthe seniors of America go into managed care rather than stay in \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare, where the senior determines their \ndoctor, pharmacy, and other choices.\n  There is a desire to move people into what are called PPOs and HMOs \nand other managed care. We have experience with this because, since \n1997, there has been the choice on behalf of American seniors to stay \nin traditional Medicare, choose their own doctor and pharmacies, and so \non, or to go into a Medicare HMO. We know as of today that 89 percent \nof the seniors who chose--they made their choice--have chosen to remain \nin traditional Medicare, which I believe is a very strong message about \nthe confidence seniors have in the current system, the stability of it, \nthe dependability of it. They know what the premium is, they know what \nthe services are, and they decide their doctor. This has been in place \nand serving the seniors of the country since 1965.\n  So the plan the committee is intending to report out tomorrow would \ncreate more choices of HMOs and PPOs and other managed care, and I \nsupport that for seniors. But what it does not do is add a prescription \ndrug benefit\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\nunder traditional Medicare as an integrated part of the traditional \nfee-for-service Medicare.\n  All of the prescription drug plans that are part of this report \ntomorrow involve private insurance first. If private insurance is \navailable in your State, or available in the region, if there are two \nor more companies there, regardless of the premium they choose, the \nbenefits they choose, and how they structure it, the pharmacies that \nthey will let you go to, however they structure it, you would have to \nchoose one of those two private insurance plans.\n  Now, technically, they are saying it is under Medicare but this is \nnot a Medicare prescription drug benefit as the seniors of the country \nhave asked to have provided to them. The seniors, potentially every \nyear, would get paperwork in the mail about two different insurance \ncompanies--if that is available in their area--and they would have to \nwade through the paperwork and decide which of the two is best for \nthem. The next year, if those two companies were not both available--if \nthere was only two and one decided it didn't want to cover seniors \nanymore; it was too costly--then there would only be one insurance \ncompany; and the senior would have the ability, then, to go to a backup \nplan--something administered through Medicare.\n  Then the next year, if there were two companies that decided they \nwanted to try their hand in covering Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage in their region, they could not get the Medicare plan anymore; \nthey would have to pick between those two companies.\n  Potentially, this could happen every single year for a senior. \nSeniors are not asking for more paperwork or more choices of insurance \ncompanies. They already picked--89 percent of them--traditional \nMedicare, run through Medicare. Yet we are not giving 89 percent of \nthem that choice.\n  That is a major concern I have about this plan. There is a better way \nto do this, to give people more choices, but make sure one of the \nchoices is traditional Medicare.\n  I find it quite amazing that we are even talking about the \nstructuring of a plan in this way at this time when we look at the fact \nthat Medicare has been rising in cost about 5 percent a year and \nprivate insurance is going up 15 to 20 percent a year. In fact, I have \nsmall businesses, as well as large businesses, including auto \nmanufacturers and many others, coming to me concerned about the \nexplosion in their private health insurance premiums every year instead \nof choosing an approach that costs less so we can take some of those \npressures off and put them into the best benefit, the best way to \nprovide medicine for seniors. This approach uses what is a more \nexpensive model--arguably, putting more dollars into the pockets of \ninsurance companies but certainly not more dollars into the pockets of \nour senior citizens in the form of access to more lower cost medicines.\n  This is a deep concern of mine. Why are we going through all this \nconvoluted process? Well, I think there are two reasons. One is there \nare those who philosophically believe we should move to private \ninsurance, managed care. I respect that. I have a disagreement with \nthat but I respect the philosophical difference. Some don't believe we \nshould have universal health coverage under Medicare. I disagree.\n  I think Medicare has been a great American success story since 1965. \nIn fact, it is the one part of the universal health care we have in \nthis country, and it concerns me deeply if we are going to roll that \nback. There is a difference in philosophy--and I appreciate that--on \nthe part of colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  We know there is something else at work here, and that is a very \nlarge and powerful prescription drug lobby, which I believe, at all \ncosts, wants to make sure our seniors are not in one insurance plan \ntogether--40 million seniors and disabled people in our country, who \nwould then be able to negotiate big discounts in prices. By dividing \nfolks up into lots of different insurance plans, making it more \nconfusing for people to stay in traditional Medicare and get \nprescription drug help, and trying in every way to move people more to \nmanaged care, the prescription drug companies know they will not be put \nin a position of having to substantially lower their prices for our \nseniors. I have deep concerns about this. I agree with my colleagues \nthat we have to work together in a bipartisan way if we are going to \nput forward a bill. I am hopeful that through amendments we can, in \nfact, provide a better bill. I will be offering an amendment that will \nset up a real choice for seniors, allow them prescription drug coverage \nunder Medicare, which is what they want, and then also allow the other \noptions colleagues have put together in the legislation that will be in \nfront of us.\n\n  I believe that is a true choice, and I believe it is a choice that \nwill allow prescription drug prices to go down, and that is a more \ncost-effective choice overall for Medicare as a system as well as for \nour seniors.\n  I will also be working with colleagues, as we have been for the last \n2 years, on other efforts to lower prices for everyone. I am very proud \nof the fact that on this side of the aisle, we have brought the issue \nto this Chamber of lowering prices through greater competition in the \nmarketplace and, in fact, we are seeing headway in that area.\n  I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been \ncoming together in agreement on the issue of generic drugs. I commend \nthe leader of the HELP Committee, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg, for his leadership, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, \nand the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, who helped lead this effort \nwith Senator McCain to close loopholes that have allowed brand-name \ncompanies essentially to game the system, to keep lower cost medicine \noff the market, unadvertised brands called generics.\n  There is a coming together that is very positive and bipartisan to \npass legislation to close loopholes and allow greater competition. I \nbelieve this is one of the most important ways we will, in fact, lower \nprices more than anything else to get more competition for unadvertised \nbrands in the marketplace.\n  There are two other issues about which we have been offering \namendments that I encourage colleagues to support as a part of this \nprocess. One is to open the border to Canada for prescription drug \ncoverage. From the State of Michigan, it is frustrating for the \nseniors, families and, in fact, the businesses in Michigan to literally \nlook across the river and know that on the other side of that river \nthey can get their American-made prescriptions at half the price and, \nin some cases, at even deeper discounts.\n  I urge we come together and open the border to Canada, and for \ncolleagues who have resisted that, I ask that we look between now and \n2006, when the prescription drug bill takes effect, at the idea of a \npilot project of opening the border to Canada until 2006 so that we can \ndrop prices immediately.\n  Our seniors have waited long enough. They do not need to wait another \n2\\1/2\\, 3 years to see prices go down and Medicare help come. Let's \nopen the border now. Let's sunset the pilot project when this bill \ntakes effect, and then we can evaluate any concerns that have been \nraised about that process. That is something we can do right now that \nwould have 10 times the effect of lowering prices than another discount \ncard for seniors.\n  The other issue I am hopeful we can support on a bipartisan basis is \nto support States that are being creative in their purchasing power to \nget discounts for their citizens; efforts such as in the State of Maine \nto use their discount power to lower prices for the uninsured.\n  There are very positive steps we can take together. The generic drugs \nbill is a very positive initiative. I appreciate the leadership on both \nsides of the aisle for bringing that forward and coming together in a \npositive way.\n  To conclude, when it comes to Medicare prescription drug coverage, I \nremain deeply concerned about the direction in which we are going. I \nbelieve we are moving in a direction that actually dismantles the only \npart of universal care we have; that, in fact, will end up with more \nsubsidies and more money in the pockets of insurance companies and drug \ncompanies as opposed to putting money in the pockets of our seniors who \ndesperately need help with their prescription drugs.\n  I hope that as we enter into amendments in the next week, we will \ncome together in a way that improves this\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\nbill and strengthens it, keeping in mind that our first priority should \nbe the people right now who need the help. We can do that if we are \nwilling to work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lautenberg are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 876\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues \nto oppose the amendment of the senior Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein.\n  First, I address the second-degree amendment the senior Senator from \nNevada, Senator Reid, is offering. I encourage my colleagues to oppose \nthis second-degree amendment, also. The Reid second-degree amendment \nwould exempt derivative contracts on precious metals from the new \nregulatory scheme the Feinstein amendment creates. We are told the \nFeinstein amendment is necessary to avoid the manipulation of markets \nfor commodities that are in limited supply like oil or metals.\n  Underpinning the Feinstein amendment is the belief the Enron debacle \nand the California energy crisis occurred because there was \ninsufficient regulation and wrongdoers were able to accomplish massive \nfrauds and manipulation. The Feinstein amendment is intended to close \nthe alleged regulatory loophole for off-exchange transactions for \nexempt commodities.\n  Assume, only for argument's sake, that Senator Feinstein is correct. \nAssume the regulatory regime established only 2\\1/2\\ years ago is \ninsufficient and that we must close a so-called regulatory loophole. If \nyou believe this and support the Feinstein amendment, you must \nnecessarily oppose the Reid second-degree amendment, which will carve a \nvast number of derivative contracts out of the regulatory scheme the \nFeinstein amendment creates.\n  I don't believe we can have it both ways. What is necessary for the \nenergy markets is necessary for the metals markets. I encourage my \ncolleagues to oppose both the Reid second-degree amendment and the \nFeinstein amendment as unnecessary, redundant, and potentially \ndestabilizing to our financial markets. I encourage my colleagues who \nfeel compelled to support the Feinstein amendment to not support the \nReid amendment, which is at direct cross-purposes to the underlying \namendment.\n  Less than 3 years ago, in December 2000, Congress enacted the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which was landmark \nlegislation that provided legal certainty regarding the regulatory \nstatus of derivatives. Passage of the modernization act was the result \nof many months of analysis of the role that derivatives play in the \nmarketplace and the consequences of increased regulation. In fact, \nbecause the modernization act addressed derivative products pertaining \nto commodities and financial products, both the Agriculture Committee \nand Banking Committee held numerous hearings to help Members and the \npublic better understand the role the various derivative financial \ninstruments and contracts played in our economy and what regulatory \nlandscape, if any, is appropriate.\n  Now, only 3 years after enactment of the modernization act, Senator \nFeinstein's amendment proposes fundamental changes to the law. I \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nthis amendment could create many regulatory problems, including \ncreating jurisdictional confusion between the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, \nimposing problematic capital requirements on facilities trading \nderivatives, and impugning the legal certainty of OTC derivatives put \nin place in 2000.\n  I am concerned this body does not have full appreciation of these \nconsequences and potential unintended consequences that will likely \nfollow if we were to adopt the Feinstein amendment.\n  I also believe it is premature to adopt this amendment because we \nhave simply not had enough time to review the results of the \nmodernization act. We have not received any reports from the CFTC \ndetailing shortfalls in the regulatory authority conferred by the \nmodernization act or recommendations requesting broader authority over \nderivatives. In fact, the CFTC had brought several major cases \ninvolving market manipulation since the passage of the modernization \nact. Congress should have more than a 2-year record before it decides \nto make rash but fundamental changes to legislation that was the \nproduct of so much deliberation a short time ago.\n  Proponents of the Feinstein amendment argue that the collapse of \nEnron and the disruption of the California energy market are prime \nexamples of the need for greater regulation of derivatives. This \nassertion is simply not true. Enron collapsed as a result of deceptive \naccounting practices involving special purpose entities and poor \ncorporate governance practices that permitted abusive business \npractices. Congress addressed such abuses in last year's Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct. More importantly, Enron's derivative business was in operation \nprior to enactment of the Modernization Act and was one of the business \nlines that retained value for sale after the collapse when most others \ndidn't.\n\n  Further, FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recently \nconcluded a year-long review of potential manipulation of electric and \nnatural gas prices in the Western markets. Although FERC did find \nmarket manipulation, it also concluded:\n\n       Significant supply shortfalls and a fatally flawed market \n     design were the root causes of the California market \n     meltdown.\n\n  In short, it was lack of energy supplies and poor State regulations \nthat caused the disruption. I fear that the adoption of the Feinstein \namendment could lead to uninformed and premature changes to the \ncarefully considered provisions of the Modernization Act.\n  I believe the Feinstein amendment proposes unnecessary regulatory \nmeasures and significantly undermines the legal certainty achieved in \nthe Modernization Act. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Feinstein amendment.\n  The President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which is \ncomprised of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nand the Chairman of the CFTC, will be sending a letter today expressing \nits concerns with this amendment and urging Congress to carefully \nconsider the potential unintended consequences of the amendment before \nacting. I intend to submit this letter for the Record when I receive \nit. I anticipate this letter will raise the same concerns that were \nraised in the working group's letter last year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nShelby, my committee chairman on the Banking Committee as well, in \nopposing the Feinstein amendment. This amendment was debated at length \nabout a year ago during the previous Senate Energy bill debate. At that \ntime, Senator Phil Gramm raised a number of issues, a number of \nconcerns with the legislation. He said a great many wise and \ncommonsense things. One of the perspectives that he pointed out that \nstuck with me was noting that, in raising concerns about failures, \ncompanies that had gone bankrupt such as Long Term Capital Management, \nor perhaps closer to home for the Senator from California, the \nbankruptcy of Orange County, CA, that involved to a certain extent \nderivatives and then called for regulation--we were, in effect, blaming \nthe instrument itself, blaming the derivative, which is a little bit \nlike blaming a thermometer for a warm day. That is not the right \napproach for legislation and I think it will lead us to bad conclusions \nin trying to structure legislation that will strengthen financial \nmarkets.\n  As the Senator from Alabama indicated, at the root is our concern \nthat we not pass legislation that has unintended consequences, not pass \nlegislation that is counterproductive, and rather than strengthen the \nmarkets or increase confidence in markets, actually has the opposite \neffect.\n  This legislation would give a great deal of new power to FERC, which \nis a concern to me because that would be power given over to the FERC \nnot just to regulate but really to arbitrate, to refer claims to \ndifferent regulatory authorities. On its face, I ask whether FERC has \nthe expertise or the knowledge in all of these sophisticated markets to \nmake such decisions. It is, perhaps, a power best not given to FERC. \nBut it is also a power, in referring and making these decisions as to \nwhich regulatory body a particular claim or complaint would go, that \nwould have the effect of creating uncertainty, uncertainty as to which \norganization had regulatory oversight.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and FERC already coordinate \ntheir enforcement with respect to the energy markets. The CFTC has \nsubpoena power. I think, as a number of other speakers indicated, in \nthe year 2000 there was a Commodity Futures Modernization Act that was \npassed that was a good piece of legislation. A lot of work went into \nthat. It drew from recommendations made by the President's working \ngroup. In particular, it strengthened the CFTC's hand in regulation in \na number of areas.\n  I certainly do not think offering an amendment at this time on this \nparticular bill is the appropriate way to modify that legislation, the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act, that was a product of extended \nnegotiations. The piece of legislation such as being offered by the \nSenator from California ought to go through the regular committee \nprocess. We ought to have hearings on it and certainly we ought to have \nan opportunity to debate it in the key area of the Banking Committee \nand Agriculture Committee jurisdictions.\n  Of particular interest as well is the fact that this amendment is \nopposed by a number of organizations, a number of the regulators \nthemselves who are most concerned with stability and confidence in the \nmarkets--by the Fed, by the SEC, and by the CFTC. Even though this bill \ngives additional powers to the CFTC, they still oppose it. It is not \noften in Washington you have someone opposing an effort to give them \nmore power and more jurisdiction, but these very organizations are \nworried every day about safety and soundness, about regulatory clarity, \nabout ensuring a greater degree of stability and solvency in the \nmarketplace. Why would they oppose this effort, to give more regulatory \npower to them or to their sister organizations?\n\n  I believe it is in part because of their concern that this might have \nunintended consequences, that this, unfortunately, might add \nuncertainty to the markets, that this might stifle transactions that so \noften act to reduce the risk in the marketplace.\n  Particularly telling is the fact that an amendment is being offered \nto strike the coverage of various metals from this provision. \nObviously, someone recognizes that this might not be good, might not be \nhealthy for a particular area of our economy, of the derivatives \nexchanges, and therefore wants to protect them from the uncertainty and \nthe instability I have described.\n  Unintended consequences, we have to be so careful about exactly in an \nexample such as this. These derivative markets are so complicated so \nthe potential to have unintended consequences is effectively magnified \nby our collective lack of knowledge. There are some Senators who know \nmore than others about these markets. The Senator from California has \nspent more time than others debating and discussing these issues. But \nany time we venture into\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\nan area of such complexity we enhance the risk that a piece of \nlegislation will have unintended consequences.\n  I certainly do not fault the intentions or question the intentions or \nthe motives in offering the legislation. We share the goals of ensuring \nthat we have good regulatory agencies with appropriate enforcement \npowers, but we also should be careful that we not disturb a market \nwhich I believe functions extremely efficiently. As complex as it is, \nand as large as it is--I have seen estimates of the size of the global \nderivatives market as high as $75 trillion--as large as that market is, \nit works very effectively.\n  These are not products that are sold on any exchanges and there is a \nreason for that. The principal reason is that they are unique. They are \nunique to the organizations that seek them out. The vast majority of \nthese organizations seek out a particular swap or derivative \ntransaction in order to reduce the risk they are exposed to at any \ngiven day. That is why these instruments were developed and exist in \nsuch great numbers in the first place. Companies, institutions, \nfinancial service companies, banks--they seek out these derivatives to \nreduce their exposure to risk. When they are able to do that, they \nensure greater stability, they ensure greater certainty for their \ninvestors, and it has the effect of, obviously, making our markets \nstronger. And helping our economy to grow.\n\n  We have exercised great caution before stepping forward and trying to \nsubstitute some kind of new regulatory regime when a market is \nfunctioning this effectively and arguably enforcing its own level of \ndiscipline in the way that it functions. What kind of discipline is \nthat? If I am going to engage in an interest rate swap, or some other \nderivative transaction with a financial institution, rest assured that \nI as an investor or as a counter-party to that transaction am going to \nwant to know a great deal about the solvency, the exposure to other \nrisks, exposure to interest rate changes, and exposure to different \nportions of our economy with which that institution I am engaging with \nin a transaction is dealing.\n  There is a level of inspection and a level of due diligence that \ntakes place in this marketplace every single day, which I might argue \nis more detailed and more thorough and more consistent than any \ngovernment regulatory agency could ever provide.\n  I believe we should oppose this amendment because it hasn't gone \nthrough the regular order because it attempts to impose a level of \nregulation that might well be counterproductive, that might increase \nthe level of uncertainty in certain areas where jurisdiction is \nconcerned, and that springs from a concern that somehow the derivatives \nthemselves--the instruments themselves--are to blame rather than \nmanagers who have made some very bad decisions.\n  Derivatives didn't cause the energy crisis in California. Derivatives \ndidn't cause the collapse of Enron. Managers making bad decisions did. \nIn some cases, managers engaging in fraudulent behavior did. Certainly \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission has the power to go after \ncases where fraud or price manipulation are concerned. They are \ncompletely empowered to do just that.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote against the amendment, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to use this time to \nrespond to some of the comments that have been made.\n  It is really a misconception to think this is an amendment against \nderivatives. This isn't an amendment against derivatives. I have never \nsaid derivatives caused the western energy crisis. What I said was that \nthere is a loophole in the law: Where all other finite commodities, \nexcept for energy and metals, have certain regulations with respect to \ntransparency, these particular finite commodities do not; and that \ncertain traders use this loophole to practice, if you will, a kind of \nfraud in their trading. The fraud was to artificially find ways to \nboost their products. I wish to respond to that.\n  Let's go into one of the ways they proceeded to do this--through what \nis called a round trip or a wash trade. Yesterday on the floor, Senator \nFitzgerald and I, as well, very clearly pointed out what a wash trade \nis: I sell you a finite commodity, and you sell that same commodity \nback to me. On our balance sheets, we both carry a sale. Yet nothing \never changes hands. What we are saying is that this should be an \nillegal practice. What we are saying is that, at the very least, it \nought to have transparency to it. We ought to be required to keep a \nrecord, to have an audit trail, and to have anti-fraud and anti-\nmanipulation oversight of these practices by the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission.\n  What we more fundamentally say is that a great deal of this was done \nin the western energy crisis through electronic trading.\n  Madam President, I understand I have the right to modify the \namendment. Is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 876, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to send a modified \namendment to the desk. That modified amendment contains an additional \ncosponsor, Senator Kennedy. The modified amendment makes two changes to \nthe amendment which I submitted before. The first change is to be \nabsolutely crystal clear that this does not affect financial \nderivatives. I said that in my comments yesterday. I say it again \ntoday. To make it crystal clear, because some are concerned, and say, \n``Oh, well, this will upset the financial derivatives marketplace,'' \nthis is not the intent. It would only apply to finite commodities.\n  Right upfront, we are clearly saying that this title shall not apply \nto financial derivatives trading.\n  The other change to this amendment simply takes Senator Reid's \namendment to exclude metals and adds this to this bill.\n  If I may, I send that amendment, as a modified, to the desk at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment (No. 876), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE____--ENERGY MARKET OVERSIGHT\n\n     SEC. ____01.

Madam President, once again, what we are seeking to \ndo is close a loophole that was created in 2000 when this Congress \npassed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. That act exempted just \nenergy and metals. It was not the intention actually to do that. The \nSenate part of that bill did not exempt them. What happened was Enron \nwent to the House and Enron secured an exemption of energy and metals \nin the House. That exemption was handled in the conference, and the \nSenate language was not in the bill.\n  The exemption was effectively created. The loophole was created. We \nare just trying to eliminate that loophole. We are not attacking \nderivatives. All we are saying is: If you do this kind of trading, you \nmust keep a record just as anybody else does. You must be transparent. \nYou must have an audit trail, and you are subject to any fraud or \nmanipulation oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  This is where it gets a little complicated. If I sell energy to you \nand you deliver, then that is covered by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. If I sell energy to you and you sell it to a third person \nor entity that sells it to a fourth entity that sells it to a fifth \nentity and then it goes into the field, those interim trades are not \ncovered.\n  That is what we seek to cover because that is where the games exist. \nIt is a rather subtle point, but it is also an important point.\n  I heard people say that this will stifle the market. I will tell you \nwhat has been happening out there. Without transparency and without \nrecord keeping stifles the market.\n  When Mr. Fortney was arrested last week for creating schemes such as \nRicochet, Death Star, and Get Shorty, you don't think that stifles the \nmarket when you have other traders pleading guilty to fraud and wire \nfraud?\n  Does that not stifle the market? And does that not give the average \nconsumer the belief that they cannot trust this marketplace as being \nfair and transparent? I believe it does. More fundamentally, I believe \nthe rules that govern the marketplace should be rules to protect the \naverage consumer, not the big boys; they can take care of themselves. \nBut the average consumer has to have confidence in the marketplace that \nit is fair and that it is transparent.\n  I would like to correct the idea that this amendment has not gone \nthrough regular order. I moved this amendment last year to the Energy \nbill. Senator Gramm of Texas, who, incidentally, subsequently went to \nwork for EnronOnline in its new life with UBS Warburg--which is fine--\nargued against my amendment. We tried to settle our differences. It \ntook quite some time. We could not settle our differences on this \namendment, and we did have a vote.\n  Another reason for the vote is there were people who believed this \nhad not had enough committee hearing. So we had a vote, and I think we \ngot 48 votes. The amendment went to the Agriculture Committee. The \nAgriculture Committee held hearings. The staff of both sides reviewed \nthe legislation. Senator Harkin, who was chairman, and Senator Lugar, \nwho was ranking member, are both cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The problem is, the end of the session came without a markup, so this \nis really the opportunity we have to place this amendment into some \nform of law, and so we take this opportunity.\n  I also wish to say that the President's working group in 1999, in \ntheir report--this was before the Commodity Futures Modernization Act \nof 2000--very specifically said, on page 2 of their report, that:\n\n       An exclusion from the CEA [Commodities Exchange Act] for \n     electronic trading systems for derivatives, provided that the \n     systems limit participation to sophisticated counterparties \n     trading for their own accounts and are not used to trade \n     contracts that involve non-financial commodities with finite \n     supplies. . . .\n\n  In other words, they are saying that commodities with finite supplies \nshould be included in the bill, but they are recommending that those \nthat do not have finite supplies, such as financials derivatives, not \nbe included in the bill. Now, apparently, they are changing their \nposition. But I want to make very clear that was the position of the \n``Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act, \nReport of The President's Working Group on Financial Markets'' dated \nNovember 1999. And the Senate version of the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act actually did just what this working group stated.\n  Again, to refute the allegation that I am in some way blaming \nderivatives for the western energy crisis--I am not--I am blaming this \nloophole which allows all this secret trading, which we have seen \nresult in fraudulent schemes, to try to close that loophole. And the \nway to close it is to bring the light of day to it. That is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  I pointed out yesterday, because some people said, well, we need to \nstudy this more, that it has been studied more and that the ``Final \nReport On Price Manipulation In Western Markets, Fact-Finding \nInvestigation Of Potential Manipulation Of Electric And Natural Gas \nPrices,'' which was prepared by the staff of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and dated March 2003, says the following as one \nof their recommendations:\n\n       Recommend that Congress consider giving direct authority to \n     a Federal agency to ensure that electronic trading platforms \n     for wholesale sales of electric energy and natural gas in \n     interstate commerce are monitored--\n\n  That is what we do--\n\n     and provide market information that is necessary for price \n     discovery in competitive energy markets.\n\n  That is exactly what this does, as recommended by this report of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  With the modification I made, metals will have the same level of \noversight as exists under current law today.\n  Now, let me go back again to 2000. I mentioned the change that was \nmade to accommodate Enron lobbying to the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act. It also did not take long for EnronOnline and others \nin the energy sector to take advantage of this new freedom by trading \nenergy derivatives absent any transparency or regulatory oversight. \nThus, after the 2000 legislation--and really right away--EnronOnline \nbegan to trade energy derivatives bilaterally without being subject to \nproper regulatory oversight.\n  It should not surprise anyone that without this transparency, prices \nsoared. In 2000, if Enron's derivatives business had been a stand-alone \ncompany, it would have been the 256th largest company in America. That \nyear, Enron claimed it made more money from its derivatives business--\n$7.23 billion--than Tyson Foods made from selling chicken. That is \naccording to author Robert Bryce, who wrote a book on Enron called \n``Pipe Dreams.''\n  EnronOnline rapidly became the biggest platform for electronic energy \ntrading. But unlike regulated exchanges, such as the New York \nMercantile Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board \nof Trade, EnronOnline was not registered\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\nwith the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, so it set its \nown standards. And that is the problem. Traders and others in the \nenergy sector came to rely on EnronOnline for pricing information. Yet \nthe company's control over this information, and its ability to \nmanipulate it, was large.\n  As this same author, Robert Bryce, describes--and let me quote--\n\n       Enron didn't just own the casino. On any given deal, Enron \n     could be the house, the dealer, the oddsmaker, and the guy \n     across the table you're trying to beat in diesel fuel \n     futures, gas futures, or the California electricity market.\n\n  The Electric Power Supply Association, EPSA, has sent a letter to all \nSenators asking them to oppose our oversight amendment. This should not \nbe strange to anybody because its members are exactly the same \ncompanies that are being investigated and have been investigated by \nFERC for wrongdoing in the western energy crisis. It is AES \nCorporation; it is BP Energy; it is Duke Energy; it is Mirant Energy; \nit is Reliant Energy; it is UBS Warburg, which purchased Enron's \ntrading unit; and it is Williams Energy. Now, with others, they are all \nmembers of EPSA, not companies that Westerners trust very much these \ndays in light of what we have been through.\n  Now, I want to just document some of this.\n  Let me quickly run through these again because, again, a lot of these \nround-trip trades were done on the Internet.\n  Other schemes were carried out on the Internet. Let's just go through \nthis. Duke Energy disclosed that $1.1 billion worth of trades were \nround trip since 1999. Roughly two-thirds of these were done on the \nIntercontinental Exchange, which is an online trading platform owned by \nthe banks, again, where there is no transparency, no net capital \nrequirements, and no recordkeeping whatsoever. Now, this also meant \nthat thousands of subscribers would have seen false price signals.\n  Why would they see false price signals? That is because of the nature \nof a wash or round-trip trade. Again, a wash or round-trip trade would \nbe that I am going to sell you energy at a certain price and you are \ngoing to sell me energy at a certain price, but no energy ever changes \nhands; yet we both post sales. That is what a wash trade or a round-\ntrip trade is.\n  A class action suit accused the El Paso Corporation of engaging in \ndozens of round-trip energy trades that artificially bolstered its \nrevenues and trading volumes over the last 2 years.\n  CMS Energy admitted conducting wash energy trades that artificially \ninflated its revenue by more than $4.4 billion. These round-trip trades \naccounted for 80 percent of their trade in 2001. So 80 percent of this \ncompany's trades in 2001--in the heart of the energy crisis--were not \ntrades at all. No energy ever traded hands. They just boosted their \nsales--artificially.\n  This is another facet of artificially filing false reports: reporting \nfictitious natural gas transactions to an industry publication. You can \nread it for yourself. The overwhelming figure in this is, if you look \nat what was done with energy and you look at California, where one year \nthe total cost of energy was $7 billion and the next year it was $28 \nbillion, which is a 400 percent increase, there is no way that could be \nlegitimate. There is no way the energy need of a State could increase \n400 percent in 1 year. Demand didn't increase 400 percent.\n  So without this type of legislation, there really is insufficient \nauthority to investigate and prevent fraud and price manipulations \nsince parties making the trade are not required to keep a record. What \nwe would require them to do is keep a record. Therefore, the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, in the event of many of these interim \ntrades, and the FERC, where energy is directly delivered as a product \nof a trade, has the ability to do the investigation based on records. \nIf you don't keep records, it is very hard to prove that.\n  I would like to repeat that this amendment does not ban trades. This \namendment does not affect financial derivatives. This amendment would \nonly require oversight and transparency for those energy trades that \nare now taking place within this loophole, and it would provide \noversight, as recommended in the FERC report.\n  We are very proud to have the support of the National Rural Electric \nCooperative Association, the Derivative Study Center, the American \nPublic Gas Association, American Public Power Association, California \nMunicipal Utilities Association, Southern California Public Power \nAuthority, Transmission Excess Policy Study Group, U.S. Public Interest \nResearch Group, Consumers Union, Consumers Federation of America, \nCalpine, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and FERC \nChairman Patrick Wood.\n  Again, this amendment is not going to do anything to change what \nhappened in California and the West. But it does provide the necessary \nauthority for the CFTC and the FERC to help protect against another \nenergy crisis.\n  I might say I am very suspicious of people who want to do trading in \nthe dark. I am very suspicious when they say, oh, we are so \nsophisticated you cannot possibly know how this is done and you are \ngoing to stifle trade, because they don't want to keep a record of that \ntrade, they don't want transparency, they don't want to keep an audit \non trade, and they don't want any Government agency assuring there \nisn't fraud or manipulation. I am doubly suspicious of them, \nparticularly because of the fraud and manipulation we now know took \nplace.\n  So, please, don't tell me I am not sophisticated enough to \nunderstand. I understand plenty. I understand, when the price goes from \n$7 billion to $28 billion in a very short period of time, that you have \nto begin to look. I understand now that these arrests are occurring and \nthe manipulations of Ricochet and Death Star and Get Shorty and wash \ntrades are all becoming well known. I understand. The point is it is \nwrong. The point is, you cannot prove it is wrong if there are no \nrecords of those trades.\n  So what we are saying is these trades can go on, but you keep \nrecords. We give the CFTC the responsibility to set net capital \nrequirements commensurate with risk. That is good oversight for the \npublic and that is good oversight for anybody who is going to invest, \nbecause when net capital is not available and the house begins to \ncollapse, as it did with Enron, the company goes bankrupt.\n  I think I have made my case. We have gone over this. I sent this \nlegislation to the head of Goldman Sachs. They run an electronic \nexchange. I said, please, if you have problems with it, let me know. I \ndid not hear. We have vetted it and talked over the past year and a \nhalf, 2 years, with virtually anyone who wanted to come in and talk \nwith us about it.\n  Mr. President, I am absolutely determined and I am going to come back \nand back and back until this loophole is closed. Nobody can tell me I \nam not sophisticated enough to know that sunshine and records and \ntransparency are critical to the effective functioning of a free \nmarketplace, because I believe that just as much as I believe in the \nPledge of Allegiance--and I do believe in the Pledge of Allegiance. \nWhen you allow hiding and you allow these trades to take place \nsurreptitiously, that is when there are problems.\n  I am afraid I have said this over and over again, but we went through \nit and we saw it. We read the 3,000 pages California has sent to the \nFERC. This is another intrigue. Can you imagine that no State has the \nright today to present evidence to the FERC of fraud or manipulation?\n  California had to go to the Supreme Court to get that right, and then \nwhen we got that right, we were told it had to be in in 100 days. \nCalifornia submitted 3,000 pages within the 100 days, and it is loaded \nwith examples of fraud and manipulation.\n  We know there is fraud, we know there is manipulation, and we know \nthat was present in the western energy crisis, and all we are trying to \ndo is bring light of day to one loophole that was in the Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act because a major offender lobbied for it in \nthe laws. It was not in the Senate bill. The Senate bill originally \ncovered this, but they lobbied in the House. It was taken out in \nconference, and the loophole was created.\n  If the past 3 years have not been evidence enough, if the arrests are \nnot evidence enough, if we do not want a transparent marketplace, if we \nwant people to be able to do this trading--\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\nand we can tell you the language of some of these trades; if they knew \nthey were being recorded, I do not think they would do it in the way \nthey did it--if we want to allow those procedures to continue to \nhappen, that is what a motion to table and a tabling vote will do.\n  I am very hopeful and I am asking my colleagues to vote nay on the \nmotion to table and vote yea on the modified amendment which is now at \nthe desk.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 877, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Reid amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate is considering the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, \nto the Energy bill now before the Senate. This amendment seeks to \ntransfer, in effect, regulatory authority from the body that now has \nthat authority, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  There are several good reasons why the Senate should not adopt this \namendment and force that transfer of regulatory authority. First, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission has special responsibilities but \nthis will give them new and different responsibilities where there is \nno experience, there is no body of law or regulatory decisionmaking on \nwhich to base the assumption that this kind of regulation or this \nregulation carried out by this Commission would be of any better \ncharacter or type than that which would be exercised by the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been operating for some \ntime now and has actually shown that it is capable of taking action to \nprevent abuses and illegal activities that can occur in these trading \nmarkets and in the energy trading area as well.\n  The Feinstein amendment would give the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission authority over areas that are currently regulated by the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission and would require, in addition, \nregulation of energy derivatives. These are complex instruments. They \nare used to transfer risks among traders and they are important tools \nin the energy markets today.\n  Congress considered in the past, when it took up the Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act of 2000 several years ago, regulating these \ninstruments. But it decided not to do so. The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission has no current responsibility in regulating derivatives.\n  It seems to me that when you look to see who has been carrying out \nduties now complained about by some Senator, you can find that the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission has a record of taking legal \naction against companies such as Enron, El Paso, and others regarding \nenergy market problems. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has \nrecovered millions of dollars in fines from these companies, and it has \nseveral ongoing investigations in this area, and more charges are \npossible.\n  To transfer now the regulatory authority to a different commission \nand purport to take away the authority from the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission is going to create disruption in ongoing \ninvestigations and actions that are taken to discipline this market and \nmake it more predictable and trustworthy.\n  The Senator from California has suggested that the amendment she has \noffered is needed to prevent wash trades. These are trades that are \nfictitious. A company will buy a commodity and then sell it creating \nthe impression that this is a legitimate trade. It establishes a price. \nIt establishes volume. But it is fictitious trading. It shouldn't have \nthat effect but it does.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has taken action to \ndiscourage that activity and to punish that activity. It has specific \nauthority to do that under the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission has brought several actions under that \nauthority in the last several years. Its authority to take this kind of \naction has been upheld by two decisions from U.S. appeals courts.\n  Just this year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has \nrecovered tens of millions of dollars from merchant energy traders for \nso-called wash trades and false trades.\n  Another claim that is made in support of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California is that because the exempt commercial markets are not \nregulated under the Commodity Exchange Act that they have no regulatory \noversight. That is just not true. Those markets are required by statute \ntoday to have electronic audit trails. They are required by statute to \nkeep records for 5 years. They are required to be subject to the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission's antifraud and antimanipulation \nauthorities. They are subject to special call examinations by the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. To suggest there are no \nregulatory requirements on those exempt commercial markets is just not \ntrue.\n  It is also claimed that the Feinstein amendment would impose capital \nrequirements on exempt commercial markets. It would require capital \nrequirements. That doesn't necessarily solve anything. Capital \nrequirements aren't imposed now on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or \nthe New York Mercantile Exchange, or the Chicago Board of Trade. They \nare not viewed as necessary. Those markets have been functioning \nwithout capital requirements. To now impose them on exempt commercial \nmarkets is inappropriate and unnecessary.\n  Capital requirements or other exempt commercial markets would be \ndifficult to establish. They would change on a regular basis--weekly \nprobably--because of new contracts being offered, and change financial \npositions of participants. Capital requirements would impose \nsignificant costs and there are no identifiable benefits.\n  The amendment would also impose large trader reporting on exempt \ncommercial markets. Large trader reporting works on retail futures \nexchanges with standardized contracts but would not work on exempt \ncommercial markets. They don't have the same type of standardization. \nLarge trader reporting on exempt commercial markets could actually lead \nto misleading information being provided to the public. Large trader \nreporting is used for market surveillance in retail futures markets.\n\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's statutory authority for \nexempt commercial markets is after the fact, antifraud and \nantimanipulation enforcement, and is inconsistent with a large trader \nreporting scheme.\n  In closing, the Senate has to take into account the fact that the \nleading figures in our Government who are responsible for enforcement \nand managing the departments that understand financial markets and the \nimpact they have on our economy and on our place in the world economy \nare urging that the Senate not adopt the Feinstein amendment.\n  This is a letter which was put on every Senator's desk in the last \nseveral minutes signed by John W. Snow, Secretary of the Department of \nthe Treasury, Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System, William H. Donaldson, Chairman, U.S. Securities \nand Exchange Commission, and James E. Newsome, Chairman of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  With the permission of the Chair, I will read the letter.\n  It is addressed to Senator Crapo of Idaho and Senator Miller of \nGeorgia.\n\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\n\n       Thank you for your letter of June 10, 2003, requesting the \n     views of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets \n     [PWG] on proposed Amendment No. 876--\n\n  That is the Feinstein amendment--\n\n     to S. 14, the pending energy bill.\n       As this amendment is similar to a proposed amendment on \n     which you sought the views of the PWG last year, we reassert \n     the positions expressed in the PWG's response dated September \n     18, 2002, a copy of which is enclosed. The proposed amendment \n     could have significant unintended consequences for an \n     extremely important risk management market--serving \n     businesses, financial institutions, and investors throughout \n     the U.S. economy. For that reason, we believe that adoption \n     of this amendment is ill-advised.\n       We would also point out that, since we wrote that letter \n     last year, various federal agencies have initiated actions \n     against wrongdoing in the energy markets. As you note, the \n     CFTC has brought formal actions against Enron, Dynegy, and El \n     Paso for market manipulation, wash (or roundtrip) trades, \n     false reporting of prices, and operation of illegal markets. \n     The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Justice have \n     also initiated formal actions in the energy sector. Some of \n     these actions have already resulted in substantial monetary \n     penalties and other sanctions. These initial actions alone \n     make clear that wrongdoing in the energy markets are fully \n     subject to the existing enforcement authority of federal \n     regulators.\n       The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 brought \n     important legal certainty to the risk management marketplace. \n     Businesses, financial institutions, and investors throughout \n     the economy rely upon derivatives to protect themselves from \n     market volatility triggered by unexpected economic events. \n     This ability to manage risks makes the economy more resilient \n     and its importance cannot be underestimated. In our judgment, \n     the ability of private counterpart surveillance to \n     effectively regulate these markets can be undermined by \n     inappropriate extensions of government regulation.\n\n  It is clear from the letter that the Senate has received no response \nto inquiries from Senator Crapo and Senator Miller clearly explaining \nthe dangers in adopting the Feinstein amendment.\n  At the appropriate time it will be our intention to move to table the \nFeinstein amendment and ask for the yeas and nays at that time. I hope \nSenators will carefully review the information we now have available on \neach Senator's desk and vote to table the Feinstein amendment.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Feinstein amendment No. 876 occur at 3:15 today, with \nno amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that would be a \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7676-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7676-S7677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF J. RONNIE GREER, OF TENNESSEE, TO BE UNITED STATES \n          DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read the nomination of J. Ronnie \nGreer, of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in a few moments, I believe at 2:15, the \nvote for J. Ronnie Greer's nomination as a United States District Court \nJudge for the Eastern District of Tennessee will take place.\n  As we come to the final few moments before that vote, I want to \nexpress my strong support for a very good friend over the years, Ronnie \nGreer.\n  People who come from the mountains of northeast Tennessee are known \nin our State for certain qualities. They are the qualities of loyalty, \nof steadfastness, of a can-do spirit. This individual, who we will be \nvoting on in a few minutes, really personifies that tradition. He is a \nhighly accomplished public servant who has served as an attorney in \nTennessee's judicial system with great distinction for more than 20 \nyears. His academic career speaks for itself--he graduated at the top \nof his class at the University of Tennessee Law School and was invited \nto be on Law Review. Since starting his own law office in Greeneville, \nhe has represented numerous clients on a wide range of issues, and he \nhas considerable experience before the Federal courts. Recognizing the \nneed to help his fellow man, he has not hesitated to accept the \nappointments of indigent clients, representing them in both the \nDistrict Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  Ronnie has also had a distinguished career in politics and public \nservice outside of his law practice. He was a State Senator in \nTennessee's General Assembly for nine years, ably serving the people of \nDistrict One. He served on both the Judiciary Committee and as Chairman \nof the Environment, Conservation and Tourism Committee. Ronnie also \nserved as a Special Assistant in then-Governor Lamar Alexander's first \nterm, forming a friendship and a bond that continues to this day.\n  You can't demand respect from the people of northeast Tennessee, you \nhave to earn it, and Ronnie has without question. He is known for his \nsense of fair play and his compassion for others. With his easy-going, \nthoughtful manner, yet quick mind and keen legal ability, he has the \ntemperament and judgement required for the Federal bench. For the last \nnineteen years, Judge Thomas Hull has served as District Judge in \nTennessee's Eastern District, and his distinguished career will long be \nremembered. While Judge Hull leaves big shoes to fill, I am confident \nRonnie is up to the task.\n  Mr. President, Ronnie Greer's dedication to the citizens of our \nState, his love of the law, and his desire to serve his country make \nhim an ideal choice to serve as a U.S. District Judge. He has my \nhighest recommendation and unqualified support, and I am delighted to \nurge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation today.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, within a few minutes, we will be \nvoting on the President's nomination of J. Ronnie Greer, of \nGreeneville, TN, to be a Federal District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Tennessee. I want to just say a word about that.\n  The President has made a superb nomination. Ronnie Greer is a \ndistinguished lawyer. He knows the people of east Tennessee. He has \nearned our respect. I am delighted the Senate has moved so \nexpeditiously to consider this exceptional nominee.\n  I had the privilege, as Governor, of appointing nearly 50 men and \nwomen as judges, and I know how important it can be. What I always \nlooked for was intelligence and good character; someone who knew and \nunderstood the people; and someone who would be courteous to the men \nand women to come before the judge once the judge assumes the bench. In \nthis case, it is a lifetime position, and it is even more important \nthat the judge have those qualities.\n  Ronnie Greer has all those qualities. I have known him since he was \nstudent body president at East Tennessee State University. He was a \nchampion debater. That was some 30 years ago. I knew then he would \namount to something special, and he already has.\n  He has served his community in many ways. He has served his political \nparty, the Republican party, in many important ways. He has been a \nState senator from his part of upper east Tennessee. He has been active \non issues that have to do with solid waste and the environment. He has \nbeen chairman of his local committee.\n  I think one of the things that most strongly recommends Ronnie Greer \nis he takes this most important position in what we call in upper east \nTennessee having been a trial judge. He will have lots of people before \nhim, litigants before him trying cases, making decisions on many \ndifferent kinds of things. He has actually practiced law in the grand \nmanner. He has been the kind of lawyer we used to see all over the \ncountry, where a single lawyer\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\nwould try many different kinds of cases. They would have a criminal \ncase one day, a civil case the next day, and a domestic relations case \nthe next day. The lawyer had many talents and was broad gauged. Today, \nso much of our legal profession is in very large law firms, where we \nhave very specialized lawyers. They do not see big slices of life. As a \nresult, many of them are not very well prepared for a Federal \njudgeship, particularly a district judgeship where many slices of life \ncome before that judge.\n  Ronnie Greer is well prepared. He has tried hundreds of cases in his \ncareer. He has represented the people of his area. The fact the \nPresident nominated him and that this Senate has moved so quickly to \nconfirm him suggests his reputation goes well before him.\n  Mr. Greer was born and raised in Mountain City, TN. He received his \nBachelor of Science degree from the East Tennessee State University in \n1974. He received his Juris Doctorate from the University Of Tennessee \nCollege Of Law in 1980.\n  Mr. Greer served in the Tennessee General Assembly as a Senator for 8 \nyears and served on the judiciary committee for 5 years. During his \nterm of service, the committee considered legislation relative to the \njudiciary, State criminal code and criminal sentencing. This committee \napproved bills: that rewrote the Tennessee Criminal Code; that dealt \nwith the appointment and retention of State appellate court judges; and \nthat revised the Tennessee Rules of Evidence; the Tennessee Rules of \nCivil Procedure; and the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n  While in the Tennessee General Assembly, Mr. Greer also served as \nChairman of the Senate Environment, Conservation and Tourism Committee \nfor 7 years. This committee considered bills related to environmental \nissues, wildlife, State parks and tourism. He also authored and was \nchief sponsor of the Tennessee Solid Waste Management Act and sponsored \nand cosponsored numerous pieces of significant environmental \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Greer has vast litigation experience in civil and criminal law. \nHe served as County Attorney for Greene County, TN. In his capacity of \nCounty Attorney and in private practice, Mr. Greer tried approximately \n200 lawsuits in State or Federal courts as sole or chief counsel. As a \npracticing attorney, he practiced general civil litigation primarily in \nthe areas of personal injury, environmental law and bankruptcy. Mr. \nGreer has represented many defendants in criminal cases in both State \nand Federal courts. Mr. Greer has represented numerous cases for \nindigent clients on a pro bono basis and routinely accepted two to \nthree criminal cases appointed by federal courts per year.\n  Mr. Greer has received honors and awards for his outstanding service \nto the community. To name a few, he was the 1989 recipient of the \nTennessee Conservation League's Legislator of the Year Award and, in \n1993, he received the Environmental Action Fund's Legislator of the \nYear Award.\n  Madam President, I join Senator Frist in saying how proud we both are \nof his nomination. I look forward to casting my vote for him in a few \nminutes and urge all my colleagues to support this nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJames Ronnie Greer to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Tennessee. Mr. Greer has extensive experience in both the private \nand public sectors of the legal community.\n  Upon graduating from the University of Tennessee College of Law, Mr. \nGreer became the special assistant to then-Gov. Lamar Alexander.\n  For the past 20 years, Mr. Greer has maintained a successful general \nlegal practice. During this time, his practice has consisted of \nconsiderable litigation involving both jury and bench trials in the \nareas of State and Federal criminal defense, personal injury, and \nworkers compensation. He has also practiced in the areas of domestic \nrelations and has represented a number of clients on environmental \nissues. From 1985 to 1986, Mr. Greer was county attorney for Green \nCounty, TN.\n  From 1986 to 1994, Mr. Greer served as a State senator in the \nTennessee General Assembly, during which time he was a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, and chairman of the Environment, Conservation and \nTourism Committee. During his tenure, he helped pass bills which \nrewrote the Tennessee Criminal Code, revised the Rules of Evidence, \nCivil Procedure, and Criminal Procedure. Mr. Greer was also the author \nand chief sponsor of the Tennessee Solid Waste Management Act.\n  I am confident that he will serve on the bench with integrity and \nfairness, and I urge my colleagues to confirm him today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, we vote to confirm J. Ronnie Greer \nto the United States District Court. With this confirmation we will \nhave filled the sole vacancy on this court, one that arose in October \n2002. Judge Greer will join Judge J. Daniel Breen and Judge Thomas \nVarlan, who we confirmed to lifetime appointments to the Western \nDistrict of Tennessee and Eastern District of Tennessee, respectively, \nearlier in March of this year. These three confirmations build on the \nprogress we were able to make while I chaired the Judiciary Committee \nduring the 107th Congress. During those months we proceeded \nexpeditiously to consider and confirm Judge Thomas Phillips to the \nEastern District of Tennessee and Samuel Hardy Mays, Jr. to the Western \nDistrict of Tennessee. In addition, during my tenure as chairman we \nbroke the logjam on appointments to the United States Court of Appeals \nto the Sixth Circuit by confirming Judge Julia Smith Gibbons of \nTennessee to that circuit court. She was the first Sixth Circuit \nconfirmation in almost 5 years during which the Republican Senate \nmajority had refused to proceed on three of President Clinton's Sixth \nCircuit nominees and vacancies grew to half the circuit court.\n  The Tennessee total during the last few years now stands at six and \nits Federal bench is completely filled. Working with Senator Frist, \nSenator Alexander, and before them my good friend Senator Thompson, we \nhave been able to make tremendous progress during the last 2 years.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of J. Ronnie Greer, of Tennessee, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nFitzgerald) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nHollings) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

KRAVITZ, OF CONNECTICUT, TO BE UNITED STATES \n             DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the following nomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Mark R. \nKravitz, of Connecticut, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 5 \nminutes for debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember or their designees prior to a vote.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield such time as the senior Senator from Connecticut \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch \nfor moving the nomination of Mark Kravitz. This is a first-rate \nnomination. I commend the President and others who recommended Mark \nKravitz. He is a first-class nominee to sit on the Federal bench. My \ncolleague Senator Lieberman and I strongly support this nomination. He \nhas been a wonderful lawyer in Connecticut, a graduate of Wellesley \nUniversity, Georgetown Law School, a clerk for then-Justice Rehnquist, \nhas written extensively and taught at the University of Connecticut Law \nSchool. He is going to be a wonderful addition to the district court \nbench.\n  We wanted our colleagues to know how strongly Senator Lieberman and I \nfelt about this nomination. We urge our colleagues to give their \nunanimous support.\n  I yield back my remaining time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. \nThis was a case where the White House worked with the Senators from the \nhome State in an effort to unite rather than divide. I suspect this \nnominee will be easily confirmed.\n  With the confirmation of Mark R. Kravitz to the District Court, we \nwill have filled the only vacancy on that court. I commend Senator Dodd \nand Senator Lieberman for their work in connection with this \noutstanding nomination and congratulate the nominee and his family.\n  The Senate has now confirmed 131 judges, including 26 circuit court \njudges, nominated by President Bush. One hundred judicial nominees were \nconfirmed when Democrats acted as the Senate majority for 17 months \nfrom the summer of 2001 to adjournment last year. After today, 31 will \nhave been confirmed in the other 12 months in which Republicans have \ncontrolled the confirmation process under President Bush. This total of \n131 judges confirmed for President Bush is more confirmations than the \nRepublicans allowed President Clinton in all of 1995, 1996 and 1997 the \nfirst 3 full years of his last term. In those 3 years, the Republican \nleadership in the Senate allowed only 111 judicial nominees to be \nconfirmed, which included only 18 circuit court judges. We have already \nsignificantly exceeded that total with 6 months remaining to us this \nyear.\n  If the Senate did not confirm another judicial nominee all year and \nsimply adjourned today, we would have treated President Bush more \nfairly and would have acted on more of his judicial nominees than \nRepublicans did for President Clinton in 1995-97. In addition, the \nvacancies on the federal courts around the country are significantly \nlower than the 80 vacancies Republicans left at the end of 1997. We \ncontinue well below the 67 vacancy level that Senator Hatch used to \ncall ``full employment'' for the federal judiciary.\n  Indeed, we have reduced vacancies to their lowest level in the last \n13 years. So while unemployment has continued to climb for Americans to \n6.1 percent last month, the Senate has helped lower the vacancy rate in \nfederal courts to an historically low level that we have not witnessed \nin over a decade. Of course, the Senate is not adjourning for the year \nand the Judiciary Committee continues to hold hearings for Bush \njudicial nominees at between two and four times as many as he did for \nPresident Clinton's.\n  For those who are claiming that Democrats are blockading this \nPresident's judicial nominees, this is another example of how quickly \nand easily the Senate can act when we proceed cooperatively with \nconsensus nominees. The Senate's record fairly considered has been \noutstanding--especially when contrasted with the obstruction of \nPresident Clinton's moderate judicial nominees by Republicans between \n1996 and 2001.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy and \nall the members of the Judiciary Committee for acting on this judicial \nnomination in a thorough and expeditious manner. I am pleased to \nrecommend Mr. Kravitz to my colleagues to serve as Federal District \nJudge for the District of Connecticut.\n  Mark Kravitz is a graduate of Wesleyan University in Middletown, \nConnecticut and Georgetown Law School. After graduating from law \nschool, Mr. Kravitz clerked for Judge James Hunter of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit. Mr. Kravitz also served as a clerk for \nthen-Justice William H. Rehnquist of the United States Supreme Court.\n  In 1976, Mr. Kravitz joined the respected law firm of Wiggin & Dana \nin New Haven, CT, where he is now a partner and heads their appellate \npractice. Mr. Kravitz's law practice has been devoted to civil \nlitigation in State and Federal courts. He has been lead counsel on \nmore than 60 appeals in State and Federal courts. In addition to his \nappellate and litigation practice, Mr. Kravitz has been an Adjunct \nProfessor of Law at the University of Connecticut School of Law.\n  Over the course of the last quarter of a century, Mr. Kravitz has \nbuilt an excellent reputation. He has become a respected and admired \nmember of the Connecticut bar and he has contributed to the larger \ncommunity, giving his time and talents to such causes as the Guilford \nLand Conservation Trust, the Connecticut Foundation for Open \nGovernment, and the Connecticut Council on Environmental Quality. Mr. \nKravitz has been listed as one of the Best Lawyers in America since \n1991. He has been elected as a fellow to the American Academy of \nAppellate Lawyers and as a member of the American Law Institute. In \n1995, Mr. Kravitz received the Deane C. Avery Award for ``advancing the \ncause of freedom of information and freedom of speech in Connecticut.''\n  Recently, there has been a great deal of debate in the Senate about \njudicial nominations. I don't believe there should be any debate about \nthis nomination. Mark Kravitz is the kind of nominee whom I believe the \nFramers of the Constitution had in mind when they envisioned an \nindependent judiciary composed of jurists whose experience, intellect, \nand commitment to justice are unquestionable.\n  I believe that Mark Kravitz possesses the intellect, the experience, \nand the disposition to be an impartial finder of fact, a faithful legal \nanalyst, and a fair and just jurist. He is an outstanding lawyer, and \ngiven everything I know about him, I am certain that he has the \ncapacity to be an outstanding judge, as well. The State of Connecticut \nis proud to have him as one of our own. I'm certain that he will serve \nhis country with honor and distinction, and I look forward to his \nconfirmation. Again, I commend Mark Kravitz without reservation and I \nurge my colleagues to vote to confirm his nomination.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. I rise to support the nomination of \nMark Kravitz, whose nomination to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Connecticut the Senate is currently considering.\n  Mr. Kravitz's confirmation will be good for Connecticut and for the \nFederal bench.\n  Connecticut isn't the biggest State in the Union, but we are blessed \nto have countless principled and professional lawyers, judges, and \nlegal scholars. Maybe that is because we were the first State to have a \nwritten constitution; maybe it is due to the gravitational tug of fine \nlaw schools like UConn and my own alma mater, Yale. Regardless, in a \nState filled with lawyers, it is no exaggeration to say that Mark \nKravitz has proven himself among the best. And I have no doubt he will \nuphold the highest standards of jurisprudence on the Federal bench.\n  Mark graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1972 from \nWesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. He later graduated from\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\nGeorgetown Law School, where he was managing editor of the Law Review. \nOut of law school, Mark clerked for Judge James Hunter of the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals, and Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist. \nHe is currently a partner at Wiggin and Dana in New Haven, where he has \nworked since 1976. He has served as lead counsel on more than 60 \nappeals in State and Federal courts, and has argued before the United \nStates Supreme Court.\n  Mark has been listed as one of the Best Lawyers in America since \n1991. He was endorsed by the Connecticut Bar Association as \nexceptionally well qualified to be a District Judge, and has been \nunanimously rated as Well Qualified by the American Bar Association.\n  Forgive the pun, but this is an open and shut case. Mark Kravitz has \nthe intellect, the independence, and the integrity to do this job and \ndo it well. I am confident he will carefully read and apply the laws of \nthe United States in Federal court, abiding only by the law-not by any \nideology, passion, or prejudice. He will be an exemplary judge. I urge \nmy colleagues to confirm him today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in support of Mark. R. \nKravitz to be a United States District Judge for the District of \nConnecticut. I am confident that with his accomplishments and \nexperience, Mr. Kravitz will make an excellent Federal judge. After \ngraduating from Georgetown University Law Center, where he was managing \neditor of the Georgetown Law Journal, Mr. Kravitz clerked for the \nHonorable James Hunter III of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit. He then went on to clerk for the Honorable William H. \nRehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Mr. Kravitz has spent the bulk of his legal career at the firm of \nWiggin & Dana in New Haven, CT, where he is currently a partner. He \nalso serves as an adjunct professor of law at the University of \nConnecticut School of Law and has also been a visiting lecturer at Yale \nUniversity Law School. For the past 12 years, Mr. Kravitz has been \nrecognized in the publication ``The Best Lawyers in America.'' He \nenjoys the support of both home State Democrat Senators and was \nunanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee. I urge my colleagues \nto vote in favor of this exceptional nominee.\n  I yield back our remaining time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield back the remaining time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nequally divided and that Senator Feinstein control our time and Senator \nCochran control the time on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Feinstein, I yield to \nthe Senator from Washington 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I am here to support the Feinstein amendment, which I am pleased to \ncosponsor. It is a very important piece of legislation. I thank my \ncolleague for her hard work on this very important issue. We have all \nheard about the dysfunctions in our western regional power market and \nhow it has cost our western economy more than $35 billion.\n  Madam President, it was more than a year ago that the Senator from \nCalifornia and I stood on the floor to have this debate with many of my \ncolleagues. During the Omnibus Appropriations bill in 2000, Congress \ngranted an exemption from regulatory scrutiny for businesses such as \nEnronOnline and electronic trading platforms. Unsurprisingly, Enron was \nchief among its boosters in lobbying for this language. Even though \nCongress listened to Enron and not the President's Working Group on \nFinancial Markets, which opposed this exemption.\n  Now we have history. What has happened? We know that the Enron \nloophole has caused quite a bit of a problem. In fact, in light of \nevidence which during last year's debate was just beginning to emerge, \nwe have found that the markets for energy derivatives and the physical \nenergy prices and supplies have caused a problem. In the West, we had \nhuge spikes. We have had a long and vigorous floor debate about this \namendment.\n  There were many detractors who basically said at the time there was \nno conclusive evidence that Enron manipulated western energy markets \nand there was no need to proceed. This year, we have heard a lot about \nhow Enron in fact has manipulated markets.\n  Less than a month after the Senate passed this comprehensive Energy \nbill with this language in it, Enron's ``smoking gun'' memos were \nreleased detailing a number of the company's schemes for driving up the \nprices. My colleagues are aware that Enron has continued to release \nvarious amounts of information about this unbelievable scandal and \nmanipulation of prices.\n  Just last week, another Enron trader was arrested. And the complaint \nof Federal prosecutors said they are uncovering even more details of \nploys to manipulate energy prices. We wanted evidence. We got it. In a \nlong-awaited report, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concluded \nthis spring that manipulation was ``epidemic'' in the western market \nduring the crisis of 2000-2001.\n  But more specifically, in a staff report the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission detailed the manner in which EnronOnline helped \nEnron to game the California markets. The Commission concluded that \n``the relationship between the financial and physical energy products . \n. . provides the opportunity to manipulate the\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\nphysical markets and profit in the financial markets.''\n  Further, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission estimated that \nEnronOnline allowed the company to reap more than $500 million in \nadditional profits. There it is, right from the Federal Commission: \nEnronOnline allowed them to reap those additional profits.\n  As we approach this very important issue in a vote here in a few \nminutes, my colleagues need to step up and close this loophole that the \nPresident's Working Group on Financial Markets first argued against \nbecause it said we didn't have real credibility on manipulation. Now we \nhave the credibility, and we have a Federal Commission pointing to the \nfact that EnronOnline was responsible for part of this market \nmanipulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you, Madam President. I will be very brief.\n  I want to reiterate, once again, we are not here dealing with a \nquestion of whether those who did try to and succeeded in manipulating \nmarkets should be held accountable for that. We are talking about what \nis the correct way to regulate the derivatives market in our country.\n  I would like to read into the Record, once again, a portion of a \nletter which we have just received signed by the Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Treasury, John W. Snow; Alan Greenspan, Chairman of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; William H. \nDonaldson, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; and \nJames E. Newsome, Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \nThey write:\n\n       Dear Senators Crapo and Miller:\n       Thank you for your letter of June 10, 2003, requesting the \n     views of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets \n     on proposed Senate Amendment # 876 to S. 14, the pending \n     energy bill. As this amendment is similar to a proposed \n     amendment on which you sought the views of the PWG last year, \n     we reassert the positions expressed in the PWG's response \n     dated September 18, 2002, a copy of which is enclosed. The \n     proposed amendment could have significant unintended \n     consequences for an extremely important risk management \n     market--serving businesses, financial institutions, and \n     investors throughout the U.S. economy. For that reason, we \n     believe that adoption of this amendment is ill-advised.\n\n  And this next paragraph responds directly to the allegations that \nthere is some manipulation in the market and there is a loophole there. \nThey go on to say:\n\n       We would also point out that, since we wrote that letter \n     last year, various federal agencies have initiated actions \n     against wrongdoing in energy markets.\n\n  I do not have time to go through the list of wrongdoing they have \ninitiated action against, but they conclude in their letter:\n\n       These initial actions alone make clear that wrongdoers in \n     the energy markets are fully subject to the existing \n     enforcement authority of federal regulators.\n\n  This amendment will not be helpful to our economy. It will take away \none of the needed elements of our economy that gives it the dynamic \nnature that it has, to be able to resist some of the difficult burdens \nthat the economy has faced in the last several years.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I just \nreferred to dated June 11, 2003, and an additional letter dated \nSeptember 18, 2002, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the \n           Federal Reserve System, U.S. Securities and Exchange \n           Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2003.\n     Hon. Micahel D. Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Zell B. Miller,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Crapo and Miller: Thank you for your letter \n     of June 10, 2003, requesting the views of the President's \n     Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) on proposed Senate \n     Amendment No. 876 to S. 14, the pending energy bill. As this \n     amendment is similar to a proposed amendment on which you \n     sought the views of the PWG last year, we reassert the \n     positions expressed in the WPG's response dated September 18, \n     2002, a copy of which is enclosed. The proposed amendment \n     could have significant unintended consequences for an \n     extremely important risk management market--serving \n     businesses, financial institutions, and investors throughout \n     the U.S. economy. For that reason, we believe that adoption \n     of this amendment is ill-advised.\n       We would also point out that, since we wrote that letter \n     last year, various federal agencies have initiated actions \n     against wrongdoing in the energy markets. As you note, the \n     CFTC has brought formal actions against Enron, Dynegy, and El \n     Paso for market manipulation, wash (or roundtrip) trades, \n     false reporting of prices, and operation of illegal markets. \n     The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Justice have \n     also initiated formal actions in the energy sector. Some of \n     these actions have already resulted in substantial monetary \n     penalties and other sanctions. These initial actions alone \n     make clear that wrongdoers in the energy market are fully \n     subject to the existing enforcement authority of federal \n     regulators.\n       The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 brought \n     important legal certainty to the risk management marketplace. \n     Businesses, financial institutions, investors throughout the \n     economy rely upon derivatives to protect themselves from \n     market volatility triggered by unexpected economic events. \n     This ability to manage risks makes the economy more resilient \n     and its importance cannot be underestimated. In our judgment, \n     the ability of private counterparty surveillance to \n     effectively regulate these markets can be undermined by \n     inappropriate extensions of government regulation.\n           Yours truly,\n     John W. Snow,\n       Secretary, Department of the Treasury.\n     William H. Donaldson,\n       Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     Alan Greenspan,\n       Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n     James E. Newsome,\n       Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal \n           Reserve System, U.S. Securities and Exchange \n           Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission,\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Michael D. Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Zell B. Miller,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Crapo and Miller: In response to your letter \n     of September 13, we write to express our serious concerns \n     about the legislative proposal to expand regulation of the \n     over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets that has recently \n     been proposed by Senators Harkin and Lugar.\n       We believe that the OTC derivatives markets in question \n     have been a major contributor to our economy's ability to \n     respond to the stresses and challenges of the last two years. \n     This proposal would limit this contribution, thereby \n     increasing the vulnerability of our economy to potential \n     future stresses.\n       The proposal would subject market participants to \n     disclosure of proprietary trading information and new capital \n     requirements. We do not believe a public policy case exists \n     to justify this governmental intervention. The OTC markets \n     trade a wide variety of instruments. Many of these are \n     idiosyncratic in nature. These customized markets generally \n     do not serve a significant price discovery function for non-\n     participants, nor do they permit retail investors to \n     participate. Public disclosure of pricing data for customized \n     OTC transactions would not improve the overall price \n     discovery process and may lead to confusion as to the \n     appropriate pricing for other transactions, as terms and \n     conditions can vary by contract. The rationale for imposing \n     capital requirements is unclear to us, and the proposal's \n     capital requirements also could duplicate or conflict with \n     existing regulatory capital requirements.\n       The trading of these instruments arbitrages away \n     inefficiencies that exist in all financial and commodities \n     markets. If dealers had to divulge promptly the proprietary \n     details and pricing of these instruments, the incentive to \n     allocate capital to developing and finding markets for these \n     highly complex instruments would be lessened. The result \n     would be that the inefficiencies in other markets that \n     derivatives have arbitraged away would reappear.\n       It is also unclear who would benefit from the proposed \n     disclosures and regulations other than whoever simply copied \n     existing products and instruments for their own short-term \n     advantage. Weakening the protection of proprietary \n     intellectual property rights in the market arena would \n     undercut a complex of highly innovative markets that is among \n     this nation's most valuable assets.\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\n       While the derivatives markets may seem far removed from the \n     interests and concerns of consumers, the efficiency gains \n     that these markets have fostered are enormously important to \n     consumers and to our economy. We urge Congress to protect \n     these market's contributions to the economy, and to be aware \n     of the potential unintended consequences of current \n     legislative proposals.\n           Yours truly,\n     Paul H. O'Neill,\n       Secretary, Department of Treasury.\n     Harvey L. Pitt,\n       Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     Alan Greenspan,\n       Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n     James E. Newsome,\n       Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I encourage my colleagues to vote against \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, do they have any time left on their \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-five seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield our time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I join Senator Feinstein as a cosponsor \nof her amendment to strengthen Federal oversight of energy markets. I \nstrongly support the amendment's provisions enhancing the ability of \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate and punish \nfraud and manipulation in over-the-counter markets in energy \nderivatives and derivatives based on other ``exempt commodities'' under \nthe Commodity Exchange Act.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nduring the last Congress, I held a hearing on the scope of the CFTC's \nauthority to insure market transparency and prevent fraud and \nmanipulation in markets in OTC derivatives based on ``exempt \ncommodities,'' such as energy and metals, following passage of the \nCFMA. Following that hearing, Senator Lugar and I worked closely with \nSenator Feinstein on an earlier version of this amendment to improve \nit. At the beginning of the 108th Congress, Senator Feinstein \nintroduced S. 509, incorporating the work we did within the Agriculture \nCommittee last summer and fall. The only difference between S. 509 and \nthis amendment is that S. 509 was drafted to fill a gap in oversight \ncreated by the CFMA and fully and clearly affirm the CFTC's authority \nto oversee trading in all ``exempt commodities''--OTC energy and metals \nderivatives as well as derivatives based on other commodities such as \nbroadband and weather--whereas this amendment now does not change the \ntreatment of metals derivatives. I have some concerns about this \napproach. Metals, like energy, are commodities of finite supply. They \nare equally susceptible to market manipulation and should therefore be \nsubject to the same level of oversight. The legislative process often \nrequires compromise in order to make progress toward important policy \ngoals, however, and because I hope this amendment will result in \nsignificant progress in addressing a problem created by the CFMA, I \nsupport it.\n  The CFMA amended the Commodity Exchange Act in a number of positive \nways, based for the most part on the recommendations of the President's \nWorking Group on Financial Markets issued in 1999. The President's \nWorking Group recommended that certain transactions involving financial \nderivatives be excluded from the CFTC's jurisdiction. The President's \nWorking Group did not recommend a similar exclusion for transactions \ninvolving energy and metals derivatives, or other commodities of finite \nsupply.\n  During 1999 and 2000, as legislation was being developed in the \nSenate, there was discussion of the issue of oversight of energy and \nmetals derivatives markets, and Senator Lugar who was at the time \nchairman, and I both supported, in the committee, a version of the \nlegislation that was consistent with the recommendations of the \nPresident's Working Group, and excluded only financial derivatives--not \nenergy and metals derivatives--from the CFTC's jurisdiction. The bill \ncodified an exemption, with specific safeguards, for certain \ncommodities such as energy and metals, but clearly retained the CFTC's \nauthority to investigate and act against fraud and manipulation.\n  The final version of the CFMA included in the omnibus appropriations \nbill in December 2000 differed from our committee bill regarding energy \nand metals derivatives markets. I supported the CFMA, although I had \nsome concerns about its treatment of energy and metals products, \nbecause I thought it had a number of very positive features, and on the \nwhole was a good bill. I still believe so. It is important that we not \nundermine the legal certainty that legislation brought to the OTC \nderivatives markets. I would not support this amendment if I thought it \nwould do that. But I do believe it is important to close the loophole \nthat has resulted in an important segment of the overall OTC \nderivatives market--that is, derivatives based on energy and other \n``exempt commodities,'' as the CFMA defined them--being completely \nexcluded from oversight. At the time of passage of the CFMA, many \nMembers of Congress believed these exempt commodities would no longer \nbe subject to most requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act, but they \ncertainly did not believe these commodities would be removed entirely \nfrom oversight by the CFTC or any other agency, which is what has \nhappened.\n\n  We know now that this lack of oversight has resulted in harm to \nconsumers. Last August, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, \nissued a report finding significant evidence that Enron used its \nunregulated OTC electronic trading platform, Enron Online, to \nmanipulate natural gas prices to increase its revenue. This \nmanipulation affected prices not only for Enron's trading partners but \nindustry-wide, as reporting firms used price information displayed \nelectronically on Enron Online as a significant source of natural gas \npricing data. And a recent report prepared by the Minority Staff of the \nU.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, after a year-long \ninvestigation on crude oil price volatility, found that crude oil \nprices are similarly affected by trading on unregulated OTC markets, \nand that the lack of information on prices and large positions in OTC \nmarkets makes it difficult if not impossible to detect price \nmanipulation. This report concluded that routine market disclosure and \noversight of the OTC energy derivatives markets are essential to halt \nmanipulation before economic damage is inflicted upon the market and \nthe public.\n  This amendment will provide the CFTC with the authority it needs to \nrequire routine market disclosure and ensure effective oversight of the \nOTC energy derivatives markets and markets for other ``exempt \ncommodities,'' such as broadband and weather derivatives. The amendment \nclarifies that the CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority \nover transactions in ``exempt commodities'' other than metals. This \namendment is not regulatory overreaching by any means. It just gives \nthe CFTC the authority it needs to establish adequate notice, \ntransparency, reporting, record-keeping, and other transparency \nrequirements which are the minimum needed to allow the agency to \neffectively police OTC markets in energy derivatives, and thereby \ndetect and deter fraud and manipulation of these markets. It also \nincreases criminal and civil penalties for manipulation, including \n``wash'' or ``round trip'' trades.\n  It is clear that the impact of OTC energy derivatives markets reaches \nwell beyond the immediate parties to the transactions. Derivatives play \nan increasingly important role in the diverse range of energy markets, \nwhich are in turn critical to our overall economy. We must ensure the \nintegrity of these markets and restore shareholder, investor, and \nconsumer confidence in them. This amendment moves us in that direction, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam President, this amendment basically closes a small loophole \nthat was left in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed in the \nyear 2000. We saw what happened with Enron. And what happened is, Enron \nOnline was used to influence energy prices far beyond Enron. This \nimpacted\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\nconsumers not only on the West Coast but in my State and all over the \nUnited States.\n  As a result, we looked at this amendment last year. Both Senator \nLugar and I looked at it. We had a hearing on it last year in the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  This amendment, I believe, does exactly what we want it to do; that \nis, to make sure the Commodity Futures Trading Commission----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds to complete my sentence.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, how much time is on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 39 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just wanted to say, this gives the CFTC the authority \nagain to provide the oversight they need to make sure we have integrity \nin these markets for derivatives based on energy, but also for \nderivatives based on other things, too, such as weather and broadband. \nIt is a step in the right direction to provide that oversight and \ntransparency.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, what this amendment really does is \ntransfer some new power and authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to regulate some of these highly sophisticated and important \nmarkets. They have never done this before. There is no expertise, \nbackground, or experience in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nto do the things this amendment would have them do. So that is not \nplugging a loophole. It may be creating a bigger one. It may be \ncounterproductive. That is what I am suggesting the Senate should \nconsider.\n  Look at the letter that has been signed by Alan Greenspan, by John \nSnow, the Secretary of the Treasury, by the head of the Securities and \nExchange Commission. These are the people who understand the impact of \nthis amendment on our economy and on our economic power in the world \ntoday.\n  This is serious business. I am hopeful the Senate will look \ncarefully. The amendment appears to grant FERC authority with respect \nto derivatives, but it leaves a jurisdictional gap. The amendment would \nreplace regulatory certainty with regulatory uncertainty. It is a bad \namendment and it ought to be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, do we have any time remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 21 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the Senator from Wyoming the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I do want to point out we debated this \nissue a year ago. The conclusion was these are professionals dealing \nwith professionals. The people who have the oversight over it do have \noversight and are taking advantage of that oversight.\n  We also passed Sarbanes-Oxley in the meantime. And if the Feinstein \namendment were to be adopted, it would lead to some confusion over \nexactly who has jurisdiction.\n  I know this is an extremely difficult issue. This is my third time \ndebating it. I do know how to spell it now. But it is a very \ncomplicated issue, and it is not something we ought to be doing in a \nreaction that will result in overreaction. So I ask that we vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. ALEXANDER], for himself, \n     Mr. Santorum, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n     Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 880.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a report from the Secretary of Energy on natural \n                        gas supplies and demand)\n\n       Page 52, after line 22, insert:\n\n     ``SECTION   . NATURAL GAS SUPPLY SHORTAGE REPORT.\n\n       ``(a) Report.--Not later than six months after the date of \n     enactment of this act, the Secretary of Energy \n     (``Secretary'') shall submit to the Congress a report on \n     natural gas supplies and demand. In preparing the report, the \n     Secretary shall consult with experts in natural gas supply \n     and demand as well as representatives of State and local \n     units of government, tribal organizations, and consumer and \n     other organizations. As the Secretary deems advisable, the \n     Secretary may hold public hearings and provide other \n     opportunities for public comment. The report shall contain \n     recommendations for federal actions that, if implemented, \n     will result in a balance between natural gas supply and \n     demand at a level that will ensure, to the maximum extend \n     practicable, achievement of the objectives established in \n     subsection (b).\n       ``(b) Objectives of Report.--In preparing the report, the \n     Secretary shall seek to develop a series of recommendations \n     that will result in a balance between natural gas supply and \n     demand adequate to--\n       ``(1) provide residential consumers with natural gas at \n     reasonable and stable prices;\n       ``(2) accommodate long-term maintenance and growth of \n     domestic natural gas dependent industrial, manufacturing and \n     commercial enterprises;\n       ``(3) facilitate the attainment of natural ambient air \n     quality standards under the Clean Air Act;\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\n       ``(4) permit continued progress in reducing emissions \n     associated with electric power generation; and\n       ``(5) support development of the preliminary phases of \n     hydrogen-based energy technologies\n       ``(c) Contents of Report.--The report shall provide a \n     comprehensive analysis of natural gas supply and demand in \n     the United States for the period from 2004 to 2015.

Madam President, I offer an amendment on behalf of \nSenator Santorum, Senator Cornyn, Senator Landrieu, Senator Bingaman, \nthe ranking member of our committee, and Senator Domenici, the chairman \nof our committee has joined the amendment as well, which I deeply \nappreciate.\n  This is an amendment about the emerging natural gas crisis. It would \nrequire the Secretary of Energy, within 6 months from the date of \nenactment of this Energy bill, to submit a report on natural gas \nsupplies and demand. I offer this amendment because I believe it will \nhelp us deal with what I am afraid is an emerging natural gas crisis. \nIf that were to occur, we would be able to protect our jobs, heat or \ncool our homes at reasonable costs, and clean our air to the standard \nthat we wish.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy, working with our chairman \nof the full committee, I intend to help schedule hearings as soon as \npossible on this emerging crisis. This report and these hearings should \nhelp us take a hard, honest look at what we do short term and long \nterm.\n  Alan Greenspan is usually a little difficult to interpret when he \ntestifies but he was not difficult to understand on May 21 when he \ntestified before the Joint Economic Committee. This is what he said \nabout natural gas:\n\n       In contrast, prices for natural gas have increased sharply \n     in response to very tight supplies. Working gas in storage is \n     presently at extremely low levels, and the normal seasonal \n     rebuilding of these inventories seems to be behind the \n     typical schedule. The colder-than-average winter played a \n     role in producing today's tight supply as did the inability \n     of heightened gas well drilling to significantly augment net \n     marketed production. Canada, our major source of gas imports, \n     has little room to expand shipments to the United States. Our \n     limited capacity to import liquefied natural gas effectively \n     restricts our access to the world's abundant supplies of \n     natural gas. The current tight domestic natural gas market \n     reflects the increases in demand over the past two decades. \n     That demand has been spurred by myriad new uses for natural \n     gas in industry and by the increased use of natural gas as a \n     clean-burning source of electric power.\n\n  I asked Mr. Greenspan to elaborate on that, and I will not read all \nof his remarks but this is the way he began his response to my question \non May 21:\n\n       Senator Alexander, I am surprised at how little attention \n     the natural gas problem has been getting. Because it is a \n     very serious problem. It's partly the result of new \n     technologies employed in the areas of growing technologies \n     and the whole exploratory procedures which embarked over the \n     last decade or so.\n\n  He talked about our contradictory Federal policies. This is not some \nabstract issue. The price of natural gas was $3.50 or so last summer. \nIt spiked to $9 or better in the winter. Today it is $6.25 or so. That \naffects the cost of heating and cooling our homes, but it affects our \njobs in a big way.\n  For example, someone from a large chemical industry in our State came \nto see me a few weeks ago when gas prices spiked up. The thousands of \nemployees there had taken a voluntary 3-percent cut in their pay. The \nmanagement had taken a 6-percent cut in their pay. They were worried \nabout the price of natural gas which is a raw material for that \nchemical industry.\n  It does not just affect the chemical industry. In California, for \nexample, where not much coal is burned because it pollutes the air, \nnatural gas effectively sets the price of electricity. So this emerging \ncrisis in natural gas affects jobs in the whole economy, as we have \nbeen debating.\n\n  There are answers but we have contradictory policies. We have plenty \nof gas but no access to the gas. We have a lot of alternatives, and we \nare trying to encourage them, but when we talk about windmills, we \nthink we may want a limit on the number of windmills we want to see. \nWhen we talk about nuclear, we have very close votes because people are \nskeptical about nuclear power. When we talk about coal, it pollutes the \nair. When we talk about drilling more oil, we vote no about going to \nAlaska. When we consider liquid gas from overseas, we are worried it \nmight blow up in big terminals on the sea coast. And hydrogen we all \nare for but it is 20 years away.\n  The bottom line: We have contradictory policies short term. This \ncould slow down our recovery and keep unemployment high and hurt our \njobs long term. It could mean electric rates go sky high and our \nmanufacturing jobs go to Mexico and China. We need to take an honest, \nhard look at the consequences of our failure to achieve a balance of \nnatural gas and its alternatives, and I hope this report required by \nthis amendment will help do just that. I will work with the chairman, \nwith the ranking member, to make certain our committee hearings help do \nthat, as well.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I understand that amendment will be \naccepted on both sides.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, that is correct. We support the \namendment and urge its passage.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Louisiana asked if she might speak for \n1 minute.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand the amendment offered by my colleague from \nTennessee will be accepted. That is good. It is a good amendment and \ncertainly should be part of this bill.\n  Since I am in the Chamber, I wish to speak a minute in support of the \namendment and add to the record he has so ably outlined. In one case in \nLouisiana--and there are many cases, but in one case Louisiana Ammonia \nProducers has gone from, in 1998, 9 companies employing more than 3,500 \npeople to 3 companies employing fewer than 1,000 people. Part of the \nreason for this tremendous decline at a time when we are trying to \ncreate jobs instead of losing them is the rising price of natural gas. \nThe price of natural gas, because supplies are so tight, in the first \nquarter of 2003, was $5.91 a million Btu's, a 129 percent increase over \nthe average price for the first quarter of the previous 10 years.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is absolutely right. A commission to study \nways to increase the supply of natural gas is critical and important if \nwe are going to keep the companies, large and small, in this country \ncompetitive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator. The first \ncomment was on a question the Senator put to Dr. Greenspan and his \nresponse about being surprised at how little attention was being paid \nto matters. We are quite proud that this committee started paying \nattention to natural gas as soon as we convened this year. Our first \nhearings indicated, through our experts, that we were going to have a \nserious shortage. We were questioning even then; that was only 3 or 4 \nmonths ago.\n  We have nothing further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The amendment (No. 880) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, staff is retyping the proposed agreement, \nbut to save time I wonder if we could go to the Bingaman amendment. \nOriginally, the plan was to vote on Bingaman and the Burma matter after \ndebate was completed on both issues. We have an objection on our side \nto doing that. We could go to the Bingaman amendment immediately, have \n40 minutes of debate equally divided, then following that have a vote \non or in relation to the Bingaman amendment, and then go to the Burma \nmatter after that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask Senator Campbell if that is all right.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 881\n\n       (Purpose: To provide for a significant environmental review \n     process associated with the development of Indian energy \n     projects, to establish duties of the federal government to \n     Indian tribes in implementing an energy development program, \n     and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered \n     881.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this is an amendment I am offering on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Inouye. It is an amendment that will make \nseveral changes in section 303 of the Indian energy title in this \nlegislation that is pending before the Senate.\n  First, a little background on these issues so my colleagues \nunderstand what is at stake. Title III of S. 14 contains a very strong \nIndian energy title. It would provide tribes with the financial and \ntechnical assistance they need to help them develop and utilize energy \nresources on Indian land.\n  This title III represents a combination of sections from two separate \nbills. One was introduced by Senator Campbell; the other was introduced \nby Senator Inouye and myself. I very much appreciate the willingness of \nthe majority to work with us and include in the bill now before the \nSenate a number of sections from the Bingaman-Inouye bill. Most of \nthese measures were included as part of last year's Senate-passed \nEnergy bill and were generally agreed to in the House-Senate conference \nwithout controversy. Unfortunately, as we all know, those sections did \nnot become law.\n  Notwithstanding the general support that exists for the Indian energy \ntitle in this bill, there is one section that is fairly controversial. \nThat is the subject of our amendment. It is section 2604. It would \nauthorize tribes to enter into leases and business agreements and issue \nrights-of-way for energy development projects on tribal lands without \nthe separate approval of the Secretary of the Interior. These leases \nand business agreements and rights-of-way would involve a broad range \nof energy projects, including oil and gas extraction, powerplants \ndevelopment and construction, and even some mining activity would be \ncovered under the language in the bill. This activity could take place \non any tribal trust lands, not just those on reservation but also lands \nthat have been designated as tribal trust lands off reservation. There \nare many of those, as we know.\n  There is no disagreement on whether we should allow tribes to \nexercise more control over development on tribal lands. There is, \nhowever, a disagreement on how we go about that.\n  The present language in section 2604 raises two significant issues. \nThe first is that by eliminating the Secretarial approval of leases and \nagreements and rights-of-way, section 2604 eliminates the ``major \nFederal action'' determination that triggers the application of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, NEPA. This effectively waives the \nanalysis and the public participation requirements that are in that \nlaw. It thereby reduces the ability to protect the interests of both \nthose residing on reservations and those residing in adjacent \ncommunities.\n\n  While a substantial environmental review process is included in \nsection 2604, it is limited in the range of impacts that require \nreview. It does not require the implementation of mitigation measures. \nIt does not require any changes in response to the concerns of affected \ntribal members or the concerns of local communities.\n  Obviously, eliminating NEPA is a concern to many national and local \nenvironmental groups and also to some Native American organizations \nthat have weighed in with strong letters on the issue. It is also of \nconcern to the counties around the country. In a letter dated May 14 of \nthis year, the National Association of Counties is calling for section \n2604 to be modified so that a NEPA analysis is completed for each new \nenergy project that goes forward on Indian lands.\n  There is a bipartisan group of attorneys general representing the \nStates of Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, North Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, and \nConnecticut that have also expressed strong concerns about the \ndiminishment of environmental review for tribal energy resource \ndevelopment projects. They have expressed their views in a letter dated \nJune 9 of this year. In that letter they wrote:\n\n       While we understand that this provision is intended to \n     promote the worthy goals of tribal self-determination and \n     sovereignty, we are concerned that it goes too far in \n     facilitating significant development activity without \n     ensuring that adequate protections exist for affected \n     communities and adjacent lands. Section 2604 represents a \n     significant change in the law that could have serious \n     implications for the States that we represent. We therefore \n     urge the provision be amended to ensure that significant \n     energy development activity on tribal lands continues to be \n     subject to meaningful environmental review, including an \n     ability for State and local governments to participate in the \n     process.\n\n  The concern expressed by those attorneys general and the counties \nunderscores the fact that without some applicable Federal law related \nto the significant development activity contemplated under this section \n2604, it is unclear what standard is to apply. Some have argued that \ntribal lands should be treated just as private lands are and tribes \nshould be free, as private landowners are, to go forward with \ndevelopment projects. In my view, that is not a good analogy because \nprivate lands are subject to State and local laws; tribal lands are \nnot. We are all aware that a private landowner has requirements by \nvirtue of State and local law that do not apply on tribal lands. Tribal \nlaw can and should apply to energy development on tribal lands, but at \nthe same time Congress has a responsibility to ensure that certain \nFederal parameters are in place.\n\n  The second issue that is raised by this section 2604 is that the \nlanguage in the section undermines the Secretary's trust responsibility \nto Indian tribes. A number of tribes have expressed strong concerns \nabout the language which appears to change the traditional trust \nrelationships between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Tribal \nconcern is driven by a decision 3 months ago by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin the case of United States v. Navajo Nation. The Supreme Court \nspecifically addressed the Federal trust responsibility and the \nstandard for ensuring that statutes affecting Native Americans contain \nfiduciary duties by which the Federal Government as trustee can be held \naccountable for its actions that may have serious and negative impacts \non tribal interests.\n  Section 2604, the subject of our amendment here, as currently drafted \ndoes not meet the standards established by the Supreme Court. In fact, \nit goes in the opposite direction. It diminishes the Federal \nGovernment's trust responsibility and accountability to tribes. This is \ninconsistent with the current Federal policy of tribal self-\ndetermination and self-governance. These policies, in effect since the \nlandmark Indian Self-Determination Act of 1975,\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\nclearly preserved the Federal trust responsibility and accountability \nto tribes while facilitating tribal control over Federal Indian \nprograms.\n  The amendment Senator Inouye and I are offering addresses both the \nenvironmental review question I talked about and the trust \nresponsibility issues, as well as other miscellaneous matters, in the \nhope that we can improve the final Indian energy title from a tribal \nperspective, from an environmental perspective, from a State \nperspective, and from a local perspective.\n  With respect to the environmental issue, the amendment does the \nfollowing four things:\n  No. 1, it ensures sufficient time for the Secretary to review the \nproposed tribal energy resource agreements without a waiver of Federal \nenvironmental laws.\n  No. 2, it improves the environmental review process so that it is \ncomparable to the standards required under NEPA, while maintaining \ntribal control over that review.\n  No. 3, it removes language limiting who can petition for a review of \nthe implementation of tribal energy resource agreements.\n  No. 4, it requires Congress to review and reauthorize this section of \nthe program 7 years from now, without it just continuing indefinitely.\n  With respect to trust responsibility, the amendment deletes language \nthat would prevent the tribes from asserting claims against the \nSecretary of the Interior related to the Secretary's approval of tribal \nenergy resource agreements. It also eliminates a broad waiver that \nlimits the liability of the United States for any losses associated \nwith the leases or with agreements or with rights-of-way.\n\n  The language being eliminated is unacceptable to a large number of \nIndian tribes. Because of the language, the Navajo Nation, the largest \ntribe in our country and the one involved in this recent Supreme Court \ndecision that I described, stated in a letter they sent to us dated \nJune 4 that the ``tribal energy proposal must be defeated.''\n  The letter goes on to say that the language, if successfully included \nin the bill:\n\n     . . . would be a virtual endorsement by the Indian tribes' \n     trustee itself [of course, that is the Federal Government], \n     of the fraud, dishonesty, and unethical treatment that was \n     the subject of the Navajo Nation's claim against the United \n     States, and would open the door for future similar conduct by \n     federal officials.\n\n  The Jicarilla Apache Tribe, in a letter dated April 28, stated that \nthe provisions currently in the bill ``are inconsistent with the United \nStates' trust relationship with Indian tribes . . .'' This is a \nquotation from their letter. They go on to say they would ``actually \nturn the current legal and political relationship between Indian tribes \nand the United States Government on its head.''\n  In addition to deleting most of the offending language, our amendment \nalso established Secretarial duties to the tribes in implementing \nsection 2604. In light of the United States v. Navajo Nation decision, \nwe view this language as necessary to maintain a trust relationship in \nwhich the Federal Government has some accountability to the tribes \nelecting to enter into agreements under section 2604. The language we \nare proposing to add is taken directly from the existing self-\ndetermination law and therefore relies on longstanding precedent.\n  Finally, our amendment includes a number of minor changes that are \ntechnical. I believe it is a good, constructive improvement to the \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam President, let me ask, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Bingaman \namendment. I will try to go through this as quickly as I can because I \nknow Senator Domenici also wants to speak.\n  On Thursday I introduced an amendment and withdrew it yesterday. That \namendment was supported by the National Congress of American Indians, \nwhich is over 300 tribes, the Council of Energy Resource Tribes, which \nrepresents 50 additional tribes, and the U.S. Eastern and Southern \nTribes, which represents 50. It was supported by five New Mexico \nPueblos, including the Jicarilla Apache Tribe of New Mexico, the \nNational Tribal Environmental Council, which represents 180 tribes, and \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  I pulled that back yesterday to refine some of the language but will \nbe reintroducing it shortly--tomorrow or as soon as I can, as soon as \nwe revise a little bit of the language.\n  Let me point out this chart I have over here. Under existing law, \ncurrent law, we have a real disparity among tribes. Tribes are treated \nlike individuals in that, if they own land and want to develop the land \nfor minerals or oil or gas, they could do it without complying with \nNEPA as individual owners or States can. If the Secretary gets involved \nby virtue of the tribe signing some agreement with an outside entity, \nshe has to then approve the lease or not approve the lease.\n\n  What has happened is that wealthy tribes have had the ability to \ndevelop their own resources. I live on one reservation, the Southern \nUte Reservation, and they do that; they don't have to comply with NEPA. \nMost tribes are not that wealthy and have to seek an outside partner. \nBasically, that puts them at a terrific disadvantage for developing \ntheir own resources.\n  I will not go into all resources now under Indian land because I did \ngo through that the other day, but it is very clear that a great deal \nof American unutilized oil, natural gas, coal, and other minerals are \nunder Indian land now. We are talking about a people who have 70 \npercent unemployment in some cases, so they definitely need the jobs \nand help as well as America needs the energy to become less dependent \non foreign energy.\n  In any event, let me go through the Bingaman amendment a little, if I \nmay. We spoke about 2604 primarily. As I understand it, and as I \nbelieve, Senator Bingaman's amendment would force the statutory NEPA \nequivalent upon all tribes. As it is now, some are not required to go \nthrough NEPA, as I just mentioned.\n  Also, it will create an unfunded mandate that will completely defeat \nthe goal of facilitating energy development on tribal lands and \ndiminish tribal sovereignty.\n  I take strong issue with another aspect of the Bingaman amendment \nhaving to do with the liability of the United States for tribal \ndecisions. Under title III, along with the power to create approved \nleases, agreements, and rights-of-ways without Secretarial approval, \nthe tribes have the responsibility for the decisions they make.\n  Mr. Bingaman's amendment in effect de-links the two, eliminating the \nlanguage that says the Secretary will not be liable for losses arising \nunder the terms of the leases the tribe negotiates on its own. That \nwould mean he would keep the Secretary on the hook for those losses \narising from lease terms negotiated by the tribe, even though the \nSecretary had nothing to do with the negotiations. I don't think that \nis very good policy, frankly.\n  Paradoxically, Senator Bingaman's amendments would give the Secretary \nof the Interior authority to negotiate a tribe's remedies against the \nUnited States for breach of its duties under the tariff on a tribe-by-\ntribe basis.\n  I know of one tribe--I believe two now--the Navajo, that supported \nthe Bingaman amendment but opposes this one. But I think it has very \nlittle to do with section 2604. It has more to do with court cases \nrecently which did not go their way. As I understand it, they really \nwant some language that would effectively bail them out of losing that \ncourt case.\n  The vast majority of tribes support the amendment that I introduced \nthe other day.\n  I think it is a particularly dangerous idea. In some instances, \nspeaking of the Secretary's obligations, the Secretary might \neffectively negotiate away her obligations, although by including a \nprovision that says the tribe will have no remedies against the United \nStates, the Bingaman amendment expressly allows her to do that without \nlimitation.\n  Do the obligations referred to in the Bingaman amendment include the \ntrust obligation? They must because there are no obligations on the \npart of the Secretary mentioned in his amendment other than duty to \nconduct annual trust evaluations.\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\n  I point out that in the amendment I offered the other day, in section \n2604 there was some question about whether it decreased trust \nresponsibility. I know my colleagues can read as I can. Let me read, on \npage 14, section (6)(a), line 19:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall absolve the United States \n     from any responsibility to Indians or Indian tribes, \n     including those which derive from the trust relationship or \n     from any treaties, Executive Orders, or agreements between \n     the United States and any Indian tribe.\n       The Secretary shall continue to have trust obligation to \n     ensure the rights of an Indian tribe are protected in the \n     event of a violation of Federal law or the terms of any \n     lease, business agreement or right-of-way under this section \n     or any other party to any such lease, business agreement or \n     right-of-way.\n\n  Under the amendment which I introduced and which I will reintroduce, \nthese trust responsibilities are very well protected.\n  Finally, Senator Bingaman's amendment would sunset section 2604 in 7 \nyears. I think that has somewhat of a chilling effect. First of all, if \na tribe wants to avail itself of section 2604 as an alternative to the \nstatus quo, it will have to make considerable effort to develop this \nrelationship and agreement to demonstrate its capacity to be able to \ndevelop its minerals resources.\n  Under the Bingaman amendment, the alternative procedure would \nevaporate in 7 years. Very frankly, the tribe advances to self-\ndetermination would evaporate right with it. I think that would \neffectively prevent any tribe from pursuing the section 2604 \nalternatives.\n  Senator Bingaman, as I understand his amendment, believes that \nsection 2604 effectively waives NEPA. It does not. The language in the \namendment expressly states that the Secretary must review the direct \neffects of her approving agreement under the provisions of NEPA. That \nmeans even though the tribe, when it is making agreements with an \noutside entity, will have to comply with NEPA upfront, before the \nSecretary can approve that agreement, she has to subscribe and conform \nto all NEPA provisions.\n  The other provisions in the section require an opportunity for public \nand local governmental input and comment.\n  The Senator mentioned some opposition from local communities. This is \nalso taken care of under 2604, and it must ensure compliance with all \napplicable environmental laws in 2604.\n  The Bingaman amendment also states that there is a tribal concern for \nsection 2604 as it undermines the trust responsibility. I have already \ndealt with that.\n  But, clearly, the United States is only held harmless from losses \narriving from terms negotiated by a tribe operating under an approved \nagreement. Hopefully, as we move forward, we will be able to deal with \nthe Navajo problem.\n  I understand the Navajo. It is a very important tribe. And I have \nmany friends in the tribe who are very willing to do that.\n  Very frankly, when we talk about the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment to Indians, let me go back a little bit and refresh my \ncolleagues' memory about how tough they have had it in this Nation.\n  This Government, as you know, took by hook or crook--and usually at \ngunpoint--roughly 98 percent of all the land from the American Indians. \nThis Government also reduced the very proud, independent people to the \npoorest ethnic group in America with the highest unemployment rate, the \nhighest degree of poor health, the highest high school dropout rate, \nand the highest suicide rate among any other group. This Government \nalso has time and again told the Indians: We know what is best for you \nwhether you like it or not.\n  That is basically what I think the Bingaman amendment does. We will \nstifle your religious beliefs, destroy your culture, relocate and \nrelegate you to a life of poverty and deprivation, as happened in the \n1950s under the Terminations Act and the Relocation Act. We will drive \nyou through a time bordering on ethnic cleansing, and we will not let \nyou be a citizen in your own land--until 1924. That is when Indians got \nthe right to vote in the United States.\n  Through all of those years, the few threads of hope Indians clung to \nwere that they would not lose what little they had left. And a few \nthings that gave them hope were closely held beliefs about so-called \nMother Earth, their belief in a creator, and that all things will get \nbetter. And one in particular was that U.S. Government promise; that \npromise is called ``trust responsibility.''\n  For the past 30 years, since the Nixon Doctrine of Self-\nDetermination, American Indians have been making small strides. But in \ntheir culture, they are rather big gains considering how far they have \ncome. It has been an endless struggle to try to share in the same \nAmerican dream that Members of this body take for granted.\n  In my view, the Bingaman amendment would literally strip tribes of 30 \nyears of that direction of self-determination and would circumvent the \ntrust responsibilities this Government has to tribes because it would \nforce the statutory equivalent of NEPA on all decisions they make with \ntheir own land. As I mentioned, it is an unfunded mandate.\n  I say to my colleagues in this body that if you want to keep American \nIndians on their knees, unable to provide jobs for their families and \nfacing a dead end future, then vote for the Bingaman amendment. If you \nbelieve that fairness should be right for all Americans, including \nIndians, to do best what they can with their own resources and for \ntheir own people, vote against the Bingaman amendment and help me craft \na better alternative, which is the one I mentioned that I introduced \nand pulled back and which I am going to reintroduce, and which already \nhas the support of the vast majority of Indian people in this Nation.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for giving \nme time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use 7 minutes and leave 3 minutes.\n  First, I congratulate the distinguished Senator Campbell from the \nState of Colorado. I don't believe I could say it any better.\n  In a nutshell, the Bingaman amendment is not good for the Indians in \nthe United States. If we are crafting a bill here that says we want \nthem to develop their energy resources, the amendment before us takes \nthe unprecedented step of applying the NEPA process to the Indian \ntribes just as if they were the Federal Government.\n  This amendment goes well beyond current environmental regulations and \nadds unnecessary regulations and costs to the tribal energy projects.\n  This proposal is opposed by numerous Indian tribes and tribal \nassociations that are already burdened by the lease approval process \nthrough the Federal bureaucracy.\n  I will read a list of Indian tribes and associations that I would \nassume do not favor the Bingaman amendment because they were in favor \nof the amendment alluded to by the distinguished Senator, Mr. Campbell, \nwith whom I was going to cosponsor, for they all refer to it:\n  The National Congress of American Indians, the Council of Energy \nResource Tribes, National Tribal Environmental Council, Southern Ute \nTribe, Cherokee Nation, Chickasaw Nation, Native American Energy Group, \nMohegan Tribe, Five Sandoval Indian Pueblos, Dine Power Corporation, \nJicarilla Apache Nation, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Tribal Letter Supporting Campbell/Domenici Amendment to Title III\n\n       1. National Congress of American Indians (NCAI)--Is the \n     largest and oldest Tribal organization.\n       2. Council of Energy Resource Tribes (CERT)--Represents \n     over 50 tribes interested in developing energy resources.\n       3. National Tribal Environmental Council--Represents 180 \n     tribes on environmental matters.\n       4. Southern Ute Tribe (Colorado).\n       5. Cherokee Nation (Oklahoma).\n       6. Chicasaw Nation (Oklahoma).\n       7. Native American Energy Group (Wyoming).\n       8. Mohegan Tribe (Connecticut).\n       9. Five Sandoval Indian Pueblos (New Mexico).\n       10. Dine Power Corporation--A Navajo Corporation (New \n     Mexico, Arizona).\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\n       11. Jicarilla Apache Nation (New Mexico).\n       12. U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the amendment will do the following:\n  It will force the tribes to pay the cost of NEPA, extend the \nbureaucratic delays of energy projects, and diminish tribal \nsovereignty.\n  There isn't a tribe in the country that would volunteer for this \nprogram because it doesn't do anything to improve their current \nprocess. So why would they volunteer to join it?\n  I am confused by the purpose of the amendment. If the intention is to \nmandate that the tribes comply with NEPA for every single lease or \npermit, why not offer an amendment to strike the entire Indian energy \ntitle and argue for the status quo?\n  This amendment goes far beyond existing law and expands NEPA beyond \nthe scope of the Federal Government to cover tribes, independent of any \nFederal action.\n  By requiring an environmental impact statement to be performed for \nevery lease, it will impose a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars \nto be financed by the tribes. A cost they should not have to afford.\n\n  If adopted, the amendment would encourage the generation of paper, \nnot the generation of natural gas and crude oil and coal, which I \nthought we were here supposed to do.\n  The objective of title III has to be to help the tribes by \nstreamlining current lease approval processes that have hampered \ninvestment and the development of the Indian tribal lands as far as \nenergy is concerned.\n  Senator Campbell and I have worked closely with the tribes to craft a \ncareful compromise that will protect the trust responsibility of the \nSecretary and the environment. That bill will be offered later, but it \nis not the bill pending before the Senate. It is a bill you will know \nbecause it will bear the name of the distinguished chairman of the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, Senator Campbell.\n  The Secretary's approval of the tribes' energy resource agreement \nwill trigger NEPA if the Secretary of the Interior believes it will \nhave a significant impact on the environment. Once an energy resource \nagreement is approved, tribes will not be required to seek Secretarial \napproval but will be required to comply with relevant environmental \nlaws, just like any other landowner.\n  Senator Campbell and I have worked with tribes to ensure that the \ntrust relationship between tribes and the Secretary of the Interior is \nprotected.\n  This proposal is embodied in the Campbell-Domenici amendment which \nwill be offered at a later date.\n  The Bingaman amendment, however, would require the Secretary of the \nInterior to take full responsibility for all liability incurred by \ntribes--even if the Secretary wasn't party to the negotiations. That \nsimply doesn't make sense.\n  However, a separate and conflicting provision in this amendment \nallows the Secretary to negotiate all remedies to the Secretary's trust \nresponsibility in the energy resource agreement.\n  As I read it this will give the Secretary authority to drive a hard \nbargain with individual tribes that are desperate to gain the \nSecretary's approval of their energy resource agreement. Of course, \nthis will vary from tribe to tribe and further confuse the trust \nissues.\n  I believe a more simple solution is to ensure that tribes take full \nresponsibility for the leases and business agreements they negotiate. \nThe Secretary will not be liable for anything she is not a party to, \nbut will continue to conduct annual trust evaluation to ensure that the \nassets are protected.\n  Such a solution as included in the Campbell amendment has the support \nof many tribes.\n  I am not aware that the administration has reviewed the Bingaman \namendment and I am not aware of how many tribes support Senator \nBingaman's amendment.\n  The current system has failed to stimulate investment on Indian land, \ndespite the resource potential.\n  The Bingaman amendment will only exacerbate this problem and continue \nto restrict the quest for Tribal self-determination.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Bingaman amendment.\n  I will state, I would not be offering these kinds of remarks in any \nnormal situation regarding the relationship between the Indian people, \nthe Federal Government, and third parties. But clearly when you have an \nenergy bill, and the purpose of the bill is to have a section in it \nthat will encourage, will cause, will say to the Indian people, we want \nyou to be players, participants, owners of energy, so that you can be \npart of America's energy solutions and become owners in that solution, \nthen I think we cannot adopt the laws that are as restrictive as the \nones proposed in the amendment that is pending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise this moment to speak in favor of an \namendment proposed by my dear friend from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman.\n  I find it rather uncomfortable and sad that my remarks may be counter \nto that of my colleague from New Mexico, my dear friend, Mr. Domenici, \nand my colleague, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. President, as you know, there is a longstanding relationship \nbetween the United States and the sovereign Indian nations that won \nexercise, exclusive dominion, and control over lands that now comprise \nour great country.\n  The large body of Federal Indian law is known as trust \nresponsibility, and it was first given expression by the Chief Justice \nof the United States Supreme Court, John Marshall, in 1832. This \nrelationship is premised upon the sovereignty of the Indian nations, a \nsovereignty that existed well before the U.S. Government was formed, \nand it is memorialized in the United States Constitution.\n  This trust relationship that has always formed the course of dealings \nbetween the U.S. and Indian tribes is well understood and beyond \ndebate. The United States holds legal title to lands that it held in \ntrust for Indian tribes. Accordingly, activities affecting Indian lands \nand resources have always been subject to approval by the Secretary of \nthe Interior Department, acting as the principal agent for the United \nStates. That is the law of the land.\n  In the Congress, we have always understood the United States trust \nresponsibility as being derived from treaties, statutes, regulations, \nexecutive orders, rulings, and agreements between the Federal \nGovernment and Indian tribal governments. We have legislated on this \nbasis. The courts have issued rulings on this basis. And until recently \nthe executive branch has premised policy on this basis and promulgated \nregulations on this fundamental principle of law.\n  However, in the arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this \nyear, the Government took the position that the duties of the U.S., as \ntrustee for Indian lands and resources, exist only as they may be \nspelled out in statute, and are legally enforceable only if a statute \nprovides a remedy for any breach of the trust.\n  The Supreme Court accepted the Government's argument that the duties \nof the trustee must be spelled out in statute, but ruled that as long \nas the Government had complete management control over the trust land \nor trust resources at issue, then the trustee's duties could be legally \nenforced and there could be a damage remedy for a breach of the \nGovernment's trust duties.\n  Tribal governments are also paying keen attention to the arguments \nthat are being advanced by the Government in pending legislation over \nthe management of funds which are held in trust by the United States \nfor individual Indians and Indian tribes. Most of us have heard of the \nassertions in this case in which it maintained that the Government is \nunable to account for more than $2 billion in Indian trust funds.\n  With the Government's advocacy for a new perspective on the United \nStates trust responsibility, it is readily apparent why the eyes of \nIndian country are sharply focused on the tribal provisions of this \nbill and the amendments that are the subject of our discussion today.\n\n  Native America wants to see what position the Congress will adopt as \nit relates to the ongoing viability of the trust relationship. They are \nclosely scrutinizing our words and our actions in the context of this \nmeasure to determine whether they signal a departure from the \ntraditional and well-established principles of the United States trust \nresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\n  That is why I believe it is incumbent upon us to make sure we \nunderstand what is at stake in this debate. There has always been, and \nlikely always will be, a tension between a greater measure of tribal \ncontrol and a diminished Federal presence in Indian country, one that \nhas to be reconciled in each distinct area. But the reality is that as \nlong as the United States holds legal title to Indian lands, the \nFederal Government and tribal governments will have to work together on \nthese matters.\n  Not all tribal governments have managed their resources, and not all \nof those who do seek to develop those resources. But for those that do, \nwe well understand that they would want to reduce the amount of time \nthat is customarily involved in securing the Secretary's approval of \nleases of tribal land and grants of right of way over Indian lands.\n  Can this be accomplished without altering or diminishing the trust \nrelationship? I believe it can. The tribal industry resource agreements \nthat are authorized, the amendment that we consider today, can serve as \nan instrument for defining and adapting this relationship to \naccommodate the unique circumstances of each tribe's energy resource \ndevelopment objectives.\n  But should the United States trust responsibility for Indian lands \nand resources be waived? I am not aware of any tribal government that \nsupports an unlimited waiver of the United States trust responsibility. \nCertainly, one of the largest land-based tribes in the United States, \nthe Navajo Nation, has made it clear that it will not countenance such \na waiver.\n  Indian country has a long history and a long memory. That history \ndocuments the sad reality that there have been too many times in the \npast when those who did not have the best interests of Indian country \nin mind have exploited tribal lands and resources and then walked away.\n  In those instances, tribal governments and the United States shared a \ncommon interest in addressing the damage to tribal lands and in \npursuing those who caused the damage.\n  Mr. President, I think it is clear that the provisions of this title \nas currently formulated, and if not further amended, will foreclose the \ncause of action when there is damage to tribal lands. So I join my \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman, in sponsoring this amendment because I \nbelieve strongly in Federal Indian responsibility for Indian lands, and \nthe resources must be maintained and strengthened, not diminished.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 16 minutes.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. We have 20 minutes; correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair that no \nagreement has been reached about the time limit on this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I will just make a couple of comments. \nSenator Inouye and I have been friends for a great number of years. \nWhen he was chairman, and now as the ranking member, we have worked on \nan awful lot of Indian legislation together.\n  With all due respect, I think he might be mistaken about what 2604 \ndid. In fact, maybe something else, too, and that is simply this. \nTribes, generally, if they are not absolutely sure of themselves when \nthey enter into agreements, or when they are dealing with the Federal \nGovernment, hire pretty sophisticated attorneys to do the research for \nthem. All of these different groups, including the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians, representing over 300 tribes; the Council of Energy \nResource Tribes, representing over 50 tribes; the U.S. Eastern and \nSouthern Tribes, representing over 50 tribes; the Pueblos of New \nMexico; the Jicarilla Apache Tribe of New Mexico; and the National \nTribal Environmental Council have had attorneys look at 2604 and, \nclearly, none of them has said anything about erosion of trust \nresponsibility because--and I mentioned earlier--it is stated in 2604, \non page 14, line 18 through page 15, line 3, that, if anything, tribal \ntrust relationship is strengthened under 2604, which is the amendment I \nintroduced the other day and am going to reintroduce.\n  Unlike the Bingaman amendment, which I think, frankly, weakens trust \nresponsibility--as near as I can tell, the language in his amendment \nweakens it. That is one of the questions: which one strengthens it and \nwhich one weakens it? My belief is that 2604 would be strengthened with \nthe language I will be reintroducing.\n  The other one is NEPA. I do not believe, frankly, that tribes are off \nthe hook for NEPA unless they want to develop resources with their own \nmoney on their own land without outside agreements or Secretarial \napproval. Once the Secretary looks into it, or agrees to take it up \nafter they have reached some negotiated agreement, she has to conform \nwith all NEPA requirements. That is clear in 2604. Nobody is off the \nhook from NEPA for trust responsibility.\n  One more thing. Under 2604, which hasn't been mentioned, and the \namendment that I introduced and will reintroduce, no tribe needs to \nparticipate in this agreement at all. It is totally voluntary, tribe by \ntribe. Senator Bingaman mentioned that the Navajo Nation was not \nsupportive of 2604 and my amendment. That is all right; they don't have \nto participate. This is open for the tribes that want to, and those \nthat do not want to don't have to.\n\n  As I understand the Bingaman amendment, they are all going to be \ncaught in the same net. That is, they will all be required to come up \nwith the money, as Senator Domenici mentioned, to subscribe to NEPA \neven before they reach an agreement. They don't have the money to do \nthat. All it is going to do is prevent tribes from moving forward in \nthis Nation.\n  I have no further comments. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thought we agreed to 20 minutes on \neach side.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is my understanding. I was hoping we would have a \nvote right away. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has consumed 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They want to set it aside and go to the Burma measure. \nWe had 20 minutes on each side, but they want to proceed to the Burma \ndebate and vote, stacked, with yours going first.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thought the agreement was that we would have a vote \non ours.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They want to stack them.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we entered into an agreement, and we all \nthought there was going to be a vote following this 40 minutes of \ndebate. The majority leader was not part of that agreement. In \ndeference to him, we will not push our 40-minute vote. We will agree to \ngo to that. That time is gone now, isn't it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We were anxious to get a vote. Senator Schumer wanted \nto be here for a vote. He had to leave. He indicates he will have to \nleave.\n  Mr. REID. He has left.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I request that we do our vote so he can be here later \non. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What was the request again?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time would remain on our side if we had \nentered into that agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will use those 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the underlying bill, which we are trying to amend \nhere, has in it really clear language that essentially lets the \nSecretary of the Interior off the hook. It eliminates responsibilities \nthat the Secretary of the Interior would otherwise have. It says the \nUnited States shall not be liable for any loss or injury sustained by \nany party, including an Indian tribe, or any member of an Indian tribe, \nto a lease,\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\nbusiness agreement, right-of-way, executed in accordance with the \ntribal energy resource agreements approved under this subsection.\n  Then it says that on approval of a tribal energy resource agreement \nof an Indian tribe, under paragraph 1, the Indian tribe shall be \nestopped from asserting a claim against the United States on the \ngrounds that the Secretary should not have approved this agreement.\n  That is a clear statement by the Congress--if that becomes law--that \nthe Secretary of the Interior is off the hook. This may be on Indian \ntrust land. It may be that the Secretary of the Interior is the trustee \nof that Indian trust land. We are saying in this language--if we don't \namend it by the amendment Senator Inouye and I have prepared, we are \nsaying that the Secretary of the Interior is off the hook and the \nIndian tribe has no one to go to for any kind of remedy. I don't think \nwe intend to do that.\n  Senator Inouye and I have put together an amendment we believe keeps \ntrust responsibility with the Federal Government, where it should be. \nIt sets up a good procedure that the tribe can work with the Federal \nGovernment. The tribe still has decisions, makes decisions over these \nenergy development projects, but clearly the Federal Government needs \nto be part of that and needs to have responsibility for seeing that \ndecisions are in the best interest of the tribe.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a good amendment. I hope that once we \ndo get to a vote, whenever that occurs, we will see this amendment \nadopted. It will strengthen the bill, and I hope very much we can \napprove it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I rise in support of the amendment offered by Senator \nBingaman.\n  His amendment does not go as far as I would wish, because it does not \nfully preserve the integrity of NEPA or the Endangered Species Act.\n  These two Federal statutes, which are under the jurisdiction of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, have been cornerstones for the \nprotection of environmental quality for decades. Section 2604 of the \nbill negates or weakens application of these laws to most energy \ndevelopment on tribal lands.\n  Section 2604 would allow tribes to grant leases or rights-of-way for \nmineral development, electric generation, transmission or distribution \nfacilities or facilities to process energy resources of any sort on \ntribal lands.\n  The tribes could do this without the approval of the Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  This would effectively remove the current legislative authority of \nthe Department of the Interior over these matters.\n  Under existing law, the oversight of the Secretary of the Interior \nover energy development on tribal lands triggers a variety of Federal \npermitting requirements which will ensure that NEPA, section 7 of the \nEndangered Species Act, and a variety of other Federal laws will apply \nto these activities.\n  Removal of the Secretary's approval authority over many of these \nactions would have a number of consequences.\n  First, it would mean that Federal NEPA laws would no longer apply. It \nwould also mean that the section 7 Federal consultation provisions of \nthe Endangered Species Act would cease to apply.\n  This is particularly significant in that tribal lands are often \nadjacent to some of the most protected and pristine Federal lands, \nincluding wildlife refuges, wilderness areas, and National Parks. \nWholesale changes in the application of the Federal mineral leasing and \ndevelopment laws--and potentially a host of environmental laws--to \ntribal lands, could have significant impacts on adjacent sensitive \nlands, air quality, water quality and wildlife.\n  Because of their sovereign immunity and special trust status, tribes \nare also generally exempt from many State environmental and other laws, \nto which private lands are subject.\n  Section 2604 represents a sweeping reversal of years and years of \nestablished environmental and energy laws, many of which are within the \njurisdiction of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Our \ncommittee has never held hearings on this, nor had the opportunity to \nexamine the extent to which this language would weaken or amend Federal \nenvironmental laws, or laws relating to the development of commercial \nnuclear power.\n  My preference would be to insert language which I filed yesterday, \nwhich would clarify that Federal environmental and nuclear laws would \ncontinue to apply to these tribal lands, regardless of removing the \napproval of the Secretary of the Interior under the Indian Mineral \nDevelopment Act.\n  However, because I think that the language offered by Senator \nBingaman has a greater chance for success, I will vote in favor of his \namendment.\n  At a minimum, his amendment would remove any implicit waiver of \nFederal environmental laws and would create an environmental review \nprocess to be conducted by tribes to ensure at lease some modicum of \npublic involvement in what could possibly be massive energy development \non tribal lands.\n  Section 2604 creates an unprecedented lack of Federal oversight for \ndevelopment with potentially massive environmental impacts, and I urge \nmy colleagues to adopt Senator Bingaman's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we yield back our time on our side. I \nmove to table the Bingaman amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. 1215, the Burma sanctions bill; \nthat there then be 60 minutes of debate equally divided under the \ncontrol of myself and the Democratic leader or his designee; further, \nthat no amendments be in order other than a substitute amendment and a \ntechnical amendment to that substitute.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will have none. But when the matters that have just \nbeen agreed upon have been completed, we will then have another \namendment on the Energy bill.

Reserving the right to object, the two leaders have \nindicated that we would have more debate on that in the morning, \nhowever, on the offshore oil inventory. I don't know what time they are \ngoing to schedule a vote, but I think it will be sometime in the \nmorning and that will be worked out later tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to comment, before we proceed, just a \nfurther 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have been working very hard to get a complete list--\nI think we are very close--of amendments we can agree to and put at the \ndesk. As everybody knows, a lot is riding on this Energy bill: a full \nethanol package; soon there will be the renewables that many are \nrelying on in this country which have extenders that are required that \nare part of the tax amendments that are going to go on this bill. Those \nare providing for the existing--continuation of the renewables in the \narea of wind and Sun and others. If we do not get the bill moving, none \nof that moves along.\n  So I do ask all Senators who have amendments to concur that they can \nwrite them up, get them in, get them on this list so we know where we \nare and when we might look for daylight on this bill. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, the chairman of the committee, we have a list on our side. \nWe are now waiting. Tentative lists have been exchanged by the two \nsides. As far as we are concerned, we are ready at any time to enter \ninto that agreement. We do have a finite list of amendments. As soon as \nwe get a finite list of amendments from the majority, a unanimous \nconsent agreement could go forward at that time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1215) to sanction the ruling Burmese military \n     junta, to strengthen Burma's democratic forces and support \n     and recognize the National League of Democracy as the \n     legitimate representative of the Burmese people, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the situation in Burma is indeed dire \nand requires our immediate response. We will make that response within \nthe next hour.\n  S. 1215, which is now the pending business in the Senate, has 56 \ncosponsors. I particularly want to thank Senator Feinstein, who will be \nspeaking on this measure, and Senator McCain, who have had a particular \ninterest in this subject for quite some time.\n  Until yesterday, Aung San Suu Kyi and other democracy activists have \nbeen held incommunicado by the repressive State Peace and Development \nCouncil, SPDC, following an ambush on her convoy several hundred \nkilometers north of Rangoon. Scores are feared murdered and injured in \nthis blatant assault on democracy in Burma.\n  In the 11th hour of his trip to Rangoon, the SPDC finally allowed \nU.N. Special Envoy Razali Ismail a 15-minute meeting with Suu Kyi. We \nare all relieved that his initial statements indicate that she is alive \nand unharmed, but the fate of other activists arrested remains unknown.\n  But simply seeing is not freeing. Razali's meeting with Suu Kyi was \nnot a private one and she remains under the total control of SPDC \nthugs. Her continued silence in the wake of this bloodshed could not be \nmore deafening, nor--despite Razali's brief visit--her predicament more \npressing.\n  Horrific details of the attack continue to emerge and heighten the \nneed for a swift and decisive response to the SPDC's brutality.\n  According to Monday's front-page article in the Washington Post, in \nthe ``pitch dark amid the rice paddies'' thugs posing as Buddhist monks \nstopped Suu Kyi's car. Soon after, a crowd ``set upon her convey, \nattacking the entourage with wooden clubs and bamboo spikes. . . . \nSeveral hundred more assailants ambushed the motorcade from the rear.''\n  This is no simple act of harassment or intimidation. It was an act of \nterrorism against innocent civilians who simply believe in democracy \nand the rule of law in Burma.\n  The free world and free press have been quick to condemn the SPDC. \nBut strong words from foreign capitals must be matched by stronger \nactions.\n  Last week, I introduced the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003, along with Senators Feinstein and McCain. As I indicated earlier, \nwe now have 56 cosponsors. I ask unanimous consent that the list be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           S. 1215 cosponsors\n\n       Akaka, Alexander, Allard, Allen, Baucus, Bennett, Biden, \n     Bingaman, Boxer, Breaux, Brownback, Bunning, Burns, \n     Chambliss, Clinton, Coleman, Collins, Corzine, Daschle, \n     Dayton, Dole, Domenici, Dorgan, Durbin, Edwards, Feingold, \n     Feinstein, Frist, and Grassley.\n       Hagel, Harkin, Hutchison, Jeffords, Kennedy, Kerry, Kyl, \n     Lautenberg, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Lugar, McCain, Mikulski, \n     Murkowski, Murray, Nelson, Ben (Nebraska), Reid, Rockefeller, \n     Santorum, Sarbanes, Schumer, Smith, Specter, Stabenow, \n     Voinovich, and Wyden.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this bill, among other sanctions, \nimposes a ban on imports from Burma.\n  I am pleased that many of my colleagues--including the majority and \nminority leaders of the Senate and the chairmen and ranking members of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations and Finance Committees--are cosponsors of \nthis important legislation.\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of the feedback we have gotten \nfrom around the country on the act:\n  An editorial in today's Los Angeles Times stated:\n\n       [Burma's] trading partners, other countries in the region \n     and aid givers like Japan need to get tougher by imposing \n     sanctions and aid suspensions to push the country toward \n     democracy; that's the outcome Myanmar's citizens show they \n     favor every time they get the chance.\n\n  By the way, they haven't gotten a chance since 1990.\n  A Washington Post editorial yesterday advised that because Burmese \ndictators ``control the nation' economy, an import ban would affect \nthose most responsible for Burma's repression, and senators supportive \nof democracy in Asia should vote for the bill without conditions or \nexpiration dates.''\n  Deputy Secretary of State Rich Armitage recently wrote:\n\n     . . . we support the goal and intent of this legislation and \n     agree on the need for many similar measures. . . . We are \n     also considering an import ban, as proposed in your \n     legislation.\n\n  A June 6 editorial in the Washington Post suggested that:\n\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\n\n       While the [Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act] moves through \n     Congress, Mr. Bush could implement many of its provisions by \n     executive order. He could find no better way to demonstrate \n     his commitment to democracy and his revulsion at a brutal \n     dictatorship.\n\n  A New York Times editorial endorsed the import ban and recommended \nthat:\n\n       Europe . . . should now block Myanmar's exports as well. \n     The junta has had a year to demonstrate that its opening was \n     genuine. Now all ambiguity is gone, and the world's response \n     must be equally decisive.\n\n  A Boston Globe editorial stated that President Bush:\n\n     . . . could and should issue an executive order that would \n     swiftly accomplish [an import ban]. This is not a partisan \n     matter. The great lesson that ought to have been learned in \n     the last century is that free democrats betray their unfree \n     brothers and sisters when they seek to appease dictatorships.\n\n  Dallas Morning News editor at large Rena Pederson, who also penned a \nsuperb article on this topic in the Weekly Standard, wrote in an op-ed:\n\n       The strongest possible pressure must be turned on the \n     Burmese generals, who apparently calculated their opposition \n     could be decapitated while the world was preoccupied with \n     events in the Middle East. They shouldn't be allowed to get \n     away with such a cowardly fast one. The Bush administration \n     should support tougher sanctions now. Senator Mitch \n     McConnell, R-KY., is pushing for increased sanctions.\n\n  That is the bill we have before us.\n  ``He will need help . . .''\n  And we obviously are going to have help with 56 cosponsors, and I \nhope a very overwhelming vote shortly.\n  ``He will need help, or the Bush administration could accomplish the \nsame thing by executive order.''\n  A Baltimore Sun editorial rightly concluded: ``. . . this regime \nought to be treated somewhat like North Korea, from which imports have \nlong been barred.''\n  Finally, in endorsing the act, the American Apparel and Footwear \nAssociation called upon ``the rest of Congress for the swift and \nimmediate passage of such import legislation.''\n  The idea of a ban on imports from Burma is not a new one to this \nbody. In he 107th Congress, S. 926 sought to impose such restrictions \nand was cosponsored by 21 Senators. I would offer that the need for an \nimportant ban has only become more urgent in the wake of the May 30 \nattack on democracy in Burma.\n  Supporters of a free Burma want America to take the lead in defending \ndemocracy in that country.\n  Supporters of a free Burma believe that serving the cause of freedom \nis America's challenge and obligation. We should not abandon the people \nof Burma during the greatest moments of need. The people of Burma have \nmade their aspirations known, and the regime has not silenced them into \nsubmission. They have not stilled their hearts for political change and \nthey will not succeed in stemming our collective resolve.\n  Supporters of a free Burma agree with President Bush that:\n\n       Men and women in every culture need liberty like they need \n     food and water and air. Everywhere that freedom arrives, \n     humanity rejoices: and everywhere that freedom stirs, let \n     tyrants fear.\n\n  It's time for tyrants to fear in Burma.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following items be printed in the \nRecord: a Washington Post article dated June 9; a letter from Under \nSecretary of State Rich Armitage; editorials from the Los Angeles \nTimes, and the Baltimore Sun, and a Rena Pederson article in the Weekly \nStandard.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 9, 2003]\n\n          Attack on Burmese Activist Seen as Work of Military\n\n                 (By Alan Sipress and Ellen Nakashima)\n\n       Bangkok, June 8.--Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu \n     Kyi's motorcade was rattling along a pocked one-lane road \n     near Mandalay in Northern Burma after the sunset when a pair \n     of men, disguised in the burnt orange robes of Buddhist \n     monks, motioned for it to stop. They asked her to alight and \n     make an impromptu speech to at least 100 people gathered at a \n     narrow bridge over a creek and blocking her way, according to \n     Burmese exiles who spoke with witnesses. But she was running \n     late. It was already pitch dark amid the rice paddies.\n       When one of her bodyguards, a young unarmed man, got out of \n     the four-wheel-drive vehicle to convey Suu Kyi's regrets, the \n     crowd set upon her convoy, attacking the entourage with \n     wooden clubs and bamboo spikes, according to the exiles and \n     diplomats who also have spoken to witnesses. Several hundred \n     more assailants ambushed the motorcade from the rear.\n       By the time the battle was over late in the evening of May \n     30, at least four of Suu Kyi's bodyguards were dead. Burmese \n     exiles and diplomats said scores of her supporters were also \n     probably killed. And Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize \n     laureate, suffered head and shoulder injuries, they said, \n     when her car windows were shattered and she was detained by \n     Burmese soldiers along with at least 17 supporters.\n       U.S. and other diplomats have concluded that the attack was \n     an ambush orchestrated by Burma's military rulers and carried \n     out by a pro-government militia reinforced by specially \n     trained prison inmates.\n       Suu Kyi, 57, has remained in custody, incommunicado and out \n     of public sight ever since, prompting protests from the \n     United Nations, the United States other governments.\n       The attack was not only a stunning bid to intimidate Suu \n     Kyi and deflate a pro-democracy movement that over recent \n     months had been attracting larger and larger crowds despite \n     mounting governmental harassment, according to exiles and \n     diplomats in Rangoon and Bangkok. It was also an effort by \n     Burma's top leader, Gen. Than Shwe, who had been \n     consolidating control in recent months, to make clear he had \n     lost patience with those in the military advocating dialogue \n     with Suu Kyi.\n       ``This was a brutal power play to show them who is in \n     charge here,'' a European diplomat said. ``This was a message \n     from Than Shwe to the softies in the military that you [had] \n     better watch out. You are not to tolerate Aung San Suu Kyi.''\n       Although supporters of political reform have despaired of \n     progress for months, the attack outside Mandalay--the \n     bloodiest confrontation since Burma crushed a pro-democracy \n     uprising in 1988--could mark the end to the spring of hope \n     that began almost exactly one year ago.\n       Under intense international pressure, the Burmese \n     government had released Suu Kyi from house arrest in May \n     2002. Some high-ranking military officers had calculated that \n     Suu Kyi's popularity had faded during her detention and that \n     she no longer posed the same threat as she had in 1990 when \n     her party, the National League for Democracy, won a landslide \n     election victory, Burmese and other analysts said. Those \n     results were voided by the military, plunging Burma into its \n     current political crisis and a decade of international \n     isolation.\n       The Burmese government, however, discovered that Suu Kyi \n     still attracted jubilant crowds when she traveled the country \n     reopening nearly 200 local offices for her party. Tens of \n     thousands turned out to chant her name. Many supporters \n     walked miles to see her. Increasingly, her rallies drew \n     Buddhist monks, who command great respect in Burmese society, \n     further alarming the military.\n       ``They are worried that despite all the threats they can \n     employ against the pro-democracy movement, people are \n     continuing to go out and see Aung San Suu Kyi,'' said Win \n     Min, a Burmese researcher who studies civilian-military \n     relations.\n       Suu Kyi, who has always preached reconciliation, was also \n     becoming openly critical of the government's unwillingness to \n     engage in meaningful dialogue for a political settlement. The \n     optimism that accompanied her release from house arrest had \n     long dissipated.\n       These developments were an affront to Than Shwe, the \n     junta's leader, who so loathes Suu Kyi that, as one European \n     diplomat said, he ``hates even to hear her name mentioned.''\n       Than Shwe, 70, chairman of the ruling State Peace and \n     Development Council and armed forces commander, has moved \n     since last year to strengthen his grip on power. He has \n     beefed up the United Solidarity and Development Association, \n     the pro-government militia that witnesses said attacked Suu \n     Kyi's motorcade. He has manipulated the military, government \n     and courts to weaken his leading rivals while placing his \n     loyalists in influential post, said diplomats and Burmese \n     exiles.\n       ``Than Shwe has been taking his time,'' said Zin Linn of \n     the opposition National Coalition Government of the Union of \n     Burma. ``He has purged many of the senior military men who \n     are soft-liners and are in some way impressed with Aung San \n     Suu Kyi'' and Tin Oo, the vice chairman of her party.\n       Most notably, Than Shwe's ascent has come at the expense of \n     Gen. Khin Nyunt, 64, the head of military intelligence and a \n     leading advocate of dialogue with Suu Kyi. His patron, former \n     dictator Gen. Ne Win, died in December. While Khin Nyunt \n     remains the third-highest-ranking official in the junta, his \n     authority in running military intelligence has been limited \n     and he has told diplomats that he no longer has a mandate to \n     pursue the reconciliation talks, which had been medicated by \n     U.N. special envoy Razali Ismail.\n       The dispute pits so-called pragmatists, such as Khin Nyunt, \n     who believe Burma can string out the talks with Suu Kyi while \n     placating foreign governments, against officers urging that \n     the pro-democracy movement be crushed. But diplomats and \n     analysts stress that the military is united in its \n     determination to retain power.\n       Suu Kyi's recent month-long swing through northern Burma \n     offered an opportunity for Than Shwe to deliver a resounding \n     message to the pragmatists that their moment had passed, \n     diplomats and exiles said.\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\n       As expedition to the northernmost state of Kachin, which \n     began May 6, was her seventh road trip since her release. It \n     was meant in part to bolster the morale of loyalists in her \n     party, who were disappointed that the reconciliation talks \n     had ground to a halt, said Debbie Stothard, coordinator of \n     ALTSEAN-Burma, a human rights group in Southeast Asia.\n       The trips, especially this last, had provoked growing \n     harassment by the government, which has staged protests by \n     machete-wielding activists, blasted music to drown out Suu \n     Kyi's speeches and blocked her way with logs and barbed wire. \n     At least once, a firetruck turned its hoses on her \n     supporters.\n       If the military wanted to escalate the confrontation, \n     Sagaing Division northwest of Mandalay was a good place, \n     Burmese exiles and diplomats said. This impoverished region \n     is the stronghold of Lt. Gen. Soe Win, a Sagaing native and \n     former military commander in the area. He was promoted by \n     Than Shwe in February to the junta's fourth-highest position. \n     Soe Win is also a leading activist in the militia and had \n     toured several towns earlier this year demanding that \n     dialogue with Suu Kyi be halted.\n       Diplomats and exiles said they have received reports that \n     Soe Win was at a military headquarters in nearby Monywa \n     either during or shortly before the ambush against Suu Kyi's \n     motorcade. Exiles said they believe he ran the operation.\n       Military officials knew Suu Kyi was coming. She had been \n     required to give them her itinerary.\n       ``Clearly, orders were given for a violent attack,'' a U.S. \n     Embassy official in Rangoon said.\n       The following account of the May 30 attack was provided by \n     that official based on the findings of a two-person U.S. \n     Embassy team dispatched to Sagaing Division late last week to \n     investigate the incident. Much of the story has been \n     corroborated by information from witnesses provided to other \n     diplomats and exiles.\n       As Suu Kyi's motorcade traveled north toward the town of \n     Dipeyin about two miles from Monywa, it was met by 100 to 200 \n     people at the bridge. Most of them were disguised as monks \n     but shed the costumes when the fighting erupted. About 400 \n     other convicts and militia recruits disguised as monks with \n     shaved heads, and wearing white armbands, blocked the \n     motorcade from behind.\n       Though Suu Kyi's supporters tried to assuage the mob, the \n     assailants began beating them and smashing the vehicles' \n     windows. Trying to stave off the attack and shelter Suu Kyi, \n     members of her party stood on the road and locked arms.\n       At the site, the investigating team found bloodied clothes, \n     clubs and spears, broken glass and debris from damaged \n     vehicles.\n       ``It was pretty clear that a big fight had taken place,'' \n     the embassy official said.\n       The team's findings contradict the brief version provided \n     by the government--that the confrontation lasted two hours \n     and was provoked by Suu Kyi's party. The government said four \n     people were killed and 50 others injured.\n       The U.S. team reported that gunfire was heard in the middle \n     of the night when the army arrived to clean up the site. \n     According to other accounts, gunshots rang out during or \n     shortly after the clash.\n       Reports reaching other diplomats and exile groups said Suu \n     Kyi's driver, trying to remove the democracy activist from \n     the melee, gunned the engine as the crowd pounded the car \n     with rocks and other objects. She was detained by security \n     forces farther down the road in Dipeyin.\n       Tin Oo, 75, the vice chairman of Suu Kyi's party, was \n     assaulted when he left his car, according to Burmese exiles, \n     who have expressed concern about his condition and \n     whereabouts.\n       Following the attack, the military closed most of the \n     party's offices across Burma, arrested other democracy \n     activists and criticized Suu Kyi's movement in the press. \n     Some suggest that these steps were part of a planned, \n     concerted crackdown, not just a hurried attempt to prevent \n     Suu Kyi's supporters from protesting the attack and arrests. \n     They noted that in the weeks before the incident, 10 \n     activists from the opposition party were arrested and \n     sentenced to prison terms of two to 28 years.\n       Since the attack, more than 100 party activists have been \n     arrested and at least a dozen imprisoned, said Stothard, \n     coordinator of the human rights group.\n       Those killed trying to protect Suu Kyi, or ``The Lady,'' as \n     she is popularly known, reportedly included Toe Lwin, 32, a \n     rising star in the party's youth division who held a \n     philosophy degree and was studying English in Rangoon, a \n     Western diplomat said. He was in Suu Kyi's vehicle, wearing \n     his orange opposition party jacket with its red badge \n     emblazoned with a gold fighting peacock. Suu Kyi treated \n     these supporters as ``surrogate sons,'' and saw in them a \n     future generation of political leaders, Stothard said.\n       Suu Kyi is being held at Yemon military camp, about 25 \n     miles outside Rangoon, without access to her doctor, party \n     members or Western envoys, concerned diplomats said.\n       ``If they lift her incommunicado status, she will speak,'' \n     a European diplomat said. ``She will speak the truth and this \n     will be damaging for them.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Deputy Secretary of State,\n\n                                          Washington June 6, 2003.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are outraged by the May 30 attack on \n     Aung San Suu Kyi and her convoy. The deteriorating conditions \n     in Burma are of grave concern to the Administration and we \n     appreciate your leadership in advancing legislation to \n     respond to these events.\n       The Department of State also appreciates the opportunity to \n     review and comment on the ``Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act \n     of 2003 (S. 1182),'' which you introduced on June 4, 2003. We \n     fully support the goal and intent of this legislation and \n     agree on the need for many similar measures. For example, we \n     are working on a unilateral expansion of the visa ban, \n     extending it to all officials of the Union Solidarity \n     Development Association (part of the SPDC) and their \n     immediate families, rather than just to senior officials, as \n     is current practice. We will also be adding managers of the \n     state-run enterprises and their families to the list.\n       We agree on the need to prevent IFI funds going to the \n     junta. We will continue to use our voice and vote in those \n     institutions to oppose loans that benefit the military \n     regime. We also agree on the need to express strong support \n     for the NLD, and are doing so in every international forum in \n     which the United States participates, including at the UN. \n     Also significant are the findings of the annual Country \n     Report on Human Rights Practices, Trafficking in Persons \n     Report and Report on International Religious Freedom, which \n     identify and strongly condemn known SPDC abuses. The \n     President's Annual Report on Major Drug Transit or Major \n     Illicit Drug Producing Countries has also identified Burma as \n     a country that demonstrably has failed to meet its \n     international obligations regarding narcotics.\n       In addition to the above efforts, which are already \n     underway, we are determined to pursue additional measures \n     against the regime, including an asset freeze, a possible ban \n     on remittances and, with appropriate legislation, a ban on \n     travel to Burma. We hope to move forward with these measures \n     expeditiously and with the support of the Congress. We are \n     also considering an import ban, as proposed in your \n     legislation. We support the intent behind the ban but are \n     reviewing the proposal in light of our international \n     obligations, including our WTO commitments.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this issue and your \n     commitment to the cause of freedom. We look forward to \n     working with you on the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard L.

They already knew how much their \n     oppressed citizens thought of the woman who should be leading \n     the nation formerly known as Burma: The huge numbers greeting \n     her on her journeys around her country provided graphic \n     evidence of her popularity.\n       Harboring despots' fears of ouster by a charismatic pro-\n     democracy leader, the army rulers arrested Suu Kyi, again, \n     after a deadly attack on her motorcade May 30. However, they \n     let United Nations representative Razali Ismail meet with the \n     democracy activist Tuesday after stalling for days.\n       Delay is not new for Razali, who has sought for two years \n     to push the nation's autocrats toward democracy. He deserves \n     credit for insisting on a meeting with Suu Kyi, so does his \n     boss, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who denounces the \n     generals.\n       In 1947 a political rival assassinated Suu Kyi's father, an \n     architect of the independence movement. Forty years later, \n     his daughter began campaigning against the military regimes \n     that ruled the country for much of its post-independence \n     history. In 1990, she and her party won a parliamentary \n     election but the military scrapped those results and kept her \n     under house arrest. It also refused to let her leave to \n     receive her 1991 Nobel Peace Prize or to be with her husband \n     as he lay dying in England.\n       But a year ago, the junta let Suu Kyi travel again. Seeing \n     her popularity undimmed, the government organized the May 30 \n     ambush of her motorcade and cited the violence as cause for \n     her arrest. She was held incommunicado until Razali met her. \n     Nearby nations like Thailand and Malaysia feebly protested \n     the assault and arrest.\n       The U.S. Congress is considering tougher measures to freeze \n     the assets of the Myanmar government held in the United \n     States and to bar the country's leaders from traveling here.\n       Those steps are warranted unless Suu Kyi is released and \n     allowed to travel freely. The United States and other \n     countries earlier imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar that \n     devastated its economy. Trade with Thailand and China, plus \n     the export of narcotics, has kept it afloat.\n       The trading partners, other countries in the region and aid \n     givers like Japan need to get tougher by imposing sanctions \n     and aid suspensions to push the country toward democracy; \n     that's the outcome Myanmar's citizens show they favor every \n     time they get the chance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, June 6, 2003]\n\n                           Squeeze the Junta\n\n       A top United Nations envoy was to arrive today in Myanmar, \n     formerly known as\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\n     Burma, and not a moment too soon: Human rights and democracy \n     once again are under siege by the narco-state's ruling \n     military party.\n       The United Nations is demanding that Yangon's generals \n     release 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, \n     arrested Saturday after a violent attack on her pro-democracy \n     party by security forces.\n       The violence, in which activists allege scores were killed, \n     and the subsequent closing of Myanmar's universities and all \n     of the offices of Ms. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy \n     mark a sudden darkening of the new dawn proclaimed last May \n     when the military regime last released her from house arrest, \n     promising dialogue with the NLD aimed at national \n     reconciliation.\n       The renewed repression begs for stronger economic sanctions \n     by the United States to squeeze this illegal junta.\n       This is a regime that competes with North Korea on human-\n     rights abuses--including long quashing the NLD, a legally \n     elected opposition party. As U.N. Secretary General Kofi \n     Annan recently put it, the political aspirations of the \n     Burmese people ``are overwhelming in favor of change.''\n       In 1990, Ms. Suu Kyi's party crushed the military's \n     candidates in Myanmar's last legal parliamentary election; \n     since then, she has spent much of the time under house \n     arrest. In response, the United States barred new American \n     investments in Myanmar in 1997. But that didn't end the \n     involvement of Unocal Corp., the California energy giant, in \n     a 1995 deal with the junta to extract natural gas off the \n     Burmese coast and transport it via a 250-mile pipelines--a \n     project allegedly built with forced labor and accompanied by \n     military murders and rapes.\n       As a result, Unocal faces a groundbreaking federal lawsuit \n     brought by international activists for 15 unnamed Burmese \n     villagers under a 1789 U.S. statute allowing lawsuits against \n     U.S. multinational corporations, holding them abroad to the \n     same standards as at home. The outcome could be far-reaching; \n     the Bush administration has weighed in on Unocal's side, \n     arguing that such human-rights cases interfere with U.S. \n     foreign policy and the war on terrorism.\n       This is precisely the wrong stance. Instead, the U.S. \n     government ought to be moving quickly toward tightening the \n     screws on Myanmar's generals and anyone keeping them afloat \n     financially.\n       Trade sanctions against Myanmar were proposed last year but \n     dropped when Ms. Suu Kyi was last released. This week, House \n     and Senate bills were entered that call for an import ban and \n     other sanctions, all of which seem fully warranted. Already, \n     a leading U.S. apparel and footwear trade group and many \n     large retailers--from Wal-Mart to Saks--are boycotting \n     Burmese goods.\n       In other words, this regime ought to be treated somewhat \n     like North Korea, from which imports have long been barred. \n     Granted, Myanmar doesn't pose North Korea's nuclear threat, \n     but it plays such a major role in the world's heroin trade \n     that it's a destabilizing force internationally.\n       Ms. Suu Kyi is again detained and her party remains under \n     attack because Myanmar's generals figure they can get away \n     with it. The United States must send a stronger message that \n     that's no longer an option.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Burma's Junta ``Disappears'' the Country's Leading Democract\n\n                           (By Rena Pederson)\n\n       In the Trademark manner of thugocracies, Burma's military \n     government, seeking to silence its critics, sent a mob to \n     attack the motorcade of longtime democracy activist Aung San \n     Suu Kyi on the night of Friday, May 30, as she traveled to a \n     speaking engagement in the north of the country. The Nobel \n     Peace Prize winner was assaulted and taken to an undisclosed \n     location.\n       The government would say only that she had been placed in \n     ``protective custody'' and that she had not been injured. But \n     reports persisted that Suu Kyi had suffered a severe blow to \n     the head and possibly a broken arm. Inside Burma, it was said \n     that hundreds of her supporters had been murdered; \n     international news agencies reported at least 70 killed and \n     50 injured. At least 18 people were believed detained.\n       ``The problem with getting an accurate story about what \n     happened is that everyone who could speak the truth in Burma \n     is under arrest,'' said one democracy advocate in Washington. \n     The government controls the only two newspapers and TV \n     stations, and the leading journalist is in prison. One in \n     four citizens reportedly spies for the government, so \n     everyone is guarded about what is said in public.\n       Nevertheless, clandestine sources inside Burma that have \n     proved reliable in the past report that hundreds of armed men \n     attacked the motorcade, some disguised as Buddhist monks. \n     Some were convicts released at the government's behest. They \n     beat Suu Kyi's supporters with bamboo clubs three feet long \n     and riddled her car with bullets. The window was shattered, \n     and either a rock or a brick was thrown at Suu Kyi's head \n     while she was seated in the car. Several students reportedly \n     tried to shield her with their bodies, but they were beaten \n     severely, and she was dragged away bleeding. According to \n     this account, she was taken to a military hospital for \n     stitches and then transferred to Yemon military camp about 25 \n     miles from Rangoon.\n       Plainly, Suu Kyi, who is 57 and weighs about 100 pounds, \n     faces long odds--though not for the first time. Since 1988, \n     she has been standing up to one of the most brutal regimes in \n     the world. In the process, she has become the photogenic \n     symbol of democracy in Asia. In 1990, her party, the National \n     League for Democracy, won 80 percent of the vote in elections \n     the junta mistakenly had though they could control. Instead \n     of seating the winners in parliament, the generals threw many \n     NLD leaders in jail and placed Suu Kyi under house arrest, \n     where she remained for most of the ensuing 13 years.\n       In this country, few people know her name, much less how to \n     pronounce it (awn sawn soo chee). But her story has the sweep \n     and drama of ``Gone With The Wind.'' Her father, General Aung \n     San, was a leader of the democracy movement in Burma after \n     World War II and was expected to become the first president \n     after Great Britain relinquished control. He was assassinated \n     when his daughter was only 2. His wife, a wartime nurse, went \n     on to become ambassador to India.\n       Suu Kyi was educated at Oxford and married a fellow \n     student, who became a professor of Tibetan studies. She lived \n     quietly in England as a wife and mother of two boys until her \n     own mother suffered a stroke in 1988, and she returned to \n     Burma to care for her. In riots that year, soldiers shot and \n     killed more student demonstrators than would die in 1989 at \n     Tiananmen Square. Suu Kyi was entreated to stay and help lead \n     the democracy effort, which she did, at great personal \n     sacrifice. She has seen her sons only sporadically since. And \n     four years ago, as her husband was dying of cancer, the junta \n     refused to grant him a visa to visit her.\n       The international response to her rearrest has been near \n     unanimous condemnation. In the midst of peace negotiations in \n     the Middle East, President Bush expressed his deep concern \n     and called for the immediate release of Suu Kyi and her \n     supporters, as did United Nations Secretary General Kofi \n     Annan. The most tepid responses came from Burma's Southeast \n     Asian neighbors, who have their own concerns about \n     stability. They asked for an explanation of Suu Kyi's \n     detention, but would not demand her release. Japan, the \n     leading investor in Burma, said the situation was not \n     ``good'' and dialogue was needed for a democratic \n     solution.\n       It will be up to the United States to increase pressure on \n     the Burmese generals, who apparently thought they could \n     decapitate their opposition while the world was concentrating \n     on the Middle East. The Bush administration must back up its \n     words with actions. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Mitch McConnell, a \n     Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Tom Lantos, a Democrat from \n     California, moved to toughen existing sanctions on Thursday. \n     They will need help. As the Boston Globe pointed out, \n     President Bush could issue an executive order that would \n     accomplish the same thing.\n       The world hardly needs another crisis at this moment, but \n     the situation in Burma could be destabilizing. Burma has been \n     seeking aid from China, its neighbor to the north, which \n     wouldn't mind having Burma as a vassal state providing port \n     access to the Indian Ocean. That prospect has alarmed India, \n     its neighbor to the west. At the same time, Thailand, to the \n     east, is overwhelmed by the thousands of refugees pouring \n     across the border each day to escape the rapacious Burmese \n     military.\n       Further complicating the picture, Burma is one of the \n     world's largest producers of heroin and amphetamines. Drug \n     dealers are often seen playing golf with high-ranking \n     generals and hold high positions in major banks. And, oh yes, \n     Burma has one of the fastest-growing AIDS rates in the world-\n     and one of the worst health systems.\n       When I spoke with Aung San Suu Kyi in February, she \n     expressed frustration that the junta had not opened a \n     dialogue with her party after her release from house arrest \n     in May 2002. ``The government promised that it would begin \n     discussions about the transition to democracy,'' she said. \n     ``They have not. They promised they would release all \n     political prisoners. They have not.'' And they promised to \n     allow the publication of independent newspapers. She asked \n     with a wry smile, ``You haven't seen one, have you?''\n       This spring she began speaking out more forcefully. When \n     she ventured into the northern states two weeks ago, \n     thousands of supporters risked their lives to greet the woman \n     they call ``the Lady.'' Government harassment then increased. \n     On May 24, 10 NLD members were jailed. On May 29, the day \n     before the ambush, clashes broke out between government \n     supporters armed with machetes and NLD backers, leaving \n     several dead.\n       Even if Aung San Suu Kyi eventually emerges unharmed, the \n     movement for free elections has been set back by the violent \n     turn of events. The main office of the National League for \n     Democracy, in Rangoon, has been closed, padlocked, and placed \n     under guard, and other party offices have been shuttered. \n     Universities, too, have been shut to prevent student \n     protests.\n       ``The Lady'' is in greater jeopardy than ever before. It \n     remains to be seen what the long-repressed Burmese people and \n     the much-distracted international community will do about it.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I note that Senator Feinstein is \nhere. I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I also thank the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky for his leadership on this issue. I am very proud \nto join with him.\n  Madam President, in 1996, Senator William Cohen and I introduced a \nsanctions bill on Bumra. It passed in 1996, and was signed by the \nPresident. In 1997, the sanctions were exercised.\n  We had a brief period of hope during that time, and the ASEAN nations \nwere going to be helpful. It looked like the military junta was going \nto be receptive. Then, recently, for a brief period, Aung San Suu Kyi, \nthe democratic leader of Burma, was released, and discussions took \nplace. Well, that was short lived and this diabolical attack took place \non Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  According to reports, her motorcade was met by 100 to 200 people at a \nbridge near Mandalay in northern Burma. Most of these people were \ndisguised as monks. Another 400 people--convicts and other militia \nrecruits who were also disguised as monks--blocked the convoy from the \nrear. Both groups then discarded their costumes and attacked the \nentourage with bamboo sticks and wooden clubs, smashing vehicles and \nbeating up their targets. Officially, four people were killed and 50 \ninjured. Witnesses contend that as many as 70 may have been killed and \nmany more injured.\n  This is outrageous. The level of coordination, the deception, and the \nbrutality of the crimes cannot go unanswered. They really demand a \nforceful and a substantive response that makes clear the United States \nwill not deal with this junta and will not tolerate such blatant \ndisregard for common human decency.\n  This legislation sends a message. It says: We will not import their \nproducts. And those Burmese exports to the United States are about 25 \npercent of what Burma exports. So it is a considerable message. It has \nto be remembered, Aung San Suu Kyi is the democratic leader of Burma. \nShe has never been permitted to serve. Her people have been arrested. \nMembers of the Parliament have been arrested and held in custody. Over \n1,300 political prisoners are still in jail, many of them elected \nparliamentarians. The practice of rape as a form of repression has been \nsanctioned by the Burmese military. The use of forced labor is \nwidespread. Trafficking in young boys and girls as sex slaves is \nrampant, and the government engages in the production and distribution \nof opium and methamphetamine. So the United States must act. Now, in \ngeneral, I do not support trade embargoes as an effective instrument of \nforeign policy. However, there are certain circumstances--South Africa \nwas one of them, largely because of the world response, and the world \nsaying enough is enough--where there must be change, and where we are \nprepared to carry out these sanctions together to effect that change. I \nhope in this sense the United States will lead the way to enact these \nsanctions in a meaningful way in which other nations will follow.\n  Our legislation imposes a complete ban on all imports until the \nPresident determines and certifies to Congress that Burma has made \nsubstantial and measurable progress on a number of democracy and human \nrights issues.\n  As Senator McConnell will indicate, there is a provision in the \nlegislation, similar to the most favored nation status for China, that \nwill allow an annual review of this to assess progress. It allows the \nPresident to waive the ban should he determine and notify Congress that \nit is in the national security interest of the United States to do \nthis. It would freeze the assets of the Burmese regime in the United \nStates. It directs United States executive directors at international \nfinancial institutions to vote against loans to Burma. It expands the \nvisa ban against past and present leadership of the junta, and it \nencourages the Secretary of State to highlight the abysmal record of \nthe junta in the international community.\n\n  Now, Senator McConnell mentioned that both business and labor are \nunited in support of this legislation. He said the American Apparel and \nFootware Association, which represents apparel, footware, and sewn \nproducts companies and their suppliers, has called for this ban. The \npresident and CEO has stated--and I think this is worth being in the \nRecord--``The government of Burma continues to abuse its citizens \nthrough force and intimidation, and refuses to respect the basic human \nrights of its people. AAFA believes this unacceptable behavior should \nbe met with condemnation from not only the international public \ncommunity, but from private industry as well.''\n  So well said.\n  A number of stores, including Saks, Macy's, Bloomingdales, Ames, and \nThe Gap have already voluntarily stopped importing or selling goods \nfrom Burma. The AFL-CIO and other labor groups also support this \nlegislation.\n  In addition, the International Labor Organization, for the first time \nin its history, called on all ILO members to impose sanctions on Burma.\n  Such diversity in support of this legislation speaks volumes about \nthe brutality of this military junta and its single-minded \nunwillingness to take even a modest step toward democracy and national \nreconciliation.\n  And to add to it, Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratic leader, is once \nagain being held in custody. This is unacceptable.\n  The military junta knows full well they do not enjoy the popular \nsupport of the Burmese people. That is why they resort to such actions.\n  As Aung San Suu Kyi traveled the country, and thousands turned out to \nhear her speak, the junta realized that after years of house arrest and \nrepression, they had failed to curb the power of her message of \ndemocracy, of human rights, and the rule of law. They realized that the \nBurmese people were determined to see the democratic elections of 1990 \nfully implemented without delay. So in a cowardly and despicable manner \nthey took this action.\n  Now we must take action. We must take a stand on the side of the \npeople of Burma and on the side of the values we cherish the most.\n  I urge support and I hope it will be unanimous.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKohl be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to my friend from California, \nas she was describing the provisions of the bill, the way it is now \nstructured, we will have an annual debate about whether or not these \nsanctions should be lifted. It will be reminiscent of the most favored \nnation debates that we had annually regarding the People's Republic of \nChina, which has now graduated to a new status.\n  But if ever there were a regime that deserved an annual review by \nthose of us here in the Congress, this is a regime that deserves that. \nSo I think that is a debate we are going to look forward to having.\n  Would you not agree, I say to my friend from California?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly agree, I say to the Senator through the \nChair. I think it would be very useful. And I think when the \nrecalcitrance, the repression, is on the floor of this Senate every \nyear, hopefully it will be helpful in changing the minds of this \nmilitary junta.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I first introduced a bill on this \nsubject back in 1993. It is one of these issues that, I must \nregretfully say, you take an interest in and follow over a period of \ntime and never see anything change. There is never any progress that \ncould be measured--until a year or so ago when the junta led Aung San \nSuu Kyi basically out of house arrest. We were supposed to applaud that \nas some kind of remarkable step in the direction of recognizing the \noutcome of the election in 1998 in which she and her party got 80 \npercent of the vote. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 while she \nwas essentially incarcerated. She remained under house arrest--except \nfor about a year or so--ever since.\n  Various strategies have been tried. The Thai Prime Minister, who was \nin town yesterday--some of us talked with him, and I know he met with \nthe President--this new Prime Minister in Thailand decided to engage in \nwhat he called ``constructive engagement.'' Obviously, constructive \nengagement doesn't work. What this regime needs is to be isolated. I \nknow there are some skeptics even in this body with regard to the \nability of sanctions to have a real impact.\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\n  Let me tell you, if there is one place in the world where sanctions \nworked, it was South Africa. The reason it worked there is because \neverybody participated and they were truly isolated. They became a \npariah regime throughout the world, and that led to the dramatic \nchanges that brought Nelson Mandela to power after decades in jail.\n  That can happen here. The United States needs to lead. Secretary \nPowell is going out to the ASEAN regional forum in Phnom Penh on June \n18 and 19 next week. This is an opportunity for him to put it at the \ntop of the agenda.\n  I said to the Thai Prime Minister that I thought constructive \nengagement wasn't working and they needed to join with us and help us \nlead the other ASEAN countries in the direction of a sanctions regime, \non a multilateral basis, that could shut these people down. Some would \nsay, well, if you have effective economic sanctions, it hurts the \npeople. It doesn't hurt the people in Burma because the regime takes \nall profits off of the exports. They make money on the exports and the \ndrug traffic, which they are quite good at.\n  So this regime needs to be squeezed by the entire world, isolated, \nand that is a strategy that we hope to begin today with the passage of \nthis legislation in the next 30 or 45 minutes.\n  I know on our side, Senator McCain wants to speak, Kay Hutchison \nwants to speak, and, I believe, Senator Brownback wants to speak. How \nmuch time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes 43 seconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 882\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 882) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the technical amendment \nto amendment No. 882 be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 883) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I will retain the remainder of my \ntime, if I may.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I will just use a quick minute. I \nmentioned some of the retail establishments supporting this but I left \nout a couple. I mentioned Saks Fifth Avenue, and there is also Macy's, \nthe Gap, Bloomingdale's, Ames, Williams Sonoma, IKEA, Wal-Mart, \nNautica, and Pottery Barn. I am very proud of these retail \nestablishments for standing up and joining us. I wanted to recognize \nthat on the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am glad the Senator from California \nmentioned those important corporations. Obviously, they could \nconceivably benefit from low-cost imports but they are choosing not to \nallow the regime to make a profit off of these American corporations. \nThey deserve our commendation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed on the time controlled by Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise in support of the efforts of \nSenator McConnell and Senator Feinstein and acknowledge the leadership \nof Senator Baucus, as well, in working this out. Senator McConnell has \nbeen tireless in his efforts to promote democracy in Burma and has been \nan acknowledged leader in this area. I thank him for not relenting.\n  I think it is to state the obvious that it is vital for us to express \nour concern for the freedom of Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the National \nLeague for Democracy and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. On May 30, \nGovernment-affiliated thugs ambushed an automobile convoy carrying the \nleader and many of her supporters. Dozens of people were reportedly \nkilled and injured in the crash. She was detained by Government \nauthorities, who also ordered the NLD offices closed nationwide.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi remains under arrest, and the Government has refused \nto allow supporters or members of the diplomatic community to meet with \nher.\n  When Burma's military rulers freed Aung San Suu Kyi of house arrest \nlast year, they claimed her release was unconditional and they pledged \nto continue the U.N.-facilitated dialog, which led to her freedom. With \nlast month's premeditated attack and her current detention, the junta \nhas abrogated all of its commitments and warrants no more time.\n  It is not hard to discern the motives of the junta.\n  They are scared. They are scared the people of Burma will rally and \nremove them from power, and they are right to be afraid. As Aung San \nSuu Kyi has toured schools, hospitals, businesses, and government \norganizations around Burma, she has been met by joyous crowds, and it \nis obvious to all observers that she remains as loved by the people of \nBurma as the military junta is reviled. It is time for the present \nmilitary oligarchy to fade into history.\n  Burma's transition to democracy would be a most welcome development \nfor all of Southeast Asia.\n  Despite pledges to crack down on narcotics production, the military \ncontinues to collaborate with heroin and methamphetamine traffickers. \nIt has failed to address the legitimate demands of ethnic minorities \nfor significant regional autonomy within a federal state, preferring \nmilitary pressure to political accommodation.\n  The generals have enriched themselves while bankrupting the country. \nThey have dismantled Burma's education system and ignored the growing \nthreat to public health posed by AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. As \nthe State Department notes with characteristic understatement in its \nmost recent human rights report:\n\n       The quality of life in Burma continues to deteriorate.\n\n  That may be the understatement of the month. It is well past time for \nthe generals to do what they said they would do; namely, begin a \nprocess that would eventually transfer the reins to a representative \ncivilian government that would enjoy domestic and international \nlegitimacy.\n  Unfortunately, there are few indications that the regime intends to \nstep down. Indeed, they apparently had high hopes the United States \nGovernment, taking note of Aung San Suu Kyi's release last year, would \ntake steps to lift the many sanctions imposed when the army brutally \nsuppressed Burma's democracy movement in 1988. The regime spent \n$450,000 to retain the services of a prominent Washington lobbying firm \nto help push the President and Congress to normalize relations, restore \naccess to international financial institutions, and resume foreign aid.\n  They were willing to spend $450,000 to improve their image, but last \nyear the officials operating the government spent less than $40,000 \nnationwide on HIV/AIDS care and prevention. Each of the nation's 35,000 \nprimary schools receives on average less than $1 from the central \ngovernment each year; $35,000 for the national education budget; \n$450,000 for lobbying in Washington.\n  No amount of money can hide the character of the Burmese military \nrulers. As the United States people stood with Nelson Mandela in his \nbid for freedom and democracy for the people of South Africa, so we \nshould now stand with those who are moving Burma toward a free and open \nsociety and the National League for Democracy as they try through \npeaceful means to end the tyrannical, brutal rule of Burma's military \nrulers.\n  Again, I thank Senators McConnell and Feinstein for their leadership \nin this area, and I am confident we will win wide support of our \ncolleagues. It is time that we are clearly standing on the right side \nof this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my friend, the ranking member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, for his contributions to the \ndebate. I very much appreciate it.\n  I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky, \nSenator McConnell, for his leadership, and I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein. I thank Senator McConnell for his \nlongstanding support of this brave and heroic person and the movement \nshe leads.\n  Several years ago, I happened to visit Myanmar, which I will refer to \nfrom now on as Burma. I had the great honor--one of the great honors of \nmy life--to meet this incredible hero, this incredible leader, this \nincredible person who has spent her life under duress, under \npunishment, under pressure, under house arrest, even to the point of \nphysical mistreatment at the hands of this gang of thugs that runs and \nhas ruined this country.\n  I will never forget the day I met her. I will never forget the grace, \nthe dignity, and the heroism that was clearly radiating from every part \nof this incredible person who very appropriately has been recognized \nwith the Nobel Peace Prize.\n  I remind my colleagues that she has been kept under house arrest for \nmany years. She was released in 1995 finally, and then she was again \nconfined to house arrest in 2000. Just a few days ago, as a motorcade \nof about 250 people drove through, about 500 armed soldiers, members of \nthe military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Association, and \nan unknown number of convicts recruited from Mandalay prison with the \npromise of reward and freedom rushed and attacked it.\n  In the ensuing melee, which lasted about an hour, the attackers beat \nup NLD members, shot them with catapults, soldiers opening and firing, \nkilling and wounding a large number of NLD members.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi was taken into custody in an unknown place. \nApparently, thank God, according to the U.N. envoy, Mr. Ishmael, she is \nin good physical condition.\n  This junta has ruined the country. It has deprived the people of \ntheir fundamental freedoms. This gang of thugs has mistreated this \ngreat person in the most disgraceful fashion. She should be free. She \nshould be free to lead her country as was already endorsed by one free \nand fair election overwhelmingly.\n  Why did they do that this time? Because everyplace Aung San Suu Kyi \nwent, the people welcomed her by the thousands, and the junta could not \nstand it. So they had to kill her people, her supporters, and they had \nto throw her back into prison.\n  What did one of the leaders who is supposed to be a moderate, whom I \nalso met when I was in Burma, GEN Khin Nyunt--remember that name--say? \nHe said:\n\n       Everyone needs to abide by the rules and regulations to be \n     observed everywhere.\n\n  Adding:\n\n       It is to be noted that the basic human rights would not \n     protect those who violate an existing law.\n\n  What existing law? What existing law that would ever be judged a \nlegitimate law in any court in the world was Aung San Suu Kyi in \nviolation of when they killed her supporters, mistreated her, and put \nher back into prison?\n  I do not know why the Japanese, the Thais, the Chinese, and the ASEAN \nnations, that ostensibly are supposed to\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\nbe standing up for freedom and democracy, are not doing everything \npossible to punish this regime, free this incredible person, and let \nthe people of Burma have a free and fair election.\n\n  I thank, again, Senator McConnell. I point out that we should be \ntaking every single measure possible, and I do not believe the \nSecretary of State should attend the ASEAN gathering in Phnom Penh, \nCambodia, unless Aung San Suu Kyi and the situation in Burma are No. 1 \non the agenda of ASEAN. Are we going to sit by and watch the \nbrutalization of a people, the imprisonment of a Nobel Peace Prize \nwinner, and the repression and devastation of a nation be carried out \nby a gang of thugs that call themselves generals? I hope not.\n  I hope the message today in the legislation we are considering, \nthanks to the Senator from Kentucky, is a message that this is the \nbeginning--this is the beginning--of our efforts to free this person \nand to free the people of Burma.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I strongly support the Burmese Freedom \nand Democracy Act of 2002 that has been introduced by Senators \nMcConnell and Feinstein. The legislation, as was said, seeks to \npressure the military junta in Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi, and \nto help bring democracy and human rights to Burma.\n\n  Several days last week--in fact, time and time again--Senator \nMcConnell came to the floor to speak on this issue. I want to commend \nmy colleague, the senior Senator from Kentucky, for his steadfast \nleadership. I associate myself gladly with his remarks. I have also \njoined him as an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The message the legislation sends to the ruling junta in Burma is \nclear: Its behavior is outrageous. By any standard anywhere in the \nworld, its behavior is outrageous. Aung San Suu Kyi is the rightful and \ndemocratically elected leader of Burma. It is that simple. Aung San Suu \nKyi is the rightful, elected leader of Burma, and the ruling junta does \nnot want her to take office because they know that their days of \nrepression, corruption, torture, and murder would be over. She and her \nfellow opposition leaders must be immediately released.\n  This legislation also sends a clear signal to the administration, to \nASEAN members, and to the international community that we need to turn \nup the heat on this illegitimate regime.\n  The efforts of Senators McConnell and Feinstein are already having an \nimpact. On June 5, 2003, our State Department issued a strong \nstatement, which reads:\n\n       The continued detention in isolation of Aung San Suu Kyi \n     and other members of her political party is outrageous and \n     unacceptable.\n\n  I agree. But we all know that U.S. actions can only go so far. \nBringing democracy and human rights to Burma is going to require active \npressure from Burma's neighbors in Southeast Asia, particularly \nThailand, Japan, and China. I hope they apply the pressure for human \nrights and democracy that many of them profess to support. They should \ndisavow the failed policies of engagement.\n  I am pleased to see that the McConnell-Feinstein legislation attempts \nto trigger a process to ratchet up the regional pressure on the Burmese \nGovernment. I am glad to see that the United States has demarched every \ngovernment in Southeast Asia on this issue. I agree with the Bush \nadministration on this very much. We have to bring this kind of \npressure. As Senator McConnell has pointed out, the administration \ncould, on its own initiative, impose many of the sanctions called for \nin this legislation.\n  All of us were relieved yesterday when the U.N. envoy in Burma was \nfinally able to see Aung San Suu Kyi. According to CNN, the U.N. envoy \nsaid that she shows no sign of injury following clashes with the pro-\ngovernment group. His exact words were:\n\n       She did not have a scratch on her and was feisty as usual.\n\n  That is indeed good.\n  I was also glad to see the U.N. envoy calling on the members of the \nASEAN to drop the organization's policy of nonintervention. He stated:\n\n       ASEAN has to break through the straitjacket and start \n     dealing with this issue. . . .The situation in Burma can only \n     be changed if regional actors take their positions to act on \n     it.\n\n  I agree. The international community has the responsibility to act \ntogether to pressure the SPDC. The time, if there ever was a time, for \nappeasement is over. It is always a time for democracy to flourish. \nDemocracy has spoken. It is being held back by the junta in Burma. It \nis time for them to step aside.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky in the Chamber. \nI again commend him for his leadership, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my good friend from Vermont for his important \ncontribution in this debate and his kind words about how we got to this \npoint. Ultimately, I guess we will all be judged by whether or not this \nis effective, I say to my friend from Vermont. For these sanctions to \nbe truly effective, we have to lead and the rest of the world has to \njoin us in sanctions of a regime that truly operates on a multilateral \nbasis like those that worked in South Africa.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Campbell be added as a cosponsor \nto this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to express my strong \nsupport for the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. This bill \nsends a powerful message to the ruling military junta in Burma that \ntheir violent restrictions against freedom and democracy will not be \ntolerated and will have serious consequences. Their recent actions have \nyet again demonstrated to the world that this junta cannot be trusted.\n  The international community cannot allow the crimes committed by the \nBurmese military against the rightfully elected leader of Burma, Aung \nSan Suu Kyi, her followers, and the Burmese people to go unpunished. \nSo, it is my great hope that the actions that the Senate is taking \ntoday will provide the international leadership needed to put the \nspotlight on the Burmese military junta and make them change their \nways.\n  I know that other countries, including the European Union, are also \nconsidering sanctions against Burma. A multilateral effort must be made \nso that we send the right message and so that our efforts are as \neffective as possible.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act of 2003. I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues to help bring freedom and justice to the Burmese people.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, when Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters \nwere so viciously assaulted last month, Burma's brutal leaders were \nresponsible for yet another major crime against human rights. The \nviolent repression of these democracy activists is a tragic and \nappalling example of the Burmese Government's shameful and continuing \nsuppression of genuine reform.\n  Only a year ago, Suu Kyi had been released from one of her previous \nhouse arrests in Burma, and that arrest had lasted 19 months. This new \natrocity has outraged the world once again, and stronger action by the \nUnited States and the entire international community is long overdue.\n  The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act calls for stiffer economic \nsanctions and the immediate release of Suu Kyi and her supporters. She \nwon the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her inspiring courageous \nleadership. Again and again, she shows us why she deserves it. She is \nan inspiration to all who care about justice and human rights.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I stand today in support of S. 1182, \nintroduced by Senator McConnell that I am cosponsoring. This bill \nanswers the rising concern that democracy cannot begin to take its \nfirst promising steps in Burma. The news in the last few days clearly \nindicates that democracy in Burma is in serious trouble again.\n  On Friday, May 30, in its latest crackdown against the National \nLeague of Democracy, Burma's military regime detained Aung San Suu Kyi, \na popular prodemocracy activist,\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\nand other leaders of her political party. There are reports that her \ncar had been hit by gunfire, and conflicting reports whether she had \nbeen hurt.\n  The clash came in a town 400 miles north of the capital city of \nRangoon. She was transported to Rangoon where she remains under house \narrest. It took nearly 2 weeks of constant international pressure on \nBurma's military regime for a United Nation's envoy to visit her \nyesterday. The envoy reported she is in good spirits and had not been \nhurt in the clash that resulted in her detention, but Burmese officials \nstill refuse to give a timetable for her release.\n  When Aung San Suu Kyi was detained, the Burmese Government closed the \noffices of the National League of Democracy and arrested some of its \nprovincial leaders. They also closed all university and college \ncampuses. The Burmese military government is acting with renegade \nabandon.\n  The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi follows a clear pattern by the \nruling military over the past decade to prevent her and her political \nparty from assuming power, despite the democratic election they won by \na landslide in 1990. Barely a year ago, the Burmese Government released \nher from 19 months of house arrest, but only after intense \ninternational pressure.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi captured the world's attention as a leader in the \nprodemocracy movement in her country after her Government refused to \nlet her party take office. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 \nfor her nonviolent efforts to promote democracy. Today, the military \nrule in Burma has shackled Aung Sun Suu Kyi again, but the world has \nnot lost notice.\n  It is time to isolate this oppressive regime and demand the release \nof those it is holding for doing nothing more than seeking democracy \nfor their nation.\n  Senator McConnell's bill will sanction the ruling Burmese military \njunta, strengthen Burma's democratic forces, and support and recognize \nthe National League of Democracy as the legitimate representative of \nthe Burmese people. It is time to increase the pressure on those who \nseek to snuff out the flame of democracy in a nation whose people \nclearly support it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to echo the condemnations of \nthe military rulers of Burma that my colleagues have so forcefully \noffered.\n  Burma should by all rights be a prosperous country. It has over 50 \nmillion people, abundant natural resources, and a population hungry for \ndemocracy.\n  Instead, it is an international outcast, ruled by a few military men \nwho finance their country through drug trafficking and forced labor.\n  Perhaps most egregious is the failure of the military rulers to \nrecognize the results of a free and fair election in which the Burmese \npeople overwhelmingly chose Aung San Suu Kyi as their leader. Rather \nthan sitting at the head of a democratic Burmese Government, she is \nsitting in a Burmese jail, a prisoner of the military rulers.\n  The existence of a democratically elected government-in-waiting makes \nBurma unique, but that is not all that makes Burma unique.\n  Suu Kyi has consistently supported sanctions against the military \nrulers of Burma, and 3 years ago, the International Labor Organization, \nfor the first time in its 82-year history, urged the world to impose \nsanctions against those rulers.\n  The bill we consider today will send a strong message to the \nillegitimate military regime in Burma that their recent actions in \nattacking Suu Kyi and her followers and imprisoning Suu Kyi are \nintolerable. A unanimous passage would send that signal loud and clear.\n  These sanctions would be most effective if the whole world joined us. \nUnilateral sanctions can send a strong message, but they are rarely \neffective. In fact, they can even end up unintentionally adding further \nmisery to an already oppressed people while leaving their rulers \nunscathed.\n  Multilateral sanctions, on the other hand, can have a dramatic \neffect. I know that others are considering sanctions, including the \nEuropean Union. I applaud their attention to this issue and urge them \nto act as we have acted.\n  I also urge the administration to work with our allies, particularly \nthose in the region, to create a united front of sanctions against the \nmilitary rulers of Burma. We must work toward multilateral support.\n  Importantly, this bill ensures that Burma will never fade from \ncongressional minds. We will not simply impose sanctions now and then \nforget all about Burma.\n  Every year, we will vote on renewing sanctions. Every year, we will \nbe talking about Burma and how best we can work to aid those working \nfor democratic change in that country.\n  The military rulers of Burma should know that their crimes against \nSuu Kyi, her followers, and the Burmese people will be neither forgiven \nnor forgotten.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senators McConnell and Feinstein on \nthis issue. They deserve our thanks for consistently bringing the \nimportant issue of human suffering in Burma to the attention of this \nbody.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Grassley. He and I worked hard to \nmake changes to this bill that, in my view, make it better.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill unanimously today, and I urge \nthe House of Representatives and the President to act soon to pass this \nbill into law. Let's send the strongest signal possible to the \nillegitimate regime in Burma.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, 13 years ago, Aung San Suu Kyi and her \nparty, the National League for Democracy, won an election in Burma with \n82 percent of the vote.\n  It was a clear sign that the Burmese people had rejected its military \nrulers that had been in place since 1962. Unfortunately, the people of \nBurma were denied its true leader when the military regime arrested Suu \nKyi and thousands of her supporters.\n  For the past 13 years, Suu Kyi has courageously pushed for democratic \nreform in Burma through nonviolent means even through she spent a great \ndeal of this time under house arrest. For her bravery and dedication to \nfreedom and democracy, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.\n  Last year, the military rulers of Burma released Suu Kyi from house \narrest. But, apparently, the strong support Suu Kyi continues to \nreceive from the Burmese people was too much for the ruling military \nregime.\n  On May 30, in a northern Burmese town 400 miles from Rangoon, \nsupporters of the military regime attacked Suu Kyi's convoy and had her \narrested. Suu Kyi and thousands of her supporters were reportedly \ninjured in the attack. Scores of Suu Kyi supporters were reportedly \nkilled.\n  The international community must not let this act of brutality stand. \nThat is why I am pleased to cosponsor and support Senator McConnell's \nlegislation to increase sanctions on Burma.\n  This legislation will impose a total import ban on Burmese goods, \nfreeze the military regime's assets in the United States, tighten the \nvisa ban on Burmese Government officials, and make it U.S. policy to \noppose any new international loans to Burma's current leaders.\n  This is an important step. It is also important to make sure that the \ninternational community and regional powers do their part to provide \nreal and sustained pressure on Burma's illegitimate rulers.\n  I was pleased to see that the United States has sent formal \ndiplomatic requests to 11 nations in the region asking them to pressure \nthe Burmese Government on the release of Suu Kyi.\n  I also sent a letter to the Japanese Ambassador asking his nation to \nput more pressure on Burma's military rules after Japan's Foreign \nMinister indicated that this incident would not set back \ndemocratization efforts in Burma. I know our Japanese friends will help \nus in this important issue of human rights and provide a stronger \ncondemnation of the attack on Suu Kyi.\n  All nations, the international community, and regional organizations \nmust take a stand against this outrage carried out by Burma's military \nleaders. We must do our part to support this brave woman and her \nfollowers.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 1215 and to \nexpress my dismay about the current human rights situation in Burma.\n  On May 30, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and at least 17 \nofficials of\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\nher party were detained after a violent clash with members of the Union \nSolidarity Development Association, a government-created organization \nthat has increasingly taken on paramilitary activities.\n  The military junta that rules Burma has stated that ``only'' four \ndied in the violence.\n  But the National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi's party, has put the \ndeath toll at 75. Furthermore, it is likely the Burmese Government \ndeliberately provoked the clashes to justify cracking down on \nopposition leaders and closing down universities.\n  Since May 30, the junta has kept Suu Kyi, who is the 1991 Nobel Peace \nPrize recipient, in an undisclosed location.\n  We have recently received word from a U.N. envoy that Suu Kyi is \nsafe, and members of the Burmese Government have promised that they \nwill release her expeditiously.\n  I join with my colleagues in this body, and with the American people, \nin demanding that the Burmese regime fulfill this promise immediately. \nThe Government must also find those responsible for the violence and \nhold them accountable.\n  The bill we have before us today addresses the serious human rights \nsituation in Burma. The recent violence and detainment of opposition \nleaders exemplify Government repression conducted on a systematic and \nfrequent basis.\n  S. 1215 would punish Burma's dictators, who have a chokehold on the \nnation's economic life, by barring the import into the United States of \ngoods manufactured in Burma and by freezing the U.S. assets of the \nregime's leading generals. These are targeted sanctions that would \npunish the military dictators in Burma, those who are directly \nresponsible for suppressing human rights there.\n  Nearly 55 years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and \nonly weeks after fighting a war to liberate 24 million Iraqis, the U.S. \nSenate must remain steadfast in its resolve to preserve the freedom of \npeoples throughout the world.\n  As a strong advocate for human rights and democratic governance in \nSoutheast Asia, I call on this body to stand up to the military junta \nof Burma by passing this important legislation. We need to send a \nmessage to these thugs that their brutal reign of oppression and terror \ndoes not go unnoticed and will not last.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe I have about 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 48 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Maybe we could get some time on the other side. I \nyield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me \nto speak on this legislation.\n  The weekend before last, the military junta in Burma, ironically \ngoing by the name of the State Peace and Development Council, staged a \nviolent clash between a government-supported militia called the United \nSolidarity and Development Association and activists of the National \nLeague for Democracy, the NLD.\n  As reported in the press, during the ensuing assault on the NLD, \nthese thugs attacked the caravan of supporters led by Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureate and democratic activist Aung San Suu Kyi and subsequently \ndetained her and 19 members of the NLD, killed scores of NLD activists \nand, in the aftermath, closed down universities and NLD offices in the \ncountry. This is intolerable. Today I hope this institution can stand \ntall by roundly condemning this thieving, bantam tyranny that is taking \nplace in Burma.\n\n  The regime claims they are detaining her, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, \nand NLD supporters for their safety. They accuse her of causing unrest \nand violence and claim she is in danger because of inflammatory \nspeeches she has been giving on her tour of northern Burma.\n  I find this accusation to be absolutely ridiculous, but nevertheless, \na common refrain coming from a government known for flaunting its human \nrights abuses which include slave labor, rape and forced prostitution, \npressing children into the military, all a carefully constructed \ncampaign to terrorize the people of Burma and consolidate the petty \nkleptocracy.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi's whereabouts are now known; the UN Secretary \nGeneral's envoy Mr. Razali Ishmail is in Rangoon working to negotiate \nher release. I cannot bring myself to believe a word of what the SPDC \nsays. It was reported in the press that she has a serious head injury; \nhowever, today I hear that Mr. Razali has seen her and that she is \nunharmed. My colleague from Kentucky and I do not believe it. And the \nregime has done nothing to reassure any member of the international \ncommunity of their intentions. Aung San Suu Kyi is not free, Burma is \nnot free.\n  In fact, this is part of a clear pattern of continually thwarting the \nadvance of democracy and freedom in Burma--something for which Aung San \nSuu Kyi is the living symbol. More than that, she has recruited some of \nthe most talented and most dedicated young people to her cause.\n  As reported by yesterday's Washington Post, one of those young people \nwas a young man by the name of Toe Lwin. This young man, and many \nothers in NLD like him, dedicated every once of his being to the cause. \nBringing change to Burma and protecting Aung San Suu Kyi were the \nthings for which he was willing to die.\n  This young man died trying to protect her. I am told that she sees \nall of these dedicated, inspiring young people as her children. I am \nsure that it breaks her heart to know that blood has been spilt in this \neffort.\n  We cannot seek a better tribute to this young man's life than by \naiding the cause of democracy by passing this bill.\n  The SPDC seems like a bunch of bush-league autocrats. But what I want \nmy colleagues to know is that this group of thugs is not just some \ncommon banana republic or petty dictatorship.\n  In 1988, the then-called State Law and Order Restoration Council, \nSLORC, took power and began its repression of pro-democracy \ndemonstrations. After National Assembly elections in 1990, which were \npoised to overwhelmingly bring to power Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD, \nSLORC annulled the elections, began jailing thousands of democracy \nactivists, suppressed all political liberties, and periodically placed \nAung San Suu Kyi under house arrest.\n  And this is just the opening line of the story. These thugs conscript \nthousands of their citizens, including children, into the military to \nserve as porters and to work on state development projects. In \naddition, narcotics is a big business for the ruling Burmese generals; \nhowever, there are some who will claim that we are getting full \ncooperation in combatting Burma's trade in heroin and amphetamines.\n  The most recent International Narcotics Control Strategy Report \npublished by the Department of State reads, ``Burma is the world's \nsecond largest producer of illicit opium.'' It continues stating ``. . \n. no Burma Army Officer over the rank of full Colonel has ever been \nprosecuted for drug offenses in Burma. This fact, the prominent role in \nBurma of the family of notorious narcotics traffickers, and the \ncontinuance of large-scale narcotics trafficking over the years of \nintrusive military rule have given rise to speculation that some senior \nmilitary leaders protect or are otherwise involved with narcotics \ntraffickers.''\n  Yet I understand there was an active effort by some embedded \nbureaucrats to give the junta a free pass on drug certification. We are \nnot dealing with the boy scouts of Southeast Asia.\n  I think that is the wrong approach to dealing with the problem of the \nSPDC's\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\nbrutal rule. If today's paper is accurate, then it looks as if our \ngovernment is beginning to take the correct steps to respond to the \nsituation. We have put eleven countries on notice, notably Thailand and \nChina, for their support of Burma.\n  This may be the mortal blow that weakens the regime. That is why next \nWednesday I have planned hearings to discuss the support for the SPDC \ncoming from key players in the region. Some of these countries need to \ngive us some private assurances about their willingness to forgo \ncontinued support of the regime. Others need to be put on notice for \nthe degree and nature of support for the SPDC junta.\n  Singapore, North Korea, Russia, and Malaysia have all been in \ncooperation or given assistance in the political, economic or military \nspheres. I will be inviting members of the administration and the NGO \ncommunity to give their knowledge of on-the-ground support for the \nSPDC.\n  This week, the Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand is in \ntown for an important visit with President Bush. It was reported that \nthe President has already weighed in with the Prime Minister. I hope to \ndo the same when I attend a luncheon today for the Prime Minister \nhosted by Senator Bond.\n  Because the can predict the perils of dealing with a thieving, \nmurderous dictatorship, many companies, especially here in the U.S., \nare avoiding doing business with these guys altogether. Department \nstores, clothing manufacturers, footwear and apparel companies are all \ntelling the junta to take a hike.\n  Maybe the Senate should consider telling them the same.\n  I note my personal experience. I was on the Thai-Burma border in late \n2000. This was on a trip where we were working on the issue of \ntrafficking in persons, sex trafficking. We found at that point in time \nin 2000, and it continues today, one of the highest trafficked areas in \nthe world was between Burma and Thailand. What was taking place was the \npeople of Burma were fleeing this totalitarian dictatorship that \nbrutalized its own people. The people of Burma were fleeing into \nThailand. On that border, then, they were fresh meat for the people who \ntraffic in persons, primarily for sex exploration, primarily of young \ngirls. We saw girls 11, 12, 13 years of age, even younger, being \ntaken--abducted in some cases--and in some cases sold because the \nfamily was so poor, sold into what they thought was a condition they \nwould serve someone in a home or work in a restaurant. Instead, they \nwere put in a brothel in Bangkok or someplace else in Thailand to a \nhorrific environment at this very young age, with most of them \ncontracting AIDS, tuberculosis, and dying at a young age. This was one \nof the key traffic areas of the world. It was being caused by this \ngovernment in Burma that cared nothing about its people.\n  These were the most wonderful people in the world. They were trying \nto eke out some mere existence. This was a government that cared \nabsolutely nothing at all about them.\n  Now they have gone and arrested the Nobel Prize-winning activist, \ndemocracy activist who has done this in a peaceful way in Burma to try \nto bring her country forward. They have taken the next step down the \nroad on this anarchy of horrific treatment of their own people, a \ncomplete movement against the way the rest of the world is moving.\n  I support this resolution. It is very timely. I applaud Senator \nMcConnell for his work. It is important we send this message that this \nregime is treating its own people so badly that these sorts of \nconditions arise. We need to be on record. The rest of the world needs \nto be on record to press this regime to stop persecuting its own people \nin such terrible ways.\n  I hope this will send a message to the regime in Burma and to people \naround the rest of the world that we will continue to bring economic \nand diplomatic pressure in a quick fashion against this regime in \nBurma. This should not wait for years to develop.\n  Furthermore, there are big questions many times about whether these \nsanctions work. Against a big economy there are legitimate questions. \nAgainst a small economy, against a situation in a country such as \nBurma, where it is located, I think these work very well and it sends \nan extraordinary message to Burma. It also sends a big message to \nThailand, which is a key country for us, to get their attention that \nthey should not repatriate the Burmese back into Burma and we should \nrecognize the refugee status for the Burmese in Thailand, a country \nthat wants to work closely and carefully with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his \ncontribution. I am not aware of any more speakers on this side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Nor on this side. I am willing to yield back the remainder \nof the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent all time be yielded \nback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nand the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Burmese Freedom and \n     Democracy Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has \n     failed to transfer power to the National League for Democracy \n     (NLD) whose parliamentarians won an overwhelming victory in \n     the 1990 elections in Burma.\n       (2) The SPDC has failed to enter into meaningful, political \n     dialogue with the NLD and ethnic minorities and has dismissed \n     the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Razali bin Ismail \n     to further such dialogue.\n       (3) According to the State Department's ``Report to the \n     Congress Regarding Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Toward \n     Burma'' dated March 28, 2003, the SPDC has become ``more \n     confrontational'' in its exchanges with the NLD.\n       (4) On May 30, 2003, the SPDC, threatened by continued \n     support for the NLD throughout Burma, brutally attacked NLD \n     supporters, killed and injured scores of civilians, and \n     arrested democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi and other \n     activists.\n       (5) The SPDC continues egregious human rights violations \n     against Burmese citizens, uses rape as a weapon of \n     intimidation and torture against women, and forcibly \n     conscripts child-soldiers for the use in fighting indigenous \n     ethnic groups.\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\n       (6) The SPDC has demonstrably failed to cooperate with the \n     United States in stopping the flood of heroin and \n     methamphetamines being grown, refined, manufactured, and \n     transported in areas under the control of the SPDC serving to \n     flood the region and much of the world with these illicit \n     drugs.\n       (7) The SPDC provides safety, security, and engages in \n     business dealings with narcotics traffickers under indictment \n     by United States authorities, and other producers and \n     traffickers of narcotics.\n       (8) The International Labor Organization (ILO), for the \n     first time in its 82-year history, adopted in 2000, a \n     resolution recommending that governments, employers, and \n     workers organizations take appropriate measures to ensure \n     that their relations with the SPDC do not abet the \n     government-sponsored system of forced, compulsory, or slave \n     labor in Burma, and that other international bodies \n     reconsider any cooperation they may be engaged in with Burma \n     and, if appropriate, cease as soon as possible any activity \n     that could abet the practice of forced, compulsory, or slave \n     labor.\n       (9) The SPDC has integrated the Burmese military and its \n     surrogates into all facets of the economy effectively \n     destroying any free enterprise system.\n       (10) Investment in Burmese companies and purchases from \n     them serve to provide the SPDC with currency that is used to \n     finance its instruments of terror and repression against the \n     Burmese people.\n       (11) On April 15, 2003, the American Apparel and Footwear \n     Association expressed its ``strong support for a full and \n     immediate ban on U.S. textiles, apparel and footwear imports \n     from Burma'' and called upon the United States Government to \n     ``impose an outright ban on U.S. imports'' of these items \n     until Burma demonstrates respect for basic human and labor \n     rights of its citizens.\n       (12) The policy of the United States, as articulated by the \n     President on April 24, 2003, is to officially recognize the \n     NLD as the legitimate representative of the Burmese people as \n     determined by the 1990 election.\n\n     SEC. 3. BAN AGAINST TRADE THAT SUPPORTS THE MILITARY REGIME \n                   OF BURMA.\n\n       (a) General Ban.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     and except as provided in section 9, until such time as the \n     President determines and certifies to Congress that Burma has \n     met the conditions described in paragraph (3), no article may \n     be imported into the United States that is produced, mined, \n     manufactured, grown, or assembled in Burma.\n       (2) Ban on imports from certain companies.--The import \n     restrictions contained in paragraph (1) shall apply to, among \n     other entities--\n       (A) the SPDC, any ministry of the SPDC, a member of the \n     SPDC or an immediate family member of such member;\n       (B) known narcotics traffickers from Burma or an immediate \n     family member of such narcotics trafficker;\n       (C) the Union of Myanmar Economics Holdings Incorporated \n     (UMEHI) or any company in which the UMEHI has a fiduciary \n     interest;\n       (D) the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) or any company \n     in which the MEC has a fiduciary interest;\n       (E) the Union Solidarity and Development Association \n     (USDA); and\n       (F) any successor entity for the SPDC, UMEHI, MEC, or USDA.\n       (3) Conditions described.--The conditions described in this \n     paragraph are the following:\n       (A) The SPDC has made substantial and measurable progress \n     to end violations of internationally recognized human rights \n     including rape, and the Secretary of State, after \n     consultation with the ILO Secretary General and relevant \n     nongovernmental organizations, reports to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that the SPDC no longer \n     systematically violates workers rights, including the use of \n     forced and child labor, and conscription of child-soldiers.\n       (B) The SPDC has made measurable and substantial progress \n     toward implementing a democratic government including--\n       (i) releasing all political prisoners;\n       (ii) allowing freedom of speech and the press;\n       (iii) allowing freedom of association;\n       (iv) permitting the peaceful exercise of religion; and\n       (v) bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC \n     and the democratic forces led by the NLD and Burma's ethnic \n     nationalities on the transfer of power to a civilian \n     government accountable to the Burmese people through \n     democratic elections under the rule of law.\n       (C) Pursuant to the terms of section 706 of the Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law \n     107-228), Burma has not failed demonstrably to make \n     substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under \n     international counternarcotics agreements and to take other \n     effective counternarcotics measures, including the arrest and \n     extradition of all individuals under indictment in the United \n     States for narcotics trafficking, and concrete and measurable \n     actions to stem the flow of illicit drug money into Burma's \n     banking system and economic enterprises and to stop the \n     manufacture and export of methamphetamines.\n       (4) Appropriate congressional committees.--In this Act, the \n     term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Finance, and \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on International Relations, the Committee on Ways \n     and Means, and the Committee on Appropriations of the House \n     of Representatives.\n       (b) Waiver Authorities.--\n       (1) In general.--The President may waive the prohibitions \n     described in this section for any or all products imported \n     from Burma to the United States if the President determines \n     and notifies the appropriate congressional committees that to \n     do so is in the vital national security interest of the \n     United States.\n       (2) International obligations.--The President may waive any \n     provision of this Act found to be in violation of any \n     international obligations of the United States pursuant to \n     any final ruling relating to Burma under the dispute \n     settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization.\n\n     SEC. 4. FREEZING ASSETS OF THE BURMESE REGIME IN THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall direct, and \n     promulgate regulations to the same, that any United States \n     financial institution holding funds belonging to the SPDC or \n     the assets of those individuals who hold senior positions in \n     the SPDC or its political arm, the Union Solidarity \n     Development Association, shall promptly report those assets \n     to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Secretary of the \n     Treasury may take such action as may be necessary to secure \n     such assets or funds.\n\n     SEC. 5. LOANS AT INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United \n     States executive director to each appropriate international \n     financial institution in which the United States \n     participates, to oppose, and vote against the extension by \n     such institution of any loan or financial or technical \n     assistance to Burma until such time as the conditions \n     described in section 3(a)(3) are met.\n\n     SEC. 6. EXPANSION OF VISA BAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Visa ban.--The President is authorized to deny visas \n     and entry to the former and present leadership of the SPDC or \n     the Union Solidarity Development Association.\n       (2) Updates.--The Secretary of State shall coordinate on a \n     biannual basis with representatives of the European Union to \n     ensure that an individual who is banned from obtaining a visa \n     by the European Union for the reasons described in paragraph \n     (1) is also banned from receiving a visa from the United \n     States.\n       (b) Publication.--The Secretary of State shall post on the \n     Department of State's website the names of individuals whose \n     entry into the United States is banned under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 7. CONDEMNATION OF THE REGIME AND DISSEMINATION OF \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Congress encourages the Secretary of State \n     to highlight the abysmal record of the SPDC to the \n     international community and use all appropriate fora, \n     including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional \n     Forum and Asian Nations Regional Forum, to encourage other \n     states to restrict financial resources to the SPDC and \n     Burmese companies while offering political recognition and \n     support to Burma's democratic movement including the National \n     League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic groups.\n       (b) United States Embassy.--The United States embassy in \n     Rangoon shall take all steps necessary to provide access of \n     information and United States policy decisions to media \n     organs not under the control of the ruling military regime.\n\n     SEC. 8. SUPPORT DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS IN BURMA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President is authorized to use all \n     available resources to assist Burmese democracy activists \n     dedicated to nonviolent opposition to the regime in their \n     efforts to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights in \n     Burma, including a listing of constraints on such \n     programming.\n       (b) Reports.--\n       (1) First report.--Not later than 3 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     provide the appropriate congressional committees a \n     comprehensive report on its short- and long-term programs and \n     activities to support democracy activists in Burma, including \n     a list of constraints on such programming.\n       (2) Report on resources.--Not later than 6 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     provide the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     identifying resources that will be necessary for the \n     reconstruction of Burma, after the SPDC is removed from \n     power, including--\n       (A) the formation of democratic institutions;\n       (B) establishing the rule of law;\n       (C) establishing freedom of the press;\n       (D) providing for the successful reintegration of military \n     officers and personnel into Burmese society; and\n       (E) providing health, educational, and economic \n     development.\n       (3) Report on trade sanctions.--Not later than 90 days \n     before the date that the import restrictions contained in \n     section 3(a)(1) are to expire, the Secretary of State, in \n     consultation with the United States Trade Representative and \n     other appropriate agencies, shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees, a report on--\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\n       (A) conditions in Burma, including human rights violations, \n     arrest and detention of democracy activists, forced and child \n     labor, and the status of dialogue between the SPDC and the \n     NLD and ethnic minorities;\n       (B) bilateral and multilateral measures undertaken by the \n     United States Government and other governments to promote \n     human rights and democracy in Burma; and\n       (C) the impact and effectiveness of the provisions of this \n     Act in furthering the policy objectives of the United States \n     toward Burma.\n\n     SEC. 9. DURATION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Termination by Request From Democratic Burma.--The \n     President may terminate any provision in this Act upon the \n     request of a democratically elected government in Burma, \n     provided that all the conditions in section 3(a)(3) have been \n     met.\n       (b) Continuation of Import Sanctions.--\n       (1) Expiration.--The import restrictions contained in \n     section 3(a)(1) shall expire 1 year from the date of \n     enactment of this Act unless renewed under paragraph (2) of \n     this section.\n       (2) Resolution by congress.--The import restrictions \n     contained in section 3(a)(1) may be renewed annually for a 1-\n     year period if, prior to the anniversary of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter, a renewal \n     resolution is enacted into law in accordance with subsection \n     (c).\n       (c) Renewal Resolutions.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``renewal resolution'' means a joint resolution of the 2 \n     Houses of Congress, the sole matter after the resolving \n     clause of which is as follows: ``That Congress approves the \n     renewal of the import restrictions contained in section \n     3(a)(1) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003.''\n       (2) Procedures.--\n       (A) In general.--A renewal resolution--\n       (i) may be introduced in either House of Congress by any \n     member of such House at any time within the 90-day period \n     before the expiration of the import restrictions contained in \n     section 3(a)(1); and\n       (ii) the provisions of subparagraph (B) shall apply.\n       (B) Expedited consideration.--The provisions of section 152 \n     (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 \n     U.S.C. 2192 (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f)) apply to a renewal \n     resolution under this Act as if such resolution were a \n     resolution described in section 152(a) of the Trade Act of \n     1974.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7702-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7702-S7707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in speaking to the managers of the bill and \nthe interested parties in this matter, the thought is--and this is not \nin the way of a unanimous consent request but just to inform Members \nwhat we are doing--the Senator from Florida will offer his amendment. \nHe will speak on it tonight. Perhaps the other Senator from Florida, \nMr. Nelson, will speak on his amendment. There are a number of Senators \nwho have requested time in the morning.\n  The manager of the bill has suggested--and we think it would be OK on \nour side--that tomorrow we would have an hour on our side and the \nmajority would have 30 minutes on their side, and then the two leaders \ncan decide if we vote at that time or sometime later in the day. Staff \nis putting that in the form of a unanimous consent request, and perhaps \nwe can enter into that sometime later tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are looking for a unanimous consent request that \nsays in the morning 1 additional hour on that side, a half hour on our \nside on the Graham amendment, and afterwards there will be a vote. That \nis being prepared. In the meantime, the Graham amendment is going to be \noffered for discussion this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 884\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. GRAHAM], for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Chafee, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Corzine, and \n     Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 884.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provision requiring the Secretary of the \n Interior to conduct an inventory and analysis of oil and natural gas \n  resources beneath all of the waters of the outer Continental Shelf)\n\n       Beginning on page 23, strike line 20 and all that follows \n     through page 25, line 8.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, the amendment I have just \noffered will strike section 105 from the legislation we are currently \nconsidering.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by a long and diverse list of Senators: \nSenators Feinstein, Dole, Cantwell, Wyden, Nelson of Florida, Boxer, \nLautenberg, Edwards, Kerry, Murray, Lieberman, Akaka, Leahy, Snowe, \nDodd, Chafee, Kennedy, Corzine, and Collins.\n  In this legislation, section 105 appears to be benign. It calls for \nan inventory of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas resources that may \nbe in the ownership of the Federal Government. However, there are some \ninsidious objectives and means to achieve those objectives in this \nlegislation.\n  In my judgment, section 105 is nothing more than a prelude to a \ndirect attack on the moratorium which currently exists in the Gulf of \nMexico, off New England, the Pacific Northwest, and California, and to \ndo so in a way that will avoid a full and public debate.\n  The OCS inventory, which is suggested in section 105, is neither \nbenign nor innocuous. It will provide for a totally duplicative survey \nto one that is already conducted by the same office that would be \ndirected to do the study under section 105, which is the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior Minerals Management Service. This is the \nfront page of the latest of the 5-year reports, which the Mineral \nManagement Service does on U.S. resources and reserves in the Outer \nContinental Shelf. As you will see, this latest assessment was done in \nthe year 2000. So it has been only 3 years since we had a comprehensive \nanalysis.\n  In light of that, why would we oppose this new study? We would oppose \nthe new study because we think it is duplicative and redundant. We \noppose it because it would allow certain techniques, which have \npreviously not been used but which have been shown to be detrimental to \nthe resources of the Outer Continental Shelf, including the fish \nresources, to be utilized. But, in my judgment, the most insidious \naspect is a provision in section 105 which states that after the \ninventory is completed it should be used as the purpose of analysis of \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. Let me read to you subparagraph 5 under \nsection 105:\n\n       The inventory and analysis shall identify and explain how \n     legislative, regulatory, and administrative programs or \n     processes restrict or impede the development of identified \n     resources and the extent that they may affect domestic \n     supply, such as moratoria, lease terms and conditions, \n     operational stipulations and requirements, approval delays by \n     the Federal Government and coastal States, and local zoning \n     restrictions on onshore processing facilities, and pipeline \n     landings.\n\n  I think that language is clearly intended to take the results of this \nnewly mandated inventory and use them as the basis, focusing \nexclusively on the issue of affecting domestic supply, to build the \ncase that the moratoria, which California and other coastal States have \nhad now for 20 years, would be undermined.\n  That moratoria has been voted on by Congress on many occasions in \nrecognition of the fact that, first, there are other interests involved \nbeyond maximizing the exploitation of our Continental Shelf oil and gas \nresources. There are issues of the environment and there are issues of \nthe economy, which are dependent upon the environment--particularly, \nthe purity of the water and the security of the coastal areas.\n  Second is the fact that it does not take into consideration the \nquestion of we want to have a domestic supply of oil and gas, but for \nwhat time period? If we were to initiate a policy that says we will \ndrain America first, we can rest assured that our grandchildren, if not\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\nour children, will live in an America that will be totally dependent \nupon foreign petroleum sources.\n  The estimate is that, as of today, we have known reserves of \npetroleum which, at current levels of utilization, will last \napproximately 50 years. We have much longer reserves of natural gas, \nstretching into the 200-year-plus estimate.\n  I think it is eminently wise public policy to say we will try to \nhusband our domestic resources as long as possible to delay the date \nwhen we will be fully dependent upon foreign resources. This practice \nof providing moratoria on certain of our resources plays a significant \npositive role in that policy of attempting to stretch our domestic \nresources.\n  As the list of cosponsors indicates, this is by no means a partisan \nissue. The moratoria have broad bipartisan support, and have had it for \nover 20 years. This is also not an issue that is bicameral. The House \nof Representatives has already adopted an Energy bill, stripping out \nlanguage that was virtually verbatim to that which is in 105 of the \nSenate bill.\n  Our desire is to have the Senate take the same position that our \nHouse colleagues have already taken, so when this issue is taken up in \nconference, the issue of an inventory that has as its objective \nundermining the moratoria will not be a conferenceable item.\n  I believe our colleagues in the House have shown wisdom in the course \nof action they have taken, and I ask my Senate colleagues to show the \nsame wisdom by eliminating section 105. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of this amendment, which will adopt or reinforce a policy where \nwe look at multiple issues in the management of our coastal areas, \nincluding the issue of exploitation of the resources but also the \npotential effect of that exploitation on other economic and \nenvironmental considerations; that we also recognize the valid function \nof those adjacent State and local communities and how this issue would \nbe resolved, and the legitimacy of the Federal Government's Coastal \nZone Management Act as the means by which those interests would be \nexpressed. For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to adopt this \namendment and strike section 105 from this bill, and then with the joy \nthat we will know that we have taken a step to protect some of our most \ncritical ocean resources, move on to the consideration of other \nprovisions in this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand Senator Dole desires to speak on the same \nside. I don't intend to speak but for a moment. I will do my speaking \nand other members of the committee will be welcome to do so in the \nmorning. I will take a couple of minutes and then yield to them for the \nevening.\n  As you well know, as you are a member of the energy committee, not \ntoo long ago the Senate of the United States said to this committee of \nSenators: Give us an energy policy for America's future, prepare a \nblueprint, a program, a policy, a set of activities that tells us what \nwe ought to be doing for America's economic future, for our jobs, for \nour prosperity, as it relates to energy. We thought that if we did \nnothing else, perhaps that little mission meant we ought to find out \nwhat we have. What does America own?\n  We thought about it for a while and we said that is pretty simple. \nThat is exactly what they would like us to do. They would like us to \nfind out--even if we don't know what to do about it--what we have. What \ndo we own? So a simple proposition was put in here, using the most \nmodern techniques, disturbing nothing, to go out and find out how much \noil and gas is in the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States--the \nproperty marked by my good friend from Florida in green on his chart--\nthat we have already, as a nation, said based on today's circumstances \nwe don't want to touch.\n  Does that mean we should not know what is there? The distinguished \nSenator from Florida says: We do know what is there. No, we do not know \nwhat is there because the most modern techniques are clearly changing \nwhat we know about what we own and what is underground. We do not have \none of those most modern evaluations that has been put over that \nproperty that is within our control that could be used for America if \nwe ever needed it and, I would even say, in a crisis.\n  As an ultimate reserve, should we not know what is there? That is the \nissue. It is, do we want to adopt an ostrich policy or do we want to \nadopt a policy of being on the surface, above board with our eyes open \nand know precisely what we are looking at? That is it. You can read the \nlanguage. We will read it very precisely.\n  It matters not too much to this Senator from New Mexico what this \nSenate decides to do about this issue. It matters a lot to me as \nchairman of the Committee on Energy that I do what I was asked to do, \nand I thought I was asked to ask the committee members: Would you like \nto spend some American tax dollars to find out what we own so that it \nwill be there in the inventory on the rack, so to speak, in the event \nsomething happened to America?\n  I thought the answer to that question was yes. We wrote it up, and we \nput the issue to the members. One member is sitting here, the new \nSenator from Tennessee. There was a rather large bipartisan vote on a \nsimple proposition. Of course we want to know. Why would we want to \nstick our head in the sand and say we know there is oil there, we know \nthere is gas there, but we do not want to use the most modern \ntechniques to tell America what is there? As is going to happen tonight \nand tomorrow, there will be all this fear aroused that we are going to \nharm the sea line, the coastal shore, the beauty of America that is \nalongside these shores.\n  This says nothing about doing that, and everybody knows that we are \nnot saying do anything whatsoever to these shorelines. What we are \nsaying is, is it not, one, the responsibility of the committee to \nsuggest to the Congress that we find out? I think the answer to that is \nunequivocal. Yes, we sure should.\n  Second, since you should have and you did, should the Senate now turn \naround and say you should have, you did, but we want to take it out, we \nwant to throw it away, and we do not want to do it? That is the issue.\n  I sense that there is going to be enough fear established that people \nare going to be voting as if we are destroying something. Quite the \ncontrary, I think we are doing something positive. I do not think we \nare destroying a thing. We are saying to folks: We have a lot of oil \nand gas out there. If the situation really gets bad--and what that \nmight be, I do not know; none of us in this room knows--but if things \ngot bad enough, there it is, and we know it is there, and it has been \nmeasured with the most modern-day techniques which are, indeed, not \nonly marvels but they are marvelous in terms of what they will tell us \nabout the capacity for the future.\n  Unless my friend from Tennessee wants to say a few words, I do not \nintend to spend any more time tonight. We will split our half hour \ntomorrow among three or four Senators from the committee in further \nresponse to the amendment that our distinguished friend from Florida \nhas brought to the floor in a bipartisan manner with a lot of Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Graham amendment to \nS. 14, the omnibus Energy bill. My State like so many others, is going \nthrough a painful economic transition. We have lost tens of thousands \nof jobs in textiles and the furniture industry, family farms are going \nout of business, and many of these traditional manufacturing jobs have \nbeen in rural areas, where there are fewer jobs and residents are \nalready struggling to make ends meet.\n  In 1999, North Carolina had the 12th lowest unemployment rate in the \nUnited States. By December 2001, the State had fallen to 46th--from \n12th to 46th. That same year, according to the Rural Center, North \nCarolina companies announced 63,222 layoffs. Our State lost more \nmanufacturing jobs between 1997 and the year 2000 than any State except \nNew York. Entire communities have been uprooted by this crisis. \nAccording to the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina, the \njobless rate rose from 6 percent in March to 6.4 percent just one month \nlater.\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\n  So you can see, Mr. President, North Carolina is hurting. But one \narea that remains strong is tourism--one of the State's largest \nindustries. Each year, travelers venture into our State to enjoy the \nmountains of Asheville, the Southern-city charm of Charlotte, the \nbeaches of the Outer Banks, and many other State treasures.\n  Last year, there were 44.4 million visitors to North Carolina, \nranking it the sixth most popular destination behind California, \nFlorida, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York. In fact, last year domestic \ntravelers spend nearly $12 billion across the State, generating $2.2 \nbillion in tax receipts.\n  The industry remains strong, despite the war, and the Nation's \neconomic concerns. In fact, while the tourism volume nationwide \nincreased by less than 1 percent last year, North Carolina saw a 3 \npercent increase in visitors.\n  Put simply, tourism plays a vital role in North Carolina's economy, \nbut offshore drilling could drastically impact these numbers.\n  Communities along the Outer Banks have spoken out time and again \nagainst offshore drilling because of the impact it cold have on the \neconomy and the environment--and I agree with them.\n  I thank my good friend, Chairman Domenici, for his hard work and \ndedication to produce a comprehensive energy bill, one that will help \nour country end its dependency on foreign oil. While I fully support \nSenator Domenici's efforts, I must disagree with regard to section 105.\n  Section 105 in the Senate bill has been presented as a study of the \noil and gas reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf, but the effect of \nthis section would be to open up scientific exploration. The final bill \nthat passed the House of Representatives, as we have heard, rejects \nlanguage that would open up scientific exploration of the Outer \nContinental Shelf.\n  The waters off the coasts of North Carolina have been placed off \nlimits to further leasing under the current moratoria. President Bush \nextended the moratorium and Secretary Norton has been very clear about \nthe administration's intention to uphold it. Congress and the \nAdministration in the past have agreed with States in the moratoria \nareas that drilling would pose too many risks to their economies and \nshores.\n  Why then, in these tough economic times, should States such as North \nCarolina be asked to bear the risk of exploration for resources that \nare under moratoria and not even accessible for development? Section \n105 hints to a backsliding from that protection by allowing intrusive \nactivities into moratoria areas, through a study that is not needed.\n  The Minerals Management Service already compiles estimates of Outer \nContinental Shelf oil and gas resources every 5 years. In fact, the \nlast one was completed in the year 2000, and includes estimates of \nundiscovered conventionally and economically recoverable oil and \nnatural gas. We already know, for instance, that 80 percent of the \nNation's undiscovered, economically recoverable Outer Continental Shelf \ngas is located in the Central and Western part of the Gulf of Mexico, \nwhich is currently not subject to the moratorium.\n  So it would appear that section 105 of this energy bill is \nduplicative and unnecessary.\n  In fact, the only logical explanation for new data under section 105 \nwould be for future exploration activity like drilling, which is \ninconsistent with the current moratorium. We have a national crisis. \nNow, more than ever, we must work to end our dependence on foreign oil \nsources. It is vital that this Nation boost its domestic oil \nproduction, but we cannot do so by ignoring the wishes of coastal \ncommunities in North Carolina and other States that oppose drilling.\n  Our local people, not the Federal Government, should decide what is \nbest for their areas. The Federal Government should not take action \nthat will further hurt our already struggling State economies. That is \nwhy I urge support for the Graham amendment, which would continue to \nprotect those areas under moratorium. We owe it to our States. We owe \nit to our local communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the bill tomorrow morning at 9:30, there then be 90 \nminutes of debate remaining prior to the vote in relation to the \npending Graham amendment; provided further that Senator Graham or his \ndesignee be in control of 60 minutes and the chairman in control of the \nremaining 30 minutes. Further, I ask consent that following the use of \nthat time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendment, \nwith no amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. The Senator from New Mexico said ``in relation \nto.'' That would not preclude the possibility of an up-or-down vote as \nopposed to a tabling motion?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Either/or.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. It would be either/or.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to support the \namendment offered by the Senator from Florida and commend him on his \nleadership on this issue. The amendment that is before us tonight will \nprevent exploration in offshore areas that are currently protected \nunder law. The truth is, we should not need a special amendment to \nprotect sensitive offshore areas that are currently off limits to \nenergy drilling and exploration, but today we find this amendment is \nneeded because the underlying Energy Bill would essentially roll back a \nlongstanding ban on exploration that protects our coastal areas.\n  This Energy Bill calls for the Department of Interior to inventory \noil and gas resources. It does not rule out exploration or drilling in \nany part of the Outer Continental Shelf and it does not prevent \nexploration or drilling in areas that are currently protected.\n  Some may say they just want to allow an inventory of oil and gas off \nour coasts, but taking an inventory of what lies beneath the sea floor \nis not like taking an inventory of what is in the kitchen pantry. \nLooking for oil and gas off our coasts is an invasive process. It \ncarries risks. It harms marine life and it can create serious \nenvironmental damage.\n  If it was just taking an inventory, it would be one set of \nenvironmental concerns, but I think we all know what is really going on \nand it is much more than inventory. This is not just about seeing what \nis out there. It is really about preparing to drill for oil and gas in \nareas that have been protected for years, for decades actually, by law.\n  Let's be clear. Oil companies are not going to spend millions of \ndollars to inventory our coasts just for the fun of it. They want to \nbegin drilling in areas that are protected, and this Energy Bill would \ngive them the start they want.\n  I am reminded of that analogy about how if a camel gets its nose \nunder the tent, pretty soon the whole camel will follow. Well, if we do \nnot want the camel in our tent, stop it when it tries to poke its nose \nin.\n  Once those oil companies get their equipment down there, they will be \nsteps away from setting up oil rigs and creating a host of dangers on \nour shores. If we do not want oil companies drilling off our shores, \nthen we cannot let them get started with these so-called inventory \nprojects.\n  There are good reasons why over the years Congress and past \nPresidents have agreed to protect parts of our Outer Continental Shelf. \nIn fact, that moratorium that today protects the coast of my State of \nWashington was passed by Congress in 1990 and protected by an executive \norder by the first President Bush. Today, the current Bush \nadministration wants to repeal that protection and pave the way for \ndrilling off our coasts.\n  Those who want to explore for energy off our coasts would like us to \nbelieve it is harmless, but it is not. When we consider offshore oil \nand gas development, we have to be concerned about oil spills and the \nrelease of other toxic materials. There are other environmental effects \nthat pose dangers to marine mammal populations, fish populations, and \nair quality. Seismic testing techniques used by the offshore oil and \ngas industry can kill marine animals. This is not harmless.\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\n  If this administration had a better record on the environment, I \nmight be inclined to give them more leeway, but this administration has \nshown an eagerness to roll back environmental protections on so many \nissues that they do not have much credibility when they say they want \nto just look for oil off our coasts.\n\n  Last month, the Bush administration took another disturbing step to \nundermine our environmental protection related to oil and gas drilling. \nIn fact, on May 26, 2003, the New York Times reported that the \nadministration proposed to defer for 2 years requirements for permits \nunder the Clean Water Act for certain activities of oil and gas \nproducers to prevent contaminated runoff. This is a bad precedent and a \nstep in the wrong direction for protecting our environment. There is no \ngood reason for oil and gas developers to be exempt from requirements \nthat are imposed on other developers to prevent contaminated runoff.\n  So not only do they want to let the big oil and gas companies start \nlooking for oil in areas that have been protected for decades, this \nBush administration is going to free those oil and gas companies from \nthe rules everyone else has to follow to protect contaminated runoff. \nNot on my watch. We know there is a better way. Congress should be \nseeking long-term solutions that make sense for energy development and \nthat balance environmental protection and economic growth. The proposal \nto drill in areas of the OCS that are currently under moratoria falls \nfar short of the balanced approach we need. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment to stop an attack on decades of protection for \nour sensitive coastal areas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to support the Graham \namendment. I am a cosponsor. Bob Graham and I have been battling on the \nquestion of oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida, and it is \nvery clear to us, as we have waged this battle over the course of the \nlast 25 years in public office, that the people of Florida do not want \nit for environmental reasons but also for business reasons; that \nFlorida's $50 billion tourism industry in large part is because we have \nbeautiful, unspoiled beaches.\n  I know what the people in my State of Florida want. They do not want \noil drilling off their shore. I ask the Senator from Washington what is \nthe thinking of her people in her State of Washington?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Florida, I \nhave listened to his battles for many years as he has fought to protect \nthe beautiful shores of Florida. I have seen the shores of Florida, and \nthey are gorgeous. He is right, tourism is a critical part of the \neconomy of his State of Florida, as it is to mine. People come to \nWashington State to see our beautiful mountains, our beautiful forests, \nand to fish. The last thing they want to see is oil drilling off our \ncoasts.\n\n  This underlying bill that allows an inventory is simply a step for \nthe oil companies to then get in and drill. My State would be \nabsolutely appalled to see that happen.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. What do you think about the rest of the \nPacific coast States, Oregon and California? What would the people \nthink?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As the Senator from Florida knows well, for all who live \non coastal States, our economies are struggling today; the high-tech \nindustry is struggling; Boeing has lost thousands of jobs.\n  There is still the beautiful environment that people come to visit. \nThe last thing anyone wants in our rain forests, whether in Oregon or \nWashington, or the beaches of California, the last thing they want to \nsee is an oil rig or, worse, an oilspill in the areas we care so much \nabout.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I talked at length with the senior Senator \nfrom North Carolina earlier today. Senator Edwards is quite concerned \nabout the oil drilling off of the Outer Banks.\n  The people directly affected are crying out. There are States that do \nnot mind drilling off the coast--the State of Louisiana, the State of \nTexas. There are about 2,000 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and they are \nprimarily off of Texas and Louisiana, some off of Alabama, some off of \nMississippi, all of those States whose Senators do not seem to mind \nbecause it must reflect their people's feeling that there be oil \ndrilling. In the Gulf of Mexico, the geology shows that is where the \noil and gas is, in the western gulf, in the central gulf, but not in \nthe eastern gulf.\n  The people of Florida simply do not think it is worth the tradeoff of \nspoiling the environment and spoiling a $50 billion tourism industry to \ntake the risk where the geology shows there is very little likelihood \nof oil, to take the risk that a well will be hit, that an oilspill will \noccur.\n  There is another reason. We have tremendous military facilities in \nthe State of Washington. What we are finding is with so many of the \nmilitary facilities on the gulf coast now that the naval facility on \nVieques Island in Puerto Rico is being closed down, some of that \ntraining for the U.S. Navy is being shifted to the gulf coast of \nFlorida, not necessarily on the land.\n  Because of computers and virtual training, they can now image what \nwould be the target zone, and it can be out in the middle of the Gulf \nof Mexico. That helps in preparation of our Navy for its proper \ntraining, but will that Navy be able to train if there are oil rigs in \nthe eastern Gulf of Mexico? The answer is no.\n  I ask the Senator from Washington, is there any similar military \nactivity in the Senator's State? I certainly know there is in \nCalifornia where they are launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Is \nthere such a facility?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Florida makes an excellent point. Our \nmilitary needs to be ready for whatever conflicts come to them on the \nwar on terror. They need to be out there training. Certainly at Makah \nAir Force Base and the other bases we have, they need to know they have \na place they can train and not be interfered with.\n  I add, as the Senator from Florida knows, there are other economies \nthat we count on as well. Fishing is a tremendous economy and part of \nour economy base in the State of Washington. They would not be excited \nabout having oil rigs out there where people are fishing, as well as \ntourism, but certainly the military is an important part of my State. \nWe want to make sure they have the space they need for training. The \nSenator makes an excellent point.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I have to tell a little story to the Senator \nfrom Washington before she leaves. In the middle of the 1980s I was the \njunior Congressman from the east coast of the State of Florida. There \nwas a Secretary of the Interior named James Watt who was absolutely \nintent on drilling. They offered for lease off the east coast of the \nUnited States leases for sale all the way from North Carolina south to \nFort Pierce, FL.\n  Perhaps I was green enough--I didn't know any better--to take him on. \nI took him on, as a junior Congressman. I was getting absolutely \nnowhere. We beat it back one year. They left it alone the next year and \ncame back with a new Secretary of the Interior the third year and they \nwere intent they were going to ram through those leases. The only way I \nwas able to beat it was I finally got the Department of Defense and \nNASA to own up to the fact and to press that on the administration back \nin the mid-1980s that you cannot be dropping the solid rocket boosters \noff of the space shuttle with oil rigs down there and you cannot be \ndropping off the first stage, after it is spent, on the expendable \nlaunch vehicles coming out of Cape Canaveral with oil rigs out there. \nThat is the only way we beat it back in the mid-1980s.\n  I thought they were going to leave us alone. Two years ago, when an \nimportant appointment was up in the Department of the Interior, I went \nto the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Norton, and she assured me \nthat in the eastern Gulf of Mexico there would be no attempt at oil \ndrilling for the next 5 years. That was a commitment made to me with \nregard to an appointment and the Senate's consideration. What is in \nthis bill does not break her commitment, but it clearly starts to imply \nthat what is being done is the intention of drilling.\n  I hope we are going to be able to muster the votes with Senators who \ndo not have coasts, with help from Senators such as the distinguished \nSenator in the chair, listening to this debate.\n\n[[Page S7706]]\n\nWith their help, we may just have the votes.\n  When Senator Graham and I tried 2 years ago just with regard to the \nGulf of Mexico off the State of Florida to keep the moratorium there, \nwe did not get but 35 votes for our amendment, so the amendment did not \npass. It was later that I got that commitment from Secretary of the \nInterior Gale Norton.\n  But this is portending something else. We are going to fight. I hope \nwe have the votes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Florida, thank \nyou on behalf of all who care about this issue for your longtime battle \nand diligence. Every time you are right, they keep coming back at you, \nbut you keep winning.\n  I agree, there are a number of Senators on this floor who are not \nfrom coastal States but they should be joining because certainly they \nall come to our States to see the beautiful coastlines, whether it is \nFlorida, Washington State, California, or Maine. They want to preserve \nthat, too. They want to take their grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren, some day, to your State. I certainly hope they want to \ncome to ours, too. If we devastate the environment, the tourism will \nnot be there.\n  I thank my colleague for working on this issue.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am not a junior Congressman anymore but I am \na junior Senator. Although there have been some birthdays between the \ntime I was a junior Senator and a junior Congressman, I still have a \nlot of fight in me.\n  I think we have a decent shot of winning this amendment and this vote \nwill take place tomorrow.\n  There is no need repeating a number of the things that have been \nsaid. Let me summarize, on first glance, section 105 of this bill seems \nreasonable. Do we know what the resources are so we can prepare an \nassessment? Upon further reflection, upon reading the language, it \nbecomes unnecessary and unreasonable when you recognize the Secretary \nof the Interior has conducted an inventory just 2 years ago. On the \nplan there is going to be an inventory that is going to be conducted in \n2005, just 2 years from now. Why should the U.S. Congress and the \nSecretary of the Interior go about duplicating the efforts that had \njust been done and were going to be done? We know most of the Outer \nContinental Shelf is under a moratorium. Almost all of those areas, \nunder this plan, of section 105 of the bill would be required to be \nreassessed under the moratorium. So I am just not sure. I kind of smell \nsomething fishy here.\n\n  Why does the Congress want to waste taxpayer money on a duplicative \ninventory of areas off limits to oil and gas exploration?\n  The House of Representatives has already realized the importance of \nthis amendment. They passed it with a voice vote in an overwhelming \nshow of bipartisan support. So if we can pass this amendment of Senator \nGraham, this issue is over and done with because of an identical \nprovision in the bill that has passed the House.\n  We already know that many coastal States exercise their rights under \nthe Coastal Zone Management Act because oil and gas exploration plans \nthat have been proposed would threaten those States. In their own \nefforts to control the destiny of their own shores and their own \nenvironment, they have exercised their rights under the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act not to have oil drilling.\n  Those who oppose this amendment, when we hear the final debate \ntomorrow, are going to argue that it is the only section in the Energy \nbill that addresses the volatility of natural gas prices. But how does \nit do that? We already know where natural gas is from. We know where it \nis from the 2000 assessment. We already know the President and the \nCongress have acted to prevent leasing of oil and gas drilling, so what \nis the true purpose? What I smell is a kind of fishy smell: what is the \ntrue purpose? You have to come to the conclusion it is to roll back the \nmoratorium on oil and gas drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. What \nis the true purpose? It is to weaken the States' rights under the \nCoastal Zone Management Act.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this Graham \namendment and strike this unnecessary language from the Energy bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of Senator \nGraham's amendment.\n  This amendment, which I cosponsor, would strike language in the \nEnergy Policy Act that would authorize an inventory of the oil and gas \nresources on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  This amendment mirrors a bill that Senator Corzine and I introduced \nlast month. It would protect the sensitive marine areas off the coast \nof New Jersey and of other coastal States.\n  For over 20 years both Democratic and Republican administrations have \nrespected the moratorium on leasing and preleasing activities on Outer \nContinental Shelf.\n  In his 2004 budget request, President Bush also honored the wishes of \nthe coastal States.\n  His request included the traditional moratorium language--and so \nshould the Energy bill before us.\n  The people of New Jersey, and the residents of all coastal States, do \nnot want oil and gas rigs marring their treasured beaches and fishing \ngrounds.\n  Such drilling poses serious threats to our environment and to our \neconomy, and so do the technologies used to gather data.\n  The seismic surveys authorized in the Energy bill produce explosive \npulses which have produced documented organ damage in marine species \nand have been associated with fatal whale strandings.\n  Dart core sampling, also authorized in the bill, is known to cause \nthe destruction of fish habitat on the sea floor and to smother seabed \nmarine life with silt.\n  Is all of this damage and destruction justified--just to gather data? \nI don't think it is.\n  Additionally, in New Jersey our economy depends heavily on shoreline \ntourism.\n  Tourism in my State is a 10-billion-dollar-a-year industry and \nprovides employment for thousands of people.\n  We simply cannot afford damage to our shorelines, nor to the marine \nlife which inhabits our coastal waters.\n  What the Energy bill proposes is a step in the wrong direction. What \npurpose would be served by performing an inventory of oil and natural \ngas resources along the Outer Continental Shelf, if there is no \nintention of drilling in these regions?\n  This provision completely undercuts the language which Congress has \napproved for years--and it clearly undercuts the stated wishes of the \ncoastal States that would incur the greatest damage.\n  Our country needs new sources of energy. And there are many energy \nsources vastly underutilized in America.\n  We have barely scratched the surface of our country's potential for \ndeveloping renewable energy.\n  The enormous energy conservation and efficiency savings that are \npossible are largely untapped. Too often these measures are voluntary \nrather than a part of the way we do business.\n  If we better utilize these untapped sources of domestic energy, \nperhaps Congress won't be tempted to sweep aside the will of the people \nof New Jersey and the will of the citizens of other coastal States.\n  We must continue, as we historically have, to recognize the right of \nStates to govern their own shorelines.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for Senator Graham's amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what kind of energy policy does this country \nneed? There is little argument about the need for affordable, reliable \nenergy from diverse sources. The bill before us seeks to achieve that \nlaudable goal in the worst possible manner: on the back of the American \ntaxpayer. This bill subsidizes two types of energy. That which few \nconsumers would be willing to pay for and that which companies would \nproduce and consumers would pay for in the absence of subsidies. I ask \nmy colleagues if this makes any sense?\n  Let's let the competitive market determine our energy future. Let's \nlet the market, with millions of individual consumers pursuing their \nindividual energy needs, based on their own unique situations, steer \nthis country's energy economy. Let us not dictate to consumers and \ntaxpayers how they should spend their energy dollars.\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\n  Recently this body voted on a tax bill that allows taxpayers to keep \nmore of their hard-earned money in an attempt to jump-start this \neconomy. The tax cut was passed on the premise that consumers and \nbusinesses are better suited than government to make sound economic \ndecisions that translate into economic growth. That same premise \napplies to energy. Yet the Energy bill under debate tosses that premise \nout the window. Suddenly the consumers and businesses of this country, \nwhich we are trusting to make sound economic decisions to put the whole \neconomy back on track, cannot be trusted to make sound energy \ndecisions. Instead, we are dictating their energy choices for them. No \nbody of persons, not even a panel of 100 of the world's most brilliant \neconomists, let alone the Senate of the United States, has the \nknowledge, wisdom or foresight to make such decisions rationally for \nmillions of American citizens.\n  Let's take a look at what this bill would do. It mandates greater use \nof ethanol, a fuel that is already heavily subsidized. Without \nsubsidies and mandates, ethanol would virtually cease to exist as a \nmotor fuel. It subsidizes renewable energies such as wind power, which \nagain would not survive in the competitive marketplace due to the high \ncost and low value of the electricity produced. It subsidizes coal, \nalready the most plentiful and affordable energy source in this \ncountry. Coal power will continue to thrive in this country whether \nsubsidized or not, as long as we don't regulate it out of existence, \nyet we are providing subsidies for coal power. This bill subsidizes \nnuclear power, which would probably be competitive were it not for the \nonerous regulatory restrictions that needlessly burden that industry. \nThe list goes on.\n  Let me suggest that the greatest obstacle to affordable and reliable \nenergy in this country is the U.S. Government. Before this body looks \noutward for solutions to our energy problems, it should look inward. It \nshould identify those laws, regulations, and other Government \nimpediments that prevents this country's citizens and businesses from \nmaking sound energy decisions. We encumber the U.S. energy economy with \nall sorts of onerous and often unneeded and outmoded rules that raise \nthe cost of energy and distort energy markets. Instead of fixing this \nstate of affairs, this bill compounds these errors by further raising \nthe cost of energy to American taxpayers and further distorting energy \nmarkets through subsidies.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an amendment to \nfix a funding gap that exists for meritorious Women's Business Centers \nthat are graduating from the first stage of the program and entering \nthe sustainability portion.\n  I would like to first thank Senator Snowe, Chair of the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, for working very closely with me \non this issue. Her leadership and support has been invaluable. I would \nalso like to thank Senator Bingaman for his support on this issue. As a \nlong-time ally of the Women's Business Centers and all SBA programs, \nhis assistance on this amendment has been very helpful. Last, I want to \nexpress my gratitude to Senators Harkin, Edwards, Cantwell, Enzi and \nDomenici, as well as Congressman McIntyre, for their backing and for \ntheir hard work to resolve this issue.\n  As I have said on more than one occasion, women business owners do \nnot get the recognition they deserve for their contribution to our \neconomy: Eighteen million Americans would be without jobs today if it \nweren't for these entrepreneurs who had the courage and the vision to \nstrike out on their own. For 18 years, as a member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have worked to \nincrease the opportunities for these enterprising women in a variety of \nways, leading to greater earning power, financial independence, and \nasset accumulation. These are more than words. For these women, it \nmeans having a bank account, buying a home, sending their children to \ncollege, calling the shots.\n  And helping them at every step are the Women's Business Centers. In \n2002 alone, these centers helped 85,000 women with the business \ncounseling and assistance they likely could not find anywhere else. \nCutting funding for any centers would be harmful to the centers, to the \nwomen they serve, to their States, and to the national economy.\n  The funding gap for Women's Business Centers in sustainability exists \nbecause the Small Business Administration has chosen to short-change \nexisting, proven centers in order to open new, unproven ones. By \nincorrectly interpreting the funding formula set up in the Women's \nBusiness Centers program, the SBA has made way for new centers at the \nexpense of those that are already established. This is both bad policy \nand contrary to congressional intent.\n  As the author of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of \n1999, I can tell you that when the Women's Business Centers \nSustainability Act of 1999 was signed into law, it was Congress's \nintent to protect the established and successful infrastructure of \nworthy, performing centers. The law was designed to allow all \ngraduating Women's Business Centers that meet certain SBA standards to \nreceive continued funding under sustainability grants, while still \nallowing for new centers--but not by penalizing those that have already \ndemonstrated their worth.\n  Currently there are 81 Women's Business Centers in 48 States. Forty-\nsix of these are in the initial program, 29 are already in \nsustainability, and 6 more are graduating or have graduated from the \ninitial program and are now applying for sustainability grants. Because \nof these potentially 6 new sustainability centers--from Georgia, Iowa, \nIllinois, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington State--and because the \nSBA is incorrectly interpreting the funding formula for sustainability \ngrants in order to open new centers, the amount of funds reserved for \nWomen's Business Centers in sustainability must be increased from 30.2 \npercent to 36 percent.\n  This amendment does just that. It directs the SBA to reserve 36 \npercent of the appropriated funds for the sustainability portion of the \nWomen's Business Centers program--even though the SBA already has the \nauthority on its own to increase the reserve--thereby protecting the \nestablished Women's Business Centers form almost certain grant funding \ncuts and still providing enough funds to open six or more new centers \nacross the country.\n  I want to again express my sincere and steadfast support for the \ngrowing community of women entrepreneurs across the Nation and for the \ninvaluable programs through which the SBA provides women business \nowners with the tools they need to succeed. As a long-time advocate for \nwomen entrepreneurs and SBA's programs, my record in support of the \nSBA's women's programs and for women business owners speaks for itself. \nI have continually fought for increased funding for the women's \nprograms at the SBA, for sustaining and expanding the women's business \ncenters, and for giving women entrepreneurs their deserved \nrepresentation within the Federal procurement process, to name a few. \nWith respect to laws assisting women-owned businesses, I have been \nproud to either introduce the underlying legislation or strongly \nadvocate to ensure their passage and adequate funding.\n  This amendment is necessary to continue the good work of SBA's \nWomen's Business Center network, and I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7707-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I read in a number of national publications \nbrief excerpts of the eulogy that former Senator Bill Bradley gave at \nthe funeral of Dave Debusschere. The paragraphs I saw were really \nmoving.\n  I was able to obtain a copy of the full eulogy that Senator Bradley \ngave on May 19 at St. Joseph's Church in Garden City, NY. It is really, \ntruly, a moving eulogy. It outlines the context and the relationship of \nDave Debusschere and Bill Bradley and other members of the New York \nKnicks team, but especially those two who were roommates\n\n[[Page S7708]]\n\nduring many years of their travels around the country playing \nchampionship basketball. It explains their personal relationship, as \nBill Bradley can do. He explains also what a team is all about. We, \nboth in the majority and minority, are always working with our team. I \nrecommend this as reading for everyone.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the speech given by \nBill Bradley at the funeral of Dave Debusschere be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Eulogy of Dave Debusschere\n\n       Geri, Michelle, Peter, Dennis, DeBusschere sisters and \n     family.\n       Today, Willis asked me to speak for him, for Clyde, Earl \n     and all the Knicks who loved Dave. The moment I heard the \n     news last Wednesday, it was as if a lightning bolt hit my \n     heart. It was so shocking, so unexpected, so final.\n       When I saw the newspaper stories after Dave's death, one \n     photo caught my eye. It was of Dave driving to the basket, \n     the ball in his left hand, legs sturdy, shoulders strong, \n     shock of dark hair matted with sweat, and a face full of his \n     unique determination. As I looked at it, I was reminded of a \n     time when we were all younger, and there was a magic about \n     life. A magic about life--there is no other way to describe \n     those years on our Knick teams. How it felt to hear the roar \n     of the Garden crowd, to know the satisfaction of a play well-\n     executed, to feel the chills of winning a championship, to \n     share the camaraderie, even brotherhood, of working in an \n     environment of mutual trust, with people you respected, each \n     of whom had the courage to take the last second shot.\n       Dave's strength, his dedication, his unselfishness, his \n     fierce desire to win, and, above all, his commitment to the \n     team, were all at the core of that success. He seemed to say, \n     ``What's the point of achieving anything in basketball if you \n     can't share it?'' That's the beauty of having teammates. They \n     know what it takes to get through a long season, to recover \n     from a loss, to pull out a win when you're hurt or tired. \n     Dave believed that once good players have put on their \n     uniforms, everything else about them--race, ethnicity, \n     personal history, off-court style--fades into the background. \n     It's time to play--together. And we did.\n       Dave DeBusschere left all of himself on the court every \n     game. He held nothing back. I can remember those nights on \n     the road in late February. Dave, his face drawn from the long \n     season; and Willis, with his brow furrowed, and heating packs \n     on each knee. They would look at each other in the locker \n     room of the fourth town in five nights, and their glances \n     alone seemed to say, ``I'm tired to my bones. I don't want to \n     go out there, but if you do it, I will too.'' And they always \n     did. Together they set the character tone for the team in a \n     kind of shared leadership that rarely needed words.\n       If I had $100 for every night Dave played hurt, I could buy \n     a nice car. One night, Dave caught an elbow in the face that \n     broke his nose. The pain was obvious. I didn't see how he was \n     going to play the next night. But, there he was, ready to go, \n     when the buzzer sounded--with a strip of plastic over his \n     nose, held in place by white adhesive tape forming an ``H'' \n     above and below his eyes.\n       I think the fans loved Dave because they sensed what his \n     teammates already knew: he was the real thing. No pretense. \n     He hated phonies. No guile. He told you exactly how he felt. \n     No greediness. I never heard him talk about points. No \n     excuses. He always took responsibility for his mistakes.\n       Dave was a man of action, not words. He was above the petty \n     things in life, and he wasn't impressed easily. Power, fame, \n     money, were not the currencies he traded in. Friendship, \n     loyalty, hard work, were what he placed the greatest value \n     in. If Bush or Madonna or Rockefeller walked into a bar, I \n     bet he'd barely look up from the beer he was sharing with a \n     friend.\n       There was a time when I'd slept in a room with Dave \n     DeBusschere more than I had with my wife. We were roommates \n     on the road for six years. That's about 250 games, 250 \n     cities, 250 hotels.\n       If the truth be told (as Geri knows), on many occasions \n     Dave woke me up with his snoring. I'd say, ``Dave.'' To no \n     avail. I'd shout, ``Dave!'' Still no success. Finally I'd get \n     out of bed, put my hands on his back and push him over on his \n     side. he still wouldn't wake up, but the snoring would stop. \n     And I'd get a few hours of sleep . . . until the next time.\n       You get to know someone when you're with him that much. You \n     hear about his life; you meet his friends and family; you \n     know what he likes to eat, what he likes to do in his \n     downtime, what forms his daily habits; you learn what he \n     admires in people and what he can't stand.\n       You can learn a lot of from your roommate, too, especially \n     if he's an experienced pro and you are not. It was my second \n     year in the NBA. I had just made the Knicks starting team as \n     a forward, and we had lost a close one in Philadelphia on a \n     bad pass I made when the Sixers were applying full court \n     pressure. After the game I was dejected. Back at the hotel. \n     Dave, who had joined the team from Detroit two months \n     earlier, saw how I felt and put me straight. ``You can't go \n     through a season like this,'' he said. ``There are too many \n     games, Sure, you blew it tonight, but when it's over, it's \n     over. Let it go. Otherwise you won't be ready to play \n     tomorrow night.'' It was NBA lesson #1; Don't make today's \n     loss the enemy of tomorrow's victory.\n       On occasion, Dave, Willis and I would go to dinner on the \n     road, and Willis would begin telling hunting stories--what \n     weapons he used, where he used them and what the weather was, \n     how be tracked the animals, what his gear consisted of, the \n     angle at which he shot with his gun, or his bow and arrow, \n     and so forth. Dave and I were not hunters, but once Willis \n     got started, it took him more than a little while to finish. \n     After one such evening when we got back to our room, Dave \n     said, ``You know, I think Willis likes to hunt!''\n       Dave also was not above practical jokes. Once after a \n     championship season, the DeBusscheres, Kladis's and Bradleys \n     chartered a boat to tour the Greek islands. One day we pulled \n     up off an island beach, and Dave and I dove off the boat to \n     swim ashore. As we were coming out of the water, we found a \n     lone man, laying on a towel. An American. He watched us \n     emerge from the sea, and shouted, ``DeBusschere--Dave \n     DeBusschere. Bradley. Oh my God! Wait til my family sees \n     this!'' and he took off. Dave looked at me; I looked at him, \n     and with a grin he said, ``Let's go.'' We swam back to the \n     boat, hid behind towels and watched as the man, his wife and \n     kids behind him, ran back onto the beach. ``Honest they were \n     here!'' We could hear him shout. ``I saw them! Really! They \n     were here I swear it.''\n       It's been a long time since the Knicks were champions and I \n     roomed with Dave. But time has only deepened our friendship. \n     I always looked forward to our one-on-one lunches, our \n     dinners with Ernestine and the irrepressible Geri, our family \n     visits to Long Island, and on occasion a game like the one \n     last spring when Willis, Dave, Earl and I went to New Jersey \n     for a Lakers/Nets playoff game with loyalties split between \n     Willis's Nets and Phil's Lakers.\n       Over the years I commiserated with Dave about the way the \n     Garden treated him when he was G.M. I spoke at Peter's \n     college graduation. I shared the pride that he and Geri felt \n     as Michelle, Peter and Dennis grew into spectacular young \n     adults.\n       And, I will never forget when he told me how proud he was \n     to be sitting in the gallery the day I was sworn into the \n     Senate. Over the years he made campaign appearances in New \n     Jersey on my behalf, attended fundraisers to add star power, \n     and sloughed through the snows of Iowa and New Hampshire in \n     2000. Whenever I asked him to do something, he was there; and \n     every place he went, he made people feel good.\n       Until last Wednesday, one of the most enjoyable things in \n     life was talking basketball with Dave DeBusschere. The \n     players and the teams, the rules and style of play have all \n     changed, but the sharpness of his insights never diminished. \n     What he said was always so clear and simple that I'd ask \n     myself afterwards, ``Why didn't I think of that?''\n       Championship teams share a moment that few other people \n     know. The overwhelming emotion derives from more than pride. \n     Your devotion to your teammates, the depth of your sense of \n     belonging, is something like blood kinship, but without the \n     complications. Rarely can words express it. In the nonverbal \n     world of basketball, it's like grace and beauty and ease, and \n     it spills into all areas of your life.\n       So I say to my big brother: Be proud. You brought all these \n     things to the many lives you touched. Goodbye, we'll miss \n     you, #22. May God grant you a peaceful journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7708-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ORDER OF PROCEDURE--S. 14\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr President, I rise today to express my concern about \nthe horrific violence which has erupted over the past few days in the \nMiddle East. The world is distressed to see the images on T.V. of \ntoday's suicide bombing in Jerusalem and the attacks in Gaza. \nCondolences are extended to all of those who continue to pay the price \nof this intolerable seemingly uncontrollable cycle of violence in the \nMiddle East.\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\n  This human suffering must be brought to an end. Once again I take the \nfloor of the Senate to call on both sides both Israel and the \nPalestinians to take the initiative to invite NATO forces to undertake \na peacekeeping role and to help provide a measure of stability needed \nto allow the ``road map'' process to maintain a momentum forward.\n  President Bush is to be commended for his personal commitment to \nbring the Israelis and the Palestinians together on a path toward \npeace. Last week, President Bush, joining with world leaders, gave new \nimpetus to the Middle East peace process. He met with the Israeli and \nPalestinian prime ministers at Aqaba, Jordan, where these two leaders \nagreed to begin to implement the early steps of the ``road map'' to \npeace.\n  In Aqaba, both sides agreed to a step-by-step process whereby each \ntakes positive steps and makes some concessions to achieve the stated \ngoal of an Israeli and a Palestinian state, living side-by-side in \npeace.\n  Unfortunately, there are third parties, such as Hamas and other \nradical groups, that are making every effort to continue the violence \nand disrupt the path to peace. These groups must not be permitted to \nhijack the peace process.\n  How can others help the Palestinian leadership gain control of the \nsecurity situation on its side?\n  The Israeli and Palestinian leaders should be urged first to fulfill \ntheir commitments to establish and help to enforce a cease-fire; and, \nsecond, to ask the North Atlantic Council to consider sending a \npeacekeeping contingent as soon as practical.\n  I have spoken before on this subject here on the Senate floor, and \nhave written to President Bush, about my idea concerning how NATO might \nplay a useful role in the quest for Middle East peace. I ask that my \nletter to President Bush and his reply be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2003.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I would like to commend you on the step \n     you took today to give new impetus to the Middle East peace \n     process by announcing that it was time to share with Israel \n     and the Palestinians the road map to peace that the United \n     States has developed with its ``Quartet'' partners. This is a \n     welcome and timely initiative, given the complex way in which \n     the Middle East conflict, Iraq and the global war against \n     terrorism are intertwined.\n       The festering hostilities in the Middle East are an \n     enormous human tragedy. Along with you, and many others, I \n     refuse to accept that this is a conflict without end. You \n     have articulated a vision of an Israeli and a Palestinian \n     state living side by side in peace and security. That is a \n     bold initiative that deserves strong international support. \n     With the Israeli elections concluded, and the imminent \n     confirmation of a Palestinian Prime Minster, you are right to \n     refocus international attention on the Middle East peace \n     process.\n       Mr. President, in August 2002, I wrote to you to propose an \n     idea concerning the possibility of offering NATO peacekeepers \n     to help implement a cease-fire in the Middle East. I have \n     spoken of this idea numerous times on the Senate Floor. I am \n     now even more convinced that the United States and its NATO \n     partners should consider an additional element for the ``road \n     map'' concept: NATO should offer, and I stress the word \n     ``offer,'' to provide a peacekeeping force, once a cease-fire \n     has been established by the Israeli Government and the \n     Palestinian Authority. This NATO force would serve in support \n     of the cease-fire mechanisms agreed to by Israel and the \n     Palestinian Authority. The NATO offer would have to be \n     willingly accepted by both governments, and it in no way \n     should be viewed as a challenge to either side's sovereignty. \n     The acceptance of this offer would have to be coupled with a \n     commitment by Israel and the Palestianian Authority to \n     cooperate in every way possible to permit the peacekeeping \n     mission to succeed.\n       I fully recognize that this would not be a risk-free \n     operation for the participating NATO forces. But I \n     nonetheless believe that the offer of peacekeepers from NATO \n     would have many benefits. First, it would demonstrate a \n     strong international commitment to peace in the Middle East. \n     Second, it would offer the prospect of a peacekeeping force \n     that is ready today. It is highly capable, rapidly \n     deployable, and has a proven record of success in the \n     Balkans. A NATO peacekeeping force is likely to be acceptable \n     to both parties, given the traditional European sympathy for \n     the Palestinian cause and the traditional United States \n     support of Israel.\n       Third, this would be a worthy post-Cold War mission for \n     NATO in a region where NATO member countries have legitimate \n     national security interests. It could even be an area of \n     possible collaboration with Russia through the NATO-Russia \n     Council. A NATO peacekeeping mission in the Middle East would \n     be wholly consistent with the Alliance's new Strategic \n     Concept. Approved at the NATO Summit in Washington in April \n     1999, the new Strategic Concept envisioned so called ``out-\n     of-area'' operations for NATO.\n       Given the fractious debate in NATO over Iraq and the \n     defense of Turkey, it would be important to show that NATO \n     can work together to make a positive contribution to solving \n     one of the most challenging security issues of our day.\n       There will be many detractors to the idea of sending NATO \n     peacekeepers to the Middle East to help implement a cease-\n     fire. But I think there is broad agreement on the imperative \n     to giving new hope to the peace process and redoubling \n     diplomatic efforts to keep Israel and the Palestinians moving \n     on the road to peace. Peacekeepers coming from many NATO \n     nations could give new hope and confidence to the peoples of \n     Israel and Palestine that there could soon be an end to the \n     violence that overhangs their daily lives.\n       Mr. President, I hope that you will receive this idea in \n     the constructive spirit in which it is offered.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      John Warner,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 29, 2003.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter about the \n     proposed roadmap to Middle East peace, and your suggestion \n     concerning a NATO peacekeeping force. I understand your view \n     that such an offer could be a further inducement to the \n     parties to reach agreement.\n       As you know, the issues dividing Israelis and Palestinians \n     are deep, complex, and hotly contested. The security \n     arrangements of any settlement are one important element \n     among many. Ultimately, our goal is for two states living \n     side by side in peace. Over the long term, such an \n     arrangement must be sustainable without the presence of \n     outside peacekeeping forces. As we engage the parties in our \n     effort to forge a peace agreement, I will keep your proposal \n     under consideration.\n       I also agree with your comments about the importance of \n     NATO's role as we face the security challenges of the 21st \n     Century. As you know, at the NATO Prague Summit, Allied \n     leaders joined me in launching an ambitious agenda for \n     modernizing NATO, including the creation of a NATO Response \n     Force, reforming the command structure, and bringing in new \n     members who are committed to democracy and collective \n     defense. I appreciate your strong support for this important \n     effort.\n       We have begun steps to increase NATO's role in Afghanistan, \n     and have asked NATO to consider assistance it could provide \n     in post-war Iraq. I welcome your support on these matters as \n     well.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I spoke today with the press about the \nidea that NATO, if requested, might provide a peacekeeping force to \nsupport a cease-fire previously agreed to by the Israeli Government and \nthe Palestinian Authority. NATO peacekeepers would have to be invited \nby both governments, and in no way should be viewed as a challenge to \neither side's sovereignty. The acceptance of this offer would have to \nbe coupled with a commitment by Israel and the Palestinian Authority to \ncooperate in every way possible to permit the peacekeeping mission to \nsucceed.\n  I fully recognize that this would not be a risk-free operation for \nthe participating NATO forces, some of which could be American. But I \nnonetheless believe that the offer of peacekeepers from NATO would have \nmany benefits.\n  First, it would demonstrate a strong international commitment to \npeace in the Middle East. By their presence, NATO peacekeepers might \ngive hope to people on both sides that violence will be curtailed.\n  Second, it would offer the prospect of a peacekeeping force that is \nready to go, today. It is highly capable, rapidly deployable, and has a \nproven record of success with peacekeeping in the Balkans.\n  Third, a NATO peacekeeping force is likely to be acceptable to both \nparties, given the traditional European associations with the \nPalestinian people and the traditional United States associations with \nthe people of Israel.\n  Fourth, it would be a worthy post-Cold War mission for NATO in a \nregion where NATO member countries have legitimate national security \ninterests. In 1999, NATO adopted a new Strategic\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\nConcept that envisioned NATO operations, including peacekeeping \noperations, taking place outside of Europe.\n  There will be many detractors to the idea of sending NATO \npeacekeepers to the Middle East to help implement a cease-fire. There \nis, I acknowledge, a historical record of outside forces being \nunsuccessful in security mission in this area. But I invite the debate, \nfirst and foremost among the NATO members themselves.\n  I think we can all agree on the imperative of redoubling our efforts \nto keep Israel and the Palestinians moving on the road to peace, and of \noffering an alternative that may break the tragic cycle of violence. \nThis is the responsibility not only of the United States, but indeed, \nof the entire international community.\n  Progress on Middle East peace would help us to continue the gains we \nhave made in Iraq to spread peace in the Middle East and to address the \nunderlying causes that have given rise to terrorist groups like al-\nQaeda.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about something that is \nunrelated to any of the subjects we have been discussing today. I rise \nto talk about the news we just heard about an explosion in Israel and \nthe killing of 13 to 15 people--and it is going to be more because, in \naddition to that, there are over 50 who have been seriously injured. We \nhave witnessed an attack like this on innocent civilians by mad men who \nencourage a son, a daughter, a brother, or a sister to blow themselves \nto smithereens, and their mission is to simply kill innocents.\n  For a few moments, let's review a scenario that perhaps would be \nbetter understood in our country. Think about a shopping mall or a busy \nstreet in New York, Detroit, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, or Louisiana, \nand think about people who might be on the bus, youngsters going to \nschool, people going to the doctor, people going to work, people \ncarrying on commerce, and imagine that someone came along with a bomb \nin one of those cities, Washington, DC, and created an explosion that \nkilled 700 people at one shot. That is the equivalent, if we take the \nsize of Israel, about 6 million people--we have 280 million--it is \nabout 45 to 1, so just do the multiplication. We are talking about 700 \npeople who would die in this senseless attack. What would our response \nbe in America? We would call out the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the \nFBI, the police, every agency that could retaliate, either to capture \nor gun down the leader of an organization that would seduce a young \nperson to sacrifice their life for such a heinous purpose.\n  Purportedly this was a response to a tragic accident that took place \nas the Israelis were pursuing the leader of Hamas, the organization \nthat took credit today for killing those innocent people and that takes \ncredit for lots of attacks on innocent people in Israel. So there was a \npursuit by the Israelis of the leader of Hamas because Hamas was an \norganization that helped take five soldiers' lives in Israel on Sunday \nnight. Unfortunately, the hunt went awry and some innocent people were \ntragically killed.\n  When an attack such as that takes place, it is in response, it is in \nretaliation, to the violence that was visited upon the citizens in \nIsrael. When these attacks take place, there is only one mission. They \nare not hunting criminals. They are not trying to capture somebody. \nWhat they are doing is killing innocent people--young people, old \npeople, it does not matter.\n  Today's horrible attack on Jerusalem is another illustration of why \nHamas has no place in any peace process. Hamas is a terror \norganization, has always been a terror organization, and desires to \ncontinue as a terror organization. I think it is time for the world to \nrecognize that Hamas is in the same league as al-Qaida, and we know \nwhat we did when our people were attacked. We did the right thing. We \nsent our troops out. We were looking to capture the leader of that \norganization.\n  We would not stand by 5 minutes and accept it. And Israel should not \nstand by 5 minutes and accept it. We cannot look at the equal violence \non both sides of the issue in Israel and with the Palestinians. They \nare not the same. Israel's attacks are always in retaliation for \nviolence that was put upon Israelis. The other side delights in \nrecording the fact that a suicide bomber took 8, 10, 12 lives, their \ncount--600 people, or whatever the number is, in equivalence in \nAmerica.\n\n  It is time to understand what is going on there. I strongly believe \nthe peace process has to continue, but it should continue with \nPalestinian leaders who have demonstrated that they are interested in \npeace, as is now-Prime Minister Mr. Abbas. I commend the administration \nfor deciding to reengage in the Mideast conflict by introducing and \npromoting a roadmap, a design, for Middle East peace.\n  President Bush's recent visit to the region was an important first \nstep in renewing U.S. commitment to this endeavor, and the \nadministration has to remain committed to peace in the area. President \nBush must forcefully deliver a message to the Palestinians about their \nneed to reconstitute and consolidate their security agencies in order \nto fulfill their stated goal to deter and punish terrorists such as \nHamas, and he has to tell the Israelis that they have the right to \ndefend themselves. They have made very important overtures, especially \nwhen it comes to talk about dismantling some of the settlements.\n  Mr. Abbas' clear statement that the violence of the intifada was a \nbetrayal of the Palestinian cause is the most important reason that \nthere is hope for progress in the Middle East. I am also encouraged \nthat as a goodwill gesture Israel has opened its borders to Palestinian \nworkers, released about 100 Palestinian prisoners, and has begun to \ndismantle some outposts. They are important first steps.\n  Israel and the settlers have to come to terms with the inevitability \nof dismantling some settlements in order to allow for the eventual \ncreation of a contiguous Palestinian state. I was gratified to hear \nfive Arab leaders--President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Crown Prince \nAbdullah of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah of Jordan, King Hamada of \nBahrain, and the new Palestinian Prime Minister, Mahmoud Abbas--release \na statement last Tuesday, June 3, clearly asserting that they oppose \nterrorism and will not finance or arm extremist Palestinian groups.\n  This statement was long overdue. Right now the Arab leaders must \ntranslate this statement into action through one central task, and that \nis strengthening the hand of the new Palestinian Prime Minister, \nMahmoud Abbas.\n  This means conferring on Mr. Abbas the authority they once gave \nYasser Arafat and condemning violent groups such as Hamas and their \nrejectionist agendas. Only a united international front critical of \nterrorists and supportive of Mr. Abbas' plan for the Palestinians' \nfuture can facilitate the implementation of the roadmap.\n  The United States should continue exerting pressure on Syria to shut \ndown its support for Palestinian terrorists, Hezbollah, and other \norganizations, the organizations that have no function except to \ndisrupt the prospect for peace. They should encourage the withdrawal of \nthe Syrians from occupied Lebanon and stem any production or research \non weapons of mass destruction.\n  Sometimes it is hard to understand why an embattled country like \nIsrael will be so effective, so hard, in its response. It is only hard \nto understand if you have not been there. This is a country that seeks \npeace more than any other place on Earth that we can imagine. They have \nlost thousands of people, perhaps hundreds of thousands in the \nequivalent American counts. There is a history of the people there that \nsays they are always the subject of some cruelty, some attacks, some \ninjury, some dead, from outsiders.\n  The last century saw the killing of millions of Jewish people. That \nsets a tone. That tone says, make peace, make life satisfactory. Do the \nthings you have to to create a society, a country. Do what we can do \nabout fighting disease, research what can be done about turning arid \nlands into farm lands, do what can be done to make life more livable. \nYet, these criminal organizations continue to press their attack on \nIsrael.\n  I make this suggestion. If the people in Paris or London or Berlin or \nother capital cities around the world had an attack such as this, we \nwould have a response from the U.N. and everybody else. But when it \ncomes to attacks on Israel, there is a notable silence, except for the \nonly friend that Israel has\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\nin the world, and that is the United States and the American people.\n  We look with horror and grief at what took place this day. \nUnfortunately, this is not an unusual occurrence as far as Israel is \nconcerned. We have to say that we in the United States of America will \nnot tolerate this kind of violence, that we are going to let Israel \nfight back as hard as she has to, to defend herself and force the \ncommunities in the Middle East to understand that there will be no \npeace for anybody. That is very dangerous. That conflict could escalate \ninto a major confrontation in other parts of the world.\n  We send our sadness and condolences to the people of Israel. We wish \nthem well in the future and hope peace will soon be the only \nconfrontation that takes place, and that would be across the table.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7711-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING UWE E.

Mr. President, the new Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \nbudget deficit numbers announced Monday should trouble us all.\n  Only 1 month ago CBO, estimated that the Federal deficit would be \n$300 billion--an alarming number considering that when President Bush \ntook office the Federal Government was running a surplus. Now, CBO has \nnotified Congress that the deficit will be a record $400 billion.\n\n       CBO now projects that the federal government is likely to \n     end fiscal year 2003 with a deficit of more than $400 \n     billion, or close to 4 percent of gross domestic product. The \n     deterioration in the short-term budget outlook stems from \n     continued weakness in revenue collections and from enactment \n     of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, \n     which will add an estimated $61 billion to this year's \n     deficit in the form of tax cuts, refundable credits, and aid \n     to states. The recent extension of unemployment benefits will \n     boost outlays by another $3 billion this year. For the first \n     eight months of 2003, the government ran a deficit of $291 \n     billion, CBO estimates, about twice the shortfall it incurred \n     in the same period last year.\n\n  When President Bush entered the White House in January 2001, the \nNation was enjoying a record budget surplus that was built with hard \nchoices and determination over the previous 8 years. With breathtaking \nspeed, this administration's fiscal irresponsibility has quickly turned \nthose record surpluses into record deficits. In 3 short years, these \npolicies have driven us further into debt, transferred a greater share \nof tax receipts to the pockets of the Nation's most privileged, and \nturned millions of hard-working Americans out of their jobs.\n  In fact, the Labor Department recently reported that the Nation's \nunemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent last month, the highest level in \n9 years. Since the economy began slumping in early 2001, nearly 2.5 \nmillion jobs have disappeared.\n  In 2001, I voted against the President's first tax plan because it \nwas too skewed toward the wealthiest Americans and it was too fiscally \nirresponsible. Since then, we have gone from record surpluses to red \nink, and the economy is still adrift.\n  Yet Congress passed a budget this year--including another ill-advised \ntax plan of $350 billion--that will only further deepen our deficits \nand pump up the national debt. I voted against the tax bill again this \nyear because it is so clearly harmful to the economic health of our \ncountry, especially with the cost of the war in Iraq and the ever-\nincreasing peacekeeping expenses.\n  The budget plans this administration has sent to Congress each year \nhave been full of misguided priorities and squandered opportunities. \nThe President's plans have severely underfunded essential health, \nemployment training and education efforts. They have contained enormous \nGovernment giveaways to wealthy corporations and the wealthiest \nindividuals instead of providing relief for hard-working Americans and \ntheir families. And they have been wholly inadequate to meet the \ndomestic security needs of the first-responder agencies that we are \ncounting on to defend against and prepare for future acts of terrorism.\n  The President's economic plan is not about growing the economy or \ncreating jobs. It is a fiscally irresponsible plan that threatens to \neconomically divide our country. Cutting taxes is a popular thing to \ndo, and I am delighted to vote for tax cuts when they make good fiscal \nsense. But it is not always the right thing to do for the country and \nfor the security and economic well-being of the American people.\n  The 1993 budget bill set the framework to eliminate the Federal \ndeficit and passed by the narrowest of margins. It was a tough vote for \neveryone who voted for that plan and many Senators and Congressmen lost \ntheir seats in the subsequent election before the benefits of the plan \ncould be fully realized. That momentous vote set this country on a \ncourse of surpluses, budget discipline and fiscal responsibility \nunmatched in American history. Unfortunately, the current \nadministration--with its lack of fiscal responsibility--has blown all \nof the progress that many worked so hard to achieve. And the proof is \nin the latest CBO deficit figures.\n  Earlier this year, the President said we should not pass on our \nfiscal problems to future Presidents, Congresses, and generations. On \nthat point, I agree with him. Regrettably, year after year his budgets \nhave driven us deeper into debt, and his policies will do exactly what \nthe President says we should avoid: They will burden our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7711-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on November \n10, 2001. In San Antonio, TX, two people in ski masks robbed and beat \nthe female owner of a small Persian restaurant, leaving behind racial \nslurs on the walls. The attackers forced open a back door. One of them \nbound the victim's hands and legs with duct tape and beat her to the \nground. The second attacker sprayed hate messages on the walls.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7712-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7712]]\nDR. SAMUEL B. HAND, UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT PROFESSOR OF HISTORY EMERITUS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about an \nextraordinary Vermonter, Dr. Samuel B. Hand. Many people argue about \nwhat makes you a true Vermonter. Some say it is if you were born there; \nsome say it is if you plan to die there. Until the debate is concluded, \nthe person who could settle the matter is Dr. Hand.\n  While originally from Long Island, in 1961, Dr. Hand became a \nprofessor of European history at the University of Vermont, UVM. As a \nscholar with a passion for history, Dr. Hand quickly became one who \nadded to Vermont's achievements and glories. He emphasized to his \nstudents the importance and the excitement of the history of Vermont, \nresulting in a number of his former students becoming teachers and \narchivists in Vermont.\n  Last month, the University of Vermont's Center for Research on \nVermont honored Dr. Hand as the recipient of a lifetime achievement \naward for his expertise in Vermont history and his generous mentoring \nskills.\n  In addition to being the ``heart'' of the history department, as his \ncolleagues called him, Dr. Hand coauthored a number of books, including \n``Vermont Voices, A Documentary History of the Green Mountain State'' \nand ``A Vermont Encyclopedia'', and directed a National Endowment for \nthe Humanities-funded series, ``Lake Champlain: Reflections on Our \nPast.'' He was also one of the founding members of the University of \nVermont's Center for Research on Vermont and served as president of the \nVermont Historical Society and as president of the Oral History \nSociety. Today's editorial in the Burlington Free Press praises Dr. \nhand for ``extend[ing] his base beyond the walls of UVM and reinforced \nthe important collaboration between the state's flagship university and \nVermont.''\n  Both the University of Vermont and the State of Vermont are truly \nfortunate to have benefited from the dedication and intelligence of Dr. \nHand. Vermonters likes him make me proud to represent such a great \nState. Mr. President, I would ask that this statement and the \nBurlington Free Press editorial be placed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, June 11, 2003]\n\n                           A Vermont Scholar\n\n       Samuel B. Hand still has a trace of Long Island in his \n     voice, but the retired University of Vermont history \n     professor knows more about Vermont than many of the state's \n     residents.\n       Hand was recognized for his contributions to the study of \n     his adopted state last month when he received a lifetime \n     achievement award from the University of Vermont's Center for \n     Research on Vermont, of which he was a founding member.\n       Although he started out teaching European history when he \n     arrived at UVM in 1961, Hand quickly saw the merit of \n     specializing in Vermont history.\n       His graduate students had a greater opportunity to have \n     their work published than if they had chosen a broader and \n     more heavily researched topic, and many of the students had a \n     personal connection to the state's history.\n       ``I might have a student from California who was a sixth-\n     generation UVMer with a grandfather who was once a state \n     senator,'' Hand said in an interview. ``Vermont history is \n     very personal.''\n       Beyond his mentoring of students--for which he was named \n     UVM graduate faculty teacher of the year in 1994, the year he \n     retired--Hand has been a prolific researcher and writer.\n       The professor of history emeritus has written many articles \n     about Vermont, and co-authored ``Vermont Voices, A \n     Documentary History of the Green Mountain State'' in 1998 and \n     ``A Vermont Encyclopedia,'' which will be out in August.\n       His book, ``The Star That Set, The Vermont Republican \n     Party, 1854-1974,'' was published last year.\n       Hand, 72, has brought together organizations and university \n     disciplines that share a common interest in Vermont. As a \n     former president of the Vermont Historical Society and last \n     year's recipient of the Founders Circle Award from the Ethan \n     Allen Homestead, Hand has extended his base beyond the walls \n     of UVM and reinforced the important collaboration between the \n     state's flagship university and Vermont.\n       Along the way, he has influenced students and aspiring \n     historians to see Vermont history--not as dry and distant--\n     but as alive and brimming with dramatic stories and \n     interesting characters, such as Ethan Allen, Samuel de \n     Champlain and former Gov. George Aiken, described by Hand as \n     ``the quintessential Vermonter against whom other Vermonters \n     measured themselves.''\n       Hand has played a major role in bringing Vermont stories to \n     life and encouraging people to know their roots and \n     appreciate their home. It is work well worth a lifetime \n     achievement award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7712-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AN OKLAHOMA LOSS IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, over the past few months we have seen the \nfall of Saddam Hussein's brutal regime coupled with the dawning of a \nnew day for the Iraqi people.\n  With major military combat operations in Iraq over and the security \nof our homeland bolstered, America and her allies are turning our \nefforts toward helping the Iraqi people build a free society.\n  Like many Americans, I was thrilled and heartened by the dramatic \nimages of U.S. troops helping Iraqi citizens tear down statues and \npaintings of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi people needed our help, our \ntanks, our troops, and our commitment to topple Saddam Hussein.\n  For the first time in their lives, many Iraqis are tasting freedom, \nand like people everywhere, they think it is wonderful. I am proud of \nour military and America's commitment to make the people of the Middle \nEast more free and secure.\n  Our military men and women surely face more difficult days in Iraq, \nand the Iraqi people will be tested by the responsibilities that come \nwith freedom. The thugs who propped up the previous regime and outside \nforces with goals of their own will seek to cause problems, stir up \ntrouble, and initiate violence. Freedom is messy--nowhere more so than \nin a country that has just shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n  But the journey toward a democratic Iraq has now begun. Like so many \nnations before it, Iraq now endures the growing pains common to a \nfledgling democracy. The uncertainty in today's Iraq will soon give way \nto the promise of a better future for the Iraqi people. As we move \ncloser to this goal, we must remember those who sacrificed for this \nnoble cause.\n  Today, I rise to honor a man who made the ultimate sacrifice one can \nmake for his country and the cause of freedom. Petty Officer 3rd Class \nDoyle Wayne Bolinger, Jr., 21, of Poteau, died last week in Iraq when \nan unexploded ordnance accidently detonated in the area where he was \nworking. Bolinger, who joined the Navy shortly after high school, was \nassigned to the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133 based in \nGulfport, MS, whose members are commonly known as Seabees. His unit has \nbeen in the Middle East since January providing construction support to \nour Armed Forces during military operations.\n  Everybody liked Bolinger. He was known to always have a smile on his \nface. People in Poteau, who he often helped out with various jobs, will \nmiss him especially.\n  His family recently issued a statement saying, ``Wayne is a very \nspecial young man and is proud to be a Navy Seabee. He died defending \nhis country. He is without a doubt one of America's finest.''\n  I could not possibly agree more. This young man represents the very \nbest this Nation has to offer. Petty Officer Bolinger did not die in \nvain. He died so many others could live in security and freedom. For \nthat sacrifice we are forever indebted. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith him and his family today and with the troops who are putting their \nlives on the line in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7712-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7712-S7713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMEMBERING THE MIAS OF SULTAN YAQUB ON THE 21ST ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR \n                                CAPTURE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join \nme in remembering the Israeli soldiers captured by the Syrians during \nthe 1982 Israeli war with Lebanon. It is with great sadness that we \nmark today 21 long years of anguish for their families, who continue to \ndesperately seek information about their sons.\n  On June 11, 1982, an Israeli unit battled with a Syrian armored unit \nin the Bekaa Valley in northeastern Lebanon. Sergeant Zachary Baumel, \nFirst Sergeant Zvi Feldman, and Corporal Yehudah Katz were captured by \nthe\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\nSyrians that day. They were identified as an Israeli tank crew, and \nreported missing in Damascus. the Israeli tank, flying the Syrian and \nPalestinian flag, was greeted with cheers from bystanders.\n  Since that terrible day in 1982, the governments of Israel and the \nUnited States have been doing their utmost by working with the office \nof the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations, \nand other international bodies to obtain any possible information about \nthe fate of the missing soldiers. According to the Geneva Convention, \nSyria is responsible for the fates of the Israeli soldiers because the \narea in Lebanon where the soldiers disappeared was continually \ncontrolled by Syria. To this day, despite promises made by the \ngovernment of Syria and by the Palestinians, very little information \nhas been released about the condition of Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman, \nand Yehudah Katz.\n  Today marks the anniversary of the day that these soldier were \nreported missing in action. Twenty-one pain-filled years have passed \nsince their families have seen their sons, and still Syria has not \nrevealed their whereabouts nor provided any information as to their \ncondition.\n  One of these missing soldiers, Zachary Baumel, is an American citizen \nfrom my home of Brooklyn, NY. An ardent basketball fan, Zachary began \nhis studies at the Hebrew School in Boro Park. In 1979, he moved to \nIsrael with other family members and continued his education at \nYeshivat Hesder, where religious studies are integrated with army \nservice. When the war with Lebanon began, Zachary was completing his \nmilitary service and was looking forward to attending Hebrew \nUniversity, where he had been accepted to study psychology. but fate \ndecreed otherwise and on June 11, 1982, he disappeared with Zvi Feldman \nand Yehudah Katz.\n  During the 106th Congress, I cosponsored and helped to pass Public \nLaw 106-89, which specifies that the State Department must raise the \nplight of these missing soldiers in all relevant discussions and report \nfindings to Congress regarding the development in the Middle East. We \nneed to know that every avenue has been pursued in order to help bring \nabout the speedy return of these young men. Therefore, I strongly feel \nthat we must be sure to continue the full implementation of Public Law \n106-89, so that information about these men can be brought to light.\n  Zachary's parents Yonah and Miriam Baumel have been relentless in \ntheir pursuit of information about Zachary and his compatriots. I have \nworked closely with the Baumels, as well as the Union of Orthodox \nJewish Congregations of America, and the American Coalition of Missing \nIsraeli Soldiers, and the MIA Task Force of the Conference of \nPresidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. These groups have \nbeen at the forefront of this pursuit of justice. I want to recognize \ntheir good work and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting their \nefforts. For two decades these families have been without their \nchildren. Answers are long overdue.\n  The agony of the families of these kidnapped Israeli soldiers is \nextreme. They have not heard a word regarding the fate of their sons. I \nbelieve that we must pledge to do our utmost to obtain information \nabout these soldiers and to bring them home, for the sake of peace, \ndecency and humanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7713-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE COAL ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on June 10, Senator Grassley, chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Finance, issued a statement concerning the Coal \nAct, included in the 1992 Energy bill, and very specifically the \nintolerable situation regarding reachback and superreachback coal \ncompanies.\n  The tax levied on these companies in that act is unfair. It never \nshould have been enacted to begin with. It even applies to companies \nthat are no longer in the coal mining business. The Coal Act created \nthe combined benefit fund, CBF, in an attempt to solve many of the \npension problems of retired coal miners. There were never any hearings. \nThere was no serious debate on the Senate floor.\n  The combined benefit fund is approaching insolvency. There are \naccountants who today would say it is already insolvent. It has been \nsaved from terminable illness only by annual appropriations in recent \nAppropriations bills. These appropriations do not permanently solve the \nproblem.\n  I, for a number of years, have attempted to pass legislation to solve \nthis issue. It is my hope that the House of Representatives would at \nlast send to the Senate a bill rectifying this problem so we might also \nenact it and at least put an end to this inequity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7713-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7713-S7714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEDICATION OF THE BATTLE CREEK FEDERAL CENTER\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, on Saturday, May 31, I had the honor of \nbeing present at the renaming of the Battle Creek, MI Federal Center \nfor three American heroes, the late Senator Phil Hart, my husband Bob \nDole, and my Senate colleague Dan Inouye.\n  This recognition would not have happened without the efforts of my \nfriend and colleague, Carl Levin. At the dedication Senator Levin spoke \neloquently and his message about honor, duty, country captured the \nattention and respect of all those present at this important event. I \nthank him again and ask unanimous consent that his remarks be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       ``What an overwhelming moment this is for all of us just to \n     be with these heroes and their families. For Barb and me it's \n     a treasured moment to join with Bob Dole, Danny Inouye, and \n     two sons of Phil Hart, Jim and Walter Hart; to be with my \n     colleague Libby Dole. You know, I used to say that the U.S. \n     Senate was the world's most exclusive club. They used to say \n     that. But now, Barb, my wife, and Bob will testify to this, \n     are members of the truly most exclusive club in the world \n     which is the Senate's spouse club, because now that Libby \n     Dole is in the Senate, Bob Dole knows what it's like to be a \n     Senate spouse.\n       Thanks are due to so many people for making this day \n     possible. We are very grateful to the General Services \n     Administration for their prompt response to the idea; \n     Administrator Perry, thank you. To the people of Battle \n     creek, first and foremost, for again accepting three American \n     soldiers into your heart as you did tens of thousands of \n     American soldiers many years ago. By renaming this building \n     and accepting these three names, you have again said what \n     this community truly is all about and what you, in Battle \n     Creek, and what the workers in this federal center are all \n     about. Thank you for taking them back into your hearts and \n     embracing them by accepting these three names.\n       For thousands of young soldiers, this was the place they \n     came home, the place where a grateful America cared for the \n     injuries they received defending our nation. And today, by \n     renaming this building we are paying tribute to three \n     soldiers who became close friends during their convalesces at \n     Percy Jones Army Hospital, and went on to serve together in \n     the United States Senate. Renaming the federal center after \n     these three heroes recognizes their unique achievements while \n     honoring all those who received care here and who provided \n     care here. As a new generation of valiant soldiers emerges \n     from the conflict in the Persian Gulf, and we greeted many of \n     them just a few weeks ago here in Battle Creek, it is more \n     appropriate than ever we remember past heroes who were \n     wounded in service to their country. By honoring these three \n     men we will inspire a new generation to follow their example.\n       Phil Hart, a native son of Michigan, was wounded during the \n     D-Day assault. He spent more than three months at the Army \n     hospital here in Battle Creek. According to Bob Dole, Phil \n     hart would tirelessly spend from morning 'til night running \n     errands for the rest of us. He was, in Bob Dole's words, and \n     I know Danny Inouye shared this very deeply, `he was without \n     a doubt one of the finest men I ever knew'. Phil hart became \n     the conscious of the Senate, whose decency was legendary and \n     whose integrity was so deep that he would without flinching \n     take on an unpopular cause, or a powerful constituency, for \n     the good of the nation.\n       Bob Dole arrived at Percy Jones in a plaster body cast. His \n     recovery program overall took three years, which underscores \n     his courage and his determination. When told by doctors his \n     disability would be career dooming, he refused to accept \n     their diagnosis and he fought successfully to prove them \n     wrong. In his first speech in the Senate, in 1969, which \n     was 25-years to the day after his serious wounds were \n     received in Italy, leading his squad of the 10th Mountain \n     Division in the Italian Alps, Bob Dole, in that first \n     speech, called for the creation of a commission to seek \n     ways to assist people with disabilities. Two decades \n     later, the Americans With Disabilities Act crowned that \n     effort and in Bob Dole's last speech in the United States \n     Senate, he spoke of his meeting and his friendship, his \n     lifelong friendship that was created here with Phil Hart \n     and Danny Inouye.\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\n       As a seventeen-year-old, Danny Inouye joined the Army. He \n     joined the 443nd Regimental Combat Team, the `go for broke' \n     regiment comprised of Japanese American soldiers. Their \n     courage, in the face of often-insurmountable odds make them \n     the most decorated unit in Europe. His extraordinary display \n     of valor led to him receiving the Congressional Medal of \n     Honor.\n       I want to read just a few words from that particular Medal \n     of Honor award to Danny Inouye. `He directed his platoon \n     through a hail of automatic weapon and small arms fire. In a \n     swift and developing movement that resulted in the capture of \n     an artillery and mortar post, he brought his men within 40-\n     yards of the hostile force. Emplaced in bunkers and rock \n     formations, the enemy halted the advance with crossfire from \n     three machine guns. With complete disregard for his personal \n     safety, Second Lieutenant Daniel Inouye crawled up the \n     treacherous slope to within five yards of the nearest machine \n     gun and hurled two grenades, destroying the emplacement. \n     Before the enemy could retaliate, he stood up and neutralized \n     a second machine gun. Although wounded by a sniper's bullet, \n     he continued to engage other hostile positions at close range \n     until an exploding grenade shattered his right arm. Despite \n     the intense pain, he refused evacuation and continued to \n     direct his platoon until enemy resistance was broken, and his \n     men were again deployed in defensive positions'.\n       Now, I read that, not to single out Danny, but to remind us \n     all, that all the while that he, and so many other Americans \n     of Japanese descent like Danny, where fighting for us. Their \n     families were in internment camps, where they had been placed \n     because of their ancestry during World War II, having been \n     torn from their homes at the beginning of the war. In combat, \n     these men learned a valuable lesson that shaped their work in \n     the Senate. In the foxhole, there are no Democrats and \n     Republicans, liberals or conservatives. There are only \n     Americans. Having fought to defeat those who would steal our \n     nation's freedom, each of them, in their Senate careers, \n     sought to ensure that all Americans would continue to realize \n     the promise of justice and liberty, a promise in our \n     Constitution.\n       Tom Brokaw's name has been mentioned and I just wanted to \n     read for you a short excerpt for an interview that Tom Brokaw \n     had with Larry King:\n       Tom Brokaw: ``Difficult conditions are a test for great \n     people. About whether they can measure up to it or not. And a \n     lot of these veterans that I have written about'', referring \n     to his book, ``said that it made a man out of me, or a young \n     woman would say I went from being a giddy teenager to being a \n     mature woman overnight.''\n       And then Brokaw went on, ``I'll just tell you one quick \n     story. I've been talking about the renewed need for public \n     service and having a sense that you do owe your country \n     something. In one hospital ward in Michigan, there was a \n     young man from Kansas who had had his arm shattered in combat \n     in Italy, and in the next bed was a young man from Honolulu \n     who was a Japanese American, who had lost his arm in the \n     442nd, and in the third bed was a young man from a family in \n     Michigan who was also wounded. And he was able to get out of \n     the hospital, to get theatre tickets and other things. Bob \n     Dole was one. Danny Inouye was the other one. And Phil Hart, \n     for whom the largest Senate office building is now named, was \n     the third one. And they talked about their future lives, and \n     they all decided it would be public service. They had just \n     given up their youth in combat, but they came back and said \n     they wanted to get involved running for public office. And \n     they all ended up in the Senate.''\n       Larry King said, ``Who could write that? That's fiction.'' \n     And Tom Brokaw said, ``I know, it's amazing.''\n       This building has helped define our nation for one hundred \n     years, and how truly fitting it is that three of our nations \n     heroes, in war and in peace, whose lives were first \n     intertwined so closely here, whose friendships were forged \n     here, who had a seminal life experience here, who were later \n     united in the Senate, are reunited again in the naming, and \n     renaming, of this federal building. They gained strength \n     here, and then they gave again of that strength to brighten \n     the future of the nation that they loved. The renaming of \n     this building after them is icing on the 100th birthday cake \n     of this wonderful, historic building.\n           Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7714-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR JACQUES PAUL KLEIN\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a friend and an \noutstanding citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Ambassador Jacques \nPaul Klein, on the occasion of his retirement from the U.S. Foreign \nService.\n  Ambassador Klein was born in Selestat in the Alsace region of France \nin 1939 and spent the first 5 years of his life living in a war zone. \nWhen World War II ended, Ambassador Klein and his mother came to the \nUnited States in search of a better life and a brighter future. They \nsettled in Chicago, where Mr. Klein worked his way through school and \neventually joined the U.S. Air Force, volunteering to serve his new \ncountry in Vietnam. In so doing, he realized a dream that started as a \nyoung boy when he watched victorious allied fighter planes flying over \nFrance.\n  In 1971 Mr. Klein joined the Foreign Service. His initial tour of \nduty was in the Center of the Executive Secretariat, Office of the \nSecretary of State. He was posted abroad to serve as Consular Officer \nat the American Consulate General in Bremen, Germany. In 1979 he was \nselected to attend the National War College and upon graduation served \nas a Senior Advisor for International Affairs to the Secretary of the \nAir Force. In 1990 he once again answered the call of his country \nreturning to Europe to serve as Senior Political Advisor to the \nCommander and Chief of the United States European Command in Stuttgart, \nGermany.\n  In 1996 United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali \nselected him to serve as Transitional Administrator for Eastern \nSlavonia and Baranya with the rank of Under Secretary-General. After \ndirecting another successful international mission, Ambassador Klein \nonce again answered the call of his country--accepting the nomination \nof the U.S. Government as the Principal Deputy High Representative in \nBosnia and Herzegovina.\n  In 1999 after more then 2 years of dedicated work to rebuild the war-\ntorn Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Klein was named by United Nations \nSecretary General Kofi Annan as Under Secretary General to the United \nNations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Under the direction of \nAmbassador Klein, the UN Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina completed \nthe most extensive police reform and restructuring mission ever \nundertaken at the United Nations.\n  Ambassador Klein's distinguished career in the U.S. Foreign Service \nand U.S. Air Force and Air Force Reserve demonstrates his continued \nwillingness to valiantly serve his country. In addition to retiring as \nMajor General of the U.S. Air Force, Ambassador Klein has been awarded \nthe Secretary of Defense Outstanding Public Service award, the Air \nForce Distinguished Service Medal, and a Bronze Star.\n  I am particularly proud of Ambassador Klein for his service to the \nUnited States and to the international community. His hard work and \ncommitment to further the cause of international peace, to alleviate \nsuffering, and to help those affected by international conflict have \nmade him a respected member of the U.S. Foreign Service. His central \ngoal in life has been to give something back, through his military and \ngovernment service, to the country that took him in after World War II \nand provided him with so many opportunities. To that end, he has been a \nsuccess that all Virginians and all Americans can be proud of.\n  I wish to extend my sincerest congratulations to Ambassador Jacques \nPaul Klein and his family on the occasion of his retirement. I am \nhonored to recognize his many accomplishments and applaud his \ndistinguished service to our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7714-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7714-S7715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN REMEMBRANCE OF JANINE LOUISE JOHNSON\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am here to remember the life of \nJanine Johnson--formerly with the Senate's Office of Legislative \nCounsel--who sadly passed away last month while still in the prime of \nher young life of 37 years.\n  Janine served in the Senate for 13 years. Some of her major \nresponsibilities included drafting child nutrition and agriculture \nlegislation for me, and for many other Senators.\n  After beginning her work for the Senate, she had a hand in crafting \nevery major child nutrition law while I was chairman of the \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, when Senator Lugar took \nover as chairman after me, and for Chairman Tom Harkin.\n  She will be sorely missed as the Senate prepares to complete the \nchild nutrition reauthorization this year.\n  She was a careful, creative, and precise drafter of some of America's \nmost important nutrition laws, which stand now in silent testament to \nher life.\n  She was as cheerful and careful at 2:00 p.m. working out complicated \ndrafts, as she was at 2:00 a.m. working on even more complicated \ndrafts. My senior nutrition counsel for many years, Ed Barron, drove \nher home more than once after the metro closed at midnight.\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\n  I know how hard this tragic loss weighs on her friends and colleagues \nat the Senate Legislative Counsel's Office.\n  She was admired by her peers, her friends, and her Senate clients.\n  It was clear from an early age that Janine would be a star. She \ngraduated first in her class from Winchester High School in \nMassachusetts.\n  In 1986, she graduated with high honors from Harvard Law School. She \nclerked for the Honorable Cecil Poole on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit.\n  Following her clerkship, she came to the Senate Office of Legislative \nCounsel.\n  According to Janine's friends here in the Senate, she loved life \noutside the Senate as much as her work within it. Janine loved theater, \nmusic, and swing dancing.\n  Of Janine it can truly be said, that there has ``passed away a glory \nfrom the Earth.''\n  The poet Wordsworth continues--\n\n     ``Though nothing can bring back the hour\n     Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower;\n     We will grieve not, rather find\n     Strength in what remains behind.''\n\n  Janine has touched many of our lives and honored the Senate with her \ndedicated and outstanding service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7715-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nIndianapolis, IN. Private Jesse M. Halling, 19 years old, was killed in \nTikrit, Iraq on June 7, 2003 when his military police station came \nunder grenade and small-arms fire. Jesse joined the Army with his \nentire life before him. He chose to risk everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld from home.\n  Jesse was the sixth Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, I join Jesse's family, his \nfriends, and the entire Indianapolis community in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over his death, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is this courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Jesse, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Jesse Halling was a hard-working student, admired by all who knew him \nfor his strong work ethic and remembered by both friends and teachers \nas a well-liked young man. Friends recall that Jesse always wanted to \nbe a soldier, to follow in the footsteps of his father, who had served \nfor 4 years in the Air Force.\n  Jesse graduated from Ben Davis High School in 2002, where he was a \nmember of the weighlifting and Spanish clubs. After graduating high \nschool, where he served as part of his school's ROTC unit, Jesse joined \nthe Army in the military police division.\n  Jesse leaves behind his father, Alma Halling, and his mother, Pamela \nHalling. As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jesse \nHalling's sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he \naddressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We \ncannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. \nThe brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated \nit, far above our poor to add or detract. The world will little note \nnor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they \ndid here.'' This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 \nyears ago, as I am certain that the impact of Jesse Halling's actions \nwill live on far longer than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jesse M. Halling in the \nofficial record of the Senate for his service to this country and for \nhis profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nJesse's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears form off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7715-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HONORING JESSICA COLLINS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Jessica was recognized at an awards gala hosted by the \nLouisville Courier-Journal Newspaper as part of their 2003 Salute to \nYoung Achievers.\n  Jessica earned this distinguished honor by sharing her commitment to \nagricultural development through a written essay reviewed and selected \nby the Kentucky Association of Future Farmers of America and the \nKentucky Department of Education. The thoughts conveyed in her essay \nare not empty words, but instead, hours of hard work show her \ncommitment to excellence.\n  A graduate of Meade County High School, Jessica's future plans \ninclude pursuing a college degree and continuing her passion of \nranching. Currently, over 19 Angus cows and numerous farming equipment \nfall under her ownership and direction. This strong business interest \nwas first sparked in her local 4-H chapter and will aid her as she \nseeks an economics degree at Western Kentucky University.\n  I am pleased that Jessica takes such an interest in her community and \nin agriculture. Her expertise and experience will serve Kentucky well. \nI want to thank the Senate for allowing me to congratulate Jessica \nCollins.

In addition to creating a business \nin Ohio and being active in numerous civic organizations. Nirmal and \nhis wife Tripta have maintained strong ties to the Asian Indian \nAmerican community. I have often said, ``show me someone who is proud \nof their ethnic heritage and I'll show you a great American!''\n  I am proud to say I have worked with Nirmal Sinha for many years. In \n1992, as Governor of Ohio, I appointed him to the Ohio Civil Rights \nCommission. I reappointed him in 1997, and I am gratified that Mr. \nSinha served two 5-year terms, helping to enforce State laws \nprohibiting discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and higher \neducation. He has worked with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to \ndevelop outreach programs, particularly to Hispanic and Asian \nAmericans.\n  As mayor of Cleveland and as Governor of Ohio, I was close to the \nAsian Indian American community and knew of Nirmal's distinguished \nrecord as a business leader and someone who was active in a variety of \ncivic organizations. Some of those organizations include the Asian \nIndian American Business Group, AIABG, of Columbus, founding member of \nthe Global Organization of People of Indian Origin, GOPIO, the Asian \nIndian Alliance of Ohio, and the Asian Indian Forum for Political \nEducation.\n  Mr. Sinha also has served as a member of the Ameritech Consumer \nAdvisory Board, Columbus International Program, and Main Street \nBusiness Association, member of the advisory board to the Ohio State \nUniversity's Department of Communications, and a director of the \nCentral Ohio March of Dimes and the International Center in Columbus.\n  Nirmal Sinha is an accomplished professional who always makes time to \ngive to others. Mr. Sinha is active in\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\nboth the National Association of Human Rights Workers, NAHRW, and the \nInternational Association of Official Human Rights Agencies, IAOHRA.\n\n  In 1998, the Columbus Dispatch awarded Mr. Sinha the Outstanding \nCommunity Service Award. In 1989, he received the Outstanding Community \nService Award from the mayor of Columbus.\n  Mr. Sinha's record in human rights is exceptional. In 1998, he \ninitiated the first ever ``Asian Roundtable'' discussion on Civil \nRights with joint efforts involving the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission and the Ohio Rights Commission. Also in 1998, Mr. Sinha \nreceived the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Award for Community Service to \nthe State of Ohio.\n  In his profession, Mr. Sinha is an accomplished mechanical engineer \nand has been involved in the design and construction of large electric \npower plants. He holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering \nfrom Jadavapur University in Calcutta, India, and a master's degree \nfrom the Polytechnic University of New York. He also studied management \nat the Ohio State University and computer science at Franklin \nUniversity. Currently, he is president of Marketing USA Group, a \nconsulting firm he founded which advises clients on energy, \ntelecommunications, technology, and global business.\n  As a humanitarian, Mr. Sinha is known for his quiet leadership. He \nhas been called ``a humble man with a compassion for human and civil \nrights.'' Throughout his career, Nirmal Sinha has exemplified the \nhighest American values, including good citizenship, and responsibility \nto his fellow man.\n  Nirmal Sinha is very deserving of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. \nAmerica is a nation of immigrants, and I believe our cultural and \nethnic diversity helps make us strong.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, one of the goals that I set for my \nadministration was to celebrate the cultural diversity of our State by \nseeking out individuals from nontraditional ethnic groups and giving \nthem an opportunity to serve. I am proud that I appointed a number of \nAsian Indian Americans, such as Nirmal Sinha, to various boards and \ncommissions, particularly in such fields, as medicine, manufacturing, \nand higher education.\n  Mr. Sinha is in good company as a recipient of the Ellis Island Medal \nof Honor. Former recipients include four Presidents, several Senators \nand Congressmen, and Nobel Prize winners.\n  As someone who has had the pleasure of knowing and working with Mr. \nSinha, I can guarantee that his significant contributions to his \ncommunity and to the State of Ohio will not stop, but will continue to \ngrow. I also know that he does not seek recognition for his \nhumanitarian service. Instead, he lives in accordance with his strong \nfaith, and his commitment to education, his family, and his community.\n  Nirmal Sinha is someone all of us would do well to emulate and I am \npleased and proud to salute him and his wife Tripti and their two \ndaughters.\n  I congratulate Nirmal Sinha as a 2003 Ellis Island Medal of Honor \nwinner. He is an outstanding American whose dedicated service to others \nhelps improve the quality of life for his fellow Americans every \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/11/senate-section/article/S7716-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 925.

A bill to designate the newly-constructed annex to the E. \nBarrett Prettyman Courthouse located at 333 Constitution Ave., NW., in \nWashington, DC., as the ``James L. Buckley Annex to the E. Barrett \nPrettyman United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ndesignate the newly-constructed annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman \nUnited States Courthouse as the ``James L. Buckley Annex.'' As members \nof this body well know, Judge Buckley served in this Senate from 1971-\n77, as a trusted colleague from the State of New York. During his \ntenure here, Judge Buckley was greatly admired for his dedication, \nintegrity, and professionalism.\n  Judge Buckley's lengthy public service career is one of great \ndistinction. In addition to the time he spent here in the Senate, Judge \nBuckley served in the United States Navy during World War II, as \nUndersecretary of State for Security Assistance, and as President of \nRadio Free Europe. Most recently, he served for more than a decade as a \nCircuit Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit, in the E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse.\n  Earlier this Congress, we honored Judge Buckley, on the celebration \nof his 80th birthday, by passing unanimously a resolution, S. Res. 88, \nacknowledging his distinguished career in the executive, legislative, \nand judicial branches of the United States.\n  Naming the new annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse after \nJudge Buckley would be a fitting tribute to our former colleague and \nprominent jurist. I am honored to offer this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this well-deserved commendation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Edwards, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1233. A bill to authorize assistance for the National Great Blacks \nin Wax Museum and Justice Learning Center; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the National Great \nBlack Americans Commemoration Act. I am proud to sponsor this \nlegislation. Black Americans have a rich history that must be cherished \nand remembered. This bill will honor African American leaders from \nacross the country--some who are well known, and others who are almost \nforgotten--by helping to preserve their names, faces, and stories for \ngenerations to come.\n  This legislation will provide Federal assistance to expand exhibits \nand educational programs at the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum and \nJustice Learning Center in Baltimore, Maryland. The museum showcases \nthe lives of great Black Americans who have proudly served the United \nStates--from civil servants like Mary McLeod Bethune, to military \nheroes like Colin Powell, to Congressional leaders like Senator Edward \nBrooke, R-MA, and civil rights leaders like Rosa Parks. Some are \nhousehold names, like Frederick Douglass and Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. Yet many more are unfamiliar, like the 22 African Americans who \nserved in Congress in the 1800s. It's time we give these pioneers the \nrecognition they deserve.\n  Maryland is proud to be home to so many important figures in black \nhistory. From the dark days of slavery through the civil rights \nmovement, Marylanders have led the way. The brilliant Frederick \nDouglass was the voice of the voiceless in the struggle against \nslavery. The courageous Harriet Tubman delivered 300 slaves to freedom \non the Underground Railroad. The great Thurgood Marshall argued the \nBrown v. Board of Education Case before the Supreme Court, and later \nbecame a Supreme Court Justice himself.\n  Maryland is home to contemporary leaders, too. The dynamic Kweisi \nMfume, president of the NAACP, who, like me, came out of the Baltimore \nCity Council. The passionate Elijah Cummings, Chair of the \nCongressional Black Caucus. Clarence Mitchell who was called by many \nthe 101st Senator. Parren Mitchell and Al Wynn, fighting for their \nconstituents. And all the members of the NAACP, which calls Baltimore \nhome.\n  It is fitting that the national Great Blacks in Wax Museum and \nJustice Learning Center also calls Baltimore home. The museum and \nlearning center is a popular and respected black history museum. \nApproximately 300,000 people a year from around the country and the \nworld visit the museum. Many are school children, who can see \nhistorical figures come to life in the museum's exhibits. Expansion \nwill allow the museum to teach even more visitors about the important \ncontributions of Black Americans. It will also help revitalize a poor \nneighborhood in East Baltimore. There will be new jobs. There will be \nmore tourists. There will be new small businesses. And most important, \nthere will be new inspiration for our young people.\n  The State of Maryland and City of Baltimore have already contributed \nover $5 million toward this expansion project. Private donors are \ncontributing too. Now it's time for the Federal Government to do its \npart. Let's help make this museum a treasure for the entire Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Great Black \n     Americans Commemoration Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Black Americans have served honorably in Congress, in \n     senior executive branch positions, in the law, the judiciary, \n     and other fields, yet their record of service is not well \n     known by the public, is not included in school history \n     lessons, and is not adequately presented in the Nation's \n     museums.\n       (2) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. in Baltimore, \n     Maryland, a nonprofit organization, is the Nation's first wax \n     museum presenting the history of great Black Americans, \n     including those who have served in Congress, in senior \n     executive branch positions, in the law, the judiciary, and \n     other fields, as well as others who have made significant \n     contributions to benefit the Nation.\n       (3) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. plans to expand \n     its existing facilities to establish the National Great \n     Blacks in Wax\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\n     Museum and Justice Learning Center, which is intended to \n     serve as a national museum and center for presentation of wax \n     figures and related interactive educational exhibits \n     portraying the history of great Black Americans.\n       (4) The wax medium has long been recognized as a unique and \n     artistic means to record human history through preservation \n     of the faces and personages of people of prominence, and \n     historically, wax exhibits were used to commemorate noted \n     figures in ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and Rome, in \n     medieval Europe, and in the art of the Italian renaissance.\n       (5) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. was founded in \n     1983 by Drs. Elmer and Joanne Martin, 2 Baltimore educators \n     who used their personal savings to purchase wax figures, \n     which they displayed in schools, churches, shopping malls, \n     and festivals in the mid-Atlantic region.\n       (6) The goal of the Martins was to test public reaction to \n     the idea of a Black history wax museum and so positive was \n     the response over time that the museum has been heralded by \n     the public and the media as a national treasure.\n       (7) The museum has been the subject of feature stories by \n     CNN, the Wall Street Journal, the Baltimore Sun, the \n     Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Sun Times, \n     the Dallas Morning News, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, \n     the Afro American Newspaper, Crisis, Essence Magazine, and \n     others.\n       (8) More than 300,000 people from across the Nation visit \n     the museum annually.\n       (9) The new museum will carry on the time honored artistic \n     tradition of the wax medium; in particular, it will recognize \n     the significant value of this medium to commemorate and \n     appreciate great Black Americans whose faces and personages \n     are not widely recognized.\n       (10) The museum will employ the most skilled artisans in \n     the wax medium, use state-of-the-art interactive exhibition \n     technologies, and consult with museum professionals \n     throughout the Nation, and its exhibits will feature the \n     following:\n       (A) Blacks who have served in the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States, including those who \n     represented constituencies in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, \n     Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and \n     Virginia during the 19th century.\n       (B) Blacks who have served in the judiciary, in the \n     Department of Justice, as prominent attorneys, in law \n     enforcement, and in the struggle for equal rights under the \n     law.\n       (C) Black veterans of various military engagements, \n     including the Buffalo Soldiers and Tuskegee Airmen, and the \n     role of Blacks in the settlement of the western United \n     States.\n       (D) Blacks who have served in senior executive branch \n     positions, including members of Presidents' Cabinets, \n     Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of Federal \n     agencies, and Presidential advisers.\n       (E) Other Blacks whose accomplishments and contributions to \n     human history during the last millennium and to the Nation \n     through more than 400 years are exemplary, including Black \n     educators, authors, scientists, inventors, athletes, clergy, \n     and civil rights leaders.\n       (11) The museum plans to develop collaborative programs \n     with other museums, serve as a clearinghouse for training, \n     technical assistance, and other resources involving use of \n     the wax medium, and sponsor traveling exhibits to provide \n     enriching museum experiences for communities throughout the \n     Nation.\n       (12) The museum has been recognized by the State of \n     Maryland and the city of Baltimore as a preeminent facility \n     for presenting and interpreting Black history, using the wax \n     medium in its highest artistic form.\n       (13) The museum is located in the heart of an area \n     designated as an empowerment zone, and is considered to be a \n     catalyst for economic and cultural improvements in this \n     economically disadvantaged area.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL GREAT BLACKS IN WAX MUSEUM \n                   AND JUSTICE LEARNING CENTER.\n\n       (a) Assistance for Museum.--Subject to subsection (b), the \n     Attorney General, acting through the Office of Justice \n     Programs of the Department of Justice, shall, from amounts \n     made available under subsection (c), make a grant to the \n     Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. in Baltimore, Maryland, to \n     pay the Federal share of the costs of expanding and creating \n     the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum and Justice Learning \n     Center, including the cost of its design, planning, \n     furnishing, and equipping.\n       (b) Grant Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--To receive a grant under subsection (a), \n     the Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. shall submit to the \n     Attorney General a proposal for the use of the grant, which \n     shall include detailed plans for the design, construction, \n     furnishing, and equipping of the National Great Blacks in Wax \n     Museum and Justice Learning Center.\n       (2) Federal share.--The Federal share of the costs \n     described in subsection (a) shall not exceed 25 percent.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $15,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Mikulski as \ncosponsor of the ``National Great Black Americans Commemoration Act of \n2003.'' This legislation will help offer a more complete portrayal of \nour Nation's proud history--one that includes an increased awareness of \nthe contributions made by many great black Americans of various fields \nand accomplishments.\n  This legislation seeks to recognize the contributions of African \nAmericans who have served in Congress or other government capacities, \nin the military, or in other important roles as educators, authors, \nscientists, inventors, athletes, clergy and civil rights leaders. \nClearly, there are few, if any, areas of American culture and history \nthat have not been touched and improved upon by the impact of black \nindividuals. As we recognize this, it is important that we also \nrecognize those whose goal is to make available the history of these \noutstanding people.\n  One such institution is The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, a nonprofit \norganization in Baltimore, MD, whose mission is to present the history \nof black Americans and to highlight their contributions to our nation. \nI believe that this institution's work thus far and its goals for the \nfuture make it worthy of our support. This legislation not only \ncommends the efforts made by this museum to date, but authorizes the \nappropriation of funds that will help the museum to improve and expand. \nAppropriate Federal assistance, coupled with other funding raised by \nthe museum, will allow the current institution to become the National \nGreat Blacks in Wax Museum and Justice Learning Center, which will be \nbetter equipped to serve its purposes. This improved museum will be a \nbright example for projects with similar goals and will provide an \nexcellent source of historical education for all who visit.\n  I am a strong believer that our history should be presented in a \ncomplete and accurate manner. Where we have understated in the past, we \nshould make amends. The development of the National Great Blacks in Wax \nMuseum and Justice Learning Center will be a valuable statement \nrecognizing the contributions of so many great African Americans. I \nhope that my colleagues will see the merit in this endeavor and will \nlend their support to the National Great Black Americans Commemoration \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1234. A bill to reauthorize the Federal Trade Commission, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am joined by the Chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee's Competition, Foreign Commerce, and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee, Senator Smith, in introducing the Federal \nTrade Commission Reauthorization Act of 2003. This legislation is \ndesigned to reauthorize the Federal Trade Commission, FTC or \nCommission, in furtherance of its mission to enhance the efficient \noperation of the marketplace by both eliminating acts or practices that \nare unfair or deceptive and preventing anti-competitive conduct. This \nvital consumer protection agency has not been reauthorized since 1996.\n  Title I of the bill is nearly identical to legislation that was \nreported by the Commerce Committee last year. It would authorize \nfunding for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2006. In addition, this portion \nof the bill would authorize the FTC to provide investigative and other \nservices to a requesting law enforcement agency and receive from that \nagency, if offered, reimbursement for the FTC's involvement. This part \nof the bill also would grant the Commission the authority it has \nrequested to receive gifts or items that would be useful to the \nCommission as long as a conflict of interest is not created by such \nreceipt.\n  The second title of the bill is designed to mitigate the challenges \nthat the FTC currently faces in combating cross-border fraud. The FTC's \nresponsibility to protect consumers is essential, particularly in \ntoday's global climate of high-speed information and marketing, which \nknows no international borders. This title would improve the \nCommission's ability to: share information involving cross-border fraud \nwith foreign consumer protection agencies; secure confidential\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\ninformation from those foreign agencies; take legal action in foreign \njurisdictions; seek redress on behalf of foreign consumers victimized \nby U.S.-based wrongdoers; make criminal referrals for cross-border \ncriminal activity; and strengthen its relationship with foreign \nconsumer protection agencies. The Competition Subcommittee will hold a \nhearing later today on the FTC's reauthorization and will consider a \nnumber of issues including the Commission's cross-border fraud \nproposal.\n  Not included in the bill is language that was reported by the \nCommerce Committee last Fall that would repeal the ``common carrier'' \nexemption in the FTC's organizing statute that currently precludes the \nCommission from exercising authority over certain activities of \ntelecommunications common carriers. The Federal Communications \nCommission, FCC, currently has jurisdiction over these common carriers.\n  While I fully support any effort to combat entities that perpetrate \nfraud on consumers, and I respect the expertise and ability of the FTC \nand FCC to seek redress for victims of such fraud, I made it clear \nduring the Commerce Committee's executive session last Fall that a \ndiscussion was necessary between the two agencies to resolve any \noverlap in jurisdiction that may exist. It is our understanding that \nthe FTC and FCC are in the process of negotiating an agreement that \nwould satisfy the objectives of both agencies to further their \nrespective consumer protection missions. Thus, for now, we will reserve \njudgment as to whether such a repeal is necessary.\n  Meanwhile, I look forward to working on this important consumer \nprotection legislation and I hope that my colleagues will agree to join \nus in expeditiously moving this reauthorization through the legislative \nprocess. Reauthorizing the FTC is important if the agency is to \ncontinue to successfully carry out its many responsibilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Trade Commission \n     Reauthorization Act of 2003''.\n\n                        TITLE I--REAUTHORIZATION\n\n     SEC. 101. REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       The text of section 25 of the Federal Trade Commission Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 57c) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the \n     functions, powers, and duties of the Commission not to exceed \n     $194,742,000 for fiscal year 2004, $224,695,000 for fiscal \n     year 2005, and $235,457,000 for fiscal year 2006.''.\n\n     SEC. 102. AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT REIMBURSEMENTS, GIFTS, AND \n                   VOLUNTARY AND UNCOMPENSATED SERVICES.\n\n       The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating section 26 as section 28; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 25 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 26. REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES.\n\n       ``The Commission may accept payment or reimbursement, in \n     cash or in kind, from a domestic or foreign law enforcement \n     authority, or payment or reimbursement made on behalf of such \n     authority, for expenses incurred by the Commission, its \n     members, or employees in carrying out any activity pursuant \n     to a statute administered by the Commission without regard to \n     any other provision of law. Any such payments or \n     reimbursements shall be considered a reimbursement to the \n     appropriated funds of the Commission.\n\n     ``SEC. 27. GIFTS AND VOLUNTARY AND UNCOMPENSATED SERVICES.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--In furtherance of its functions the \n     Commission may accept, hold, administer, and use \n     unconditional gifts, donations, and bequests of real, \n     personal, and other property and, notwithstanding section \n     1342 of title 31, United States Code, accept voluntary and \n     uncompensated services.\n       ``(b) Limitations.--\n       ``(1) Conflicts of interest.--Notwithstanding subsection \n     (a), the Commission may not accept, hold, administer, or use \n     a gift, donation, or bequest if the acceptance, holding, \n     administration, or use would create a conflict of interest or \n     the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n       ``(2) Voluntary services.--A person who provides voluntary \n     and uncompensated service under subsection (a) shall not be \n     considered a Federal employee for any purpose other than for \n     purposes of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, \n     (relating to compensation for injury) and section 2671 \n     through 2680 of title 28, United States Code, (relating to \n     tort claims).''.\n\n              TITLE II--INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Trade Commission protects consumers from \n     fraud and deception. Cross-border fraud and deception are \n     growing international problems that affect American consumers \n     and businesses.\n       (2) The development of the Internet and improvements in \n     telecommunications technologies have brought significant \n     benefits to consumers. At the same time, they have also \n     provided unprecedented opportunities for those engaged in \n     fraud and deception to establish operations in one country \n     and victimize a large number of consumers in other countries.\n       (3) An increasing number of consumer complaints collected \n     in the Consumer Sentinel database maintained by the \n     Commission, and an increasing number of cases brought by the \n     Commission, involve foreign consumers, foreign businesses or \n     individuals, or assets or evidence located outside the United \n     States.\n       (4) The Commission has legal authority to remedy law \n     violations involving domestic and foreign wrongdoers, \n     pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act. The \n     Commission's ability to obtain effective relief using this \n     authority, however, may face practical impediments when \n     wrongdoers, victims, other witnesses, documents, money and \n     third parties involved in the transaction are widely \n     dispersed in many different jurisdictions. Such circumstances \n     make it difficult for the Commission to gather all the \n     information necessary to detect injurious practices, to \n     recover offshore assets for consumer redress, and to reach \n     conduct occurring outside the United States that affects \n     United States consumers.\n       (5) Improving the ability of the Commission and its foreign \n     counterparts to share information about cross-border fraud \n     and deception, to conduct joint and parallel investigations, \n     and to assist each other is critical to achieve more timely \n     and effective enforcement in cross- border cases.\n       (6) Consequently, Congress should enact legislation to \n     provide the Commission with more tools to protect consumers \n     across borders.\n\n     SEC. 202.

Mr. President, today I am proud to join with two of my \ncolleagues--Senator Reed and Senator Roberts--to introduce legislation \nthat will help America meet a critical challenge that, during the past \ndecade, it has faced over and over: helping countries that have \nsuffered from conflict work to rebuild their societies.\n  Over the past two years, America has proved again that we have the \nfinest military force in the world. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the men \nand women of America's military performed with great bravery and skill. \nBy defeating the Taliban and removing Saddam Hussein's regime from \npower, they showed that they are the world's best trained troops using \nthe world's most sophisticated weapons. This is a powerful example of \nthe leadership and commitment both here in the Congress and in \nsuccessive Administrations--both Democrat and Republican--to ensure \nthat our military remains the best equipped, best trained, most \nprepared fighting force in the world.\n  But these decisive military victories have been followed by a peace \nwhere success has not been so clear. First in Afghanistan, and now in \nIraq, our efforts to help these societies get back on their feet have \nproduced mixed results. To be sure, the challenges in both countries \nare profound: Afghanistan suffered from nearly a quarter-century of \ncivil war, and Iraq suffered for more than two decades under the thumb \nof Saddam Hussein and his brutal regime. Both countries have deep \ninternal divisions and little experience with representative \ngovernment. While it is reasonable to assume post-conflict \nreconstruction efforts in both nations will take considerable time, \nthese realities cannot be an excuse for the overall shortcoming in our \nown efforts, especially because we have the resources and capabilities \nto do better.\n  This is not the first time we have faced such challenges. Since the \nend of the Cold War, thousands of American military, diplomatic and \nhumanitarian personnel have also been involved in major post-conflict \nreconstruction efforts in such places as Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, \nRwanda, Haiti, and East Timor. Each of these efforts has had varying \ndegrees of success, but on balance, I think we all can agree that we \ncould have done better.\n  Too often, our response to post-conflict situations has been \nhaphazard and slow to start. And once underway, our efforts often \nsuffer from a cumbersome chain-of-command, lack of resources, and \ninadequate accountability.\n  The problem is that our government is still not well organized to \ndeal with such situations. Each time we get involved in a post-conflict \nreconstruction effort we end up making it up as we go. We waste \nvaluable time reinventing the bureaucratic wheel. And we get in \nunnecessary arguments about who should do what and who should be in \ncharge.\n  It is remarkable that even with all the commitments we have made \nduring the past decade, next to nothing has been done to reform the way \nour government works to enhance our capacity to deal with these \nsituations effectively. Governmental mechanisms developed during the \nCold War are outdated and not suited to addressing the complex set of \nchallenges created by failed states.\n  We must do better. After more than ten years of improvising our \nresponses to these challenges, it is time to change the way we do \nthings. We need to improve our ability to plan, coordinate, and \norganize U.S. government resources to assist with post-conflict \nreconstruction. We need to train our people more effectively. We need a \nbetter sense of what works and what does not. We need greater \naccountability. And we need to promote the means for involving other \ncountries in these efforts, including through institutions like NATO.\n  I believe that the ``Winning the Peace Act'' is an important step \ntoward accomplishing these goals. This legislation is based upon the \nwork of the bipartisan ``Commission on Post-Conflict Reconstruction,'' \nconvened by the Association of the U.S. Army and the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, CSIS. This Commission was very \nably led by Dr. John Hamre, the former Deputy Secretary of Defense, and \nGeneral Gordon Sullivan, the former Army Chief of Staff. The Commission \nwas composed of twenty-seven distinguished military, diplomatic and \nhumanitarian experts, including myself and my two Senate cosponsors.\n  The legislation includes five key proposals:\n  First, it calls on the President to appoint a Director of \nReconstruction for areas where the U.S. will assist with post-conflict \nreconstruction. These Directors will provide oversight, help \ncoordinate, and have decision-making authority for all U.S. government \nreconstruction activities in a particular country. They will also \ncoordinate with the representatives of the country in question, other \nforeign governments, multilateral organizations, and relevant NGOs.\n  Second, it establishes a permanent office within the State Department \nto provide support to Directors of Reconstruction, ensuring that these \nDirectors can hit the ground running and not waste valuable time hiring \nstaff and getting office space.\n  Third, it establishes within USAID an Office of International \nEmergency Management. This new office will develop and maintain a \ndatabase of individuals with expertise in reconstruction, and provide \nsupport for mobilizing these experts.\n  Fourth, it calls on NATO to develop an ``Integrated Security Support \nComponent'' to assist with reconstruction. This NATO-led force will \nhelp provide security, including assistance with policing ensuring that \nAmerica will not be forced to shoulder these burdens alone.\n  Finally, this bill establishes an interagency training center for \npost-conflict reconstruction. This will be run by the State Department, \nand will help train personnel in assessment, strategy development, \nplanning, and coordination related to providing reconstruction \nservices. It will also develop and certify experts in the field, and \nconduct lesson-learned reviews of operations.\n  Having these resources in place will enhance America's capacity to \nassist reconstruction in four critical areas: Security and public \nsafety, such as assisting with disarmament and training of police \nforces; Justice, such as developing the rule of law, preventing human \nrights violations, and bringing war criminals to justice; Governance, \nsuch as reforming civil administration, restoring basic civil \nfunctions, and establishing processes of governance and participation; \nand Economic and Social Well-being, such as providing humanitarian \nassistance and developing national economic institutions.\n  With these changes, we will not only make America's efforts to assist \nin post-conflict reconstruction more efficient and accountable. We will \nalso make our efforts more effective contributing more to the safety \nand security of the people we are trying to help, and helping them run \ntheir countries on their own.\n  By ensuring that we maintain the best military in the world, we have \nmade a full commitment to winning wars. It is now time to ensure that \nwe are capable of winning the peace.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Winning the Peace Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) President George W. Bush has stated that the United \n     States security strategy takes into account the fact that \n     ``America is now threatened less by conquering states than we \n     are by failing ones''.\n       (2) Failed states can provide safe haven for a diverse \n     array of transnational threats, including terrorist networks, \n     militia and warlords, global organized crime, and narcotics \n     traffickers who threaten the security of the United States \n     and the allies of the United States.\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\n       (3) The inability of the authorities in a failed state to \n     provide basic services can create or contribute to \n     humanitarian emergencies.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the United States and the \n     international community to bring conflict and humanitarian \n     emergencies stemming from failed states to a lasting and \n     sustainable close.\n       (5) Since the end of the Cold War, United States military, \n     diplomatic, and humanitarian personnel have been engaged in \n     major post-conflict reconstruction efforts in such places as \n     Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, East Timor, and \n     Afghanistan.\n       (6) Assisting failed states in emerging from violent \n     conflict is a complex and long-term task, as demonstrated by \n     the experience that 50 percent of such states emerging from \n     conditions of violent conflict slip back into violence within \n     5 years.\n       (7) In 2003, the bipartisan Commission on Post-Conflict \n     Reconstruction created by the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies and the Association of the United \n     States Army, released a report explaining that ``United \n     States security and development agencies still reflect their \n     Cold War heritage. The kinds of complex crises and the \n     challenge of failed states encountered in recent years do not \n     line up with these outdated governmental mechanisms. If \n     regional stability is to be maintained, economic development \n     advanced, lives saved, and transnational threats reduced, the \n     United States and the international community must develop a \n     strategy and enhance capacity for pursuing post-conflict \n     reconstruction.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish \na program to control or eradicate tamarisk in the\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\nwestern States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tamarisk \nControl & Riparian Restoration Act.\n  Tamarisk is a noxious weed that is not native to the Americas, but \nhas spread across 11 States, from California to Oklahoma, like a \nplague. Many westerners consider Tamarisk, also known as Salt Cedar, to \nbe one of the West's most significant natural resources problems for a \nvariety of reasons.\n  Tamarisk's major threat is that it uses a significant amount of \nwater, far more water than many realize. Yet, folks out West know all \ntoo well that we have been and are still experiencing one of the worst \ndroughts in the West's recorded history. People who have been farming \nand ranching for generations have been forced to sell their homesteads \nand give up the life they love because there just hasn't been enough \nwater for crops or to maintain livestock. I've personally felt the \neffects of the drought as my wife and I have had to sell our little \ncow/calf operation.\n  I mentioned earlier that Tamarisk uses significant amounts of water, \nbut I want to speak a little bit now about just how much water it uses. \nStudies have found that Tamarisk uses from 2 to 4\\1/2\\ million acre \nfeet of water each year, water we frankly cannot afford to lose.\n  To put that in perspective, several other States and the Republic of \nMexico are delivered 10 million acre feet from all of Colorado's rivers \nand streams, including the mighty Colorado River. California is \nallotted 4\\1/2\\ million acre feet of Colorado water per year. That \nmeans that Tamarisk, a noxious, nonnative weed, uses the same amount of \nwater flowing from Colorado to California. We must address the \npreventable loss of this most valuable resource before it's too late.\n  My bill seeks to begin get the Tamarisk problem under control in a \nfew innovative ways. First, my bill requires the Secretary of the \nInterior to assess the extent of Tamarisk invasion, identifying where \nit is in each affected State, and estimate the costs to restore the \nland.\n  Second, my bill establishes a State Tamarisk Assistance Program to \nprovide States the needed funds to control or eradicate Tamarisk. Grant \nfunds will be distributed to states in accordance with the severity of \nthe Tamarisk problem they have.\n  The Governor of each State will appoint a state lead agency to \nadminister the program in the State, working with Indian Tribes, \ncolleges and universities, nonprofit organizations, soil and water \nconservancy districts, and Federal partners. This coordinate approach \nprovides sufficient flexibility to deal with Tamarisk's spread and to \nreduce duplicative efforts.\n  A watershed or basin can stretch across all kinds of land, including \nFederal, State, or tribal lands. Noxious weeds don't recognize those \nownership boundaries and neither can we.\n  Since my bill's focus is on getting rid of this water-sucking weed, \nit requires that 90 percent of the Federal funds must be used for \neradiction or rehabilitation.\n  This legislation authorizes $20 million for 2004 and such sums as \nnecessary thereafter. States must share the burden by ponying up 25 \npercent of the costs. The Tamarisk problem hurts everyone and the non-\nFederal share can come from counties, municipalities, special \ndistricts, nongovernmental entities, or the States themselves.\n  Our Nation is in a deficit, and every state is experiencing money \nshortages. Americans demand to know that their hard earned money is \nbeing spent wisely and in the most effient way possible. That is why my \nbill requires that each participating State must submit a report of the \nSecretary describing the purpose and results of the project in order to \nreceive funding. In the West, water is more precious and scarce than \nelsewhere in our great nation. To do nothing about the preventable loss \nof precious water by the spread of this noxious plant and the loss of \nnative habitat will cost us untold millions more in the future.\n  Back in my State of Colorado, constituents tell me how the drought \nhas affected them, even devastated their livelihoods. No one can \ncontrol the weather and bring rain. However, getting a handle on the \nwater-sucking Tamarisk plaguing the West is possible--if we act now.\n  My bill provides the necessary tools to deal with this problem so \nthat ther will be enough water for all of us, and habitat suitable for \nnative species of plants and animals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tamarisk Control and \n     Riparian Restoration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the western United States is currently experiencing its \n     worst drought in modern history;\n       (2) the drought in the western United States has caused--\n       (A) severe losses in rural, agricultural, and recreational \n     economies;\n       (B) detrimental effects on wildlife; and\n       (C) increased risk of wildfires;\n       (3) it is estimated that throughout the western United \n     States tamarisk, a noxious and non-native plant--\n       (A) occupies between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 acres of land; \n     and\n       (B) is a nonbeneficial user of 2,000,000 to 4,500,000 acre-\n     feet of water per year;\n       (4) the amount of nonbeneficial use of water by tamarisk--\n       (A) is greater than the amount that valuable native \n     vegetation would have used; and\n       (B) represents enough water for--\n       (i) use by 20,000,000 or more people; or\n       (ii) the irrigation of over 1,000,000 acres of land;\n       (5) scientists have established that tamarisk infestations \n     can--\n       (A) increase soil and water salinity;\n       (B) increase the risk of flooding through increased \n     sedimentation and decreased channel conveyance;\n       (C) increase wildfire potential;\n       (D) diminish human enjoyment of and interaction with the \n     river environment; and\n       (E) adversely affect--\n       (i) wildlife habitat for threatened and endangered species; \n     and\n       (ii) the abundance and biodiversity of other species; and\n       (6) as drought conditions and legal requirements relating \n     to water supply accelerate water shortages, innovative \n     approaches are needed to address the increasing demand for a \n     diminishing water supply.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to provide \nfor more equitable allotment of funds to States for centers for \nindependent living; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I am introducing The Independent \nLiving Improvement Act of 2003, a bill to provide a more equitable \nallotment of funds to States for Centers for Independent Living.\n  Centers for Independent Living, CILs, are non-profit organizations \nthat assist people with significant disabilities who want to live more \nindependently. CILs are primarily staffed by people with disabilities \nwho act as role models, mentors, and counselors to other individuals \nwith disabilities. Each center not only offers fundamental services \nsuch as information referral, and independent living skills training, \nit also tailors its services to the particular needs of its community. \nThe ultimate goal of these centers is to help individuals become more \nindependent and decrease the need for institutional care.\n  Currently, funds authorized for CILs under Title VII, Part C of the \nRehabilitation Act are essentially allocated to States on the basis of \ntheir share of the total population. States with small populations are \nguaranteed the larger of $450,000 or \\1/3\\ of 1 percent of the funds \navailable for the fiscal year in which the allocation is made, with a \nguaranteed minimum at the fiscal 1992 funding level for each State.\n  While the Federal appropriation to CILs has increased over the last \nfive years, the growing disparity between funding for small States and \nlarger States is problematic. The proposed formula change would amend \nthe current funding formula for CILs to provide for more equitable \ndistribution of future funds to each state. Fifty percent of any \nincrease in CILs appropriated fund would be allocated according to \npopulation, as is currently done, and the remaining fifty percent would \nbe divided equally among all States. The formula would only be \napplicable to any future increases in funding. This more equitable \nsharing of funds ensures that each State's CILs will receive additional \nfunding each time there is an increase in funding and programs will be \ndeveloped for people with disabilities regardless of where they live in \nthe country.\n  This bill is supported by the National Council on Independent Living. \nI believe this a reasonable approach to solving this problem and look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Independent Living \n     Improvement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATE ALLOTMENTS FOR CENTERS FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING.\n\n       Section 721 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. \n     796f) is amended by striking subsection (c) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(c) Allotments to States.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       ``(A) Additional appropriation.--The term `additional \n     appropriation' means the amount (if any) by which the \n     appropriation for a fiscal year exceeds the total of--\n       ``(i) the amount reserved under subsection (b) for that \n     fiscal year; and\n       ``(ii) the appropriation for fiscal year 2003.\n       ``(B) Appropriation.--The term `appropriation' means the \n     amount appropriated to carry out this part.\n       ``(C) Base appropriation.--The term `base appropriation' \n     means the portion of the appropriation for a fiscal year that \n     is equal to the lesser of--\n       ``(i) an amount equal to 100 percent of the appropriation, \n     minus the amount reserved under subsection (b) for that \n     fiscal year; or\n       ``(ii) the appropriation for fiscal year 2003.\n       ``(2) Allotments to states from base appropriation.--After \n     the reservation required by subsection (b) has been made, the \n     Commissioner shall allot to each State whose State plan has \n     been approved under section 706 an amount that bears the same \n     ratio to the base appropriation as the amount the State \n     received under this subsection for fiscal year 2003 bears to \n     the total amount that all States received under this \n     subsection for fiscal year 2003.\n       ``(3) Allotments to states additional appropriation.--From \n     any additional appropriation for each fiscal year, the \n     Commissioner shall allot to each State whose State plan has \n     been approved under section 706 an amount equal to the sum \n     of--\n       ``(A) an amount that bears the same ratio to 50 percent of \n     the additional appropriation as the population of the State \n     bears to the population of all States; and\n       ``(B) \\1/56\\ of 50 percent of the additional appropriation.\n       ``(4) Maintenance of effort.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Commissioner shall not make a \n     payment for the allotments described in this subsection to \n     any State for a fiscal year unless the Commissioner--\n       ``(i) determines that the State independent living \n     expenditure for the first preceding fiscal year is not less \n     than the State independent living expenditure for the second \n     preceding fiscal year; or\n       ``(ii) reduces the amount of the payment by the amount by \n     which the State independent living expenditure for the second \n     preceding fiscal year exceeds the State independent living \n     expenditure for the first preceding fiscal year.\n       ``(B) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `State \n     independent living expenditure', used with respect to a \n     fiscal year, means the total expenditure in the State of \n     other Federal funds (other than funds made available to carry \n     out this part), State funds, and local funds for that fiscal \n     year to provide assistance for centers for independent \n     living.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORT.\n\n       Section 704(m)(4)(D) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (42 \n     U.S.C. 795c(m)(4)(D)) is amended by inserting ``, including \n     reports indicating the manner in which and extent to which \n     the State complied with the maintenance of effort requirement \n     specified in section 721(c)(4)(A)(i)'' before the semicolon.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Landrieu, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 1238. A bill to amend titles XVIII, XIX, and XXI of the Social \nSecurity Act to improve women's health, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Improving \nWomen's Health Act of 2003, which seeks to make Medicare, Medicaid, and \nS-CHIP better programs for women. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort today by my friends Senators Murray, Landrieu, and Cantwell.\n  Women are the majority of Medicare recipients, and, at age 85, women \nmake up 71 percent of the Medicare population. By adding several modern \ntreatments to the list of Medicare benefits, we will begin to address \nsome of the most prominent, underlying risk factors for illness that \nface women Medicare beneficiaries today. These new benefits represent \nthe highest recommendations for Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force and the Institute of Medicine. These \nbenefits can help reduce Medicare beneficiaries' risk for health \nproblems such as diabetes, stroke, cancer, osteoporosis, and heart \ndisease.\n  This bill would also eliminate all cost-sharing for these and \nexisting preventive health benefits to encourage women to get screened \nfor diseases such as osteoporosis and breast cancer. We need to get rid \nof all barriers to preventative services. Studies have\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\nshown that cost-sharing deters beneficiaries, especially those with \nlow-incomes, from getting screened.\n  Because heart disease is the number one killer of women, this bill \nwould add new preventive services to Medicare, such as cholesterol \nscreening, medical nutrition therapy services for beneficiaries with \ncardiovascular disease, counseling for cessation of tobacco use, and \ndiabetes screening.\n  In addition, this bill provides for coverage of annual pap smear and \npelvic exams and boosts the payment amount for screening mammography \nunder Medicare. Numerous reports in the media have indicated that \nscreening mammography is not adequately reimbursed and, as a result, \nfacilities are closing or ending their service. Facilities are saying \nthat they are losing money on every patient that comes through the \ndoor, and patient load is rising.\n  Recognizing the role women play as caregivers for aging family \nmembers, this bill provides Medicare beneficiaries with a new option of \nreceiving home health services in an adult day care setting. Adult day \ncenters enable family caregivers to continue working or simply take a \nbreak from their caregiving duties. Most importantly, adult day care \npatients benefit from social interaction, therapeutic activities, \nnutrition, health monitoring, and medication management.\n  More than 22 million families nationwide, or nearly 1 in 4 families, \nserve as caregivers for aging seniors, providing close to 80 percent of \nthe care of to individuals requiring long-term care. Nearly 75 percent \nof people providing care for aging family members are women who also \nmaintain other responsibilities, such as working outside of the home \nand raising young children. The average loss of income to these \ncaregivers has been shown to be over $650,000 in wages, pension, and \nSocial Security benefits. The loss of productivity in U.S. businesses \nranges from $11 to $29 billion a year. The services offered in adult \nday care facilities provide continuity of care and an important sense \nof community for both the senior and the caregiver. This important \nprovision will benefit women of all ages.\n  Finally, this legislation provides States with the flexibility and \nFederal resources to improve and expand prenatal care for low-income \npregnant women. It gives States new options to cover pregnant women \nunder their State Children's Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP, to cover \nlow-income legal immigrant pregnant women and children under Medicaid \nand S-CHIP, and to cover tobacco cessation counseling services for \npregnant women under the Medicaid program. The bill also gives States \nthe option to provide family planning services and supplies to low-\nincome women. In recent years, a number of States, including Arkansas, \nhave sought and received Federal permission in the form of waivers to \nprovide Medicaid-financed family planning services and supplies to \nlower income, uninsured residents whose incomes are above the state's \nregular Medicaid eligibility ceilings. Under this section, States would \nno longer have to seek a waiver to extend Medicaid coverage for family \nplanning services; instead they could establish these programs at their \noption.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me by supporting this important \nlegislation that will make Medicare, Medicaid, and S-CHIP better \nprograms for all women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 1240. A bill to establish the Millennium Challenge Corporation, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that is \nintended to unite Senators behind the President's bold new commitment \nto international development. As my colleagues are aware, the President \nhas offered a plan called the Millennium Challenge Corporation that \nwill focus U.S. energy and resources on countries that, while very \npoor, show commitment to economic reform and development. It is a \nunique plan that would reward and showcase what we Americans believe to \nbe the essential ingredients for success: good government, investments \nin people, and a reliance on free markets.\n  My colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee strongly \nsupported the goals of the President's initiative and applauded his \nenthusiasm and personal commitment. But, when we considered the MCC \nlegislation a few weeks ago, organizational issues divided the \nCommittee. The Committee voted 11 to 8 against creating the MCC as an \nindependent agency. Instead the functions of the MCC were integrated \ninto the State Department.\n  This outcome did not capture the President's vision of a fresh start \nfor a unique approach to development assistance. The Secretary of State \nhimself argued against the Committee's majority on that vote. Secretary \nPowell said that the President's plan would be best achieved through \nthe establishment of an innovative, flexible, narrowly targeted and \nhighly visible separate organization that can complement other \nassistance provided through more traditional means.\n  I believe the Senate should work for a consensus on this issue. This \nimportant initiative cannot be allowed to founder on a question of \norganization.\n  I have been working to develop a middle ground that will satisfy the \nbasic goals of all sides. My bill creates the needed ingredients for \ninteragency coordination, a top priority among a majority on the \nCommittee. But it does not undermine the integrity of the President's \nconcept. It puts the MCC under the authority of the Secretary of State \nand has the MCC's Chief Executive Officer report to the Secretary. It \ngives the MCC the same status within the State Department as the U.S. \nAgency for International Development, with the right to manage itself, \nhire staff, and create its own culture. It mandates coordination \nbetween the MCC and USAID in the field and give USAID the primary role \nin preparing countries for MCC eligibility. It also includes the \nAdministrator of USAID on the MCC board to ensure that the perspective \nof USAID is considered.\n\n  Through these means, I believe that the MCC can be substantially \nindependent, as envisioned by the President, while preserving the \nleadership of the Secretary of State and the input of USAID.\n  I would emphasize that the President has invested his personal \nattention and time in the MCC concept. It is rare for a President of \neither party to provide such strong leadership in the area of \ndevelopment assistance. President Bush's advocacy is critical to the \nsuccess of this initiative. I believe Congress will regret its actions \nif we undercut this opportunity for U.S. foreign policy by failing to \nreach a workable consensus on the MCC's organization.\n  I am hoping for a strong Senate vote on the MCC and will bring up my \ncompromise proposal at an appropriate time. The MCC provides a way to \nfocus single-mindedly on economic development that is results-based and \nmeets clear benchmarks of success. We can have the coordination we seek \nwhile also insulating it from short-term political considerations so \nthat it can focus on widening the universe of countries that live in \npeace and look to a prosperous and stable future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two accompany pages be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Millennium Challenge Corporation\n\n\n                           ORIGINAL PROPOSAL\n\n       MCC is an independent agency.\n       President of the United States--Appoints MCC Chief Exec. \n     Officer subject to advice and consent.\n       MCC Board Composition--Secretary of the Treasury, Director \n     of OMB, Secretary of State, Chrman.\n       MCC Board Responsibilities--Directs all MCC activities, \n     Develops indicators, Determines eligible countries, Writes \n     contracts with MCC countries, Selects proposals for funding.\n       Secretary of State--Serves as Chairman of the MCC Board.\n       MCC Chief Exec.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the Federal Maritime \nCommission for fiscal years 2004 and 2005; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nHollings, the Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee; and \nSenator Hutchison, the Chairman of the Surface Transportation and \nMerchant Marine Subcommittee, in introducing a bipartisan bill to \nreauthorize the Federal Maritime Commission, FMC.\n  The Federal Maritime Commission is an independent agency comprised of \nfive commissioners. Its primary responsibility is administering the \nShipping Act of 1984 and enforcing the Foreign Shipping Practices Act \nand Section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. The work carried out \nby the FMC is critical to protecting shippers and carriers from \nrestrictive or unfair practices by foreign-flag carriers.\n  This legislation would authorize funding for the Commission to \ncontinue its important work through fiscal year 2005. Specifically, the \nbill would authorize $18.5 million for fiscal year 2004, which is the \nlevel requested by the Administration, and $19.5 million for fiscal \nyear 2005. The bill also would amend Section 102(b) of the \nReorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961 to require that the Commission's \nchairman be subject to Senate confirmation.

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 54\n\n       Whereas a pioneer in the fight for racial justice, Medgar \n     Wiley Evers, was born July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, \n     to James and Jessie Evers;\n       Whereas, to faithfully serve his country, Medgar Evers left \n     high school to join the Army when World War II began and, \n     after coming home to Mississippi, he completed high school, \n     enrolled in Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, \n     presently known as Alcorn State University, and majored in \n     business administration;\n       Whereas, as a student at Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical \n     College, Evers was a member of the debate team, the college \n     choir, and the football and track teams, was the editor of \n     the campus newspaper and the yearbook, and held several \n     student offices, which gained him recognition in Who's Who in \n     American Colleges;\n       Whereas, while a junior at Alcorn Agricultural and \n     Mechanical College, Evers met a freshman named Myrlie \n     Beasley, whom he married on December 24, 1951, and with whom \n     he spent the remainder of his life;\n       Whereas, after Medgar Evers received a bachelor of arts \n     degree, he moved to historic Mound Bayou, Mississippi, became \n     employed by Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company, and soon \n     began establishing local chapters of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People (referred to in this \n     resolution as the ``NAACP'') throughout the Delta region;\n       Whereas, moved by the plight of African-Americans in \n     Mississippi and a desire to change the conditions facing \n     them, in 1954, after the United States Supreme Court ruled \n     school segregation unconstitutional, Medgar Evers became the \n     first known African-American person to apply for admission to \n     the University of Mississippi Law School, but was denied that \n     admission;\n       Whereas, as a result of that denial, Medgar Evers contacted \n     the NAACP to take legal action;\n       Whereas in 1954, Medgar Evers was offered a position as the \n     Mississippi Field Secretary for the NAACP, and he accepted \n     the position, making Myrlie Evers his secretary;\n       Whereas, with his wife by his side, Medgar Evers began a \n     movement to register people to vote in Mississippi and, as a \n     result of his activities, Medgar Evers received numerous \n     threats;\n       Whereas, in spite of the threats, Medgar Evers persisted, \n     with dedication and courage, to organize rallies, build the \n     NAACP's membership, and travel around the country with Myrlie \n     Evers to educate the public;\n       Whereas Medgar Evers' passion for quality education for all \n     children led him to file suit against the Jackson, \n     Mississippi public schools, which gained him national media \n     coverage;\n       Whereas Medgar Evers organized students from Tougaloo and \n     Campbell Colleges, coordinated and led protest marches, \n     organized boycotts of Jackson businesses and sit-ins, and \n     challenged segregated bus seating, and for these heroic \n     efforts, he was arrested, beaten, and jailed;\n       Whereas the violence against Medgar Evers came to a climax \n     on June 12, 1963, when he was shot and killed in front of his \n     home;\n       Whereas, after the fingerprints of an outspoken \n     segregationist were recovered from the scene of the shooting, \n     and 2 juries deadlocked without a conviction in the shooting \n     case, Myrlie Evers and her 3 children moved to Claremont, \n     California, where she enrolled in Pomona College and earned \n     her bachelor's degree in sociology in 1968;\n       Whereas, after Medgar Evers' death, Myrlie Evers began to \n     create her own legacy and emerged as a national catalyst for \n     justice and equality by becoming active in politics, becoming \n     a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus, running \n     for Congress in California's 24th congressional district, \n     serving as Commissioner of Public Works for Los Angeles, \n     using her writing skills to serve as a correspondent for \n     Ladies Home Journal and to cover the Paris Peace Talks, and \n     rising to prominence as Director of Consumer Affairs for the \n     Atlantic Richfield Company;\n       Whereas Myrlie Evers became Myrlie Evers-Williams when she \n     married Walter Williams in 1976;\n       Whereas, in the 1990's, Evers-Williams convinced \n     Mississippi prosecutors to reopen Medgar Evers' murder case, \n     and the reopening of the case led to the conviction and life \n     imprisonment of Medgar Evers' killer;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams became the first female to chair the \n     64-member Board of Directors of the NAACP, to provide \n     guidance to an organization that was dear to Medgar Evers' \n     heart;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams has published her memoirs, entitled \n     ``Watch Me Fly: What I Learned on the Way to Becoming the \n     Woman I Was Meant to Be'', to enlighten the world about the \n     struggles that plagued her life as the wife of an activist \n     and empowered her to become a community leader;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams is widely known as a motivational \n     lecturer and continues to speak out against discrimination \n     and injustice;\n       Whereas her latest endeavor has brought her home to \n     Mississippi to make two remarkable contributions, through the \n     establishment of the Evers Collection and the Medgar Evers \n     Institute, which advance the knowledge and cause of social \n     injustice and which encompass the many lessons in the life's \n     work of Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers-Williams;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams has presented the extraordinary \n     papers in that Collection and Institute to the Mississippi \n     Department of Archives and History, where the papers are \n     being preserved and catalogued; and\n       Whereas it is the policy of Congress to recognize and pay \n     tribute to the lives and accomplishments of extraordinary \n     Mississippians such as Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers-\n     Williams, whose life sacrifices have contributed to the \n     betterment of the lives of the citizens of Mississippi as \n     well as the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) Congress commends Medgar Wiley Evers and his widow, \n     Myrlie Evers-Williams, and expresses the greatest respect and \n     gratitude of Congress, for their lives and accomplishments;\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) designates the period beginning on June 9, 2003, and \n     ending on June 16, 2003, as the ``Medgar Evers National Week \n     of Remembrance''; and\n       (B) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (3) copies of this resolution shall be furnished to the \n     family of Medgar Wiley Evers and Myrlie Evers-Williams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Burmese Freedom and \n     Democracy Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has \n     failed to transfer power to the National League for Democracy \n     (NLD) whose parliamentarians won an overwhelming victory in \n     the 1990 elections in Burma.\n       (2) The SPDC has failed to enter into meaningful, political \n     dialogue with the NLD and ethnic minorities and has dismissed \n     the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Razali bin Ismail \n     to further such dialogue.\n       (3) According to the State Department's ``Report to the \n     Congress Regarding Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Toward \n     Burma'' dated March 28, 2003, the SPDC has become ``more \n     confrontational'' in its exchanges with the NLD.\n       (4) On May 30, 2003, the SPDC, threatened by continued \n     support for the NLD throughout Burma, brutally attacked NLD \n     supporters, killed and injured scores of civilians, and \n     arrested democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi and other \n     activists.\n       (5) The SPDC continues egregious human rights violations \n     against Burmese citizens, uses rape as a weapon of \n     intimidation and torture against women, and forcibly \n     conscripts child-soldiers for the use in fighting indigenous \n     ethnic groups.\n       (6) The SPDC has demonstrably failed to cooperate with the \n     United States in stopping the flood of heroin and \n     methamphetamines being grown, refined, manufactured, and \n     transported in areas under the control of the SPDC serving to \n     flood the region and much of the world with these illicit \n     drugs.\n       (7) The SPDC provides safety, security, and engages in \n     business dealings with narcotics traffickers under indictment \n     by United States authorities, and other producers and \n     traffickers of narcotics.\n       (8) The International Labor Organization (ILO), for the \n     first time in its 82-year history, adopted in 2000, a \n     resolution recommending that governments, employers, and \n     workers organizations take appropriate measures to ensure \n     that their relations with the SPDC do not abet the \n     government-sponsored system of forced, compulsory, or slave \n     labor in Burma, and that other international bodies \n     reconsider any cooperation they may be engaged in with Burma \n     and, if appropriate, cease as soon as possible any activity \n     that could abet the practice of forced, compulsory, or slave \n     labor.\n       (9) The SPDC has integrated the Burmese military and its \n     surrogates into all facets of the economy effectively \n     destroying any free enterprise system.\n       (10) Investment in Burmese companies and purchases from \n     them serve to provide the SPDC with currency that is used to \n     finance its instruments of terror and repression against the \n     Burmese people.\n       (11) On April 15, 2003, the American Apparel and Footwear \n     Association expressed its ``strong support for a full and \n     immediate ban on U.S. textiles, apparel and footwear imports \n     from Burma'' and called upon the United States Government to \n     ``impose an outright ban on U.S. imports'' of these items \n     until Burma demonstrates respect for basic human and labor \n     rights of its citizens.\n       (12) The policy of the United States, as articulated by the \n     President on April 24, 2003, is to officially recognize the \n     NLD as the legitimate representative of the Burmese people as \n     determined by the 1990 election.\n\n     SEC. 3. BAN AGAINST TRADE THAT SUPPORTS THE MILITARY REGIME \n                   OF BURMA.\n\n       (a) General Ban.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, until such time as the President determines and \n     certifies to Congress that Burma has met the conditions \n     described in paragraph (3), no article may be imported \n     into the United States that is produced, mined, \n     manufactured, grown, or assembled in Burma.\n       (2) Ban on imports from certain companies.--The import \n     restrictions contained in paragraph (1) shall apply to, among \n     other entities--\n       (A) the SPDC, any ministry of the SPDC, a member of the \n     SPDC or an immediate family member of such member;\n       (B) known narcotics traffickers from Burma or an immediate \n     family member of such narcotics trafficker;\n       (C) the Union of Myanmar Economics Holdings Incorporated \n     (UMEHI) or any company in which the UMEHI has a fiduciary \n     interest;\n       (D) the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) or any company \n     in which the MEC has a fiduciary interest;\n       (E) the Union Solidarity and Development Association \n     (USDA); and\n       (F) any successor entity for the SPDC, UMEHI, MEC, or USDA.\n       (3) Conditions described.--The conditions described in this \n     paragraph are the following:\n       (A) The SPDC has made substantial and measurable progress \n     to end violations of internationally recognized human rights \n     including rape, and the Secretary of State, after \n     consultation with the ILO Secretary General and relevant \n     nongovernmental organizations, reports to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that the SPDC no longer \n     systematically violates workers rights, including the use of \n     forced and child labor, and conscription of child-soldiers.\n       (B) The SPDC has made measurable and substantial progress \n     toward implementing a democratic government including--\n       (i) releasing all political prisoners;\n       (ii) allowing freedom of speech and the press;\n       (iii) allowing freedom of association;\n       (iv) permitting the peaceful exercise of religion; and\n       (v) bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC \n     and the democratic forces led by the NLD and Burma's ethnic \n     nationalities on the transfer of power to a civilian \n     government accountable to the Burmese people through \n     democratic elections under the rule of law.\n       (C) Pursuant to the terms of section 706 of the Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law \n     107-228), Burma has not failed demonstrably to make \n     substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under \n     international counternarcotics agreements and to take other \n     effective counternarcotics measures, including the arrest and \n     extradition of all individuals under indictment in the United \n     States for narcotics trafficking, and concrete and measurable \n     actions to stem the flow of illicit drug money into Burma's \n     banking system and economic enterprises and to stop the \n     manufacture and export of methamphetamines.\n       (4) Appropriate congressional committees.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means the Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations \n     of the Senate and the Committees on International Relations \n     and Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n       (b) Waiver Authorities.--\n       (1) In general.--The President may waive the prohibitions \n     described in this section for any or all products imported \n     from Burma to the United States if the President determines \n     and notifies the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations \n     and International Relations of the House of Representatives \n     that to do so is in the national security interest of the \n     United States.\n       (2) International obligations.--The President may waive any \n     provision of this Act found to be in violation of any \n     international obligations of the United States pursuant to \n     any final ruling relating to Burma under the dispute \n     settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization.\n\n     SEC. 4. FREEZING ASSETS OF THE BURMESE REGIME IN THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall direct, and \n     promulgate regulations to the same, that any United States \n     financial institution holding funds belonging to the SPDC \n     or the assets of those individuals who hold senior \n     positions in the SPDC or its political arm, the Union \n     Solidarity Development Association, shall promptly report \n     those assets to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The \n     Secretary of the Treasury may take such action as may be \n     necessary to secure such assets or funds.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 54) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 54\n\n       Whereas a pioneer in the fight for racial justice, Medgar \n     Wiley Evers, was born July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, \n     to James and Jessie Evers;\n       Whereas, to faithfully serve his country, Medgar Evers left \n     high school to join the Army when World War II began and, \n     after coming home to Mississippi, he completed high school, \n     enrolled in Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, \n     presently known as Alcorn State University, and majored in \n     business administration;\n       Whereas, as a student at Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical \n     College, Evers was a member of the debate team, the college \n     choir, and the football and track teams, was the editor of \n     the campus newspaper and the yearbook, and held several \n     student offices, which gained him recognition in Who's Who in \n     American Colleges;\n       Whereas, while a junior at Alcorn Agricultural and \n     Mechanical College, Evers met a freshman named Myrlie \n     Beasley, whom he married on December 24, 1951, and with whom \n     he spent the remainder of his life;\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\n       Whereas, after Medgar Evers received a bachelor of arts \n     degree, he moved to historic Mound Bayou, Mississippi, became \n     employed by Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company, and soon \n     began establishing local chapters of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People (referred to in this \n     resolution as the ``NAACP'') throughout the Delta region;\n       Whereas, moved by the plight of African-Americans in \n     Mississippi and a desire to change the conditions facing \n     them, in 1954, after the United States Supreme Court ruled \n     school segregation unconstitutional, Medgar Evers became the \n     first known African-American person to apply for admission to \n     the University of Mississippi Law School, but was denied that \n     admission;\n       Whereas, as a result of that denial, Medgar Evers contacted \n     the NAACP to take legal action;\n       Whereas in 1954, Medgar Evers was offered a position as the \n     Mississippi Field Secretary for the NAACP, and he accepted \n     the position, making Myrlie Evers his secretary;\n       Whereas, with his wife by his side, Medgar Evers began a \n     movement to register people to vote in Mississippi and, as a \n     result of his activities, Medgar Evers received numerous \n     threats;\n       Whereas, in spite of the threats, Medgar Evers persisted, \n     with dedication and courage, to organize rallies, build the \n     NAACP's membership, and travel around the country with Myrlie \n     Evers to educate the public;\n       Whereas Medgar Evers' passion for quality education for all \n     children led him to file suit against the Jackson, \n     Mississippi public schools, which gained him national media \n     coverage;\n       Whereas Medgar Evers organized students from Tougaloo and \n     Campbell Colleges, coordinated and led protest marches, \n     organized boycotts of Jackson businesses and sit-ins, and \n     challenged segregated bus seating, and for these heroic \n     efforts, he was arrested, beaten, and jailed;\n       Whereas the violence against Medgar Evers came to a climax \n     on June 12, 1963, when he was shot and killed in front of his \n     home;\n       Whereas, after the fingerprints of an outspoken \n     segregationist were recovered from the scene of the shooting, \n     and 2 juries deadlocked without a conviction in the shooting \n     case, Myrlie Evers and her 3 children moved to Claremont, \n     California, where she enrolled in Pomona College and earned \n     her bachelor's degree in sociology in 1968;\n       Whereas, after Medgar Evers' death, Myrlie Evers began to \n     create her own legacy and emerged as a national catalyst for \n     justice and equality by becoming active in politics, becoming \n     a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus, running \n     for Congress in California's 24th congressional district, \n     serving as Commissioner of Public Works for Los Angeles, \n     using her writing skills to serve as a correspondent for \n     Ladies Home Journal and to cover the Paris Peace Talks, and \n     rising to prominence as Director of Consumer Affairs for the \n     Atlantic Richfield Company;\n       Whereas Myrlie Evers became Myrlie Evers-Williams when she \n     married Walter Williams in 1976;\n       Whereas, in the 1990's, Evers-Williams convinced \n     Mississippi prosecutors to reopen Medgar Evers' murder case, \n     and the reopening of the case led to the conviction and life \n     imprisonment of Medgar Evers' killer;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams became the first female to chair the \n     64-member Board of Directors of the NAACP, to provide \n     guidance to an organization that was dear to Medgar Evers' \n     heart;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams has published her memoirs, entitled \n     ``Watch Me Fly: What I Learned on the Way to Becoming the \n     Woman I Was Meant to Be'', to enlighten the world about the \n     struggles that plagued her life as the wife of an activist \n     and empowered her to become a community leader;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams is widely known as a motivational \n     lecturer and continues to speak out against discrimination \n     and injustice;\n       Whereas her latest endeavor has brought her home to \n     Mississippi to make two remarkable contributions, through the \n     establishment of the Evers Collection and the Medgar Evers \n     Institute, which advance the knowledge and cause of social \n     injustice and which encompass the many lessons in the life's \n     work of Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers-Williams;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams has presented the extraordinary \n     papers in that Collection and Institute to the Mississippi \n     Department of Archives and History, where the papers are \n     being preserved and catalogued; and\n       Whereas it is the policy of Congress to recognize and pay \n     tribute to the lives and accomplishments of extraordinary \n     Mississippians such as Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers-\n     Williams, whose life sacrifices have contributed to the \n     betterment of the lives of the citizens of Mississippi as \n     well as the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) Congress commends Medgar Wiley Evers and his widow, \n     Myrlie Evers-Williams, and expresses the greatest respect and \n     gratitude of Congress, for their lives and accomplishments;\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) designates the period beginning on June 9, 2003, and \n     ending on June 16, 2003, as the ``Medgar Evers National Week \n     of Remembrance''; and\n       (B) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (3) copies of this resolution shall be furnished to the \n     family of Medgar Wiley Evers and Myrlie Evers-Williams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url":
