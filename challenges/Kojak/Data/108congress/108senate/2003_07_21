Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 1:30 p.m. At 1:30, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. As I \nmentioned--I think it was Thursday night of last week--this \nappropriations bill will for the first time be considered on this \nfloor. So this is a new initiative for us. I look forward to handling \nthat expeditiously this week in a thoughtful and deliberate way. These \nare very important issues before this body.\n  I announced previously we will not have rollcall votes today. Having \nsaid that, I encourage Members to come to the floor and proceed with \ntheir opening statements on the Homeland Security bill. Any amendment \nthat is offered today can be debated throughout the day with a vote to \noccur during Tuesday's session at a time determined later.\n  Once again, I encourage Members who desire to offer amendments to the \nHomeland Security bill to contact Senator Cochran or the ranking \nmember. I hope we can pass this legislation early this week and then \ncontinue with the other appropriations bills. With only 2 weeks \nremaining prior to the scheduled recess, we need to address as many of \nthe appropriations bills as possible this week. As previously stated, \nduring the last week, which is next week, we will be addressing and \ncompleting action on the Energy bill.\n  Last week, I discussed with the other side of the aisle the \npossibility of having a filing deadline for amendments to the Energy \nbill. I continue to hope that the objection on the Democratic side will \nbe lifted and that we can allow Chairman Domenici and the ranking \nmember to look at the legislative language of these amendments.\n\n  We first brought Energy to the floor now several months ago. It was \nMay 6. We have had 12 days on the floor. We have a list of amendments \nby title. Now is the time to narrow that list, to look at the \nlegislative language.\n  One of the purposes of setting aside this week at the end of this \nmonth so far in advance was that those actions and deliberations could \nbe taken by our colleagues so we could best use the time on the floor \nof the Senate in a focused way and in a way that respects people's time \nbroadly but allows adequate discussion, debate, amendment, and \ncompletion of this bill.\n  I do want to take a moment to congratulate the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. Last week, he made significant progress on \nthe appropriations process, but obviously there is a lot of work to be \ndone. I am confident that Senator Stevens will continue along this \nroad. He is clearly up to the task and will complete these bills in a \ntimely fashion.\n  In addition to the three appropriations bills that the Senate passed \nlast week, we were also able to continue to\n\n[[Page S9622]]\n\nwork on a number of other important issues. Senator McConnell helped in \nensuring that the Senate passed H.R. 2330, the Burma sanctions bill. \nThat bill has now been cleared for the President's signature.\n  The Senate also passed S. 764, Senator Campbell's bill to extend the \nauthority for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program.\n  The Senate was also able to act on a number of Energy Committee \nbills, including S. 470, which extended the authority for the \nconstruction of a memorial for Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  I look forward to a productive couple of weeks before our recess as \nwe address the appropriations bills, energy bills, and other \nlegislative and executive items that can be cleared.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9622-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  SPAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to move to another subject, \none that is brought to my attention on a daily basis. In fact, every \ntime I turn on my computer, it is there, staring me in the face. It is \nthis whole issue of spam.\n  One of my sons had not answered his e-mails; he had been away, in \nBartlett, back in Tennessee. He came and turned his computer on and \nthere were 300 e-mails waiting for him. He said only 40 of the 300 e-\nmails--this was just last night--40 of the 300 e-mails were e-mails \nactually sent to him by somebody he knew in the sort of discussion that \nwe know e-mail is all about; that is, to stay in touch with family and \nfriends and communicate effectively. The other approximately 250 or 260 \ne-mails were unsolicited e-mails that had been sent to him.\n  It reminded me of a letter I received from a constituent, a 73-year-\nold grandmother from Vonore, TN. That letter reads as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Frist: My niece gave me a computer in 2001. It \n     has been a delight to e-mail. At age 73, there is a tendency \n     to feel the world has moved ahead of you, and no one wants to \n     be left behind. Now I wonder if left behind would not be \n     better.\n       I started getting e-mail titles that horrified me. I have \n     been unable to find out where it comes from or how to stop \n     it. I communicated with my niece, who is Executive Assistant \n     to the only female Judge in Alabama, and she tells me they \n     also have had the experience. She sent me an article from the \n     Mobile paper that would indicate many people are becoming \n     outraged at the practice. I urge you to be one of them.\n\n  Mary's letter continues. There are two more paragraphs. Third \nparagraph:\n\n       I do understand the need for free speech, but this goes way \n     beyond the bounds of decency. I am appalled to think our \n     young people are subjected to such an onslaught of trash. \n     There is no way they can be protected at this point if a \n     grandmother, whose e-mail address clearly identifies her as \n     such, is not.\n       If a child buys alcohol, tobacco, Playboy or Hustler at the \n     local market, it is a crime. Yet in their own home they are \n     not being protected. Could you craft a law that would \n     prosecute anyone who sent unsolicited indecent or vulgar mail \n     into our homes?--Sincerely, Mary K. Barnwell.\n\n  This letter is just one of many that I could have read which \nconstituents have sent me. I mentioned my own son's experience, \nexperience we all have had, the inconvenience, and the offensive nature \nwith which these e-mails are sent and received.\n  The answer to Mary's question clearly is, yes; we can craft a law \nthat will punish individuals who flood our homes with indecent, \nunsolicited, and endless streams of spam. International Magazine \nreports in its most current issue that the millions of spam e-mails \nthat are clogging up our computers are sent out by only a handful of \nindividuals. These spammers call e-mail addresses from chat rooms, from \nWeb pages, from news groups, from message boards, and from e-mail \nservice directories to set up their spamming operations. They even sent \nout e-mails to random number and letter combinations to look for hits. \nWhen they get a hit, it is a matter of minutes before the spam starts \npouring in.\n  Spammers, as we all know, often deliberately target children. They \ncapture e-mail addresses from sites that are typically used by kids, \nand then they inundate these young victims with offers of free toys, of \nvideo games, and contests. But when the child clicks to enter, they are \nagain rerouted to a 900-number modem connection. A dialer is \nautomatically loaded onto the child's system, and unbeknownst to the \nchild they are racking up $3.99 per minute until they sign off. You can \nimagine the parents' shock and anger when that phone bill arrives.\n  In other instances, the child might click on the free toy offer. They \nmight get rerouted through a pornography site. When they try to exit, \npornography screens pop up to block their retreat.\n  Some spammers send e-mail in the old-fashioned way. The perpetrator \nsends an enticing e-mail--an offer, for example, for action figures. \nThe hook? The child has to enter a credit card to get the toy. Mom and \ndad's credit card information goes in and thousands of credit card \ndollars go out.\n  As we all know, as parents it is hard to keep close tabs on a child's \nInternet activity. Many kids have multiple e-mail addresses among \nvarious free Web sites. Multiple e-mail addresses means multiple routes \nfor spam, not to mention the unsavory and dangerous Internet \ncommunication.\n  That is why in this body we need to address the problem and start \nhelping parents filter out this irritating and indeed potentially \nfinancially ruinous junk. Indeed, in the Senate, we will take action to \nprotect the millions of Americans who have used the Internet the \npositive way for which it was intended--to talk, to communicate, to \nstay in touch with loved ones, to shop and to talk to families and \nfriends with good intent. We simply should not be hassled by fraudulent \nsales pitches. We simply should not have to put up with being pelted \nwith pornographic material when we simply sign on to read e-mail. \nAggressive spamming is a menace. It is threatening an otherwise \nmiraculous and indeed revolutionary form of communication. We simply \ncannot and should not let a few nefarious individuals spoil it for us \nall.\n   I bring this issue up in part because my son mentioned last night \nwhat happened to him when he turned on his computer and there was the \nspam laid out in over 250 e-mails sent to him over a period of several \nweeks, and in part because we all see it each and every time we turn on \nour computer.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to address this problem, \nand indeed to help America's families and Internet users put a stop to \nthis spam.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we currently \nin morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to first say to the distinguished \nmajority leader that I was privileged to be here for part of the \ncomments on the floor. As usual, today he brings to the floor of the \nSenate a tremendously difficult issue confronting the American people. \nWhat he spoke of in terms of spam and our kids is a tough one. We have \nto solve it. I believe his response to his own question about whether \nit can be solved is that it can be solved. It is going to be tough. I \nhope we can get some good Senators to put their shoulders to it and see \nwhat we can do about getting it stopped.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1432 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9622-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9622-S9623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WAR WITH IRAQ\n\n   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Democrats--not all, but some, \npredominantly those running for President of the United States--have \nquestioned United States intelligence and war with Iraq based on 16 \nwords. Republicans have made a comprehensive case based on facts, \nrecent history, and protecting the American people. Democrats', in my \nopinion, politically motivated case, questions intelligence and a war \nwith Iraq in the following words found in the address by the President:\n\n       The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  The case for going to war was not made by those words.\n   No. 1, it was made on the proposition of protecting the American \npeople.\n\n       On a September morning, threats that had gathered for \n     years, in secret and far away, led to murder in our country \n     on a massive scale. As a result, we must look at our security \n     in a new way, because our country is a battlefield in the \n     first war of the 21st century. We learned a lesson: The \n     dangers of our\n\n[[Page S9623]]\n\n     time must be confronted actively and forcefully, before we \n     see them again in our skies and in our cities. And we set a \n     goal: we will not allow the triumph of hatred and violence in \n     the affairs of men.\n\n       That is from a speech President Bush made to the American \n     Enterprise Institute on February 26, 2003.\n\n       Possession of the world's most deadly weapons is the \n     ultimate trump card. . . . Should we take the risk that \n     [Saddam] will not someday use these weapons at a time and a \n     place and in a manner of his choosing . . . ? The U.S. will \n     not and cannot run that risk to the American people. That is \n     not an option, not in a post-September 11 world.\n\n  That is from the presentation Secretary Powell made to the United \nNations Security Council on February 5, 2003.\n  The second reason to go to war was the refusal to disarm:\n\n       Saddam Hussein has been under a duty to disarm for more \n     than a decade. Yet he has consistently and systematically \n     violated that obligation and undermined U.N. inspections. And \n     he only admitted to a massive biological weapons program \n     after being confronted with the evidence.\n\n  That is from a radio address to the Nation President Bush made on \nDecember 7, 2002.\n  The third reason to go to war was the refusal to allow weapons \ninspections:\n\n       Iraq has undermined the effectiveness of weapons inspectors \n     with ploys, delays, and threats--making their work impossible \n     and leading to four years of no inspections at all.\n\n  That is from a press conference President Bush gave on November 8, \n2002.\n  The fourth reason to go to war was the use of biological and chemical \nweapons:\n\n  Now, what makes him even more unique is the fact that he's actually \ngassed his own people. He has used weapons of mass destruction on \nneighboring countries and he's used weapons of mass destruction on his \nown citizenry.\n\n  That is from a press conference President George Bush gave on October \n21, 2002.\n  The fifth reason for going to war--chemical weapons:\n\n       We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of \n     chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX \n     nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using \n     chemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on Iran, \n     and on more than forty villages in his own country. These \n     actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more \n     than six times the number of people who died in the \n     attacks of September the 11th.\n\n  That is from President Bush's Cincinnati speech on October 7, 2002.\n\n       Earlier today, I ordered America's armed forces to strike \n     military and security targets in Iraq. Their mission is to \n     attack Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons \n     programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors. \n     Their purpose is to protect the national interest of the \n     United States.\n\n  That is from a speech to the Nation by President Bill Clinton on \nDecember 16, 1998.\n  The sixth reason for going to war--biological weapons:\n\n       It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had \n     produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly \n     biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that \n     Iraq had likely produced two to four times that amount. This \n     is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never \n     been accounted for, and capable of killing millions.\n\n  That is from President George W. Bush's Cincinnati speech on October \n7, 2002.\n\n        Although criticizing the Bush Administration for its \n     ``sudden burst of urgency'' to go after Saddam, he did not \n     dispute the Iraqi dictator's possession of prohibited weapons \n     and stated on September 23, 2001: ``We know that he has \n     stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons \n     throughout his country.''\n\n  That is from the Washington Times of June 4, 2003.\n  No. 7, concealed WMD production:\n\n       In 2001, an Iraqi defector, Adnan Ihsan Saeed al-Haideri, \n     said he had visited twenty secret facilities for chemical, \n     biological and nuclear weapons. Mr. Saeed, a civil engineer, \n     supported his claims with stacks or Iraqi government \n     contracts, complete with technical specifications. Mr. Saeed \n     said Iraq used companies to purchase equipment with the \n     blessing of the United Nations--and then secretly used the \n     equipment for their weapons programs.''\n       This came from ``A Decade of Deception and Defiance,'' a \n     briefing document to accompany President George W. Bush's \n     speech to the U.N., September 12, 2002.\n\n  No. 8, Saddam Hussein's atrocities:\n\n       The government continues to execute summarily alleged \n     political opponents and leaders in the Shi'a religious \n     community. Reports suggest that persons were executed merely \n     because of their association with an opposition group or as \n     part of a continuing effort to reduce prison populations.''\n       This came from ``A Decade of Deception and Defiance,'' a \n     briefing document to accompanying President George W. Bush's \n     speech to the U.N., September 12, 2002.\n\n  No. 9, links to terrorists:\n\n       Iraq shelters terrorist groups including the Mujahedin-e-\n     Khalq Organization (MKO), which has used terrorist violence \n     against Iran and in the 1970s was responsible for killing \n     several U.S. military personnel and U.S. civilians; the \n     Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), which is known for aerial \n     attacks against Israel and is headed by Abu Abbas, who \n     carries out the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille \n     Lauro; and the Abu Nidal Organization, an international \n     terrorist organization that has carried out terrorist attacks \n     in twenty countries, killing or injuring almost 900 people.\n       This came from ``A Decade of Deception and Defiance,'' a \n     briefing document to accompany President George W. Bush's \n     speech to the U.N., September 12, 2002.\n\n  No. 10, peace and stability in the Middle East:\n\n       And there is no doubt that his aggressive regional \n     ambitions will lead him into future confrontations with his \n     neighbors--confrontations that will involve both the weapons \n     he has today, and the ones he will continue to develop with \n     his oil wealth.\n       This was Vice President Cheney in a speech to VFW \n     convention, August 26, 2002.\n\n  No. 11, nuclear weapons:\n\n       The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its \n     nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous \n     meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his \n     ``nuclear mujahideen''--his nuclear holy warriors. Satellite \n     photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at \n     sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past. \n     Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes \n     and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are \n     used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.\n       This was President George W. Bush, the Cincinnati speech, \n     October 7, 2002.\n       On the nuclear question, many of you will recall that \n     Saddam's nuclear ambitions suffered a severe setback in 1981 \n     when the Israelis bombed the Osirak reactor. They suffered \n     another major blow in Desert Storm and its aftermath.\n       This was Vice President Cheney in a speech to VFW \n     convention, August 26, 2002.\n\n  There is no doubt in my mind that these and many more are the reasons \nwe went to war. These and many more are the reasons Americans supported \nthe war. These and many more are the reasons they still support the \nwar. These and many more are the reasons they hope this war ends in a \nsuccessful peace. These reasons and many more, not the 26 words that \nare being argued about, are the reasons Americans supported our \nPresident in the war, supported our troops in the war, support both of \nthem today, and support both in a genuine American hope that peace will \nensue.\n  Already there are some fruits of this effort in the Middle East. We \nhadn't seen for a long time the meetings between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians that we have been seeing. This war had something to do \nwith that. Let's hope it is the beginning of peace.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9623-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9623-S9626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate now will \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 2555, the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2555) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present for the Senate's \nconsideration today the fiscal year 2004 Department of Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Act.\n  This bill provides appropriations for the first time directly to the \nnew Department of Homeland Security which was created by law last \nNovember. The September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in \nNew York City and the Pentagon here in Washington dramatically \nillustrated the need for more effective protection of our homeland.\n  On March 1 of this year, this new Department of Homeland Security was \nformally established. Its mission is to reorganize the Federal \nGovernment's\n\n[[Page S9624]]\n\nefforts to prevent terrorist attacks, to reduce the vulnerability of \nthe United States to terrorism, and to deal more effectively with the \ndamages that are caused by natural disasters as well.\n  The Department has administrative control over and responsibility for \n22 previously existing Federal agencies and an estimated 180,000 \nemployees.\n  The bill we present today provides total new budget authority for \nfiscal year 2004 of $29.326 billion to fund the Department. In \naddition, an estimated $4.8 billion in collections from immigration \nservices and from air passenger and carrier fees paid by the users will \nbe available to the Department for fiscal year 2004.\n  This bill is $1 billion over the President's budget request. The bill \nrecommends that this additional amount of money be used to increase \nfunding to assist State and local first responders, to enhance aviation \nsecurity, to better protect critical infrastructures, to more \neffectively secure our ports and waterways, to hire and train \nadditional border investigators and inspectors, and to establish the \nsurveillance capability to protect our northern border.\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, this is a big country. You \ncannot possibly build a wall around it. We have over 95,000 miles of \ncoastline. The northern border of our country stretches a distance of \n5,500 miles. Our southern border with Mexico is approximately 2,000 \nmiles in length, all present very real and very important challenges to \nthe security protection effort of our homeland.\n   For fiscal year 2003, and with the additional appropriations \nrecommended by this bill for fiscal year 2004, Congress will have \nprovided over $3 billion for the security of our Nation's ports and \nwaterways and over $10 billion for security of all sectors of \ntransportation through the Transportation Security Administration.\n  Through the firefighter assistance and Office of Domestic \nPreparedness grant programs alone, the Congress will have provided \nalmost $9 billion since September 11, 2001, to enhance the capacity of \nthe Nation's first responders.\n  To further explain part of the uses that are expected by the \ncommittee for these funds, I invite the attention of the Senate to page \n9 of the committee's report that we have submitted to accompany this \nbill. It says, ``Pursuant to the President's National Strategy for \nHomeland Security, the Secretary is to provide to the Committee, no \nlater than April 30, 2004, a report that updates the progress that is \nmade to: clearly define standards and guidelines for Federal, State, \nand local government emergency preparedness and response in such areas \nas training, interoperable communications systems, and response \nequipment; an estimate of the costs of the unmet needs of State and \nlocal governments for fiscal years 2004--2008 in meeting those \nstandards and guidelines.''\n  This illustrates the fact that, first of all, we know you cannot \ntransform our country's homeland security infrastructure overnight; it \nis going to take time. This bill marks the beginning of the effort and \na response to the President's call for the strengthening of our \nhomeland security capability through the establishment of a new \nDepartment, which was undertaken by Congress through its legislative \ncommittees that actually wrote the law that provided the legal \nauthority for this new Department to begin its work. This bill provides \nthe money the Department needs. It is not all the money that can be \nspent. It is not all the money that everybody suggests is needed. But \nit is a very important and generous investment in the effort to begin \nthe work that has to be done to reach the goals we all share.\n  As the Committee report suggests it is going to take a while, too, \nfor local governments and local responders to upgrade their \ncapabilities, through training, through exercises, through new state-\nof-the-art equipment and communications equipment, and other assets \nthat are necessary to fully reach our goals. Working together with a \nbetter sense of cooperation between State, local, and Federal \nGovernment agencies, I am confident that we are going to see a dramatic \nimprovement made. This is another positive step forward.\n  I am hopeful that Senators will appreciate the fact that we want to \nhear their advice. We had hearings where we not only heard other \nSenators' suggestions about steps that ought to be taken and the dollar \namount of funds that ought to be appropriated, but we also heard from \nadministration officials whose job it is to manage this new Department. \nWe had a series of six hearings on these subjects. The Homeland \nSecurity Act established four new directorates under the auspices of \nthe Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary. Agencies were \nreorganized, such as the Customs Service. Some disappeared, such as the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. However, the components and \nactivities of that previous agency are included under the control and \nauthority of the new Department in a way that we hope will make it a \nmore effective organization and those agencies better able to do their \njob.\n  But the challenges are quite enormous, as we all recognize. There \nhave been, in the course of our hearings, discoveries made of the \nchallenges, in terms of how many people there are to keep up with who \nare undocumented aliens within the United States, for example. That \nnumber has increased from 3 million in 1990 to an estimated 9 million \nnow. Forty percent of those people originally gained entry into the \nUnited States legally, but they never left when either the time expired \nfor their visa or the end of the legal authority of their presence came \nabout. Attempting to identify and track those people, some of whom may \nbe threats to our security and many of whom may not be threats to our \nnational security, illustrates the challenges we face.\n  We are embracing in this bill the development of new technologies to \nhelp us identify, through automation and new technologies, friendly \nvessels that come close to our shores, that enter our ports, in a way \nthat you can automatically know whether this ship is certified and \nlicensed to enter that port or not.\n\n  The Coast Guard is included as a complete entity within the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security and is taking on new roles. So we have \nour challenge from the President to support these efforts. I think \nCongress is responding, as it should, with a generous bill for \nappropriations of funds needed to start this Department off on its way.\n  We will continue to monitor the use of these funds, as we suggested \nin the report. We are going to require to be kept advised of the \nprogress made to achieve the goals. We will have oversight hearings. If \nwe see there are needs that arise that have not been funded, we will \nbring those to the attention of the Senate. Working with our friends in \nthe House, we will go to conference with the House upon the passage of \nthis bill and work out the differences between our two bills and \npresent the final result to the President for his signature.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will support this bill. I am confident \nit will help achieve our goal of a strengthened and much-improved \nhomeland defense against terrorism and natural disasters, as well.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to point out that I certainly \nappreciate and acknowledge the good assistance of the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, who is the senior Democrat on the \nAppropriations Committee and who serves as the ranking Democrat of this \nsubcommittee, for his cooperation and support during the committee's \nconsideration and development of this bill.\n  The following is a detailed summary of the bill's major funding \nrecommendations.\n  For security, enforcement, and investigations activities of the \nDepartment funded under Title III of the bill, $19.5 billion is \nrecommended. Included in this amount is a total of $8.1 billion for the \nDepartment's two new bureaus--the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection, and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Also \nrecommended is $5.4 billion for the Transportation Security \nAdministration; $6.8 billion for the Coast Guard; and $1.1 billion for \nthe United States Secret Service.\n  For assessments, preparedness, and recovery activities of the \nDepartment funded under Title IV of the bill, $8.3 billion is \nrecommended. This includes $3.6 billion for emergency preparedness and \nresponse activities; $823 million for the Department's new Information\n\n[[Page S9625]]\n\nAnalysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate; $201 million for \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; and $3.6 billion for the \nOffice for Domestic Preparedness.\n  In addition, the bill recommends $494 million for Departmental \noperations and oversight; $229 million for the Bureau of Citizenship \nand Immigration Services; and $866 million for research and development \nactivities of the Department's Science and Technology Directorate.\n  The bill recommends $8.1 billion for the defense of the nation's \nborders and investigations and enforcement of our immigration and \ncustoms laws.\n  Included in this amount is an increase to establish the first \npermanent northern border surveillance air wing.\n  The bill also provides $380 million for the United States Visitor and \nImmigrant Status Indicator Technology project, known as US VISIT. This \nautomated entry/exit system is one of the Department's top priorities. \nIt will track the entry and exit of all non-immigrant travelers, making \nit easier for legitimate travelers while making it more difficult for \nthose who may intend to do us harm.\n  The bill recommends $4.9 billion for the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection, which supports inspection activities and patrolling of our \nborders.\n  As I previously stated, the United States has 5,525 miles of border \nwith Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Our maritime border includes \n95,000 miles of shoreline. Each year, more than 500 million people \ncross the border into the United States, some 330 million who are non-\ncitizens. There are 118,129,875 vehicles that enter the United States \nannually and 16 million cargo containers.\n  To assist the Bureau in its task to protect our border, the bill \nprovides an increase of $74.3 million for additional personnel, $41 \nmillion of which is for 570 additional border agents.\n  In addition, the bill provides full funding of $12.1 million for the \nCustoms Trade Partnership Against Terrorism. A safe and secure supply \nchain is a critical part of the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection's work to keep our country safe. Through this initiative, \nthe Bureau is committed to working closely with companies whose good \nbusiness practices ensure supply chain security as well as compliance \nwith trade laws.\n  It also provides the requested increase of $61.7 million for the \nContainer Security Initiative. This initiative seeks to enhance the \nsecurity of an indispensable, but vulnerable, link in the chain of \nglobal trade: the oceangoing shipping container. Proactively screening \ncontainers before they reach the United States will significantly \ncontribute to efforts to secure the borders against dangers that might \nbe introduced through commercial traffic. A more secure maritime trade \ninfrastructure will help ensure the continued smooth flow of \nmerchandise through seaports.\n  The bill recommends $2.8 billion for the Bureau of Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, which supports investigations, intelligence, \ndetention and removal activities, and provides a safe and secure work \nenvironment for Federal facilities. To assist the Bureau in carrying \nout these tasks, the bill provides an increase of $28.3 million for \nadditional investigative and intelligence personnel.\n  The bill provides an increase of $66.2 million for the establishment \nof the first permanent air surveillance wing on the northern border. \nThe Nation is vulnerable to illegal incursions by terrorists, drug \nsmugglers and other criminals. The establishment of this air wing will \nallow the Department to extend its reach to an at-risk area of the \nNation's airspace.\n  The bill also provides a transfer of $424 million from the General \nServices Administration, Federal Buildings Fund, for the Federal \nProtective Service, which is the same as the President's budget, to \nensure a safe and secure workplace for Federal employees.\n  For the Transportation Security Administration, responsible for \nensuring security across the U.S. transportation system, including our \nNation's airports, railways, highways, and waterways, the bill \nrecommends total funding of $5.4 billion.\n  For security enhancements to our Nation's aviation sector, an \nincrease of $307 million over the President's budget request has been \nprovided. A major component of this increase is $150.5 million for the \npurchase of baggage explosive detection systems and $309 million to \nmake security improvements at our Nation's airports, including the \npermanent installation of these detection systems in the airport to \nmove them out of airport lobbies. In addition, the bill provides \nfunding at the President's requested level for passenger and baggage \nscreeners at airports.\n  Also provided for the security of aviation is $600 million for the \nFederal Air Marshals program, and $25 million for Federal flight deck \nofficer training for commercial pilots who voluntarily apply to carry \nfirearms in the cockpit.\n  To further enhance TSA efforts to secure cargo placed on aircraft, \n$30 million is provided for the screening of air cargo.\n  For maritime and surface transportation security activities, the bill \nprovides $150 million for port security grants, $30 million for the \ncontinuation of operation safe commerce to better secure cargo entering \nthe Nation's three largest ports, and $25 million for trucking industry \ngrants to provide for safe travel on our Nation's highways.\n  To further improve transportation security, $130.2 million is \nprovided for research and development of the latest technologies to \ndetect and deter terrorist attacks, including $45 million for research \nand development of next generation explosive detection systems and $30 \nmillion for research and development of new technologies to screen air \ncargo.\n  The bill recommends $6.88 billion in total funding for the United \nStates Coast Guard, which supports the President's request for search \nand rescue activities, fisheries enforcement, drug interdiction, and \ndefense-related activities. Included in this amount are increases for \nthe Integrated Deepwater Systems, ``Deepwater'', Maritime Safety and \nSecurity Teams, and the Automatic Identification System.\n  The bill provides $702 million for the Deepwater program, which is \n$202 million above the President's budget. Deepwater missions cover the \nspectrum of the Coast Guard's responsibilities, including: homeland \nsecurity, search and rescue, alien migrant interdiction, drug \ninterdiction, fisheries protection, and marine environmental \nprotection.\n  Deepwater was conceptualized as a 20-year program at a cost of $500 \nmillion a year, to recapitalize the Coast Guard's aging assets and \nfully integrate the communications capability of all ships and \naircraft. In order for Deepwater to be completed in 20 years, the \nannual funding would have to include inflation, which has not been the \ncase. If the recent pattern of under-funding continues, the projected \ntime-frame for completion could increase to 30 years, thereby \nincreasing the total cost to the government. Fiscal year 2004 funding \nof $702 million will go a long way toward getting Deepwater back on \nschedule for completion in 20 years.\n  The bill provides $134 million for the Rescue 21 program, which is \nthe same as the President's budget. Rescue 21 is effectively the \nmaritime 9-1-1 system for mariners in distress, designed to monitor \ndistress calls, alert response assets, and coordinate search and rescue \nresponses. This funding will improve the Coast Guard's effectiveness \nand enhance mission delivery of marine safety, law enforcement, \nenvironmental protection, and homeland security.\n  The bill provides an increase of $40 million for the Automatic \nIdentification System, which is similar to an air traffic control \nsystem that transmits important safety and security information \nconcerning vessels back to a shore-based receiver. This provides the \nCoast Guard with the capability to track vessels throughout the coastal \nzone and provide greater security to the Nation's ports.\n  To further strengthen the capacity of the Nation's first responders \nto prepare for and respond to possible terrorist threats, the bill \nprovides $3.638 billion for the Office for Domestic Preparedness.\n  Included in this amount is $1.2 billion for State and local basic \nformula grants; $500 million for State and local law enforcement \nterrorism prevention grants; and $750 million for high-threat urban \narea discretionary grants.\n  The bill also provides $750 million for firefighter assistance \ngrants, to remain as a stand-alone program.\n\n[[Page S9626]]\n\n  The bill does not recommend the consolidation of funding for \nemergency management performance grants into the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness grant programs, as proposed in the budget. An \nappropriation of $165 million for this grant program is provided \nthrough the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate.\n\n  The bill recommends $3.6 billion in total funding for the operations \nof the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate, fully \nsupporting the fiscal year 2004 budget for preparedness, mitigation, \nresponse, and recovery activities; public health programs, to include \nthe Strategic National Stockpile; and information technology services \nand regional operations.\n  The bill provides $1.9 billion for disaster relief as proposed in the \nPresident's budget. The disaster relief fund through the Department of \nHomeland Security will continue to operate the programs formerly run by \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist victims in \npresidentially-declared major disasters and emergencies.\n  The bill provides $200 million for flood map modernization activities \nto modernize and digitize the Nation's flood maps. These maps are \noutdated and in some cases not permanently documented, as the \ndigitization process would provide. Fiscal year 2004 funding will \nensure that the Department stays on track to provide up-to-date flood \nmaps for the Nation within 5 years.\n  The bill continues the Emergency Management Performance Grants, \n``EMPG'', at $165 million, and does not recommend shifting this program \nto the Office for Domestic Preparedness. EMPG is a State matching grant \nprogram designed to assist States and local communities in all-hazards \nplanning and response, and is therefore more appropriately administered \nthrough the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate. In \nMississippi, the number of counties with emergency management programs \nhas increased from 43 to 65 in the last three years because of funds \nmade available through EMPG. The same is true for numerous other \nStates, indicating the importance of this program to provide \ncommunities with the capability to develop localized emergency \nmanagement programs.\n  The bill recommends $823.7 million for activities of the Information \nAnalysis and Infrastructure Protection directorate to identify and \nassess threats to the homeland, map threat information against current \nvulnerabilities, issue warnings, and take preventive and protective \naction.\n  A critical component of this directorate is the ability to provide \nthe resources to secure our Nation's critical infrastructures from \ncatastrophic events. In order to achieve this, $293.9 million is \nprovided for critical infrastructure and key asset identification, \nfield assessments of critical infrastructures, and key asset protection \nimplementation to help guide development of protective measures to \nharden facilities and assets.\n  For the intelligence and warning functions of the Department of \nHomeland Security, $101.7 million is provided to guide collection, \nassessment, evaluation, and prioritization of all intelligence \ninformation.\n  As part of the effort by IAIP to better secure not only physical \nassets but also cyber assets, the bill includes $98.5 million for the \nintegration of physical and cyber infrastructure monitoring and \ncoordination for cyber security.\n  A total of $866 million is recommended for the research and \ndevelopment activities of the Department's Science and Technology \nDirectorate.\n  This directorate is tasked with the centralization of research and \ndevelopment department-wide and is provided $64 million in support of \nconventional missions of the Department's agencies and bureaus.\n  The bill also provides $55 million for the establishment of a \nuniversity-based system to enhance and strengthen the efforts of \nhomeland security on our Nation's campuses.\n  As the Department works to monitor and detect cyber attacks by \nterrorist organizations within the auspices of the Information Analysis \nand Infrastructure Protection directorate, Science and Technology is \nresponsible for the research and development of the most appropriate \ntechnologies for next generation cyber threat characterization, \ndetection, and origination. For these activities, the bill provides $18 \nmillion.\n  A total of $70 million is made available for the technical support \nworking group responsible for the rapid development and prototyping of \nnew technologies in support of homeland security.\n  For research and development of critical infrastructure security \nassurance, $72 million is provided, of which up to $60 million is made \navailable for research, development, testing, and evaluation of an \nanti-missile system for commercial aircraft. There also is a great need \nfor the development of standards and protocols for equipment that is \nused in the field for detecting, mitigating, and recovering from \nterrorist attacks and funds are available for this purpose.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9626-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9626-S9628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A CONSTANT DRUMBEAT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the constant drumbeat in the press goes \non. We find it highlighted in this week's national news magazines: a \nconstant attack on the credibility of George W. Bush; a constant \ndrumbeat calling him a liar, at the very least an exaggerator who did \nit deliberately to mislead the American people and to take us to war.\n  Those in the media who get involved need to be reminded just a little \nbit of their responsibility. It is their responsibility to react not \njust to the flavor of the moment, in terms of political issues, but to \ngive us a little bit of institutional memory. Since they seem to lack \nthat memory, I will do my best to supply it here this afternoon.\n  I remember as a Member of this body some intelligence lapses that \noccurred and decisions that were made on the basis of those lapses. Let \nme give you some.\n  I remember when the United States bombed a pharmaceutical plant in \nSudan because the intelligence said it was a place where biological \nweapons were being created. This was not a trivial matter. I went to \nthe room here in the Capitol that is reserved for secret briefings. I \nrefer to it as the secret room where secret people tell us secret \nthings, and I had no less than the Secretary of Defense absolutely \ninsist that the intelligence was rock solid that biological weapons \nwere being produced at this plant in Sudan.\n  We now know the intelligence was wrong. The plant was not involved in \nthe production of biological or chemical weapons. The intelligence \ninformation that led us to believe it had been was flawed, it was old, \nand the casualties that occurred on that occasion were civilians who \nneedlessly lost their lives because the American intelligence was bad.\n  The question is: Would we have been better off if we had not \ndestroyed that plant in the Sudan? And the answer is clearly yes. \nIntelligence let us down. We made the wrong decision. We killed some \ncivilians. We would have been better off if we had not proceeded.\n  The second lapse of intelligence occurred during the bombing in \nBosnia. I was involved in this one to a greater degree than the other. \nThis is where the Americans bombed what they thought was a legitimate \ntarget and it turned out to be the Chinese Embassy. Furthermore, it was \nmore than just the Chinese Embassy. It was the center of Chinese \nintelligence activity that covered most of that part of Europe.\n  I was in China on a congressional delegation not long after that \noccurred. One after another Chinese official kept berating me and the \nother members of the delegation as to why we had deliberately targeted \nand destroyed a key intelligence center for the Chinese.\n  Our answer was that this was an intelligence failure on our part; \nthat the CIA was using an old address book, and we had not realized we \nwere, in fact,\n\n[[Page S9627]]\n\ndestroying a very sensitive Chinese installation.\n  I remember the response from a Chinese official as we made that \nexplanation. He said: You Americans have the best intelligence in the \nworld. You have been following what we have been doing in that part of \nthe world for years. You destroyed a major intelligence asset of ours, \nand you claim it was a mistake? You claim your intelligence assets were \nso bad you did not realize we had been at that location for years?\n  It was very clear from the questions and the tone of voice with which \nthose questions were asked that the Chinese officials did not believe \nus. They did not believe we were capable of such a stupid mistake.\n  The only defense that could be offered, and it was offered by another \nmember of the delegation, was it had to be a mistake because, in fact, \nit was so stupid. No one would have done that deliberately and damaged \nthe relationship between the United States and the Chinese so \nseriously.\n  It was in response to that the U.S. Embassy in Beijing was stoned. I \nsaw the windows that were broken. I saw the bullet holes that pocked \nthe walls as people fired on the Embassy. It was a major incident.\n  Again, the fundamental question: Would we have been better off if we \nhad not done it? And the answer is an unequivocal and overwhelming, \nyes; we would have been better off if we had not done it.\n  I could go on, but let me take those two examples of failed \nintelligence and those two questions--would we have been better off if \nwe had not done it in the Sudan, and would we have been better off if \nwe had not done it in Belgrade--and put them in the context of today's \ndebate.\n  Let's assume for a moment--and I underscore that I do not--that the \nintelligence that led up to the decision to go ahead in Iraq was as \nfaulty as the administration's critics are now claiming it was, and \nthen ask the same fundamental question: Would the world be better off \nif we had not gone into Iraq? And the answer is clearly, no. The answer \nis clearly as Tony Blair laid it out before the joint session of \nCongress. He made it clear if we made a mistake, history will forgive \nthe mistake because the consequences of it were that we freed the Iraqi \npeople. We brought a degree of credibility and stability into that \nregion that has not been there. We have new leverage to deal with the \nIsraeli/Palestinian question beyond that which any American President \nhas had.\n  If, in fact, we blundered into Iraq--and, once again, I underscore \nthe fact I do not believe we did--we did a good thing. Unlike the \nfailed intelligence that caused us to blow up a civilian production \nfacility in the Sudan, which was a bad thing, unlike the failed \nintelligence that caused us to destroy the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, \nwhich was a bad thing, if there was flawed intelligence here that \ncaused us to go into Iraq, it was still a good thing.\n  Let me give an example of flawed intelligence with respect to Iraq. \nWe did not know, going into Iraq, the degree to which Saddam Hussein \nhad committed genocide against his own people. With all of the \nintelligence assets we had on the ground in Iraq, we were unaware of \nthe number and extent of the mass graves that we are still uncovering \nwhile we are there. If we are going to complain, as those in the media \nare doing, that the intelligence going into Iraq was flawed, they \nshould complain just as much about the failure of intelligence to tell \nus the degree of his brutality. But they are not talking about that. We \ndo not get any media reports with each new discovery of a major new \nmass grave. Those are dismissed in what is called the mainstream media \nbecause that might lend support to the idea that going into Iraq was \nthe right thing to have done.\n\n  No, instead we are quibbling over words that appeared in the State of \nthe Union that somehow triggered massive misunderstanding on the part \nof the American people. I would challenge anyone to go to anyone in \nAmerica and ask them how many of them remember the 16 words that are \nbeing challenged. Well, maybe the American people do not remember those \nwords but certainly the Congress does.\n  There is a slight problem with that because the State of the Union \nMessage was given after the Congress had approved the President's \nintervention in Iraq. The vote was taken on this floor prior to the \ntime the President made those statements. So how can anyone in this \nbody claim that he or she was misled by the President's statement in \nthe State of the Union when the vote was taken prior to the time that \nstatement was made?\n  Once again, that is a fact that is conveniently left out of all of \nthe media analysis. They do not tell us that Congress went to the \nbriefings and came to its conclusion as to the rightness of the \ndecision in Iraq before the President made that comment in the State of \nthe Union.\n  I went to the briefings. There was a briefing at the Pentagon that I \nremember very carefully. We went over for breakfast with the Secretary \nof Defense and he gave us a complete briefing on the entire issue of \nweapons of mass destruction and where things were in Iraq. I must say I \ndid not see any of the current critics of the President's plan present \nat that briefing. I remember fairly clearly who was there. I could not \nname all of the Senators who were there, but I could name all of the \nDemocratic Senators who were there, and none of them is currently \nengaged in criticizing the President.\n  I remember a briefing at the White House in the Roosevelt Room with \nrepresentatives of the CIA and Condoleezza Rice, where we went through \nthe whole issue of weapons of mass destruction. Once again, I can \nremember the Senators who were at that briefing. It was open to all. It \nwas not a private thing where a few Senators were requested. Any \nSenator who wanted could have gone to that briefing. I remember those \nwho were there. Not one of the current critics of the President's \nposition was there at that briefing.\n  So I find it a little disingenuous to have them say they were misled \nwhen they did not attend the briefings that were given.\n  Now let me take my colleagues to that briefing in the Roosevelt Room \nin the White House and summarize for them what was said there. We were \ntold the following: Four areas of deep concern were raised, and we were \ntold in descending order of how scary these were. The first was \nbiological weapons. The second was Saddam Hussein's capacity to deliver \nthose weapons. The third was chemical weapons. The fourth was nuclear \nweapons.\n  I remember that very clearly because I summarized it back to the \nbriefers and said: Let me be sure I understand what you are saying. You \nare saying you are most frightened of his capacity in the biological \narea, slightly less frightened about his ability to deliver those \nweapons, slightly less frightened about his capacity in the chemical \narea, and least frightened about his capacity in the nuclear area? And \nthey said, yes, Senator that is the descending order of concern.\n  I cite that because we are now being told in the popular press that \nthe entire operation was sold to us because of the threat of nuclear \nweapons, ignoring the facts that we were given at the briefing to which \nthey did not come.\n  The question was raised, Why should we be going against Saddam \nHussein at this particular time? That was one of the questions at the \nbriefing. I remember the answer very clearly. If we are just talking \nabout weapons of mass destruction, there are a number of countries that \nhave weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, if we went to the country \nthat has the most outside of the United States itself, that would be \nRussia. Simple possession of weapons of mass destruction, the point was \nclearly made at the briefing, simple possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction does not justify taking action.\n  A brutal dictator who oppresses his own people. Look around the world \nand there are plenty of brutal dictators who oppress their own people. \nBeing a brutal dictator who oppresses his own people is not \njustification for the United States to go to war against you. That \npoint was clearly made at the briefing.\n  Willingness to invade your neighbors. There have been regimes around \nthe world that have attacked recently their neighbors. Clearly, the \nUnited States cannot intervene every time there is a border war or a \nwillingness to attack your neighbors. That, alone, does not justify \ngoing against someone in a military fashion.\n\n[[Page S9628]]\n\n  Using weapons of mass destruction is different from possessing them. \nNow we are getting kind of narrow because we do not have a great number \nof examples of regimes that have used weapons of mass destruction. But \nmaybe that alone, again, does not justify going against another regime.\n  Put them all together--possession of weapons of mass destruction, \nusing the weapons of mass destruction, crossing borders and invading \nyour neighbors, and being in the hands of a brutal dictator--now we are \ngetting a list and we are coming very close to Saddam Hussein, as the \nonly brutal dictator with weapons of mass destruction, who qualifies \nfor all four of those.\n  But there is a fifth that comes into play as a follow-on to September \n11: That is financing and harboring terrorists. Let me make it clear at \nthat briefing, no one said there was a heavy al-Qaida presence in Iraq. \nOnce again, people in the media are attacking President Bush for saying \nsomething that, in fact, he did not say. What was said at the briefing \nwas Iraq sponsors terrorism, Iraq funds terrorism, and there are \nintelligence reports of Iraq harboring members of al-Qaida who are \nfleeing for their lives.\n  The statement was never made that there was a major al-Qaida \nheadquarters in Iraq. The statement was simply made that terrorists run \nthrough Iraq. A number of terrorist organizations, in addition to al-\nQaida, have been represented in Iraq. Iraq funds terrorism throughout \nthe region.\n  Here are five different criteria, any one of which might not be \nenough to justify moving against a foreign government. Indeed, two or \neven three gathered together might still not justify moving against a \nforeign government. But the statement was made clearly, when you put \nall five together and ask yourself where in the world do you find all \nfive at the same time, the answer is in one place and one place only: \nThat place is Iraq.\n  That was the intelligence briefing I attended. That was the \nintelligence information I heard when I made up my mind to be in \nsupport of the President and this operation. As I said before, I do not \nremember--indeed, I am sure that most of the President's congressional \ncritics--indeed, all of--the President's congressional critics in this \nChamber--were not there. They did not hear the briefings.\n\n  For them to come forward now and say the President misled them, when \nthey did not go, is disingenuous. I do not feel misled. I do not feel \nuninformed. I do not feel the intelligence was bad. Insufficient? Of \ncourse. Intelligence is always insufficient. But that does not mean it \nwas deliberately manipulated; that does not mean it was planted; that \ndoes not mean anyone did anything but the very best he or she could do \nin good faith.\n  The fundamental question I posed earlier still stands. Even if you \naccuse the President of doing all of what his critics are saying he \ndid, was it bad to have gone into Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein? \nUntil critics either in the Congress or the media will come forward and \nsay, we used bad intelligence to make the bad decision and the world \nwould be better off if Saddam Hussein were still in power, they cannot, \nin my view, sustain their criticism. They cannot fault this President \nunless they are willing to say in this instance what we can say in the \ntwo other instances I have described.\n  Intelligence was flawed in the Sudan. Would the world be better off \nif we had not destroyed that plant? Yes. The intelligence was flawed in \nBelgrade. Would we be better off if we had not destroyed the Chinese \nEmbassy? The answer is yes. If the intelligence was flawed in Iraq, the \nsame question still applies: Would we be better off if we had not \ntoppled Saddam Hussein? Until someone is willing to answer that \nquestion yes, I am not willing to give credence to their complaints \nabout this President and this White House.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9628-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9628-S9629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004--Continued\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today the Senate takes up H.R. 2555, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations bill. This is the first \nhomeland security appropriations bill in the history of the Nation. The \nSenate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee was created just 4 \nmonths ago. Under the able leadership of Chairman Cochran, the \nsubcommittee held six hearings to review the operations of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I commend Chairman Cochran and his \nstaff for their work on this important legislation.\n  The bill provides discretionary budget authority totaling $28.521 \nbillion, a level that is $1.039 billion above the President's request. \nThe bill is at the level available under the 302(b) allocation. \nRegrettably, the allocation for homeland security programs is \ninadequate. This is not a criticism of Chairman Cochran, nor is it a \ncriticism of full Committee Chairman Ted Stevens. Unfortunately, the \nbudget resolution that passed this Congress limited discretionary \nspending to levels below the President's already inadequate request. \nThe budget resolution severely constrains our ability to address known \nthreats to the safety of the American people.\n  With the Department of Homeland Security regularly changing the \nterrorist level from elevated to high and back, and with the Secretary \nsaying publicly that another terrorist attack is inevitable, the \ndemands for homeland security spending seem endless. Our job on the \nAppropriations Committee is to make careful choices. Unfortunately, the \nbudget resolution has forced us to exclude from the bill some funding \nthat both the Congress and the President have recognized as being real \nneeds.\n  All Americans, whether they live in rural communities or major \ncities, want to know that if there is a terrorist attack close to their \nhomes, their local doctors and nurses have the training to treat the \ninjured. Americans want to know that their local firemen have the \nability and the equipment to handle a chemical or biological attack. \nAmericans want to know that their local police officers are trained in \nidentifying and responding to the variety of terrorist attacks that we \ncould now face.\n  Regrettably, this bill, while providing first responder funding at a \nlevel that is $303 million over the President's request, is $434 \nmillion below the level that the Congress approved for the current \nfiscal year. The Federal Government needs to remain a full partner in \nlocal homeland defense efforts and adequate funding is essential to \nthat task.\n  According to the Secretary of Defense, the United States is spending \n$3.9 billion per month for the war in Iraq. Yet this bill includes only \n$3.9 billion for the entire year for equipping and training our first \nresponders. Frankly, I believe that the President and the \nadministration have lost their focus on what really matters to American \ncitizens; namely, the combating of terrorism and securing the homeland.\n  One of the mysteries about the President's budget is the budget for \nthe Transportation Security Administration or TSA. TSA was created by \nthe Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 and was supposed \nto focus on securing all modes of transportation. Yet the President's \nbudget includes only $86 million or 2 percent of the TSA budget for \nmaritime and land security.\n  Yet the President's budget includes only $86 million.\n  The rest of the President's budget request is for aviation security \nand for administration. What about securing our ports? What about \nsecuring our trains? What about securing our subways and our railway \ntunnels? What about securing our buses, or securing the trucks that \ncarry hazardous materials? In fact, the President's budget requests 2.5 \ntimes more for administering the Transportation Security Administration \nbureaucracy than the President does for securing the Nation's ports, \ntrains, trucks, and buses.\n  I commend Chairman Thad Cochran for recognizing this problem and for \naddressing some of these weaknesses. But he simply did not have the \nresources available to him to deal with several well-known \nvulnerabilities.\n\n[[Page S9629]]\n\n  For example, in November of 2002, President Bush signed the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act which established new standards for \nsecuring our Nation's ports. Despite the fact that the Coast Guard had \nestimated it will cost the ports $5.4 billion over 10 years to \nimplement those standards, including $1.1 billion the first year, the \nPresident did not request a dime for port security.\n  The bill that is before the Senate includes $150 million for port \nsecurity grants, and I commend Chairman Cochran for finding the \nresources within the limited allocation for this important program. I \nhope we can do more to secure our ports.\n  In October of 2001, the President signed the Patriot Act, which \ncalled for tripling the number of Border Patrol agents and Customs and \nimmigration inspectors on the northern border. In May of 2002, the \nPresident signed the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform \nAct, which authorized significant new investments in Border Patrol \nagents and facilities. The goals with regard to Customs inspectors and \nborder facilities cannot be met with the limited funding that was made \navailable for discretionary programs under the budget resolution.\n  Under the President's proposal for the Transportation Security \nAdministration, there is a significant gap in securing commercial \nairlines. Under the proposal, each airline passenger is screened before \nhe or she gets on a plane, and each passenger's baggage would be \nscreened before being loaded on a plane. But commercial cargo on that \nsame plane would be left unchecked. That is a dangerous security risk \nthat needs to be addressed. This bill adds $30 million to the budget \nrequest to research, develop, and deploy air cargo security programs to \nenhance the secure transport of cargo on commercial airlines. I believe \nwe need to do more to secure cargo on our commercial airlines.\n  However, with the funds that were made available to the subcommittee \nunder our allocation, I believe Chairman Cochran has produced a good \nbill. It is balanced. It is fair. It addresses a number of weaknesses \nin the President's budget request that we identified during our \ncommittee hearing.\n  We increased funding over the President's request to equip and train \nour first responders. We continue to fund effective programs such as \nthe Fire Grants Program and the All Hazards Emergency Management \nPerformance Grants Program, which the President had proposed to \nconsolidate into a single grant program. We increased funding for our \nairports to purchase explosives detection equipment and to install that \nequipment.\n  We increased funding over the President's request for the Coast Guard \nin order to keep the Deep Water Air and Sea Modernization Program on \nschedule. We recognize that not all transportation security \nvulnerabilities are at our airports. We also fund grants for port \nsecurity, bus security, and for securing hazardous materials.\n\n  Additionally, this legislation takes an important step to protect \npersonal privacy. The bill delays for 60 days the expenditure of funds \non implementing the Department's proposed new Airline Passenger \nProfiling System--CAPPS II--until the General Accounting Office \nconducts a study and reports to the Congress on the privacy \nimplications of the system. We must make sure that the privacy rights \nof individuals are protected and that individuals who are determined to \npose a threat to security have an appeal mechanism.\n  This is a good bill, but we must address several critical shortfalls \nthat result from the budget resolution that put tax cuts at the front \nof the line and left homeland security to compete with every other \nFederal program for limited dollars. The result, regrettably, is a \nhomeland security budget that leaves gaps in our security by leaving \npriority programs underfunded.\n  After 9/11, Congress passed the Patriot Act, the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act, the Aviation and Transportation Security \nAct, and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act. And \nthe President signed them with great fanfare. But the President has \ndone little to fulfill the promise of those laws. Now the Senate has \nbefore it the funding legislation that would either fulfill the promise \nof those acts or continue to leave the Nation and its citizens \nvulnerable.\n  I urge all Members to be mindful of the solemn duty to ``provide for \nthe common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the \nblessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity'' as we debate \nthis important appropriations bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1317\n\n            (Purpose: Fulfilling Homeland Security Promises)\n\n   Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I want to comment on an opportunity I had \non Saturday to meet with Ambassador Bremer shortly after his arrival \nfrom Iraq. And we met, for a short period of time, with Senator Warner \nand Representatives Lewis and Murtha to talk a little bit about what is \ngoing on on the ground in Iraq, specifically with coalition provisional \nauthority, what their role is, how much progress is being made in \nrebuilding Iraq.\n  It is so difficult for all of us, in our briefings, where we are \ngetting information secondhand, thirdhand--we are watching the news on \ntelevision and reading it in the papers, and you get slivers of \ninformation--it is very tough to put in perspective what is actually \ngoing on in this vast country, where we know we are rebuilding not just \nfrom the war several weeks ago but from 10 years of neglect--indeed, 30 \nyears of neglect. It is hard to assess, in terms of health care and \nwater and schools and roads, where we are. You really see very little \nin terms of progress being made based on the information that filters \nthrough to us.\n  That is really why, as a prelude to some of the things we will hear \ntomorrow, Ambassador Bremer is going to come and visit with us in the \nSenate, where we will have a discussion. He is briefing the \nadministration today, and he had several very public addresses on \nSunday. But what he has to say is astonishing in lots of different \nways, but mostly I think because of the relative silence in the press \nabout the conditions on the ground in terms of progress, in terms of \nimprovement.\n  After talking to Ambassador Bremer, it is clear to me that we are \nmaking real progress, demonstrable progress, day to day, week to week, \nin Iraq. Just as one example, I very specifically asked about food and \nasked about health care. Today, based on all objective measures, and as \nreinforced by Ambassador Bremer, there is no food crisis in Iraq. \nIndeed, there is no health care crisis in Iraq right now, today. The \nprovision of basic utilities is improving daily, as is the overall \npublic health situation. Indeed, I believe the Ambassador said that \nnext week there will be a second immunization day nationwide scheduled.\n  When I asked about basic health care services, the Ambassador replied \nthat they have been restored to about 90 percent in the north and 80 \npercent in the south and about 75 percent in the mid region around \nBaghdad.\n  When I asked about specific hospitals, I was told that over 200 \nhospitals--I don't know the exact number; there are over 200 hospitals \nin Iraq--all of those hospitals are now operational, in service.\n  Much of Iraq is near the prewar service conditions for water. When I \nspeak of water conditions, I include sewage and the like. But what is \ninteresting, and what we have to constantly remind ourselves, is that \nthe country has been in a state of deterioration over the last 15 \nyears, with no money invested in clean water, servicing that water, \ngetting water to the people, and sewage plants. So even prewar \nconditions were very poor. But then we had the impact of the war. We \nhave some sabotage going on right now. But now we are just about up to \nthe prewar service conditions. We still have a long way to go to get \nback to the sort of conditions we would say are acceptable.\n  In terms of security, while lawlessness and entrenched Saddam \nloyalists continue to obstruct and hinder recovery efforts, progress \nhas been made on the security front as well. Large-scale looting has \nstopped, has come to an end. Where there were once, not that long ago, \nempty roads, empty streets, and deserted markets, there are now \nbustling sidewalks with all sorts of items being sold, from shoes to \nsatellite dishes to basic utensils. Now you see traffic back on the \nstreets and even traffic jams.\n\n  Except for the small, central area--an important area but a small \narea--encompassing Tikrit and Baghdad, security throughout the rest of \nIraq has improved. Indeed, more than 80 percent of the country is \nliving in a more secure environment than they were before the war. Mr. \nPresident, 34,000 Iraqi police have been rehired, and 30,000 are on \nduty right now. Additionally, over 1,000 guards have been hired to \nprotect 87 sites just in Baghdad alone.\n  Also, we hear, again: Is it just the United States? Ambassador Bremer \nwill share with us the participation and cooperation we are receiving \nfrom around the world. We are not going it alone. He has mentioned, and \ncontinues to mention, the international constabulary teams that are \nfrom Italy and Spain that will serve as a bridge between the combat \nforces and the police.\n  The one distressing area we hear about every morning when we wake up \nor late at night is the distressing news of guerrilla activity and \nattacks on our troops. Indeed, our hearts go out to the families who \nhave been affected and continue to be affected by this loss of loved \nones. But it is important for us to understand we are not fighting a \nlarge-scale insurgency at this point in time. We are fighting the dead-\nenders from the old regime, the former Baathists. They have no popular \nsupport in Iraq. They will not return to power.\n  In addition to improving the security of the country, the coalition \nis also working hard to generate a thriving Iraqi economy. Again, we \nhave to mention, however, that the Iraqi economy has been grossly \nmismanaged for more than 30 years. By his own estimates, Iraq suffered \nfrom employment levels at 50 percent before the war. Before the war, at \nleast 30 percent of the GDP was spent just on the military--not on \nbuilding infrastructure or refurbishing infrastructure, not on water \nsupply or sewage plants or health or education.\n  Saddam Hussein had run the country into the ground: 50 percent \nunemployment; 30 percent of the GDP, the gross domestic product, spent \non the military. Saddam's government spent zero on capital goods. And, \nyes, there were lavish palaces. There were manmade lakes, luxury \nyachts, and cars. Saddam spent untold billions on himself and his \nregime, but for the Iraqi people, for the people themselves, he left \nthem a country with an infrastructure, as we witness today, that is \nbrittle, that is antiquated, and, indeed, is susceptible to breakdown.\n  I mention this because, at least in my conversations with the \nAmbassador, it is clear we need for us and the American people to \nunderstand that part of this reconstruction is going to be \nreconstruction from the war but mainly reconstruction from the last 10, \n15, 20 years of this tyrannical, oppressive regime.\n  As we look at the economy, I am fascinated by the dispensing fund \nwhich has been set up that is financing and will continue to finance \nconstruction projects and reconstruction projects that are carried out \nby the Iraqis themselves.\n  It is currently employing Iraqi construction firms to carry out the \nrestoration of that national infrastructure. The coalition is paying \nsalaries, paying pensions. It is paying the army and buying crops from \nfarmers. And these are the first steps toward building and rebuilding \nthat economy, a functioning economy, and indeed they are vital steps. \nAnd they are under way. Freedom is coming to the Iraqi people. Freedom \nis coming to support their economy.\n   In terms of democracy itself, the coalition is leading Iraq toward a \nfunctioning democracy. It was just a little over a week ago, just 8 \ndays ago, that the governing council of Iraq was established. The \ncouncil comprises 25 political leaders from across Iraq. Its immediate \nresponsibilities include the appointment of ministers, the creation of \na 2004 budget, and a constitutional process. It is remarkable that \nthese 25 will be charged with sitting down and writing a constitution \nreally from scratch.\n   The governing council will be responsible for creating a \nconstitutional process, not just the writing but the actual debate as \nto what should be in the constitution. Once the constitution is \ndrafted, then free elections will take\n\n[[Page S9631]]\n\nplace. That will create a sovereign Iraqi government. When that \ngovernment is created, the coalition provisional authority's work is \nessentially done, but it does take time. It does take patience. It does \ntake time to rebuild the economy, to establish the security that the \npeople of Iraq deserve.\n   I welcome the ambassador to the Senate tomorrow to hear of his \nfirsthand experiences and to help paint that perspective which makes it \nmuch easier for us both to view the news and the information that is \ngiven to us so we can make appropriate policy decisions. It is vitally \nimportant that we have that complete perspective and that full view of \nthe Iraqi situation. We will stay the course. The Iraqi people, of \ncourse, depend on us to stay the course. It will take time. It will \ntake patience. It will take determination.\n   It is astounding to me that even in defeat Saddam has the power \nseemingly to turn the free world against itself and divert the media's \nattention from his monstrous crimes. For the last week and a half we \nhave had a glossing over of the atrocities this man had committed. I \nappeal to my colleagues to look at the Iraqi people, at this crucial \nturning point in their history, and allow the Iraqis for the first time \nin 30 years to really taste what freedom is all about.\n   We talk all the time in this Chamber about helping, reaching out to \nhelp the oppressed and helping the downtrodden. Now is the time to ask: \nAre Iraqis in some way unworthy, are 300,000 missing people in Iraq \nmerely a statistic? Every day our soldiers are turning up mass graves \nfull of the bones of men, women, and children who have been hacked down \nliterally by Saddam's men. We are beginning to see these images. We in \nthis body have had the opportunity to talk to our Senate colleagues who \nhave visited Iraq recently. There are literally tiny skeletons strewn \nin the dust alongside these once-adored little plastic baby dolls. The \nimages are coming back to us to demonstrate the atrocities committed by \nSaddam Hussein.\n   We cannot, we should not look away. We will not look away. We know \nthis will take time.\n   On the question of weapons of mass destruction, we know, and indeed \nwe have those horrifying pictures, that Saddam used chemical and \nbiological weapons of mass destruction against his neighbors and his \nown people. Last week on the floor I talked about my opportunity to \nvisit directly in my office with Kurdish physicians, who are still \npracticing today, who talked about the thousands of Kurds, Saddam's own \npeople, who were killed by the chemical weapons of Saddam Hussein. \nIndeed, these Kurdish physicians tell me they are still taking care of \npeople today who suffered the morbidity of having been exposed to \nchemical weapons, those who were fortunate enough to survive.\n\n   Furthermore, Saddam's quest for nuclear weaponry is well known. It \nis indisputable. One only need ask the most elemental question: For \nwhat purpose were nuclear scientists on Saddam's payroll? Indeed, the \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Graham, told Fox News Sunday:\n\n        What we're concerned about with Iraq is its intention and \n     capabilities to develop weapons of mass destruction, and the \n     merger of that capability with terrorist groups. That is the \n     ultimate nightmare scenario.\n\n   The nightmare is over. A bloody tyrant no longer rules in Iraq. A \nman who without qualm or regret murdered members of his own family and \ntens of thousands of his own citizens has been removed from power. The \nperpetrator of one of the past century's most gruesome crimes against \nhumanity, the use of chemical weapons on thousands of innocent Kurdish \ncivilians, is no longer free to pursue such weapons. The aggressor in \nthe gulf war who a decade ago invaded his neighbor only to be driven \nout by a mighty coalition no longer threatens the volatile region of \nthe Middle East. Iraq is no longer a playground for Saddam and his \ndemented offspring. Iraq is finally and thankfully on the road to \nliberation.\n   Yes, it will be a bumpy road. It will take time. Even America was \nnot built in a day. We are rebuilding, not just from the war but from \n30 years of neglect. Today we should be celebrating the historic \nopportunity before the Iraqi people to build a democracy that respects \nthe rule of law, that values life, that protects the God-given rights \nof every Iraqi citizen. We should lend them our strength and our \ncompetence as they face the difficult journey ahead. There can be no \nother course of action.\n  I believe that when all is said and done, Iraq will proudly stand \namong the nations of free people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9631-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAIRNESS IN ASBESTOS INJURY RESOLUTION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nDepartment of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program. Last week, we \npassed a Defense appropriations bill that includes $150 million in \nfunding for this program. In the more than 10 years since its \ninception, I have worked with many of my colleagues to ensure that this \ngroundbreaking program continues to have the strong level of support \nnecessary to give researchers the essential resources they need to \ndiscover the keys to curing and preventing breast cancer.\n  Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. It \naccounts for 30 percent of all cancers in women. In the United States \nin 2002 alone, it is estimated that 203,500 women were diagnosed with \ninvasive breast cancer while 40,000 women lost their lives to this \ndisease. These women are our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, our \nfriends. Research toward a cure cannot bring those loved ones back to \nus, but we hope it will spare thousands of future tragedies and provide \nhope for women currently struggling with this devastating disease.\n  Earlier this year, as I have for the past several years, I \ncoordinated a letter, along with Senators Leahy and others, requesting \nthat the Defense appropriations for fiscal year 2004 contain $175 \nmillion in funding for the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research \nProgram. This letter received the strong bipartisan support of 66 \nsenators. Although budgetary constraints did not permit funding at the \nrequested level, the fiscal year 2004 Defense appropriations bill does \ncontain $150 million for this program. Given the challenges of this \nyear's budget, I am pleased that the appropriation bill contains such a \nstrong level of support.\n  The research made possible by the Breast Cancer Research Program may \nbenefit not only the victims of breast cancer but of countless other \ndiseases as well. This program fills a unique role in offering awards \nthat fill gaps in ongoing research and complement initiatives sponsored \nby other agencies. The program supports research and training awards \nthat promote the investigation of innovative ideas and a strong \nworkforce of scientists in this critical field. In an analysis of this \nprogram the Institute of Medicine said:\n\n       The Program fills a unique niche among public and private \n     funding sources for cancer research. It is not duplicative of \n     other programs and is a promising vehicle for forging new \n     ideas and scientific breakthroughs in the nation's fight \n     against breast cancer.\n\n  In just over a decade since its inception, the DOD Breast Cancer \nResearch Program already has shown great success. The flexibility of \nthis program helps to maximize the limited resources available. I \napplaud the strong support of this program and want to stress that the \nintent of reviewing alternative funding sources is to strengthen breast \ncancer research efforts and not to affect funding for the current \nprogram. I am concerned about\n\n[[Page S9632]]\n\nany efforts to review or restructure the program that might reduce the \neffectiveness and vitality of the dynamic research efforts it supports. \nMuch work remains to be done in our quest for the cure, and I will \ncontinue my strong support of the Breast Cancer Research Program in \nyears to come.\n  Mr. President, as this bill heads to conference, I urge the conferees \nto recognize the strong congressional support of this program by, at a \nminimum, maintaining the Senate funding level.\n\n\n                          honoring john hardt\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to \npay tribute to a very distinguished servant of the legislative branch \nof Congress. In May 2003, Dr. John Hardt ends his official service with \nthe Congressional Research Service after 32 years as a valuable \nresource to Congress in the field of international economics and \nforeign affairs. In many ways, Dr. Hardt's retirement symbolizes the \nending of an era for the Congress; he is the only remaining CRS senior \nspecialist now providing Congress with research and analysis in the \nfield of foreign affairs. He has been a great asset to the Congress and \nto CRS throughout his long career in public service.\n  Dr. Hardt received both his PhD in economics and a certificate from \nthe Russian Institute from Columbia University. Prior to joining the \nCongressional Research Service, he had already had the kind of \nillustrious career that serves as a lifetime achievement for many \nothers. He served his country with distinction during World War II, \nreceiving ribbons and battle stars for both the European and Asiatic \nTheaters of operations as well as the Philippines Liberation Ribbon. He \nhas been an educator--specializing in economics, Soviet studies, and \nSino-Soviet studies--at the University of Washington, the University of \nMaryland, Johns Hopkins University, the George Washington University, \nthe Foreign Service Institute, and American military service schools. \nHe has served in the American private sector specializing in Soviet \nelectric power and nuclear energy economics for the CEIR Corporation in \nWashington, DC, and as Director of the Strategic Studies Department at \nthe Research Analysis Corporation in McLean, VA, where he specialized \nin Soviet comparative Communist and Japanese studies. He is a widely \npublished author, with hundreds of research papers, journal articles, \ntechnical memoranda, and book chapters to his credit.\n  Dr. Hardt joined the Congressional Research Service as the senior \nspecialist in Soviet economics in November of 1971. It is work for \nCRS--and for us,the Members of this body--that I want to honor today. \nFor the past three decades, Dr. Hardt has served Members of Congress, \ntheir staff and committees with his considerable expertise in soviet \nand post-soviet and Eastern Europe economics, the economy of the \nPeople's Republic of China, East-West commercial relations, and \ncomparative international economic analysis. He has advised, among \nothers, both the Senate and House Commerce Committees on East-West \ntrade; the Senate and House Banking Committees on the Export-Import \nBank and other U.S. Government financing programs; and the Senate \nFinance and House Ways and Means Committees on U.S. trade policy. He \nfrequently has traveled with congressional committee delegations, \nserving as a technical adviser on visits to the former Soviet Union, \nPoland, Hungary, the former Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom, the Federal \nRepublic of Germany, Italy, and Sweden, and then preparing committee \nreports for these trips. On many occasions, Dr. Hardt has been called \non to advise directly Members of Congress and congressional staff on \nRussian Federation debt reduction and its relationship to \nnonproliferation concerns, and has provided support to the Russian \nLeadership Program, especially those events and activities that \ninvolved Members of Congress. The extent of his national and \ninternational contacts is breathtaking, and includes senior members of \nforeign governments and leading multinational businesses.\n  His most lasting legacy for Congress may well be his service as both \neditor and coordinator of a long series of Joint Economic Committee \ncompendia on the economies of the PRC, Soviet Union, and Eastern \nEurope. The Congress can take pride in these important, well known, and \nhighly respected JEC studies, to which Dr. Hardt devoted so much of his \ntalent and energies. The more than 70 volumes of this work include; \nChina Under the Four Modernizations, 1982; China's Economy Looks Toward \nthe Year 2000, 1986; The Former Soviet Union in Transition, 1993; East-\nCentral European Economies in transition, 1994; and Russia's Uncertain \nEconomic Future, 2001. The series includes hundreds of analytical \npapers on various aspects of issues pertinent to Congress and to U.S. \npolicy, all written by internationally recognized government, academic, \nand private sector experts, and all coordinated and edited by Dr. \nHardt. This work was not only a valuable source of analysis to the \nCongress but also to the policy making and academic communities at \nlarge. For many years, these volumes were the most comprehensive \nsources of economic data and analyses on the economies of the Soviet \nUnion, China and Eastern Europe.\n  Let me make one final point to illustrate the loss that we, as \nMembers of Congress, sustain with Dr.. Hardt's retirement. That point \nconcerns one of the great strengths that CRS offers to Congress, and \nwhich Dr. Hardt's tenure and contributions at CRS epitomize perfectly: \ninstitutional member. Of the 535 Members of the 108th Congress, only 11 \nwere Members of the 92nd Congress when Dr. Hardt first assumed his \nofficial congressional duties. Most of the countries that he has \nspecialized in have undergone astounding transformation during his \nworking life--some, indeed, no longer exist. The membership of this \ndeliberative body in which we serve has turned over many times. \nCommittees have come and gone. But through it all, John Hardt has been \na constant fixture, a strand of continuity in an environment of \ncontinual change--part of the collective institutional memory of CRS \nwhich is of such value to our work in Congress. We wish Dr. Hardt well \nin the new ventures on which he will be embarking. He will be greatly \nmissed by us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9632-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9632-S9633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO YASMINA VINCI\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I honor one of our most \ndedicated leaders, effective advocates and passionate activists for \nAmerica's children: Ms. Yasmina Vinci. Ms. Vinci is retiring after 11 \nyears as the executive director of the Nation's Network of Child Care \nResource and Referral Agencies, NACCRRA. Ms. Vinci started the \nWashington, DC office of NACCRRA from her kitchen table with just a \ntelephone and fax machine and built it into a highly respected \norganization representing more than 860 local and State child care \nresource and referral agencies.\n  Ms. Vinci is one of our Nation's most tireless advocates for a high-\nquality early care and education system designed to serve all children. \nAs executive director of NACCRRA, Ms. Vinci has provided vision, \nleadership and support to community child care resource and referral \nagencies and has promoted national policies and partnerships committed \nto the development and learning of all children. Ms. Vinci has worked \ndiligently to promote quality in child care resource and referral \nservices.\n  Prior to joining NACCRRA in 1992, Ms. Vinci was the manager of \nspecial projects in the New Jersey Department of Human Services where \nshe managed the Dependent Care Grant, coordinated the development of \nthe New Jersey plan for the implementation of the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant and supervised a number of research, \nimmunization and Head Start-related projects. For nearly 10 years, Ms. \nVinci was the executive director of an inner-city child care center, \nserving 200 low-income families through a continuum of high quality, \ncomprehensive, and family supportive programs.\n  Ms. Vinci has served on the Boards of the National School Age Care \nAlliance, the Interfaith Council for the Homeless, United Way and YWCA. \nShe is a current member of the Board of the Alliance for Work Life \nProgress, the Center for Evidence Based Practices, the Center for \nSocial and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning and the NOW Legal \nDefense and Education\n\n[[Page S9633]]\n\nFund National Advisory Commission on Child Care and Early Education. In \naddition, Ms. Vinci has served as a commissioner on the National Head \nStart Fellowship Commission since its inception.\n  Ms. Vinci's commitment to children and those who care for them is an \ninspiration to all who have known and worked with her. Her \ncontributions have made a difference in the lives of many and have \nbuilt a pathway for generations to come. On behalf of America's \nchildren and advocates for children, I thank her for her great work and \nwish her a rewarding retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9633-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n   I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on September \n21, 2001. In Holden, MA, a 20-year-old man stopped at a traffic light \nassaulted another driver because he thought he was of Middle Eastern \ndescent. The assailant got out of his car, pulled the driver out of his \nvan, and proceeded to attack the victim. The assailant punched and \nyelled at the victim, striking him several times before the van driver \nattempted to fight back.\n   I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9633-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BRAD BEAN\n\n Mr. BURNS.

Brad played an integral role in \ncapturing my vision of using technology to connect all sectors of our \nrural State to the ``new world'' of electronic transmission and \ncommunication which has developed since the late 1980s. My goal to \ndevelop a technology training center dedicated to distance learning, \ntelemedicine, classrooms, students and teachers and the business \ncommunity has been advanced by Brad's belief in that vision.\n  His proven leadership has drawn individuals and companies from around \nthe world to invest in the Burns' Telecommunications Center. Brad and \nhis wife, Jacqueline, have helped to promote the opportunities \navailable at the Burns' Center to people from many places in Montana \nand beyond its borders. Brad has served on the Burns' \nTelecommunications National Advisory Board and is retiring this year to \nmy regret. I personally thank Brad and acknowledge and praise his \npassion for excellence, program development and his loyalty to my \nmission for the Burns' Center. Brad has gone above and beyond the call \nof duty and I salute him for his generous support and help.\n  We are fortunate in Montana to have people like Brad and Jacqueline, \nwho are willing to give of themselves to help their community and their \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9633-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9633-S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO A PATRIOT, HARLAN MEREDITH\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Mr. \nHarland Meredith, a resident of Tuscaloosa, a Navy hero, and a leader \nin our community. Over the Independence Day holiday, a friend of mine, \nCharlie Land, read the following tribute about Mr. Meredith. I ask that \nCharlie's comments be printed in the Record in celebration of Harlan \nMeredith.\n  The material follows:\n\n       Once upon a time a young man of this church, freshly \n     graduated from the University of Alabama, faced the world and \n     pondered the future. I know that doesn't sound like a big \n     deal. New college graduates are always doing that. No doubt \n     some are right now.\n       But this was a special time. It was May of 1941. He was 20 \n     years old and war loomed uncertainly on the horizon.\n       He already had tried to get into military service through \n     the University's advanced Army or Army Air Corps ROTC \n     programs. Both had turned him down. Something always seemed \n     to be wrong when he took the required physical examinations, \n     although nothing ever showed up in his regular physicals. ``I \n     guess the Lord was just looking after me,'' he would muse \n     many years later. ``I figure He just didn't want me to be in \n     those.''\n       Within a few months, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. \n     War wasn't just on the horizon anymore.\n       He really had always wanted to serve in the U.S. Navy, \n     anyhow. He applied for a direct commission as a naval officer \n     and was accepted. He was ready to go fight for his country, \n     for freedom.\n       But the Navy sent its new ensign to Chicago to oversee the \n     hydrographic office that served the Great Lakes. It was not \n     an unimportant job and he did it well. His commanding officer \n     in Detroit was pleased. He pronounced his ensign a lucky \n     young man; he could hydrograph his way through the whole war \n     right there in Chicago. He liked Chicago okay, but that \n     wasn't at all where he wanted to be or what he wanted to do. \n     He wanted to go to sea and fight. It took a while, and he had \n     to find his own replacement, but finally he was off to San \n     Francisco to train for sea duty.\n       Now he was 21, but he was still single, his wife-to-be yet \n     unmet. And he was all steamed up to go to the South Pacific.\n       ``You know how you are at that age,'' he says.\n       He got there, although in a sort of roundabout way. His \n     first sea duty was on the seaplane tender Hulbert, a \n     converted destroyer, in the Aleutian Islands off Alaska. It \n     was no pleasure cruise. The Aleutians were hostile waters; \n     Japanese forces occupied some of the islands. There was \n     combat, although not the heavy action to be found in the \n     South Pacific. One night the Hulbert dragged anchor off a \n     point in the Aleutians, ran aground and sank.\n       He transferred to a small new escort aircraft carrier based \n     in Portland, OR. Typical of her class, the ship was named for \n     a bay. Her namesake, Kalinin Bay, was in Southeast Alaska. \n     But she would take her new gunnery officer from Tuscaloosa to \n     the South Pacific at last.\n       And there would be some action.\n       The Kalinin Bay, with her 27 aircraft and 860 crew members, \n     sailed about the South Pacific, doing her chores. A lot of \n     them involved combat. There were enemy air attacks to fend \n     off. There was the occasional torpedo to dodge. There were \n     air strikes to be made. There were invasions to support-\n     Sapan, Guam, the Southern Palaus, islands in the Leyte Gulf \n     and finally the invasion of Leyte itself as Gen. Douglas \n     MacArthur made good on his promise to return to the \n     Philippines.\n       So the Kalinin Bay was no stranger to combat as she steamed \n     some 60 miles east of the Philippine Island of Samar early on \n     the morning of October 25, 1944. She already had operated off \n     Leyte for more than a week. Her planes already had flown 244 \n     sorties, destroying enemy installations and airfields on five \n     different islands.\n       She was part of a small naval battle group nicknamed \n     ``Taffy 3.'' It included 5 other escort carriers, plus a \n     screen of 3 destroyers and 4 destroyer escorts. The carriers \n     of ``Taffy 3'' were preparing to launch their first air \n     strikes of the day when its commanding admiral learned that a \n     sizable Japanese naval force was approaching. It was 0647 \n     hours.\n       By 0658 hours, ``Taffy 3'' was under fire from part of the \n     largest Japanese surface fleet to fight since the Battle of \n     Midway, coming to keep the Americans out of the Philippines.\n       The ``Battle Off Samar'', as it would be called, was under \n     way. It would be described by historians as one of the most \n     memorable engagements in U.S. naval history.\n       The ships of ``Taffy 3'', slower, outnumbered and \n     outgunned, soon were fighting for their lives against a force \n     of four Japanese battleships, eight cruisers and 12 \n     destroyers. The Kalinin Bay took the first of 15 direct hits \n     at 0750 hours, a 14- or 16-inch shell from one of the \n     battleships. It struck one side of the hangar deck near the \n     forward elevator. A later hit penetrated the deck and \n     destroyed all of the ship's radio and radar equipment.\n       Fortunately, some of the shells went right through the ship \n     without causing significant damage. And even more \n     fortunately, there were a great many near misses. The Kalinin \n     Bay fought back hard. She launched her aircraft while under \n     fire from three cruisers. She dodged behind a timely rain \n     squall, then maneuvered behind chemical smoke. She traded \n     fire with the cruisers for a while, then shot it out with \n     Japan's Destroyer Squadron 10.\n       Her 5-inch gun stayed busy. It scored two hits on one heavy \n     cruiser and hit a Japanese destroyer amidships. And her \n     planes inflicted heavy damage, striking the enemy ships \n     with bombs, rockets and gunfire.\n       The Japanese naval vessels turned away for ``Taffy 3'' \n     after 2\\1/2\\ hours, but not before their destroyers launched \n     a torpedo attack. The torpedoes were launched from far enough \n     away to begin to slow before reaching their targets. So a \n     U.S. Avenger torpedo-\n\n[[Page S9634]]\n\n     bomber from a sister ship was able to explode two torpedoes \n     in the Kalinin Bay's wake about 100 yards astern, and the \n     ship's 5-inch gun deflected another from a collision course \n     with her stern.\n       Battered and bloody, the U.S. force sailed south, but there \n     still would be little respite for the Kalinin Bay and her \n     surviving sister ships. Little more than an hour later, at \n     1050, they cam under concentrated attack from kamikzae \n     aircraft, the suicide bombers of World War II. Four kamikazes \n     dived at the Kalinin Bay. Two of the airplanes were shot down \n     at close range. The third crashed into one side of the flight \n     deck, damaging it badly. The fourth destroyed the aft port \n     stack.\n       It was finally over by 1130 hours. The ships and planes of \n     ``Taffy 3,'' with some help from the planes of another unit, \n     ``Taffy 2'', had cleared the air of enemy planes and had \n     denied the powerful Japanese force entry into the Gulf of \n     Leyte.\n       MacArthur's beachhead was safe.\n       The price had been high. Five of ``Taffy 3's'' 13 ships had \n     been sunk--two carriers, a destroyer and two destroyer \n     escorts. Hundreds of American sailors had died. The Kalinin \n     Bay counted five dead among her 60 casualties, plus \n     considerable structural damage.\n       During the hours of intense, furious fighting, the gunnery \n     officer of the Kalinin Bay never wished he was back in that \n     office in Chicago.\n       The Kalinin Bay managed to make it to New Guinea for \n     temporary repairs. The ship was back in the States by late \n     November and he transferred off as it awaited further work. \n     Shipmates had died in several battles. He had been frightened \n     at times and his faith in God had been tested. But he had \n     come through without a scratch and with his faith stronger \n     than ever.\n       ``You realized your Christian faith was the most important \n     thing you could have,'' he would say. ``In combat I felt like \n     I was sent there for a purpose. I felt like God's hand was \n     holding me the whole time; I really did.''\n       He was ready for his next assignment.\n       It was to the Midway, a much larger aircraft carrier that \n     soon was to be commissioned at Newport News, VA. The idea was \n     for the Midway to sail around the Horn and into the Pacific, \n     where it would be a powerful additional force. By the time \n     the Midway was commissioned September 10, 1945, that \n     assignment was unnecessary. Gen. MacArthur had accepted \n     Japan's unconditional surrender on September 2 aboard the \n     Battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. The war was over.\n       The Midway would have a lasting impact on his life, though. \n     A fellow naval officer needed tickets to the commissioning \n     ceremony for house guests, and he was glad to oblige. Among \n     the guests he met the lovely young woman from Tuscaloosa who \n     would become his wife.\n       They married shortly after he got out of the Navy. Duty \n     done and a bit older, the young man who had loved his country \n     so much that he was determined to fight for it turned his \n     attention to a successful business career; helped raise two \n     beautiful daughters, and became a highly respected community \n     leader.\n       He became a stalwart of this church, a wise, practical \n     leader who has given of himself, grown and thrived on his \n     ability to seek and receive more insights. His faith has been \n     unwavering, even during the painful ordeal of one daughter's \n     untimely death.\n       People who know him will tell you he is a man of high \n     intelligence, great character, impeccable integrity, calm \n     consistency and complete credibility. They will also tell you \n     he hard-working, caring, considerate, loyal and a Southern \n     gentleman in the best sense of that definition.\n       He's a man who still greatly loves his family and his \n     hometown and the United States of America and what it stands \n     for, what he fought for.\n       A patriot.\n       A man who reminds us in his modest, unassuming way that \n     patriotism isn't some mysterious, exotic condition. It is \n     simple and fundamental and powerful. It springs from fervent \n     love for your country, love for freedom. It is in your heart \n     and spirit and actions, just like it always has been in his.\n       This sanctuary hasn't lacked for patriots and heroes to sit \n     in its pews to worship God over the decades. Many who fit \n     that description are here today, as you are most Sundays.\n       I salute you. And I salute Harlan Meredith, who story I'm \n     sure some of you recognized. I also thank him for his \n     graciousness in sharing it with me, at my request, so I could \n     share it with you today.\n       Incidentally, Harlan and Mary Anne have been married for 57 \n     years now. That's worth a salute, too. Our church, community \n     and country has been blessed to have people like Harlan, and \n     you.\n       This, too, is a special time in our country's history. \n     Again we are at war. Almost every day more of our soldiers \n     pay the ultimate price for our country, leaving saddened \n     survivors to live with the aftermath. It makes this \n     Independence Day weekend all the more meaningful. I pray it \n     also makes us all the more thankful for our blessings.\n       And the United States of America truly has been blessed \n     these 227 years, perhaps most of all with the courageous, \n     hard-working, God-loving people who have built and maintained \n     this great country of liberty and justice. People who have \n     been willing to sacrifice and fight for it, as so many \n     continue to do today. Patriots.\n       We aren't perfect as a country. But to the extent mere \n     humankind can be, the good part of the United States of \n     America is both the light and the hope of the world. May God \n     bless you; may God continue to bless America; and may we \n     never forget from Whom our blessings flow.\n       I don't think Harlan Meredith ever has.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9634-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:41 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2754.

A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada relative to payments for the detrimental \n     effects of federally held lands in Nevada; to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, An average of 52 percent of the land in 13 western \n     states is held by the Federal Government, while the Federal \n     Government holds an average of only 4.1 percent of the land \n     in the remaining 37 states; and\n       Whereas, In Nevada, approximately 87 percent of the land, \n     which amounts to approximately 61 million acres, is held by \n     the Federal Government; and\n       Whereas, In 15 of the 17 counties in Nevada, more than 50 \n     percent of the land is held by the Federal Government, and in \n     4 of the 17 counties, more than 90 percent of the land is \n     held by the Federal Government; and\n       Whereas, The management and control of such an extensive \n     amount of the land in Nevada by the Federal Government has \n     had substantial adverse effects on Nevadans; and\n       Whereas, When the Territory of Nevada was admitted to \n     statehood on October 31, 1864, the Federal Government \n     provided the newly admitted state with 2 sections of land in \n     each township for the benefit of common schools, which \n     amounted to 3.9 million acres, while other states that were \n     subsequently admitted to statehood received 4 sections of \n     land in each township for the benefit of common schools; and\n       Whereas, In 1880, it was necessary for Nevada to agree to \n     exchange its 3.9 million acres for only 2 million acres of \n     its own selection as Nevada had an immediate need for public \n     school revenues and the land originally granted by the \n     Federal Government to Nevada for common schools was not \n     providing sufficient revenue because it included many \n     undesirable sections that were on steep mountainsides or salt \n     flats, the sections of the land could not be received from \n     the Federal Government until they were surveyed and only a \n     small fraction of the land had been surveyed and sold; and\n\n[[Page S9635]]\n\n       Whereas, The disproportionately small amount of land \n     received from the Federal Government for the benefit of \n     common schools contributes only a small amount of revenue for \n     the schools in Nevada in comparison to other states, and \n     places and excessive burden on the financial resources of \n     each county in Nevada; and\n       Whereas, Because the land held by the Federal Government is \n     exempt from property taxes, the management and control of \n     such an extensive amount of land in Nevada by the Federal \n     Government has the effect of worsening the tremendous fiscal \n     burdens experienced by counties in Nevada for those counties \n     with a considerable amount of federally held land located \n     within their boundaries; and\n       Whereas, The annual impact of this property tax exemption \n     in the western states has been estimated at billions of \n     dollars, which greatly hinders the ability of those western \n     states, including Nevada, to develop and prosper \n     economically; and\n       Whereas, In 1976, Congress enacted Public Law 94-595, which \n     is codified as 31 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 6901 to 6907, inclusive, \n     and as amended, is commonly known as the Payments In Lieu of \n     Taxes Act; and\n       Whereas, The Act requires the Federal Government to make \n     annual payments to local governments to compensate the local \n     governments for the loss of revenue they experience because \n     of the presence of land within their boundaries that is held \n     by the Federal Government; and\n       Whereas, Congress appropriates money each year that the \n     Bureau of Land Management distributes to each of the 17 \n     counties in the State of Nevada pursuant to several statutory \n     formulas set forth in the Act; and\n       Whereas, The annual payments received by the counties in \n     Nevada pursuant to the Act are significantly less than the \n     annual revenue that those counties could collect from \n     property taxes if the land held by the Federal Government \n     were privately held; and\n       Whereas, From the inception of the payments in 1977 to the \n     end of the 2001-2002 Fiscal Year, the money appropriate by \n     Congress has been insufficient to provide full payment to the \n     counties in Nevada pursuant to the statutory formulas; and\n       Whereas, Even though Nevada is the state with the second \n     highest percentage of land held by the Federal Government, \n     Nevada only ranks as the eighth highest state in terms of the \n     amount of the payments it receives from the Bureau of Land \n     Management pursuant to the Act because the statutory formula \n     set forth in 31 U.S.C. Sec. 6903 is based in part on the \n     population of the local government that will be receiving the \n     payments, and 14 of the 17 counties in Nevada have \n     populations that are less than 50,000; and\n       Whereas, Another example of the adverse effects of the \n     management and control of the extensive amount of land in \n     Nevada held by the Federal Government is the management and \n     control of the Nevada Test Site, which was established in \n     December 1950, by President Truman, upon the recommendation \n     of the Atomic Energy Commission, as the location at which \n     nuclear weapons testing would be conducted within the \n     continental United States; and\n       Whereas, Approximately 5,470 square miles of federally held \n     land in Nevada was used to provide:\n       1. The Nevada Test Site, which is owned and controlled by \n     the United States Department of Energy and encompasses \n     approximately 1,350 square miles of desert and mountainous \n     terrain, an area which is larger than the State of Rhode \n     Island; and\n       2. An additional 4,120 square miles of unpopulated land \n     area surrounding the site which was withdrawn from the public \n     domain for use as a protected wildlife range and for a \n     military gunnery range; and\n       Whereas, More than 1,100 nuclear weapons tests were \n     conducted at the Nevada Test Site, located 65 miles northwest \n     of Las Vegas Nevada, before the Limited Test Ban Treaty, \n     which effectively banned atmospheric testing of nuclear \n     weapons, was signed on August 5, 1963; and\n       Whereas, While the primary mission of the Nevada Test Site \n     has been the testing of nuclear weapons, after the signing of \n     the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963 and the initiation of a \n     voluntary worldwide moratorium on nuclear weapons testing in \n     1992, the Nevada Test Site has been used for other purposes, \n     including, without limitation, hazardous chemical spill \n     testing, emergency response training, conventional weapons \n     testing, conducting studies relating to waste management and \n     environmental technology, and storing low-level waste; and\n       Whereas, In 1978, the United States Department of Energy \n     established two Radioactive Waste Management Sites at the \n     Nevada Test Site which have received approximately 21 million \n     cubic feet of low-level waste for disposal from 1978 until \n     the present, making the Nevada Test Site one of the largest \n     regional low-level waste storage facilities in the country; \n     and\n       Whereas, Because the Nevada Test Site is centrally located \n     within the Death Valley regional ground-water flow system, \n     which includes much of southern Nevada and the Death Valley \n     region of eastern California, the residents of Nevada and \n     California are subject to risks from subsurface contaminants \n     that may be transported from the Nevada Test Site by ground \n     water as a result of past and future activities conducted at \n     the Nevada Test Site; and\n       Whereas, The residents and resources of Nevada may be \n     exposed to additional risks because most of the ground water \n     leaving the ground-water flow system is limited to local \n     areas where geologic and hydrologic conditions force ground \n     water upward toward the surface to discharge at springs and \n     seeps; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 72nd Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature hereby urge Congress to:\n       1. Authorize the transfer of land in Nevada from the \n     Federal Government to the State of Nevada in the amount \n     necessary to provide Nevada with the same amount of land \n     received by the states that received 4 sections of land for \n     the benefit of common schools upon admission to statehood;\n       2. Either:\n       (a) Amend 31 U.S.C. Sec. 6906 to provide permanent funding \n     in the amount necessary to carry out the Payments In Lieu of \n     Taxes Act as set forth in 31 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 6901 to 6097, \n     inclusive; or\n       (b) Appropriate for distribution to the counties in the \n     State of Nevada a sufficient amount of money each fiscal year \n     to provide the entire amount of the payments required by the \n     statutory formulas set forth in the Payments In Lieu of Taxes \n     Act;\n       3. Amend 31 U.S.C. Sec. 6903 by deleting the current \n     population-based statutory formula and replacing it with a \n     provision that authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to \n     compensate the counties in Nevada and the local governments \n     of other states in an amount that is equal to the amount that \n     those counties and other local governments would be able to \n     collect in property taxes if the land held by the Federal \n     Government were privately held; and\n       4.

A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada relative to prescription drugs in the \n     Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, Prescription medications are vital to health care \n     today; and\n       Whereas, Medicare represents a critically important source \n     of health insurance for older residents of Nevada and for \n     residents of Nevada with certain disabilities, and the \n     coverage provided through Medicare does not provide coverage \n     for prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, Most beneficiaries of Medicare who seek coverage \n     for prescription drugs are required to obtain private or \n     public supplemental coverage to cover prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, According to the results of a study conducted by \n     the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and \n     contained in the AARP Public Policy Issue Brief #IB41, \n     consisting primarily of data collected in 1999 and based on \n     an average of the different levels of income as a percentage \n     of the federally designated level signifying poverty, \n     beneficiaries of Medicare who are 65 years of age or older \n     spent an average of approximately $2,500 per year, or 19 \n     percent of their income, on out-of-pocket health care \n     expenses; and\n       Whereas, According to the AARP study, prescription drugs \n     constitute the largest component of out-of-pocket spending on \n     health care by beneficiaries of Medicare, averaging \n     approximately 17 percent of the total out-of-pocket spending \n     on health care and accounting for more than the costs of \n     physician care, vision services and medical supplies \n     combined; and\n       Whereas, According to the study, the total spending on \n     prescription drugs in the United States grew by approximately \n     13 percent per year between 1993 and 2000 and is expected to \n     grow by approximately 12 percent per year through 2011; and\n       Whereas, According to the study, beneficiaries of Medicare \n     made up approximately 15 percent of the population in 1999, \n     but accounted for approximately 40 percent of the total \n     spending on prescription drugs in the United states; and\n       Whereas, According to the study, beneficiaries of Medicare \n     with supplemental coverage for prescription drugs are at risk \n     of losing such coverage, as evidenced by a decrease of \n     coverage of prescription drugs offered by certain employers \n     from 31 percent in 1997 to 24 percent in 2001 and a decrease \n     of coverage offered under certain Medicare plans for \n     prescription drugs from 65 percent in 1999 to 50 percent in \n     2002; and\n       Whereas, Many older or disabled residents of Nevada who \n     receive Medicare benefits cannot afford supplemental coverage \n     for prescription drugs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 72nd Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature urge Congress to provide a comprehensive \n     universal plan for the uniform coverage of prescription drugs \n     within the Medicare program that will provide beneficiaries \n     of Medicare with stable access to prescription drugs on a \n     voluntary basis, without extraordinary out-of-pocket costs \n     and without unreasonable premiums, deductibles or copayments; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the program of prescription drug coverage \n     for Medicare beneficiaries should have no requirement \n     relating to the use of state funds now used for existing \n     State programs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, that this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-225. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to tariff rate quotas for the importation of dry \n     milk protein concentrates; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, The dairy industry has been significantly impacted \n     in recent years by the rising use of dry milk protein \n     concentrates (MPCs). The technology that makes possible the \n     ultrafiltration process that separates proteins and the other \n     components of milk was not fully developed when the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was finalized in 1994. \n     As a result, there are almost no restrictions on the \n     importation of MPCs. This is causing serious damage to the \n     domestic dairy industry; and\n       Whereas, According to the General Accounting Office report \n     on dairy products, the volume of MPC imports grew from 805 \n     metric tons in 1990 to 44,878 in 1999. The quotas set under \n     GATT in 1994 are clearly not comprehensive enough for the \n     forms in which some dairy products are imported today. \n     Foreign exporters are known to blend dairy proteins for the \n     purpose of circumventing existing tariff rate quotas; and\n       Whereas, In the 108th Congress, legislation has been \n     introduced to establish tariff rate quotas for MPCs. With the \n     enactment of legislation to close this loophole, American \n     agriculture will be able to complete on a more equal basis. \n     The overall benefits, to our national economy and the \n     domestic dairy industry, will strengthen a vitally important \n     industry and restore the stability of the marketplace; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resoloved by the house of representatives (the senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to enact legislation to provide for tariff rate quotas \n     for dry milk protein concentrates that are equivalent to the \n     import quotas currently in place on other dairy products; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-226.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to restoring proposed cuts to the 21st Century \n     Community Learning Centers Program; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 55\n\n       Whereas, The proposed federal budget includes a $400 \n     million cut in the 21st Century Community Learning Centers \n     program for after-school programs; and\n       Whereas, The proposed cut undermines the goals of the ``No \n     Child Left Behind'' Act to help children succeed academically \n     and enhance their reading and writing skills; and\n       Whereas, The proposed cut would directly affect programming \n     for over 20,000 high-risk youth in Michigan, through an \n     estimated $15,688,256 loss of funding; and\n       Whereas, Many research studies indicate that children who \n     consistently attend after-school programs have better peer \n     relations, emotional adjustment, conflict resolution skills, \n     grades, and conduct compared to those children not involved \n     in programs; and\n       Whereas, Juvenile crime soars in the hours immediately \n     after the bell rings, and after-school programs prevent \n     juvenile delinquency and victimization of youth; and\n       Whereas, 21st Century Community Learning Centers actively \n     engage parents as partners in their children's education and \n     seek to strengthen the bonds between home and school; and\n       Whereas, 21st Century Community Learning Centers in \n     Michigan are successful in reducing school absenteeism, \n     improving reading scores, and providing a safe place for \n     children during peak juvenile crime hours; and\n       Whereas, 21st Century Community Learning Centers align \n     their curriculum with the school day curriculum through fun \n     and experimental learning activities; and\n       Whereas, The state of Michigan has begun the implementation \n     of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers and sees these \n     centers as one of the best sustainable means to offer quality \n     after-school programs to the greatest number of high-risk \n     youth in the state; and\n       Whereas, On April 10, 2003, the Michigan House of \n     Representatives, knowing the value of after-school programs, \n     passed House Resolution 26, on the ``Michigan After-School \n     Initiative,'' to call for the creation of a task force to \n     assess the status of after-school programming in Michigan and \n     to develop a plan to ensure access to after-school programs \n     for every school-age child in Michigan; and\n       Whereas, 21st Century Community Learning Centers promote an \n     active level of community partnership and collaboration among \n     providers to best serve children; and\n       Whereas, Polls show that 92% of Americans believe there \n     should be organized activities for children and teens during \n     after-school hours: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives; That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to restore the \n     proposed $400 million cut to the 21st Century Community \n     Learning Centers program; and be it further\n\n[[Page S9638]]\n\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n     Adopted by the House of Representatives, July 1, 2003.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-231. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to partial birth abortions; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 68\n\n       Whereas, partial birth abortion shall mean an abortion in \n     which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally \n     delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and \n     completing the delivery; and\n       Whereas, in a partial birth abortion, the physician pulls \n     the baby out of the womb and into the birth canal, leaving \n     the head lodged just inside the cervix; and\n       Whereas, the physician then punctures the base of the skull \n     and inserts a catheter into the wound, removing the baby's \n     brain and causing the skull to collapse; the physician then \n     completes the delivery of the now-dead baby; and\n       Whereas, although partial birth abortions are usually \n     performed in the fifth and sixth months of gestation, the \n     procedure has been used in the third trimester of pregnancy; \n     and\n       Whereas, experts agree that with current medical \n     technology, a normal fetus in the twenty-first week of \n     gestation is capable of sustaining life outside the womb; and\n       Whereas, under both federal and most state laws, a live \n     birth occurs when a baby is entirely expelled from the womb, \n     shows any signs of life, and is developed enough to be \n     sustained outside the womb with neonatal medical assistance; \n     and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that three thousand to five \n     thousand partial birth abortions are performed annually, \n     sometimes in the seventh month or later; and\n       Whereas, although the procedure is sometimes performed in \n     cases of fetal disorders or maternal distress, many partial \n     birth abortions are performed on healthy babies of healthy \n     mothers: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana Legislature does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to vote to ban partial \n     birth abortions; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the residing officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-232. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to the Federal Prison Industries; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 37\n\n       Whereas, In 1934, Federal Prison Industries (FPI) was \n     created as a government corporation. This system operates \n     more than 100 factories, utilizes more than 20,000 inmate \n     workers, and compiles total sales of approximately $500 \n     million annually from over 150 products; and\n       Whereas, While the role that FPI plays in promoting the \n     development of marketable skills among inmates has clear \n     merits, this operation enjoys unfair advantages over private \n     sector manufacturers. Even beyond the obvious wages and \n     benefits advantages inmate workers offer, other factors favor \n     FPI. This is especially true through certain governmental \n     procurement policies, including a ``mandatory source'' \n     requirement that severely limits competition; and\n       Whereas, Michigan is harmed significantly by the advantages \n     FPI has over private manufacturers, especially within the \n     furniture industry. Thousands of Michigan workers have lost \n     their jobs in recent years, and the favorable policies for \n     FPI are major contributing factors in these job losses; and\n       Whereas, In the past, legislation has been considered in \n     Congress to address directly the issue of the preferential \n     treatment afforded FPI in bidding for government contracts. \n     This unfair situation needs to be corrected to preserve jobs \n     and the restore fairness in the marketplace; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation that would remove the unfair advantages that \n     Federal Prison Industries has in competition for business; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-233. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to the ratification of an amendment to the \n     Constitution to prohibit desecration of the American flag; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 80\n\n       Whereas, Throughout our history, the American flag has held \n     a unique place of respect and affection among our people. \n     This symbol of our shared ideals and aspirations has taken on \n     even greater meaning in the wake of the September 11, 2001, \n     attacks and through our growing appreciation of the suffering \n     of the men and women who have made immeasurable sacrifices to \n     preserve our liberties; and\n       Whereas, In recent years, there has been considerable \n     debate over the idea of extending constitutional protection \n     to the flag. The people of our country strongly support \n     establishing special protections for our national symbol. \n     Extending this status to our most cherished symbol would only \n     accord due recognition to a unique component of our national \n     identity; and\n       Whereas, Debate on the issue of creating a constitutional \n     amendment to prohibit desecration of our flag often centers \n     on what constitutes freedom of expression and free speech. In \n     this discussion, it is important to realize that a \n     prohibition on flag desecration would not eliminate or \n     restrict other avenues of expression or protest. Thoughtful \n     citizens do not equate providing protection for the flag with \n     the removal of freedom of speech any more than laws generally \n     provide acceptable limits of behavior for the common good; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to adopt and \n     submit to the states for ratification an amendment to the \n     United States Constitution to prohibit the desecration of the \n     American flag; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/21/senate-section/article/S9638-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Ms. COLLINS, from the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 481.

A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to establish a \nprogram to provide assistance to small communities for use in carrying \nout projects and activities necessary to achieve or maintain compliance \nwith drinking water standards; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to talk about two things: One is \nstrictly domestic and another is international.\n  First, I am introducing a bill today in behalf of myself, Senator \nHagel, and Senator Bingaman.\n  I will start this discussion with a chart. The dark brown on this map \nare counties in these United States--you will note that they are \npredominantly in the West--with arsenic concentrations exceeding 10 \nparts per billion or more in the water sampling. The little bit lighter \nones are counties with 5 parts per billion. The little bit lighter ones \nare counties with 3 parts per billion. And, the very light ones are \ncounties with fewer than 10 parts per billion.\n  Arsenic is a very prevalent compound or chemical in the United \nStates. Communities in the State of New Mexico and throughout the \ncountry are going to face, very soon, a very costly situation not of \ntheir own making. Beginning in the year 2000, Federal drinking water \nregulations established by the Environmental Protection Agency will \nrequire substantial reductions in the amount of arsenic present in \nwater.\n  Today, the limit is 50 parts per billion. In 2006, it will become 10 \nparts per billion.\n  When I was referring a while ago to these colorations, this dark \nbrown is parts per billion. Today the limit is 50. In 2006, it will \nbecome 10 parts per billion. Arsenic is indeed poisonous if used in \nlarge amounts. It is naturally occurring, however, in much of the \nground water throughout the Nation.\n  That means there have been people living for as long as they have \nlived in areas that have naturally occurring arsenic in the ground \nwater. Believe it or not, fellow citizens, they have been drinking that \nwater.\n  What is so strange about it is that we don't have any evidence it has \nbeen killing them. We don't have any evidence it has been hurting \nthem. But actually there are scientific tests on which the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency relied, I regret to tell you, that, in \nthis Senator's opinion, are very meager in terms of their strength, and \nthey predominate in foreign countries. However, the law has been \ninterpreted to say that, in 2006, drinking water systems will be down \nto 10 parts per billion or they will be in violation of this Federal \nlaw.\n\n  In my home city of Albuquerque, which is shown on this second map I \nhave put up--there is Albuquerque; you see there is the very dark \nbrown--there are around 13 parts per billion. This illustrates the \nproblem the new standard\n\n[[Page S9640]]\n\nwill create. This bill recognizes that in some parts of the United \nStates, and of my State, the burden will become so great that some \ncommunities just will not be able to bear it. They have to go through--\nat least today--a whole new cleanup system for their domestic water. \nWhatever they have been doing, they must do it all another way.\n  Although our scientists are busy at work, No. 1, trying to figure an \neasier way to clean it up, we are also having some of them busy at work \ntrying to offer us more evidence that it is not dangerous to have \nAlbuquerquians drink the water that must be cleaned up and water in \nwater systems in many other parts of my State and in other parts of \nAmerica.\n  But this bill goes on to say that small communities may not have the \nresources to meet these standards and may need help, and it creates a \ngrant program for the small communities to help them upgrade these \nsystems and ensures them that not less than 20 percent of the grant \nmoneys go to communities with fewer than 50,000 residents. And the bill \nauthorizes appropriations of $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2004 and for \neach year through 2009.\n  In New Mexico, the geology, the make up of the rocks and dirt, \nresults in relatively high levels of arsenic in the groundwater. \nHowever, over time, New Mexico residents have not experienced higher \nlevels of diseases associated with arsenic. Be that as it may, many \nsmall communities throughout New Mexico and the west will not be able \nto meet the financial burden. Because of this, I believe it is \nimportant to aid communities in meeting the coming standards. The \nfinancial burden facing many communities and individuals is great.\n  The new standards could cost New Mexico communities between $370 to \n$440 million to improve treatment systems, plus $18 million a year in \noperating costs.\n  Albuquerque, alone, is looking at having to spend $150 million to \ncome into compliance. Its sister city, right across the river, Rio \nRancho--our second largest city--is facing $60 million in improvements. \nAnd many individuals in small communities throughout the West are \nfacing increases in their water bills of $50 to $90 a month just to pay \nfor the cleanup. Most people cannot afford such an increase.\n  This legislation will help these communities in upgrading their \nsystems and training their people. We are forcing communities to comply \nwith drinking water standards that many believe will not increase \npublic health. The least we can do is help them meet the burden.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to the printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1432\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Drinking Water \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) drinking water standards proposed and in effect as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act will place a large \n     financial burden on many public water systems, especially \n     those public water systems in rural communities serving small \n     populations;\n       (2) the limited scientific, technical, and professional \n     resources available in small communities complicate the \n     implementation of regulatory requirements;\n       (3) small communities often cannot afford to meet water \n     quality standards because of the expenses associated with \n     upgrading public water systems and training personnel to \n     operate and maintain the public water systems;\n       (4) small communities do not have a tax base for dealing \n     with the costs of upgrading their public water systems;\n       (5) small communities face high per capita costs in \n     improving drinking water quality;\n       (6) small communities would greatly benefit from a grant \n     program designed to provide funding for water quality \n     projects;\n       (7) as of the date of enactment of this Act, there is no \n     Federal program in effect that adequately meets the needs of \n     small, primarily rural communities with respect to public \n     water systems; and\n       (8) since new, more protective arsenic drinking water \n     standards proposed by the Clinton and Bush administrations, \n     respectively, are expected to be implemented in 2006, the \n     grant program established by the amendment made by this Act \n     should be implemented in a manner that ensures that the \n     implementation of those new standards is not delayed.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nassistance in implementing cultural heritage, conservation, and \nrecreational activities in the Connecticut River watershed of the \nStates of New Hampshire and Vermont; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Upper \nConnecticut River Partnership Act that will help bring recognition to \nNew England's largest river ecosystem and help the communities along \nthe river protect and enhance their natural, cultural and recreational \nresources. I am pleased to add Senators Jeffords and Gregg as original \ncosponsors of this bill.\n  For years, our offices and our States have worked together to help \ncommunities on both sides of the river develop local partnerships to \nprotect the Connecticut River valley of Vermont and New Hampshire. This \nvalley is a scenic region of historic villages located in a working \nlandscape of farms and forests.\n  Citizens on both sides of the river know just how special this region \nis and have worked side by side for years to protect it. The two States \ncame together to create the Connecticut River Joint Commissions, which \nhelp coordinate the efforts of towns, watersheds and other local groups \nto implement the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan. This Plan \nhas become the blueprint for how communities along the river can work \ntogether, with the States of Vermont and New Hampshire and with the \nFederal Government to protect the river's resources.\n  The Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act would help carry out the \nrecommendations of the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan and \nhelp communities along the river protect their cultural, natural and \nrecreational resources. This Act would provide the Secretary of \nInterior with the ability to assist the States of New Hampshire and \nVermont with technical and financial aid for the Upper Connecticut \nRiver through the Connecticut River Joint Commissions. The people \nliving in the Upper Connecticut Watershed region would be able to learn \nabout the river and be given knowledge on how to protect it. Also, the \nAct would assist local community efforts to continue cultural heritage \noutreach and education programs while enriching the recreational \nactivities already active in the Connecticut River Watersheds of \nVermont and New Hampshire.\n  The bill also will require that the Secretary of Interior establish a \nConnecticut River Grants and Technical Assistance Program to help local \ncommunity groups develop new projects and build on existing ones to \nenhance the river basin. Over the next few years, I hope this bill will \nhelp bring new recognition to the Connecticut River as one of our \nNation's great water resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. \n        Daschle, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1436. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for State and local sales taxes in lieu of State and local \nincome taxes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, when Congress enacted \nthe Tax Reform Act of 1986, it was heralded for its simplicity, \nefficiency and fairness. Yet the legislation was not fair to states \nsuch as Florida that choose not to finance the government through the \nimposition of an income tax. Residents from these States are forced to \npay a higher Federal income tax liability than comparable citizens of \nother States. This results from the 1986 Act's elimination of the \nFederal income tax deduction for State sales taxes.\n  Today, Senators Nelson of Florida, Daschle, Johnson and I are \nintroducing the Sales Tax Equity act to remedy this inequity and lift \nour constituents from second-class status. The bill allows taxpayers to \nelect a deduct State and local sales taxes in lieu of a deduction for \nState and local income taxes. Although the election is available to \nresidents of all States, the practical effect of the bill is to make \nthe deduction for State taxes available to residents of States with no \nState income tax. Residents from these States should not be forced to \npay higher Federal tax bills simply because their State government's \nfunding does not derive from an income tax.\n  To avoid burdensome record-keeping requirements, the deduction for \nState and local sales taxes would be determined by tables produced by \nTreasury. Those tables will take into consideration the sales tax rates \nin the various States and average consumption.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the cost of restoring this \nfairness to the citizens of non-income tax States at $26 billion over \nten years. Under most circumstances it should not be incumbent upon \nthose of us who are trying to restore equity in our Federal tax laws to \nfind offsets for this cost. The problem we face, however, is that last \nweek the Office of Management and Budget announced that the deficit for \nthis year would be 455 billion dollars--165 billion dollars greater \nthan the previous record deficit. The fiscal hole in which we now find \nourselves--primarily as a result of the fiscal mismanagement of the \nBush Administration--places an extra burden on us. The responsible \napproach to fixing this problem, therefore, requires us to put together \na proposal that will not exacerbate the deficit. Fortunately, offsets \nexist that will fully offset the cost of the restored sales tax \ndeduction and improve the Nation's tax laws by making it tougher for \ntaxpayers to avoid paying their fair share.\n\n[[Page S9642]]\n\n  In his last report to the IRS Oversight Board, former Commissioner \nRossotti identified corporate tax shelters as one of the top problems \nfacing the IRS. To combat this growing problem, the bill includes \nmeasures to crack down on the proliferation of tax shelters. The \npurpose of these provisions is to reinforce the Treasury department's \nadministrative enforcement regime. A key element of the Service's \nenforcement regime is their ability to detect potentially abusive \ntransactions. Thus, the bill promotes disclosure of such transactions \nthrough a framework of increased penalties and limited defenses in the \nevent of nondisclosure.\n\n  The legislation also clarifies the judicially created doctrine of \neconomic substance and imposes a new 40 percent strict-liability \npenalty for those transactions that fail this new requirement. \nClarification of the economic substance doctrine requires that the \ntaxpayer establish that (1) The transaction changes in a meaningful \nway, apart from the Federal income tax consequences, the taxpayer's \neconomic position, (2) the taxpayer has a substantial non-tax purpose \nof entering into the transaction, and (3) the transaction is a \nreasonable means of accomplishing such non-tax purpose.\n  In addition to cracking down on potentially abusive transactions, our \nbill will shut down known abusive transactions. Last year, at the \nrequest of the Chairman and Ranking Members of the Senate Committee on \nFinance, the Joint Committee on Taxation investigated Enron's tax \nreturns. One of the areas on which the Joint Committee focused was the \ntax shelter arrangements, offshore entities, and special purposes \nentities that Enron used to reduce its tax liability. The Joint \nCommittee issued its report on this investigation on February 13, 2003 \nand included recommendations for shutting down some of the tax shelters \nused by the company. This legislation includes those recommendations.\n  The legislation also eliminates incentives in our tax code that \nencourage individuals and corporations to renounce their U.S. \ncitizenship to avoid paying U.S. tax. For individuals, the legislation \ngenerally subjects U.S. citizens who relinquish their U.S. citizenship \nand certain long-term U.S. residents who terminate their U.S. residence \nto tax on the net unrealized gain in their property as if such property \nwere sold at fair market value on the day before the expatriation or \nresidency termination. Only a gain in excess of $600,000, $1.2 million \nfor a married couple, is subject to tax.\n  The legislation also establishes new rules to thwart efforts by some \nU.S. corporations to reincorporate in a foreign country in order to \navoid paying U.S. tax. These proposals are identical to legislation \npassed previously by the Senate.\n  There is one additional, and crucial, benefit of our legislation. It \nwill not slow down the current conference negotiations on legislations \nextending the child credit expansion to low-income families. As my \ncolleagues know, legislation resolving this matter has passed both the \nHouse and Senate and the differences between the two bills must be \nreconciled. It is important for that legislation to get resolved as \nsoon as possible so that the IRS has ample time to send checks out to \nthese families this summer. Some have suggested that resolution of the \nsales tax issue--a matter not included in either the House or Senate \nbill--be attached to the child credit bill. I fear that such an attempt \nwould further complicate resolution of that important legislation.\n  I hope our colleagues will look upon this legislation in the spirit \nwith which it is offered. It is fundamentally unfair that for the past \nseventeen years the residents of our States have faced higher Federal \nincome tax liabilities than their fellow citizens living in other \nStates.

Designation of America's National World War II \n     Museum. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National D-Day Museum, operated in New Orleans, \n     Louisiana by an educational foundation, has been established \n     with the vision ``to celebrate the American Spirit''.\n       (2) The National D-Day Museum is the only museum in the \n     United States that exists for the exclusive purpose of \n     interpreting the American experience during the World War II \n     years (1939-1945) on both the battlefront and the home front \n     and, in doing so, covers all of the branches of the Armed \n     Forces and the Merchant Marine.\n       (3) The National D-Day Museum was founded by the preeminent \n     American historian, Stephen E. Ambrose, as a result of a \n     conversation with President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1963, \n     when the President and former Supreme Commander, Allied \n     Expeditionary Forces in Europe, credited Andrew Jackson \n     Higgins, the chief executive officer of Higgins Industries in \n     New Orleans, as the ``man who won the war for us'' because \n     the 12,000 landing craft designed by Higgins Industries made \n     possible all of the amphibious invasions of World War II and \n     carried American soldiers into every theatre of the war.\n       (4) The National D-Day Museum, since its grand opening on \n     June 6, 2000, the 56th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of \n     Normandy, has attracted nearly 1,000,000 visitors from around \n     the world, 85 percent of whom have been Americans from across \n     the country.\n       (5) American World War II veterans, called the ``greatest \n     generation'' of the Nation, are dying at the rapid rate of \n     more than 1,200 veterans each day, creating an urgent need to \n     preserve the stories, artifacts, and heroic achievements of \n     that generation.\n       (6) The United States has a need to preserve forever the \n     knowledge and history of the Nation's most decisive \n     achievement in the 20th century and to portray that history \n     to citizens, visitors, and school children for centuries to \n     come.\n       (7) Congress, recognizing the need to preserve this \n     knowledge and history, appropriated funds in 1992 to \n     authorize the design and construction of The National D-Day \n     Museum in New Orleans to commemorate the epic 1944 Normandy \n     invasion, and subsequently appropriated additional funds in \n     1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 to help expand the exhibits \n     in the museum to include the D-Day invasions in the Pacific \n     Theatre of Operations and the other campaigns of World War \n     II.\n       (8) The State of Louisiana and thousands of donors and \n     foundations across the country have contributed millions of \n     dollars to help build this national institution.\n       (9) The Board of Trustees of The National D-Day Museum is \n     national in scope and diverse in its makeup.\n       (10) The World War II Memorial now under construction on \n     the National Mall in Washington, the District of Columbia, \n     will always be the memorial in our Nation where people come \n     to remember America's sacrifices in World War II, while The \n     National D-Day Museum will always be the museum of the \n     American experience in the World War II years (1939-1945), \n     where people come to learn about Americans' experiences \n     during that critical period, as well as a place where the \n     history of our Nation's monumental struggle against worldwide \n     aggression by would-be oppressors is preserved so that future \n     generations can understand the role the United States played \n     in the preservation and advancement of democracy and freedom \n     in the middle of the 20th century.\n       (11) The National D-Day Museum seeks to educate a diverse \n     group of audiences through its collection of artifacts, \n     photographs, letters, documents, and first-hand personal \n     accounts of the participants in the war and on the home front \n     during one of history's darkest hours.\n       (12) The National D-Day Museum is devoted to the combat \n     experience of United States citizen soldiers in all of the \n     theatres of World War II and to the heroic efforts of the men \n     and women on the home front who worked tirelessly to support \n     the troops and the war effort.\n       (13) The National D-Day Museum continues to add to and \n     maintain one of the largest personal history collections in \n     the United States of the men and women who fought in World \n     War II and who served on the home front.\n       (14) No other museum describes as well the volunteer spirit \n     that arose throughout the United States and united the \n     country during the World War II years.\n       (15) The National D-Day Museum is engaged in a 250,000 \n     square foot expansion to include the Center for the Study of \n     the American Spirit, an advanced format theatre, and a new \n     United States pavilion.\n       (16) The planned ``We're All in this Together'' exhibit \n     will describe the role every State, commonwealth, and \n     territory played in World War II, and the computer database \n     and software of The National D-Day Museum's educational \n     program will be made available to the teachers and school \n     children of every State, commonwealth, and territory.\n       (17) The National D-Day Museum is an official Smithsonian \n     affiliate institution with a formal agreement to borrow \n     Smithsonian artifacts for future exhibitions.\n       (18) Le Memorial de Caen in Normandy, France has formally \n     recognized The National D-Day Museum as its official partner \n     in a Patriotic Alliance signed on October 16, 2002, by both \n     museums.\n       (19) The official Battle of the Bulge museums in Luxembourg \n     and the American Battlefield Monuments Commission are already \n     collaborating with The National D-Day Museum on World War II \n     exhibitions.\n       (20) For all of these reasons, it is appropriate to \n     designate The National D-Day Museum as ``America's National \n     World War II Museum''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are, through \n     the designation of The National D-Day Museum as ``America's \n     National World War II Museum'', to express the United States \n     Government's support for--\n       (1) the continuing preservation, maintenance, and \n     interpretation of the artifacts, documents, images, and \n     history collected by the museum;\n       (2) the education of the American people as to the American \n     experience in combat and on the home front during the World \n     War II years, including the conduct of educational outreach \n     programs for teachers and students throughout the United \n     States;\n       (3) the operation of a premier facility for the public \n     display of artifacts, photographs, letters, documents, and \n     personal histories from the World War II years (1939-1945);\n       (4) the further expansion of the current European and \n     Pacific campaign exhibits in the museum, including the Center \n     for the Study of the American Spirit for education; and\n       (5) ensuring the understanding by all future generations of \n     the magnitude of the American contribution to the Allied \n     victory in World War II, the sacrifices made to preserve \n     freedom and democracy, and the benefits of peace for all \n     future generations in the 21st century and beyond.\n       (c) Designation of ``America's National World War II \n     Museum''.--The National D-Day Museum, New Orleans, Louisiana, \n     is designated as ``America's National World War II Museum''.\n       Sec. 8118.

In Recognition of the National Guard and \n     Reserve's Contributions to Our National Security and \n     Expressing Strong Support for the Senate's Previous \n     Bipartisan Vote To Provide These Forces Access to TRICARE. \n     (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forces in the United States National Guard and Reserve \n     have made and continue to make essential and effective \n     contributions to Operation Iraqi Freedom and other ongoing \n     military operations.\n       (2) More than 200,000 Reserve personnel from the Army, \n     Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard are currently \n     serving their Nation on active status.\n       (3) Our dependence on the National Guard and Reserve has \n     increased dramatically over the course of the past decade. \n     Annual duty days have grown from about 1 million in the late \n     1980s to more than 12 million in every year since 1996.\n       (4) While our dependence on the Reserves has increased in \n     the post-Cold War era, their basic pay and benefits structure \n     has remained largely unchanged.\n       (5) Offering TRICARE to reservists for an affordable \n     monthly premium enhances our national security by improving \n     their medical readiness when called to duty, streamlining and \n     accelerating the mobilization process, and enhancing our \n     military's ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel \n     to reserve duty.\n       (6) The Congressional Budget Office, the official, \n     nonpartisan scorekeeper of all congressional legislation, has \n     estimated the cost of this proposal at just over one-tenth of \n     one percent of the Administration's fiscal year 2004 defense \n     budget request.\n       (7) On May 20, 2003, a strong majority of Senate Democrats \n     and Republicans joined together and voted 85-10 for an \n     amendment to the fiscal year 2004 Defense authorization bill \n     to provide\n\n[[Page S9657]]\n\n     reserve personnel and their families access to TRICARE \n     regardless of their current deployment status.\n       (8) The Appropriations Committee indicated in its report \n     accompanying the fiscal year 2004 Defense appropriations bill \n     that it supports this proposal.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the National Guard and Reserve play a critical and \n     increasingly demanding role in protecting our national \n     security; and\n       (2) the Senate supports the Appropriations Committee \n     position as articulated in the report accompanying the fiscal \n     year 2004 Defense appropriations bill and affirms its support \n     for providing Guard and Reserve personnel access to TRICARE.\n       Sec. 8143. (a) The Secretary of Defense--\n       (1) shall review--\n       (A) all contractual offset arrangements to which the policy \n     established under section 2532 of title 10, United States \n     Code, applies that are in effect on the date of the enactment \n     of this Act;\n       (B) any memoranda of understanding and related agreements \n     to which the limitation in section 2531(c) of such title \n     applies that have been entered into with a country with \n     respect to which such contractual offset arrangements have \n     been entered into and are in effect on such date; and\n       (C) any waivers granted with respect to a foreign country \n     under section 2534(d)(3) of title 10, United States Code, \n     that are in effect on such date; and\n       (2) shall determine the effects of the use of such \n     arrangements, memoranda of understanding, and agreements on \n     the effectiveness of buy American requirements provided in \n     law.\n       (b) The Secretary shall submit a report on the results of \n     the review under subsection (a) to Congress not later than \n     March 1, 2005. The report shall include a discussion of each \n     of the following:\n       (1) The effects of the contractual offset arrangements on \n     specific subsectors of the industrial base of the United \n     States and what actions have been taken to prevent or \n     ameliorate any serious adverse effects on such subsectors.\n       (2) The extent, if any, to which the contractual offset \n     arrangements and memoranda of understanding and related \n     agreements have provided for technology transfer that would \n     significantly and adversely affect the defense industrial \n     base of the United States and would result in substantial \n     financial loss to a United States firm.\n       (3) The extent to which the use of such contractual offset \n     arrangements is consistent with--\n       (A) the limitation in section 2531(c) of title 10, United \n     States Code, that prohibits implementation of a memorandum of \n     understanding and related agreements if the President, taking \n     into consideration the results of the interagency review, \n     determines that such memorandum of understanding or related \n     agreement has or is likely to have a significant adverse \n     effect on United States industry that outweighs the benefits \n     of entering into or implementing such memorandum or \n     agreement; and\n       (B) the requirements under section 2534(d) of such title \n     that--\n       (i) a waiver granted under such section not impede \n     cooperative programs entered into between the Department of \n     Defense and a foreign country and not impede the reciprocal \n     procurement of defense items that is entered into in \n     accordance with section 2531 of such title; and\n       (ii) the country with respect to which the waiver is \n     granted not discriminate against defense items produced in \n     the United States to a greater degree than the United States \n     discriminates against defense items produced in that country.\n       (c) The Secretary--\n       (1) shall submit to the President any recommendations \n     regarding the use or administration of contractual offset \n     arrangements and memoranda of understanding and related \n     agreements referred to in subsection (a) that the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to strengthen the administration buy \n     American requirements in law; and\n       (2) may modify memoranda of understanding or related \n     agreements entered into under section 2531 of title 10, \n     United States Code, or take other action with regard to such \n     memoranda or related agreements, as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate to strengthen the administration buy American \n     requirements in law in the case of procurements covered by \n     such memoranda or related agreements.\n       Sec. 8144. It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any request for funds for a fiscal year for an ongoing \n     overseas military operation, including operations in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq, should be included in the annual budget \n     of the President for such fiscal year as submitted to \n     Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States \n     Code; and\n       (2) any funds provided for such fiscal year for such a \n     military operation should be provided in appropriations Acts \n     for such fiscal year through appropriations to specific \n     accounts set forth in such Acts.\n       Sec. 8145.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) If a terrorist group were to acquire the necessary \n     fissile material for a nuclear explosive device, it would not \n     be difficult for the group to construct such a device, the \n     explosion of which could kill and injure thousands, or even \n     hundreds of thousands, of people and destroy a large area of \n     a city.\n       (2) If a terrorist group were to acquire a complete nuclear \n     weapon from a nation which has constructed nuclear weapons, \n     it is likely that the group would be able to detonate the \n     device with similar results.\n       (3) A nation supplying either complete nuclear weapons or \n     special nuclear material to terrorists might believe that it \n     could escape retaliation by the United States, as the United \n     States would not be able to determine the origin of either a \n     weapon or its fissile material.\n       (4) It is possible, however, to determine the country of \n     origin of fissile material after a nuclear explosion, \n     provided that samples of the radioactive debris from the \n     explosion are collected promptly and analyzed in appropriate \n     laboratories.\n       (5) If radioactive debris is collected soon enough after a \n     nuclear explosion, it is also possible to determine the \n     characteristics of the nuclear explosive device involved, \n     which information can assist in locating and dismantling \n     other nuclear devices that may threaten the United States.\n       (6) If countries that might contemplate supplying nuclear \n     weapons or fissile material to terrorists know that their \n     assistance can be traced, they are much less likely to allow \n     terrorists access to either weapons or material.\n       (7) It is in the interest of the United States to acquire a \n     capability to collect promptly the debris from a nuclear \n     explosion that might occur in any part of the Nation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate on Nuclear Debris Collection and \n     Analysis Capability.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense should develop and deploy a \n     nuclear debris collection and analysis capability sufficient \n     to enable characterization of any nuclear device that might \n     be exploded in the United States;\n       (2) the capability should incorporate airborne debris \n     collectors, either permanently installed on dedicated \n     aircraft or available for immediate use on a class of \n     aircraft, stationed so that a properly equipped and manned \n     aircraft is available to collect debris from a nuclear \n     explosion anywhere in the United States and transport such \n     debris to an appropriate laboratory in a timely fashion; and\n       (3) to the maximum extent practicable, the capability \n     should be compatible with collection and analysis systems \n     used by the United States to characterize overseas nuclear \n     explosions.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than March 31, 2004, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on the feasibility of developing and \n     deploying the capability described in subsection (b)(1).\n       Sec. 8166. Of the amount appropriated by title II of this \n     Act under the heading ``Operation and Maintenance, Army'' up \n     to $15,000,000 may be made available for upgrades of M1A1 \n     Abrams tank transmissions.\n       Sec. 8167. Of the total amount appropriated by title II of \n     this Act under the heading ``Operations and Maintenance, \n     Army'', up to $2,000,000 may be used to promote civil rights \n     education and history in the Army.\n       Sec. 8168.

The report shall detail--\n       (1) the process and standards for designing and awarding \n     such contracts, including assistance or consulting services \n     provided by contractors in that process;\n       (2) the process and standards for awarding limited or sole-\n     source contracts, including the criteria for justifying the \n     awarding of such contracts;\n       (3) any policies that the Secretary has implemented or \n     plans to implement to provide for independent oversight of \n     the performance by a contractor of services in designing and \n     awarding such contracts;\n       (4) any policies that the Secretary has implemented or \n     plans to implement to identify, assess, and prevent any \n     conflict of interest relating to such contracts for \n     reconstruction;\n       (5) any policies that the Secretary has implemented or \n     plans to implement to ensure public accountability of \n     contractors and to identify any fraud, waste, or abuse \n     relating to such contracts for reconstruction;\n       (6) the process and criteria used to determine the \n     percentage of profit allowed on cost-plus-a-fixed-fee \n     contracts for reconstruction or other services in Iraq; and\n       (7) a good faith estimate of the expected costs and \n     duration of all contracts for reconstruction or other \n     services in Iraq.\n       Sec. 8170. Of the amount appropriated by title III of this \n     Act under the heading ``Aircraft Procurement, Air Force'', up \n     to $19,700,000 may be available for C-5 aircraft in-service \n     modifications for the procurement of additional C-5 aircraft \n     Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) kits.\n       Sec. 8171.

Requirement that accreditation organizations adopt \n              accreditation standards.\nSec. 10. Definitions.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) 2,100,146 persons were incarcerated in the United \n     States at the end of 2001: 1,324,465 in Federal and State \n     prisons and 631,240 in county and local jails. In 1999, there \n     were more than 10,000,000 separate admissions to and \n     discharges from prisons and jails.\n       (2) Insufficient research has been conducted and \n     insufficient data reported on the extent of prison rape. \n     However, experts have conservatively estimated that at least \n     13 percent of the inmates in the United States have been \n     sexually assaulted in prison. Many inmates have suffered \n     repeated assaults. Under this estimate, nearly 200,000 \n     inmates now incarcerated have been or will be the victims of \n     prison rape. The total number of inmates who have been \n     sexually assaulted in the past 20 years likely exceeds \n     1,000,000.\n       (3) Inmates with mental illness are at increased risk of \n     sexual victimization. America's jails and prisons house more \n     mentally ill individuals than all of the Nation's psychiatric \n     hospitals combined. As many as 16 percent of inmates in state \n     prisons and jails, and 7 percent of Federal inmates, suffer \n     from mental illness.\n       (4) Young first-time offenders are at increased risk of \n     sexual victimization. Juveniles are 5 times more likely to be \n     sexually assaulted in adult rather than juvenile facilities--\n     often within the first 48 hours of incarceration.\n       (5) Most prison staff are not adequately trained or \n     prepared to prevent, report, or treat inmate sexual assaults.\n       (6) Prison rape often goes unreported, and inmate victims \n     often receive inadequate treatment for the severe physical \n     and psychological effects of sexual assault--if they receive \n     treatment at all.\n       (7) HIV and AIDS are major public health problems within \n     America's correctional facilities. In 2000, 25,088 inmates in \n     Federal and State prisons were known to be infected with HIV/\n     AIDS. In 2000, HIV/AIDS accounted for more than 6 percent of \n     all deaths in Federal and State prisons. Infection rates for \n     other sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, and \n     hepatitis B and C are also far greater for prisoners than for \n     the American population as a whole. Prison rape undermines \n     the public health by contributing to the spread of these \n     diseases, and often giving a potential death sentence to its \n     victims.\n       (8) Prison rape endangers the public safety by making \n     brutalized inmates more likely to commit crimes when they are \n     released--as 600,000 inmates are each year.\n       (9) The frequently interracial character of prison sexual \n     assaults significantly exacerbates interracial tensions, both \n     within prison and, upon release of perpetrators and victims \n     from prison, in the community at large.\n       (10) Prison rape increases the level of homicides and other \n     violence against inmates and staff, and the risk of \n     insurrections and riots.\n       (11) Victims of prison rape suffer severe physical and \n     psychological effects that hinder their ability to integrate \n     into the community and maintain stable employment upon their \n     release from prison. They are thus more likely to become \n     homeless and/or require government assistance.\n       (12) Members of the public and government officials are \n     largely unaware of the epidemic character of prison rape and \n     the day-to-day horror experienced by victimized inmates.\n       (13) The high incidence of sexual assault within prisons \n     involves actual and potential violations of the United States \n     Constitution. In Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994), the \n     Supreme Court ruled that deliberate indifference to the \n     substantial risk of sexual assault violates prisoners' rights \n     under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth \n     Amendment. The Eighth Amendment rights of State and local \n     prisoners are protected through the Due Process Clause of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment. Pursuant to the\n\n[[Page S9660]]\n\n     power of Congress under Section Five of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment, Congress may take action to enforce those rights \n     in States where officials have demonstrated such \n     indifference. States that do not take basic steps to abate \n     prison rape by adopting standards that do not generate \n     significant additional expenditures demonstrate such \n     indifference. Therefore, such States are not entitled to the \n     same level of Federal benefits as other States.\n       (14) The high incidence of prison rape undermines the \n     effectiveness and efficiency of United States Government \n     expenditures through grant programs such as those dealing \n     with health care; mental health care; disease prevention; \n     crime prevention, investigation, and prosecution; prison \n     construction, maintenance, and operation; race relations; \n     poverty; unemployment and homelessness. The effectiveness and \n     efficiency of these Federally funded grant programs are \n     compromised by the failure of State officials to adopt \n     policies and procedure that reduce the incidence of prison \n     rape in that the high incidence of prison rape--\n       (A) increases the costs incurred by Federal, State, and \n     local jurisdictions to administer their prison systems;\n       (B) increases the levels of violence, directed at inmates \n     and at staff, within prisons;\n       (C) increases health care expenditures, both inside and \n     outside of prison systems, and reduces the effectiveness of \n     disease prevention programs by substantially increasing the \n     incidence and spread of HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B \n     and C, and other diseases;\n       (D) increases mental health care expenditures, both inside \n     and outside of prison systems, by substantially increasing \n     the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, \n     suicide, and the exacerbation of existing mental illnesses \n     among current and former inmates;\n       (E) increases the risks of recidivism, civil strife, and \n     violent crime by individuals who have been brutalized by \n     prison rape; and\n       (F) increases the level of interracial tensions and strife \n     within prisons and, upon release of perpetrators and victims, \n     in the community at large.\n       (15) The high incidence of prison rape has a significant \n     effect on interstate commerce because it increases \n     substantially--\n       (A) the costs incurred by Federal, State, and local \n     jurisdictions to administer their prison systems;\n       (B) the incidence and spread of HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, \n     hepatitis B and C, and other diseases, contributing to \n     increased health and medical expenditures throughout the \n     Nation;\n       (C) the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, \n     suicide, and the exacerbation of existing mental illnesses \n     among current and former inmates, contributing to increased \n     health and medical expenditures throughout the Nation; and\n       (D) the risk of recidivism, civil strife, and violent crime \n     by individuals who have been brutalized by prison rape.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) establish a zero-tolerance standard for the incidence \n     of prison rape in prisons in the United States;\n       (2) make the prevention of prison rape a top priority in \n     each prison system;\n       (3) develop and implement national standards for the \n     detection, prevention, reduction, and punishment of prison \n     rape;\n       (4) increase the available data and information on the \n     incidence of prison rape, consequently improving the \n     management and administration of correctional facilities;\n       (5) standardize the definitions used for collecting data on \n     the incidence of prison rape;\n       (6) increase the accountability of prison officials who \n     fail to detect, prevent, reduce, and punish prison rape;\n       (7) protect the Eighth Amendment rights of Federal, State, \n     and local prisoners;\n       (8) increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal \n     expenditures through grant programs such as those dealing \n     with health care; mental health care; disease prevention; \n     crime prevention, investigation, and prosecution; prison \n     construction, maintenance, and operation; race relations; \n     poverty; unemployment; and homelessness; and\n       (9) reduce the costs that prison rape imposes on interstate \n     commerce.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL PRISON RAPE STATISTICS, DATA, AND RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Annual Comprehensive Statistical Review.--\n       (1) In general.--The Bureau of Justice Statistics of the \n     Department of Justice (in this section referred to as the \n     ``Bureau'') shall carry out, for each calendar year, a \n     comprehensive statistical review and analysis of the \n     incidence and effects of prison rape. The statistical review \n     and analysis shall include, but not be limited to the \n     identification of the common characteristics of--\n       (A) both victims and perpetrators of prison rape; and\n       (B) prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of \n     prison rape.\n       (2) Considerations.--In carrying out paragraph (1), the \n     Bureau shall consider--\n       (A) how rape should be defined for the purposes of the \n     statistical review and analysis;\n       (B) how the Bureau should collect information about staff-\n     on-inmate sexual assault;\n       (C) how the Bureau should collect information beyond inmate \n     self-reports of prison rape;\n       (D) how the Bureau should adjust the data in order to \n     account for differences among prisons as required by \n     subsection (c)(3);\n       (E) the categorization of prisons as required by subsection \n     (c)(4); and\n       (F) whether a preliminary study of prison rape should be \n     conducted to inform the methodology of the comprehensive \n     statistical review.\n       (3) Solicitation of views.--The Bureau of Justice \n     Statistics shall solicit views from representatives of the \n     following: State departments of correction; county and \n     municipal jails; juvenile correctional facilities; former \n     inmates; victim advocates; researchers; and other experts in \n     the area of sexual assault.\n       (4) Sampling techniques.--The review and analysis under \n     paragraph (1) shall be based on a random sample, or other \n     scientifically appropriate sample, of not less than 10 \n     percent of all Federal, State, and county prisons, and a \n     representative sample of municipal prisons. The selection \n     shall include at least one prison from each State. The \n     selection of facilities for sampling shall be made at the \n     latest practicable date prior to conducting the surveys and \n     shall not be disclosed to any facility or prison system \n     official prior to the time period studied in the survey. \n     Selection of a facility for sampling during any year shall \n     not preclude its selection for sampling in any subsequent \n     year.\n       (5) Surveys.--In carrying out the review and analysis under \n     paragraph (1), the Bureau shall, in addition to such other \n     methods as the Bureau considers appropriate, use surveys and \n     other statistical studies of current and former inmates from \n     a sample of Federal, State, county, and municipal prisons. \n     The Bureau shall ensure the confidentiality of each survey \n     participant.\n       (6) Participation in survey.--Federal, State, or local \n     officials or facility administrators that receive a request \n     from the Bureau under subsection (a)(4) or (5) will be \n     required to participate in the national survey and provide \n     access to any inmates under their legal custody.\n       (b) Review Panel on Prison Rape.--\n       (1) Establishment.--To assist the Bureau in carrying out \n     the review and analysis under subsection (a), there is \n     established, within the Department of Justice, the Review \n     Panel on Prison Rape (in this section referred to as the \n     ``Panel'').\n       (2) Membership.--\n       (A) Composition.--The Panel shall be composed of 3 members, \n     each of whom shall be appointed by the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n       (B) Qualifications.--Members of the Panel shall be selected \n     from among individuals with knowledge or expertise in matters \n     to be studied by the Panel.\n       (3) Public hearings.--\n       (A) In general.--The duty of the Panel shall be to carry \n     out, for each calendar year, public hearings concerning the \n     operation of the three prisons with the highest incidence of \n     prison rape and the two prisons with the lowest incidence of \n     prison rape in each category of facilities identified under \n     subsection (c)(4). The Panel shall hold a separate hearing \n     regarding the three Federal or State prisons with the highest \n     incidence of prison rape. The purpose of these hearings shall \n     be to collect evidence to aid in the identification of common \n     characteristics of both victims and perpetrators of prison \n     rape, and the identification of common characteristics of \n     prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of prison \n     rape, and the identification of common characteristics of \n     prisons and prison systems that appear to have been \n     successful in deterring prison rape.\n       (B) Testimony at hearings.--\n       (i) Public officials.--In carrying out the hearings \n     required under subparagraph (A), the Panel shall request the \n     public testimony of Federal, State, and local officials (and \n     organizations that represent such officials), including the \n     warden or director of each prison, who bears responsibility \n     for the prevention, detection, and punishment of prison rape \n     at each entity, and the head of the prison system \n     encompassing such prison.\n       (ii) Victims.--The Panel may request the testimony of \n     prison rape victims, organizations representing such victims, \n     and other appropriate individuals and organizations.\n       (C) Subpoenas.--\n       (i) Issuance.--The Panel may issue subpoenas for the \n     attendance of witnesses and the production of written or \n     other matter.\n       (ii) Enforcement.--In the case of contumacy or refusal to \n     obey a subpoena, the Attorney General may in a Federal court \n     of appropriate jurisdiction obtain an appropriate order to \n     enforce the subpoena.\n       (c) Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than June 30 of each year, the \n     Attorney General shall submit a report on the activities of \n     the Bureau and the Review Panel, with respect to prison rape, \n     for the preceding calendar year to--\n       (A) Congress; and\n       (B) the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n       (2) Contents.--The report required under paragraph (1) \n     shall include--\n       (A) with respect to the effects of prison rape, \n     statistical, sociological, and psychological data;\n       (B) with respect to the incidence of prison rape--\n       (i) statistical data aggregated at the Federal, State, \n     prison system, and prison levels;\n       (ii) a listing of those institutions in the representative \n     sample, separated into each category identified under \n     subsection (c)(4)\n\n[[Page S9661]]\n\n     and ranked according to the incidence of prison rape in each \n     institution; and\n       (iii) an identification of those institutions in the \n     representative sample that appear to have been successful in \n     deterring prison rape; and\n       (C) a listing of any prisons in the representative sample \n     that did not cooperate with the survey conducted pursuant to \n     section 4.\n       (3) Data adjustments.--In preparing the information \n     specified in paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall use \n     established statistical methods to adjust the data as \n     necessary to account for differences among institutions in \n     the representative sample, which are not related to the \n     detection, prevention, reduction and punishment of prison \n     rape, or which are outside the control of the of the State, \n     prison, or prison system, in order to provide an accurate \n     comparison among prisons. Such differences may include the \n     mission, security level, size, and jurisdiction under which \n     the prison operates. For each such adjustment made, the \n     Attorney General shall identify and explain such adjustment \n     in the report.\n       (4) Categorization of prisons.--The report shall divide the \n     prisons surveyed into three categories.
