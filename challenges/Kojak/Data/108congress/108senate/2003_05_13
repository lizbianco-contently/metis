Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business to allow speakers to discuss and introduce \nlegislation or to speak on the topic of their choice. It had been our \nexpectation that the amendment process on the jobs/growth bill would \nbegin this morning; however, that will be delayed until later today.\n  Today, we do have a Senate delegation out of town attending the \nfuneral of former Senator Russell Long, and that delegation will not \nreturn until early this evening. In addition, the Finance Committee \nwill need to meet this evening to report out the reconciliation \nmeasure. The Senate will then immediately begin its consideration. This \nwill allow us to begin to use time under the statutory time limit as \nwell as begin the consideration of germane amendments this evening.\n  I say to my colleagues, we will have to work late each night this \nweek. At the end of last week I mentioned it was going to be a very \nbusy week, and due to the delays which we are experiencing, it means we \nwill be working late each night this week and through Friday.\n  Following morning business today, we will resume consideration of the \nenergy bill. Pending to the energy bill is the bipartisan Frist-Daschle \nethanol amendment. I understand there are additional speakers on that \namendment.\n  Also, as I mentioned last week, there are a number of pressing issues \nthat the Senate must address prior to the Memorial Day recess. First, \nwe will finish the jobs/growth package this week. We have the statutory \ntime interval of 20 hours of debate which will begin as soon as the \nFinance Committee reports out the reconciliation bill tonight.\n  Also, as I mentioned last week, this week the Senate will consider \nthe bipartisan global HIV/AIDS legislation. This measure has broad \nsupport across both sides of the aisle, and it is my hope that we will \nbe able to work out an agreement this morning or over the course of the \nday that will allow the Senate to pass this bill after a reasonable \nperiod of consideration later this week.\n\n  Third, we also have an order to consider the debt limit extension \nbill with a limited number of amendments. My colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have indicated they would not delay this bill once we \nbring it up. I hope it will not be necessary for all of the 12 \nDemocratic amendments to be offered once we do bring up that bill. I \nbelieve everyone does understand the need for fiscal continuity and the \nimportance of getting a debt limit bill to the President's desk before \nthe Memorial Day recess.\n  As for next week, we will be considering the Department of Defense \nauthorization. The chairman and the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee have done yeoman's work to get the Department of \nDefense authorization bill ready for floor action. We will proceed to \nfull Senate consideration of that bill early next week.\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\n  Needless to say, again, as I mentioned at the end of last week, we \nhave a very busy 2 weeks really with 9 legislative days prior to the \nrecess. I do ask for all Members' cooperation in the coming weeks as we \nmove through these important issues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant minority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, I know the distinguished \nmajority leader has a statement to make on an important subject. While \nhe is here, as we begin today's session, I have a couple of questions.\n  First, with the order that was entered last night, we are in morning \nbusiness until 12:30; is that what the leader intends to do?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it was not specified last night, but our \nintent was to do morning business for an hour and at 11 o'clock to come \nback to the energy bill to continue the opening statements and comments \nand discussion on the ethanol amendment that was offered last week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the leader, we would be happy to \ncooperate in any way that will make things move more quickly. We do \nhave a number of Senators--Senator Conrad, Senator Stabenow--who wish \nto speak, and so I am not sure they can complete everything by then, \nbut we will enter into an agreement that we can get to the energy bill \nas quickly as possible.\n  I am not going to do this in the form of a unanimous consent request \nbecause I did this yesterday--and there is no need to do this again--\nother than to say, I think it would be in the best interest of the \nSenate if today we immediately move to the debt limit bill. The leader \nhas indicated what he wishes to finish this week. We believe it would \nbe good to do this prior to the tax bill. We could finish it today. We \ncould be in a position where we could complete the votes even tonight \nwhen the people return from the Long funeral.\n  So I would hope the majority leader would consider allowing us, \nrather than going to the energy bill, which we are not going to make \nmuch progress on--and my personal feeling is we will not finish that \nbill until the leader gives us a lump of time that says we are going to \nfinish the bill. So, anyway, I hope we can move to the debt limit bill \nas expeditiously as possible. That is why we have this agreement which \nis standing dealing with H.J. Res. 51, that we have a limited number of \namendments. We have indicated there would be no filibuster. So I would \nhope we could move to this as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the assistant Democratic \nleader making the request and stressing the importance of dealing with \nthe extension of the debt ceiling. It is an issue we have to address. \nWe have a number of issues that are pending, that are underway, and one \nis the energy bill introduced last week, with an amendment that is \ncurrently on the floor that I would like to come to this morning and \ncontinue. It is business that is underway.\n  Secondly, the jobs and growth package is an issue that, at the end of \nlast week, we committed to go to very early. I very much want to get \nthis out of the Congress before the recess, if at all possible. That \nmeans we do need to go to that as soon as possible.\n\n  The third priority I have set and laid out last week is the HIV/AIDS \nbill. I will make a few comments on that shortly, why I believe it is \nurgent for us to pass that particular legislation. Then, in this order, \nthe fourth is the debt ceiling which has to be dealt with before we \nleave. I will be in consultation with the Department of the Treasury in \nterms of the exact timing of that. The sequence of events will be as I \noutlined as we go forward.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we understand the importance of each one of \nthese measures. We understand the importance of global AIDS. I think it \nis important that we have a bipartisan approach, and the majority \nleader, as a physician, has helped us move into that position. Keep in \nmind, this is an authorization bill. We have to do authorizations \nbefore we do appropriations. With regard to its urgency, it is \nimportant we get it done so that during the appropriations process we \ncan give some money to the programs that are authorized. As far as it \nbeing as urgent as the tax bill or the debt ceiling is concerned, it is \ndown the list in that regard.\n  Senator Feingold wishes to speak. I will work with the floor staff as \nsoon as the majority leader completes his statement to try to figure \nout how much time we need on this side. While it is the decision of the \nleader to move to energy, we think we should move to the debt limit. \nBut the leader makes that decision. We will work out with the floor \nstaff as to how much time we need for this side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6036-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6036-S6037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                HIV/AIDS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the sequence we just walked through is very \nimportant. The sense of urgency for the HIV/AIDS legislation, for me, \nreally boils down to the fact that every 10 seconds somebody is dying \nfrom this little virus, and that is something that is going to take \nleadership from the United States--the President, the Senate, and the \nHouse of Representatives--to act upon. Indeed, the President has acted; \nthe House of Representatives has acted. The last hurdle to the reality \nof the United States being the true world leader in fighting HIV/AIDS \nis this body. When every 10 seconds a person is dying and we can make a \ndifference, it becomes urgent, not just to this physician but to the \nCongress and to the United States.\n  Following the jobs and growth package this week, we will immediately \nturn to H.R. 1298, which is the bipartisan United States Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. I plan to \nbring that to the floor as soon as we complete the jobs and growth \npackage and to complete it this week. It is my hope we will have good \ndebate. We will have good debate. There are people on both sides of the \naisle who have participated aggressively in the discussion and, indeed, \nhave moved legislation--not successfully--but moved legislation forward \nin this body. We will have the debate. We will dispose of the \namendments and proceed to final passage by the end of this week on this \nurgent issue.\n  For the past 5 years, I have worked with Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, and House Members, all of whom are devoted to the idea that \nthe United States can and, even more importantly, must play a leading \nrole in our response to this global health crisis. It has taken a long \ntime for people throughout the world, indeed the United States and--\nmaybe a little bit longer than I and others would like--for the \nCongress to realize what a moral crisis, what a public health crisis \nthis pandemic is, all caused by a virus, an infection which emerged in \nthis country about 22 years ago--in 1981, not that long ago.\n  In previous Congresses, we passed legislation at the committee level. \nSweeping legislation to accomplish the establishment of the U.S. \nleadership on the virus has been considered, but it has never made it \ninto law. Now we have that opportunity. Indeed, I am committed to see \nthat we seize that opportunity this week with no delays because it is \nsuch a huge global issue, an issue which I regard as one of the \ngreatest moral challenges we have seen in this country in the last 100 \nyears.\n  I have chosen to begin our debate with H.R. 1298 because it is the \nbill that offers us the best hope that we can get the job done in an \nexpeditious fashion and one that best assimilates the thoughts and \nideas and works of past legislation from this body, on both sides of \nthe aisle, as well as in the House of Representatives.\n  What is making it possible now, after 5 years of working on this \nissue personally, again with colleagues from both sides of the aisle--\nit is very clear--is the leadership of the President of the United \nStates. It was his statement in the State of the Union Address this \nyear where the President didn't just use rhetoric or give lipservice to \nthe fight against this virus, but he made an unprecedented commitment \nto this public health challenge in a 5-year, $15 billion effort to \ncombat HIV/AIDS globally. It was unprecedented. The President has \nclaimed for our Nation the leading role in fighting this aggressive \nvirus, this destructive virus, a virus that daily continues to take the \nlives of thousands of innocents, resulting in about 13 to 14 million \nyoung children today as orphans, and even that number will go to 30 to \n40 million over the next 15 years.\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\n  It should be recognized that the bipartisan bill we will consider is \na product of a lot of work. People say it is a House-written bill. If \nyou look at it, first, it is overwhelmingly bipartisan; secondly, if \nyou read through the legislation, you see that it draws upon much of \nthe effort from this body, on both sides of the aisle, from the various \ncommittees, that have addressed emerging infections in the past--from \nthis body as well as the House.\n  In the pages of that legislation, we will find much that is familiar \nin the proposals we have tried to pass before. Thus, Democrats and \nRepublicans, once they read the bill, can claim satisfaction by finding \nthat many of the provisions have been authored from Members on both \nsides of the aisle. That is the bill that is so close to becoming law. \nThat is the bill we will be debating.\n  The consensus on the legislation to fight global HIV/AIDS is deep, \nbut I have to say it is very narrow. I don't reveal any secrets in \nacknowledging that there are very strong differences around the margins \nof this debate. But what is truly remarkable--people will see this as \nthey look at the legislation itself, and I find it very encouraging--is \nthat we have come to this point of consensus that will permit us to get \nthis bill through this last hurdle, through the Congress, and to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  The bill we bring to the floor does offer a 5-year plan, $15 billion \nto combat HIV/AIDS on a global scale. The bipartisan support is \nreflected in the fact that only one House Democrat voted against this \nbipartisan compromise bill. Thus, it is not a Republican bill; it is \nnot a Democrat bill; it is a bipartisan bill.\n  The vote in the House of Representatives was 375 to 41. The President \nand White House staff have reviewed the House bill, and the White House \nhas informed me that the President would sign this bill as it currently \nstands. This means that Senate passage is the only remaining hurdle in \nthe way of this 5-year, $15 billion commitment by the United States of \nAmerica in the global fight against HIV/AIDS.\n  We must pass this bill. We must pass this bill this week. I know some \nof my colleagues would change the legislation and tweak it, given the \nopportunity. I know some would add a little here and take away some \nthere, change the language as it is written. In a perfect world, I \nwould like to make several changes in the bill that I think have some \nmerit. But as someone who has invested years of my own life, in terms \nof developing the legislation in this fight against AIDS and in \neducating others about this issue, and as a physician and someone who \nis familiar with infectious disease and has experience in treating this \nvirus very directly, I have reflected on ultimately what is most \nimportant.\n  My conclusion is that it is important for us to pass this legislation \nnow and get this program established without further delay--not 6 \nmonths from now, not 3 months from now, not a month from now. It is a \nmoral issue, and history will ultimately judge how this body responds \nto this devastating virus. There is no change I could personally \npropose to this legislation that is so significant that it would cause \na delay in getting this bill to the President. Therefore, when we bring \nup the bill, I intend to offer no amendments. I will argue against any \namendments. It is my hope that other Senators will reach that \nconclusion as well.\n  The bill is a 5-year authorization and it is important for us to \nremember that no matter what final shape this bill takes as we pass it, \nthis is the first major step. We still have a lot of work to do, but \nthis is the first major step. We will have the ability in future \nauthorizations and in the appropriations process to make other changes, \nto take the next step as they prove necessary. But now is the time for \nus to get the job done, create the capacity for that global response, \nand to give the President of the United States the leverage he needs to \nattract similar leadership from the world's other wealthy nations.\n  With this legislation, the United States of America will clearly be \nleading this fight and will become an example for the other wealthy \nnations to participate. Simply put, too many innocent children and men \nand women and young people have been infected by this terrible virus. \nToo many have died. We have failed to act in the past. We have had good \nintentions, but we have failed to act in the past. We must not fail \nthese people again. This is our opportunity.\n  In closing, I appeal to my colleagues on both sides that we join \ntogether in passing this bipartisan bill. I acknowledge that it is not \na perfect bill, but my conscience does not permit me to let the perfect \nbe the enemy of the good. This is, without a doubt, one moment to put \nthe global interests of others above our own differences and to do our \nwork, to do good, and to reaffirm that which makes the United States of \nAmerica not just a powerful Nation but indeed a great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6037-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week, some of our colleagues came \nto the floor to discuss the President's recent appearance on the USS \nAbraham Lincoln and the propriety of that appearance. I, however, come \nto the floor today to discuss some of what the President said on the \nLincoln, especially with regard to the fight against terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the fight against global \nterrorism--an effort that is surely our highest national security \npriority. I want to spend a few minutes talking about the fight against \nterrorism today because it is not at all clear to me that we are as \nfocused on this mission as we should be. I fear that our mission has \nbecome obscured and our approach unfocused. I also fear that this \nconfused approach will undermine our goal rather than enhance our \nsecurity.\n  I had planned to make these remarks even before yesterday's terrible \nterrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia. Early reports indicate that those \ndeplorable\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\nattacks killed several, including at least 10 Americans. Many more \ninnocent people were wounded. Al-Qaida is strongly suspected to be \nresponsible. Of course, my heart and all of our hearts go out to all of \nthe families who are grieving today and to those who are left with the \nterrible uncertainty as they wait to hear news of loved ones.\n  More information will surely be emerging shortly, but Secretary \nPowell has already pointed out one of the most important conclusions \nthat can be drawn from this incident in Saudi Arabia, and that is that \nthose forces who would have us live in fear have not been destroyed.\n  I have no doubt that everyone in this Chamber was gratified to hear \nthe recent better news about Pakistan's arrest of several members of an \nimportant al-Qaida cell, including a Yemeni man believed to be involved \nin the October 2000 attack on the U.S. warship Cole in Yemen. I look \nforward to more information about this development. But I also look \nforward to more information about another related matter.\n  The President reminded us on the USS Lincoln that he has pledged that \nterrorists who attacked America ``would not escape the patient justice \nof the United States.'' I think the country expects nothing less. But \nhow many people noticed when, according to reports, 10 men escaped from \na prison in Yemen on April 11--10 men who apparently were being held on \ncharges of involvement in the terrorist attack on the USS Cole that \nkilled 17 American sailors, including one from my home State of \nWisconsin?\n  I want to know--is this so? If so, how did they escape? Did they have \nassistance? Critically, why are we not hearing more about this? This \nescape occurred, apparently, just as our brave troops were entering \nBaghdad--at least in part in the name of stopping the threat of \nterrorism. But no one seems to be discussing at all this potentially \ndangerous lapse in Yemen. Did the perpetrators of the murder of 17 \nAmericans on the USS Cole escape or not? And what does this mean? \nAmericans pledge every day to never forget September 11, 2001. We \npledge this to ourselves, to each other, and to the rest of the world, \nbut I fear that the administration and the Congress are losing sight of \nour most important goals and priorities.\n\n  September 11 is invoked in some surprising and, I think, largely \nunrelated contexts. Sometimes the very idea of terrorism is used by \nsome on the right and some on the left as a politically convenient \nattack on whomever or whatever they do not agree with. Rhetoric about \nSeptember 11 and the fight against terrorism seems to be everywhere, \nand our distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, \nraised this very same issue in his remarks last week.\n  In many ways, the actual business of combating the terrorist \norganizations or organization responsible for the attacks on our \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania, for the attack on the USS Cole, for \nthe horror of September 11, and now possibly for last night's attacks \nin Riyadh, seems to be lost in the shuffle.\n  A few days ago, from the deck of the USS Lincoln, our President told \nthe American people that ``the battle of Iraq is one victory in a war \non terror that began on September 11, 2001.'' And polls indicate a \nmajority of the American people believe the Saddam Hussein regime was \ninvolved in the September 11 attacks. But I have never--I have never--\nnot in hearings, not in classified briefings, I have never heard once \nour officials assert we have intelligence indicating this is the case.\n  President Bush was, of course, right to praise our dedicated service \nmen and women during that speech for they have performed their duties \nwith skill and bravery and superb professionalism. I enthusiastically \njoin the President in thanking them and in welcoming those who are now \ncoming home.\n  But I cannot and will not join in any attempt to blur what must be \nthe necessary and principal focus on the international terrorist threat \nby too easily merging it with different issues, including the issue of \nIraq.\n  Last October, I was not able to support the resolution authorizing \nthe President to use force in Iraq. I felt that in terms of the \nconstantly shifting justifications for an invasion and in terms of the \nmission and the plan for the engagement's aftermath, I felt the \nadministration had not made a sufficiently compelling case for Congress \nto grant war powers to the President.\n  I had no problem granting such power to the President to make war on \nthose who attacked this country on September 11, but Iraq was a \ndifferent issue which, of course, is why it required its own resolution \nauthorizing force. If, in fact, there was a connection in planning \ntogether for the 9/11 attack by Saddam Hussein and his agents and the \nperpetrators of 9/11 and al-Qaida, then I believe there was no need for \nadditional authority and resolution.\n  The administration had and continues to have all the authority \nrequired to go after the perpetrators of 9/11, but Iraq was and is a \ndifferent issue. In fact, many of us feared it would be a distraction \nfrom the urgent task of fighting terrorism. I said on the floor in \nOctober, right after the President's famous speech in Cincinnati, the \nadministration's arguments regarding Iraq did not add up to a coherent \nbasis for a new major war in the middle of our current challenging \nfight against the terrorism of al-Qaida and related organizations.\n\n  Of course, a majority of my colleagues in this Chamber voted in favor \nof authorizing the President to use force in Iraq. We did proceed, and \nthe brave men and women of the United States military answered the call \nto service and performed brilliantly.\n  It is certainly my understanding when the Senate voted to authorize \nthe use of force, and it remains my understanding today, that most \nSenators were convinced by the most compelling argument that the \nadministration put forward. That is the one relating to Iraq's failures \nto comply with its obligations to verifiably dismantle and destroy its \nweapons of mass destruction program.\n  All of us recognize this as a serious issue, but now we are talking \nless and less about those weapons, it seems, and there is less and less \nclarity about this matter. So before returning to the principal issue \nof the fight against terrorism, let me spend a few minutes on the issue \nof WMD in Iraq.\n  I raise this issue not in an attempt to revisit the debate about our \nwisdom in the approach in Iraq and not because I am searching for a \nsmoking gun. I raise it because it does matter whether or not we find \nWMD. Most importantly, it matters because if those materials were in \nthe country in the first place and we cannot find them now, that is a \nsecurity problem. Where did they go? Whose hands are they in? These \nare, obviously, very serious questions, and accounting for these \nmaterials cannot be written off as some sort of distraction or \nlegalistic irrelevance.\n  Just yesterday the New York Times reported that the nuclear expert \nfor the Army's Mobile Exploitation Team Alpha was unaware of any U.S. \npolicy as to how to handle radioactive material that may be found in \nIraq, material that could be used to make a dirty bomb. On Sunday, the \nWashington Post reported that the group directing the U.S. search for \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq is ``winding down operations'' \nafter a host of fruitless missions.\n  For months, I and others asked the administration: What is the plan \nfor securing these weapons? We tried to understand how we would use the \nintelligence that was shared in the briefing room to quickly secure \nweapons of mass destruction and the means to make them. We asked the \nquestion for good reason. We were concerned that in the midst of the \ndisorder and disarray likely to accompany military action and the fall \nof Saddam that WMD could be spirited out of the country or sold to the \nhighest bidder, compounding the threat to the United States rather than \neliminating it.\n  We were right to ask about this issue, and today it appears we either \nhad a problem with our intelligence or we had an inadequate plan. \nEither way, we are talking about a serious problem that should be \nexamined carefully and one that should not be repeated.\n  I also think the issue of weapons of mass destruction matters in \nterms of how the rest of the world and history will understand this \nundertaking in Iraq. Those perceptions and judgments do affect our \nsecurity and global stability. We cannot afford to have the world \nbelieving the United States will\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\nconjure up pretexts to wage wars and overthrow governments around the \nworld at will. That is not who we are, and it is not in our interest to \nbe perceived in that fashion.\n\n  Do not misunderstand me, I am not suggesting at all this was conjured \nup. There is no doubt that Iraq was not in compliance with Security \nCouncil Resolution 1441 when this conflict began, but I think we need \nto continue to focus on disarmament to keep from muddying the waters \nwith regard to our intentions, and I believe we should accept credible \nand qualified international assistance in this regard. Yes, what the \nrest of the world thinks surely matters.\n  Turning back to the paramount issue of the fight against terrorism, I \nbelieve we have to keep this truth about how we are perceived \nthroughout the rest of the world in mind. Perhaps the most important \nform of American power projected over the last century has been the \npower of our ideas and our values. If we lose our capacity to lead in \nthat sense, then all of us in Government will have presided over the \ngreatest loss of power in American history, regardless of how much we \nspend on our mighty and admirable military forces. And we will have put \nourselves at a great disadvantage, likely a decisive and crippling \ndisadvantage, in the fight against terrorism, which is our first \nnational priority, which is our first priority in terms of national \nsecurity.\n  I recognize many issues are interlinked, that our approach to one \npolicy issue may affect the course of the campaign against terrorism. \nThere can be no doubt about our primary responsibility and our most \nimportant security concern. We should be having a more focused dialog \nand exercising our oversight responsibilities in a more focused way.\n  A tremendous number of questions came to the surface on September 11. \nHow can we win a war against a shadowy network of nonstate actors? How \ncan we define success? How will we know when we have been victorious? \nAll of us, Democrats and Republicans, the Congress and the executive \nbranch, waded through these questions recognizing that some answers \nwould take time to take shape.\n  So today many questions remain. Where are we in this fight against \nterrorism? Our colleague Senator Graham of Florida, one of the most \nrespected Members of this body, suggested recently on the Today show \nthat the war on terrorism has been ``essentially abandoned over the \npast year,'' and that it is ``a fundamental mis- \ncharacterization'' to describe the war in Iraq as part of the fight \nagainst global terrorism.'' Both issues should be the subject of \nintense focus in Congress. How are we finding our way in this new kind \nof conflict? How stable and robust is the multilateral coalition \ncommitted to combating terrorism of global reach?\n  The task at hand is difficult enough without obscuring the issues. \nRecently when Secretary Powell testified before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, he noted that Americans have concluded that \nterrorism must be eradicated. But, he said:\n\n       Some in Europe see it differently. Some see terrorism as a \n     regrettable but inevitable part of society and they want to \n     keep it at arm-length and as low key as possible.\n\n  At this point, I am uncertain as to how to interpret this. Are our \nEuropean partners really unconvinced of the need to fight terrorism? \nWhich partners is he talking about? What steps are they unwilling to \ntake to combat international terrorist organizations? These are real \nissues and the Secretary is quite right to raise them. But I am left \nuncertain. Are we conflating policy divergence on Iraq with divergence \non international terrorism? Is that what we are talking about?\n  The President has asserted that:\n\n       Any person involved in committing or planning terrorist \n     attacks against the American people becomes an enemy of this \n     country, and a target of American justice. . . . Any person, \n     organization, or government that supports, protects, or \n     harbors terrorists is complicit in the murder of the \n     innocent, and equally guilty of terrorist crimes.\n\n  But if it is our policy to eradicate terrorist networks of global \nreach, then what does it mean when U.S. forces sign a cease-fire \nagreement with a designated foreign terrorist organization, as they did \non April 15 with the Iraq-based Iranian organization known as the \nPeople's Mujahedeen or more formally as the Mujahedeen Khalq, the MEK? \nAre we making peace with terrorist organizations? For what purpose; to \nwhat end? Is there a question about the way we apply the terrorist \norganization designation? Now we read that the organization is \nsurrendering weapons to U.S. forces in a reversal of the April 15 \ndecision. What are the terms of this new agreement? The issues are \ndifficult, but the elected representatives of the American people \nshould be working on shaping the answers together, not picking up hints \nabout ad-hoc decisions by scanning the wires.\n  Few would argue with the fact that this administration is intensely \nsecretive. And, in this atmosphere of tightly controlled information, \ntoo often the elected representatives of the American people are \nstifled in our ability to fulfill Congress's very important oversight \nrole. With only vague information at our disposal, it is difficult to \nassess progress or the wisdom of our policy course. The absence of \nclarity and the absence of data are dangerous. I think it endangers the \nAmerican people.\n  The President was right when he said that we have not forgotten the \nvictims of September 11. We have not, and we cannot. But in the same \nvein, we must not allow the mission that we accepted in the aftermath \nof that day to become an ever-shifting idea, one that we can never pin \ndown in order to evaluate our performance and take stock of our needs. \nLet us hear less rhetoric and more about disturbing reports, such as \nthe possible escape of the perpetrators of the dastardly attack on the \nUSS Cole. That surely relates to the fight against terrorism. We \ncertainly cannot permit the fight on terrorism, this most serious of \nissues, this horror that unites all Americans in resistance and \nresolve, to become a matter of rhetorical convenience. Our national \nsecurity is at stake. We need clarity, we need focus, and we need \ncandor. The American people deserve nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today as we are beginning the \ndiscussion in earnest about how to create jobs in our country, how to \nhelp the economy, how to be responsible as we do that and how to help \nthe States. Certainly my home State of Michigan, as most States, is \nfinding financial crisis.\n  As we do that, we hear a lot of words, a lot of rhetoric, a lot of \nslogans. One of those is that the President's proposal is a job and \ngrowth package and that colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \ninvolved in a job and growth package. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. In fact, we have 450 well-known economists in the country, 10 \nNobel laureates, Chairman Greenspan, many around the country, saying \nthis will not create jobs and it will not create growth. It is not a \njobs program. It is not a growth program. We have 13 economists saying \nit is; 450 economists versus 13 economists.\n  I suggest the overwhelming opinion of those who have studied this \nquestion of how to create jobs, how to move the economy, and how to do \nit in a responsible manner, without creating a sea of red ink as far as \nthe eye can see, the majority of those who have locked at this issue, \nthe vast majority have said the plan by the White House and by the \nRepublican majority does not do that.\n  In fact, it adds to what we unfortunately are on track to do, which \nis to\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nsee the worst job creation in 58 years. It is astounding what has \nhappened in a very short time, going from budget surpluses, a boom in \nthe economy in the 1990s, and now, in a very short time, to a \nturnaround where we are plummeting into debt. We are seeing close to \nthe worst job creation in 58 years. What we are seeing from this \nrecord, over and over again, is the plan to give tax breaks for the \nprivileged few will not create jobs. It did not create jobs in the \n1980s when it was done. The bill that was passed 2 years ago, in 2001, \nwas the first round of the Bush tax breaks for the privileged few, and \nit has not created jobs. Now they are saying do it again.\n  In my home State just this last month, 17,700 workers lost their \njobs. That is 17,700 families who lost income, possibly--probably \nlosing health care, losing the opportunity to pay into a pension fund, \nlosing the opportunity to buy that new home, that new car squeezing \nthem in terms of being able to send their children to college.\n  Mr. President, that is 17,700 people in just 1 month in Michigan. In \nfact, we have had, since this administration came into power, over \n178,000 people who have lost their jobs in my home State alone--\n178,000-plus people. Again, many of them lost their health care, lost \nthe ability to care for their families and do what they need to do to \ncreate opportunity and security for their families.\n  In the last 2\\1/2\\ years we have seen an astounding 2.5 million \nprivate sector jobs lost. You have to go back over 50 years to see that \nkind of a record in this country. We certainly do not want to be going \nin that direction as a country.\n  What should we do? We do need to work together. We need to work \nacross the aisle to do what is necessary to get the economy going, \ncreate jobs, and protect Social Security and Medicare for the long \nhaul. Unfortunately, what we are seeing is a replay of the 1980s that \nput us into double digit unemployment, double digit interest rate \nincreases, and tripled the national debt. We are seeing a replay of \nwhat was passed 2 years ago now that has caused us to plummet in terms \nof the budget situation and the economy and unemployment.\n  My question is, Why in the world are we going to do this again? Why \nin the world would we use the same policies that have not worked? We \nhave this saying we use a lot in Michigan: The first step in getting \nout of a hole is to stop digging. What we are seeing is the digging of \na deeper and deeper hole. In fact, we have seen a $7 trillion fiscal \ncollapse in just the last 2 years. I find this most disturbing. It is \nextremely worrisome, and every single American I know shares this \nconcern.\n  When we combine the tax policies 2 years ago, the tax cut for the \nprivileged few passed 2 years ago--and by the way, I am all for putting \nmoney in people's pockets. The question is, Whose pockets? We want to \nmake sure it goes into the pockets of the majority of Americans who \nwill spend and drive this economy. That is not what happened 2 years \nago.\n  But if we were to make that permanent and we were to take the other \nproposals that have come forward in some variation, certainly from the \nPresident, what we see as we look to the future is that $14.2 trillion \nis taken out of Federal resources. There is $14.2 trillion of projected \nloss or deficit.\n\n  Compare that to the projected Medicare and Social Security deficit \nover the same time. That is $10 trillion. So we are talking about a \nhole that is bigger than Social Security and Medicare combined, in \nterms of the deficit for the future.\n  I sit on the Budget Committee. We look at these numbers. We are \nseeing red ink proposed as far as the eye can see, red ink that is far \ngreater than what is projected on Medicare and Social Security. We see \nthe baby boomers retiring in just a few years in large numbers. Many of \nus ask the question: How in the world can this be justified? How in the \nworld can anyone look at these numbers and say we are going to put our \ncountry in this huge debt, greater than the liability of Medicare and \nSocial Security, and then meet our obligations to our seniors, to those \nretiring, those who have paid in throughout their working years into a \nsystem that has, in fact, brought people out of poverty and guaranteed \nhealth care once you are age 65 or are disabled?\n  The pattern I have heard back too many times, and it is extremely \nworrisome, is that you assume Medicare and Social Security will be \nthere as we know it.\n  I do assume Medicare and Social Security will be there as we know it. \nFundamental to this debate right now on this tax cut, when we know \neconomists say overwhelmingly say it is not going to work, it is not \ngoing to create growth, it is going to give tax cuts to the privileged \nfew in our country at the expense of everyone else--why in the world, \nthen, would someone propose this? Why in the world would someone \npropose something that would create massive debt, jeopardize Social \nSecurity and Medicare, for a tax break for only a few people?\n  I believe the real purpose is to privatize Medicare and Social \nSecurity. We see over and over again disparaging comments being made, \nparticularly now, about Medicare. Just recently Tom Skully, the \nadministrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said \nwhen he was in Pennsylvania at a public meeting--this was quoted in the \npress and others who were there heard this and responded accordingly; \nmany seniors were very upset and were disagreeing with this, but Mr. \nScully said, when talking about the Medicare Program:\n\n       It was an unbelievable disaster.\n\n  And:\n\n       We think it's a dumb system.\n\n  So we have a situation now where we are seeing a setup to create this \nhuge debt and then we are being told we can't afford Medicare and \nSocial Security as we know it. We can't afford to provide real \nprescription drug coverage for our seniors on Medicare right now. That \nis too expensive to do. We can't afford it. We can't afford Medicare as \nwe know it.\n  I believe what is fundamentally happening is a situation to set up \nthe ability to eliminate Medicare as we know it because of a belief \nthat it is ``an unbelievable disaster'' and ``a dumb system.''\n  I do not believe Medicare is a dumb system. I believe that Medicare \nand Social Security are great American success stories. They have \nbrought the majority of seniors out of poverty in this country. They \nhave created a safety net so when an Enron employee finds that his or \nher entire life savings are wiped out, there is at least a foundation \non Social Security that they have paid into throughout their life.\n  I also believe that when we are seeing millions of Americans without \nhealth care, an explosion in prices on private sector health care for \nlarge and small businesses, Medicare seeing a smaller rate of growth--\nthe only part of universal health care we have where you are guaranteed \nthat when you reach age 65, you will have health care, or if you are \ndisabled, you will have health care--this is not the time to be rolling \nback that system or eliminating that system.\n  When we hear the words ``reform,'' ``dumb system,'' it is a \n``disaster,'' it ``doesn't work and we can't afford it,'' I would say \nto my colleagues that the only reason we will have to have a discussion \nabout the financial viability and whether or not we can afford it is \nthe tax proposals currently on this floor. If we choose as an American \nvalue to put the quality of life of all of our citizens first and \naccess to health care first for seniors, prescription drug coverage, a \nfoundation of Social Security that will be there for all of us--if we \nput that as a value first, we can make sure that it is there for the \nfuture.\n  I believe we need to modernize Medicare. I believe, as Secretary \nThompson said in our Budget Committee, that we need to focus more on \nprevention. I share his belief that this is a system which needs to be \nmoved and modified, focusing more on prevention; that there are ways to \nstreamline it with less bureaucracy and paperwork for our doctors and \nhospitals and other providers. And it needs to be updated to cover \nmedication. There is not a health care policy today that would be \ndesigned without prescription drugs coverage, if it is going to be a \nreal health care policy. That is the major way we provide health care \ntoday.\n  There is no question, it needs to be updated. But it is not a \n``dumb'' system, it is not an ``unbelievable disaster,'' and it is not \nunaffordable if we make the right decision.\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues to consider what is really going on in the \nbroadest sense as we debate the tax bill. We have an alternative. We \ndon't have to set up a situation where we take $14.2 trillion out of \nFederal resources at a time when we will have a projected deficit in \nMedicare and Social Security of $10 trillion. We don't have to do that. \nWe have an alternative.\n  I am proud to be supporting the Democratic alternative that in fact \ncreates more jobs, gives a tax cut to every taxpayer--not just a \nprivileged few--and that helps our States so they don't have to raise \nlocal taxes, creates a situation where we can help small business and \nhelp individuals in the short run but does it responsibly. We can \ncreate jobs, opportunity, and prosperity without creating a situation \nwhere Medicare and Social Security are jeopardized for the future.\n  That is what this is about. This tax bill cannot be debated in \nisolation. I know what is going to happen. If this tax bill passes, we \nwill have another debate on Medicare, and we will be told we can't \nreally provide prescription drug coverage to everybody, we don't have \nthe money, and, by the way, we have to change Medicare, we have to \nreform Medicare, we have to privatize it, and we have to put it back in \nthe private sector because we can't afford to provide Medicare as we \nknow it anymore for our seniors. That debate will have been done after \nwe have created this deep hole, which would be done on purpose.\n  I urge that we take another look. There is a way to create jobs. \nThere is a way to create opportunity. There is a way to create \nprosperity. We would very much like to join with our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to do that. There is a way to do that which is \nfiscally responsible and which protects Medicare and Social Security.\n  I urge the support of all of my colleagues for that approach which \nwill be put forward. I urge my colleagues to take another look at what \nis being suggested here and stand with us to protect the long-term \nsolvency of Medicare and Social Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaryland is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Republicans introduced the wrong \ntax bill yesterday. I think they got it right. I think the tax bill is \nthe wrong bill. I don't think it was a drafting problem. I think it is \nan economic problem. I don't think this tax bill is the right solution \nto what our economy is facing. The tax bill is the wrong bill. It is \nthe wrong bill because it does not create jobs; it adds to our \nstructural deficit; and it doesn't deal with the other economic issues \nfacing our country.\n  I would like to have an economic package which clearly helps create \njobs. If we are going to give tax breaks, they should be targeted to \nhelp families and small businesses. They should be temporary, such as \naid to States and local communities that are reeling with their own \nproblems. And they should not in any way weaken Social Security or \nweaken Medicare.\n  I think the tax bill is the wrong bill.\n  I believe if we put our heads together and think about targeted tax \ncredits, we can help small business with health care and help families. \nLater on this week, I will offer an amendment to the tax bill to \nprovide relief for family caregivers and help those who face the \ncrushing consequences of caring for chronically ill family members.\n  Families are hurting. There is a weak economy. They worry about their \njobs. They worry about their pension. They worry about skyrocketing \nhealth care. They are often holding down two jobs to make ends meet or \nare going into debt in order to put their children through college. \nThey are finding it more difficult to be able to afford health \ninsurance.\n  My targeted tax credit will give help to those who practice self-\nhelp. I think that should be a guiding principle. Let us give help to \nthose who practice self-help.\n  My bill will provide a tax credit up to $5,000 for family caregivers \nwho are caring for someone with a chronic condition.\n  Who would that be? Some families are facing extraordinary \nchallenges--caring for loved ones with special needs, a child with \nautism or cerebral palsy, a parent with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or \na spouse with multiple sclerosis. Those are just a few examples of what \nI mean by a chronic and severe condition.\n  My tax credit would help people pay for prescription drugs, home \nhealth care, specialized daycare, respite care, and specialized \ntherapy, including occupational, physical, or rehabilitation therapy.\n  Family caregivers face so many stresses. There is the emotional and \nphysical stress of caregiving. Then there is the financial stress of \ncaregiving, and the long days of raising a family while caring for a \nloved one with a chronic disease such as cerebral palsy or Parkinson's. \nA dad would have to work two jobs to meet the cost of care for a \nhandicapped child, or a dad and mom might be working to be able to \nafford the special care for grandma. It places incredible stress on the \nfamily checkbook, and it places great strains on the family marriage.\n  We need to give help to those families who are practicing self-help. \nIf you took the total cost of caregiving, it would be $200 billion.\n  The first caregivers are the families--not government. But government \nshould help the family with its responsibilities. They face high costs \nfor prescription drugs, home health, adult daycare or specialized \ndaycare for a handicapped child, physical therapy, durable medical \nequipment such as a wheelchair, and medical bills for care by \nspecialists.\n  People who care for a chronically ill family member must often patch \ntogether whatever they can afford. They really go into debt. Many of \nthem go into their college accounts or retirement savings or they go \nwithout in order to be able to care of their family.\n\n  Example one: Let's talk about a family in Baltimore who has a child \nnamed Jackson. These are real families. They gave me permission to talk \nabout them on the Senate floor so that we would again be focusing on \nwhat a family is facing. Family responsibility, yes, but a family's \nstress needs to be helped.\n  This family has a 2-year-old son named Jackson. He was born with \nsevere brain abnormalities. He has the motor skill development of a 4-\nmonth-old. This little guy has daily seizures, so he needs total, \nround-the-clock care. The emotional costs of caring for a severely \ndisabled child are incalculable. The financial costs are also crushing.\n  It costs $650 a month for daycare for medically fragile children. His \nlittle wheelchair costs $1,400. Though his skills are not growing, he \nis growing, so they need to frequently replace his wheelchair. He even \nneeds a special shower chair which costs $700. Then, of course, with \nall of those seizures and all the other complications, the cost of \nprescription drugs goes off the charts.\n  Let's talk about another family.\n  This is a family in Rockville. They have a 10-year-old girl named \nRachel. She has autism. The mom does not work because the cost of \nspecialized afterschool care would be so high; yet the family has very \nhigh costs, including $200 a month for medication, $150 a week for \nphysical and speech therapy. That is $600 a month for physical and \nspeech therapy. So that is $800 a month or $9,600 a year for just \nmedication and physical and speech therapy.\n  This father works 70 hours a week to provide for his family and to \nmeet Rachel's special needs but also to save for college for his three \nother children. This places great stress on the family.\n  Then there is a couple where the wife is in the advanced stages of \nAlzheimer's. She was a teacher and spoke five languages. Now she needs \n24-hour-a-day care, but the husband will not put her in a nursing home, \nwhich, by the way, would cost over $60,000 a year. This family is \nspending $3,000 a month or $36,000 a year. They have gone through their \nsavings, but they took a vow, ``for richer or for poorer, and in \nsickness and in health,'' and that man intends to keep his vow to his \nwife.\n  What is the social contract that we have with those families? These \nare real families. This is why we need to have a real tax bill that \nalso gives help to those who practice self-help. There are 26 million \npeople in this country who face those situations.\n  My amendment has been backed by the Autism Society of America, the \nCystic Fibrosis Foundation, Easter Seals, the National Organization for\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\nRare Disorders, the United Cerebral Palsy Association, Arc of the \nUnited States, the National Health Council, the National Council on the \nAging, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Family Voices, the National \nRespite Coalition, the National Family Caregivers Association, and the \nNational Alliance for Caregiving.\n  Mr. President, one of my first milestones in the Senate was the \nenactment of something called the Spousal Anti-Impoverishment Act. That \nchanged the cruel rules of Medicaid so families would not go bankrupt \nbefore they could get help for nursing home care.\n  I said: Family responsibility, yes, and always. Family bankruptcy due \nto the cruel rules of government, no.\n  That has helped over 1 million people. Now it is our turn to also \nhelp the caregivers. They are the backbone of our long-term care in \nthis country.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Clinton and Sarbanes, and others, for \nsupporting this amendment. If we really want to help the economy, let's \nstart by helping the American family. I hope, when the Senate considers \nwhatever is introduced, Senators will favorably consider my targeted \ntax credit to help family caregivers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to \ntake a few minutes today to discuss the state of the American economy \nand discuss why I believe new tax cuts are the wrong economic medicine \nright now.\n  I was one of the 12 Democrats who voted for a major tax cut in March \nof 2001. And I want to just bring to everybody's attention what the \nsituation was then.\n  In March 2001 we were in our third year of surplus in the budget. We \nwere projected to run a $5.6 trillion surplus through 2010. So it \nseemed an appropriate time to return some of that surplus to taxpayers, \njust as a business would do when that business was doing well. That is \nwhen a business would consider dividends for its investors or bonuses \nfor its employees. That was 7 months before 9/11. Today we face \ncumulative deficits of approximately $2 trillion over 10 years. And \nthat is the conservative estimate. Goldman Sachs estimates it at double \nthat. We also face huge long-term shortfalls in the Medicare and Social \nSecurity trust funds.\n  Since late last year, the administration has been pushing for a \nsecond large tax cut, some $726 billion in tax breaks that would \nactually provide little upfront stimulus. The centerpiece of the \nPresident's proposal is a plan to eliminate taxes on corporate \ndividends.\n  Half of the benefits of that plan would be realized by taxpayers \nearning over $200,000 a year, and the plan would do nothing for the \nmillions of Americans who hold stocks only through retirement plans \nthat are already tax advantaged. At the same time, my State, \nCalifornia, would lose over $20 billion over the next 10 years as a \nresult of lower direct tax revenue and higher interest rates on \nmunicipal bonds.\n  State budgets cannot afford to lose these costs, and neither can the \nFederal budget. The budget report which recently passed Congress locks \nus into deficits for the next 10 years, totaling some $2 trillion over \nthat period.\n  In his State of the Union Message, the President stated:\n\n       We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass \n     along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, \n     and other generations.\n\n  I cannot agree with that sentiment more, but that is not what has \nhappened. Exactly the opposite has happened.\n  Whether the tax cut ends up at $150 billion or $350 billion or $550 \nbillion, it will all be financed by deficit spending. Every dollar in \nnew tax cuts that passes this Chamber is a dollar we cannot afford to \nspend. We will not pay for it now, but our children are going to pay \nfor it later.\n  Our current deficit is projected to be $347 billion this year, \nalthough many estimate the number will more likely be closer to $400 \nbillion by the end of the fiscal year. And it is estimated to be $385 \nbillion next year. These estimates do not include additional costs of \nrebuilding Iraq or new legislation not included in the President's \nbudget.\n  The deficits now projected are neither small nor are they short term. \nRather, they are the largest in history. The only way that the budget \nresolution which came out of conference committee achieves balance is \nby expecting unrealistic cuts to discretionary spending after 2008.\n  To put some perspective on the size of the deficits expected this \nyear, it is useful to compare it to nondefense discretionary spending. \nThis year we are projected to spend $385 billion for everything outside \nof entitlement programs and defense. That includes funding for \neducation, law enforcement, transportation, environmental protection, \nand hundreds of other uses.\n  If the Federal Government were required to balance its budget each \nyear, as do 49 of our 50 States, it could cut nondefense discretionary \nspending by 90 percent--by 90 percent--and only just manage to reach \nbalance. Imagine the impact that would have on Government services that \nwe rely on every day.\n\n  Let me explain that further. If you look at a pie chart for the year \n2003, 64 percent of all of the expenditures, the outlays this year, is \nfor interest on the debt and entitlement programs. Entitlement programs \nare Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, veterans benefits, and \nwelfare. If you are entitled to them, you get them. They cannot be cut \nin the budget process. So 64 percent of all of the expenditures cannot \nbe controlled. Defense is 17 percent, and nondiscretionary--every other \ndepartment--is 19 percent. That is why you could cut 90 percent of that \n19 percent, and you can't really bring the budget into balance because \nof these other items in the expenditure area.\n  The only reason the Federal Government is not facing cuts in service \nis because it can take on new debt to cover the shortfall in tax \nrevenue. When the occupant of the chair was mayor of a great city and I \nwas mayor of a great city, we couldn't do this. We had to balance our \nbudgets. The Federal Government can do this.\n  Should the President's proposed tax cuts be adopted in their \nentirety, our public debt would nearly double over the next 10 years, \nfrom $6.7 trillion today to $12 trillion in 2013.\n  Later this month, the Senate will take up a bill to increase the \nFederal debt ceiling by almost $1 trillion--$984 billion, to be \nprecise. That is the largest increase in our Nation's history. That \nincrease represents $3,400 in new debt for every American citizen, \nwhether they pay taxes or not. That increase is shocking, but the \nunfortunate truth is that the $1 trillion in new debt Congress is set \nto authorize will cost Americans much more than $3,400 each because \ninterest in our debt drives up interest rates, because there is a \nlimited appetite for debt at home and abroad, and investors must be \ngiven incentives to take on new debt in the form of higher interest \nrates.\n  Those interest rates are not just paid by the Government; they are \nalso paid by homeowners who take out a mortgage. Look at the low \nmortgage rates today and what they are worth to an individual. William \nGale, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, predicts that \ninterest rates could rise by as much as four-tenths of a percent due to \nthe effects of the President's proposal.\n  What does that do to the average citizen? I will tell you. An \nincrease of that magnitude would add $800 to the cost of a $200,000 \nhome mortgage in the first year alone. It would increase costs by \nthousands of dollars more over the life of the mortgage.\n  I have always believed for many Americans low interest rates are much \nmore worthwhile than a tax cut that they may only see slightly. But \nwhen they refinance their house, they see it big time, or when they are \nable to draw out from the accrued equity of the house. So interest \nrates not only affect homeowners, but they also affect businesses \nseeking to make new capital investments in the cost of money they \nborrow. The effect is to crowd out private investment and stifle \neconomic growth.\n  Let's talk for a moment about the 2001 tax cut that I voted for, that \n12 of us on my side of the aisle voted for, when times were good, \nbefore 9/11, with\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\na $5.6 trillion surplus and a surplus in our budget 3 years in a row.\n  At the same time that the administration pushes for new tax relief, \nit does little to acknowledge that tax relief already scheduled to \noccur is, in fact, taking place. I don't understand. If I were \nPresident of the United States, I would be out on the hustings saying: \nThe Congress, in 2001, gave you tax relief, Mr. and Mrs. America, and \nthis is what it looks like: In 2001, $41 billion was paid out to \ntaxpayers. In 2002, $71 billion was paid out in tax cuts to taxpayers. \nIn 2003, $90 billion is going to be paid out in tax cuts to taxpayers. \nThat totals, Mr. and Mrs. America, $202 billion that you have already \nor are getting from the 2001 tax cut. And next year, 2004, you will get \nanother $100 billion. That totals over $300 billion being paid out in \ntax cuts today from the 2001 tax cut.\n\n  Why, in our current fiscal circumstances, should we add on such a \nlarge amount of tax relief when that relief is now beginning to take \neffect from the 2001 tax cut? Next year, which is the earliest a new \ntax cut could reasonably take effect, we are already scheduled to see a \n1-percent drop in marginal income tax rates, an increase in the \nindividual estate tax exemption from $1 million to $1.5 million, and \nrelief from the alternative minimum tax, or AMT. So these things are \nhappening as a product of our 2001 tax cut. Why doesn't the President \nspeak about them? That would reassure the American public, I believe.\n  Today I have heard two primary arguments in favor of this tax cut. I \nhave found neither argument to be logical or persuasive. The first \nargument is that the tax cut will be stimulative. In fact, we know it \nwill have little or no stimulative impact as it is currently \nstructured. Let me mention a few of the reasons why.\n  Less than 20 percent of the tax cut can take effect within a year. \nLess than 20 percent of it can take effect within the next year. \nEconomists agree that in order for tax cuts to be stimulative, they \nmust be front loaded, and they must be large enough to make a \nmeaningful impact.\n  The President's package fulfills neither requirement because its \nbenefits largely accrue in the outyears. They would amount to a \nstimulus of less than 1 percent of GDP over the next 12 months.\n  A dynamic analysis of the effect of the package on the economy \npredicts it will generate little or no economic growth. The newly \nappointed head of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas Holz-Eakin, \nrecently conducted CBO's first foray into dynamic scoring. Dynamic \nscoring is a method of economic analysis that looks at the ripple \neffects of tax and spending bills on economic growth beyond their \ndirect cost or benefit.\n  The results of the CBO study were eye opening. The President's tax \ncut proposal was projected to have little or no impact on economic \ngrowth and could actually reduce growth in the later years. The \nadministration's own economic team released data indicating that over \nthe long term, the plan creates few new jobs.\n  The tax cuts included in the plan provide very little bang for the \nbuck.\n  The second argument in favor of the President's tax cut is that \nwithout the threat of large budget deficits, Congress will never act to \nrein in spending. Therefore, large budget deficits are actually a tool \nof responsible government. To me, this argument boggles the mind. Far \nfrom reining in spending, large deficits will actually increase \nspending by sending interest costs on our debt skyrocketing. \nDiscretionary spending over the past several years has, in fact, been \nheld tightly in check, and nearly all new discretionary spending is \nallocated to defense and homeland security.\n  Mr. President, the only way I believe we can return to the path of \nlong-term growth is by balancing our budget and by proving our ability \nto act as long-term stewards of our economy. Right now, the biggest \ndrags on this economy are uncertainty and distrust. Corporate leaders \nremain uncertain about geopolitical developments, such as the war \nagainst Iraq, North Korea, India/Pakistan, and what might happen next, \nand the risk of domestic terrorism. They are holding off investments \nuntil those concerns abate. Consumers share similar concerns and fear \nthe loss of jobs or further deterioration in their retirement savings. \nRemember, large companies have crashed--Enron, Arthur Andersen, Global \nCrossings--and with them went retirement benefits. People have fear, \nand fear has entered the marketplace.\n  At the same time, small investors show little inclination to get back \ninto the stock market as corporate scandals continue. So I believe the \nappropriate medicine for this uncertainty and distrust is strong \nregulatory action by agents such as the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the Accounting Oversight Board, to increase accounting \ntransparency and to stop corporate criminal behavior before it begins.\n  In the Senate, I have tried to push for corporate accountability in \nthe energy sector. God knows it is necessary, and I hope to introduce \nan amendment on the energy bill.\n  The return of investor confidence will have a positive impact on our \nmarkets and our economy. Coupled with strong congressional leadership \ncommitted to keeping our budget in balance, I believe we can quickly \nreturn to healthy rates of economic growth.\n  What will not work, however, is further deficit spending for tax cuts \nwe cannot afford. When I last voted for a tax cut in March of 2001, we \nwere projected to run a $5.6 trillion surplus through 2010. Our \neconomic outlook at that point could not be more different than our \ncurrent circumstances.\n  Now we face cumulative deficits of approximately $2 trillion over 10 \nyears, if interest costs are included. Those are unified deficits and \ndo not reflect the one-time boost we are getting from surpluses in the \nMedicare and Social Security trust funds. If those surpluses were not \nincluded, our deficits over 10 years would add up to over $3 trillion.\n  Unfortunatey, Congress cannot ensure an immediate return to economic \ngrowth. What we can do, however, is prove to those Americans who \ncontribute to the economy that Congress can properly manage the \ngovernment's finances. Yet our current course is taking us in the \nopposite direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose any new tax cuts, no matter what the \nsize, and focus on laying the groundwork for a return to long-term \neconomic growth.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6043-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 14) to enhance the energy security of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Frist-Daschle amendment No. 539, to eliminate methyl \n     tertiary butyl ether from the United States fuel supply, to \n     increase production and use of renewable fuel, and to \n     increase the Nation's energy independence.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the Senate now knows that S. 14, \na comprehensive energy policy, is before the Senate. Obviously, we are \ngoing to have to take some time in this calendar of ours to get it \ndone.\n  We always speak of a comprehensive energy bill and we tell the \ncountry we need one. We have one before us. There are many of us who \nthink it is very good. We won't know how good the Senate thinks it is \nuntil we have had a chance to go through it and vote on it. I am very \nhopeful that those who have amendments will start thinking about coming \ndown here to offer them.\n  The pending amendment is a major one--the so-called ethanol \namendment. That is the bill which establishes a national goal of 5 \nbillion barrels by the year 2012. It is a very important contribution \nto America's independence and a component of the bill, if adopted, when \nadopted, that will create diversification. It will be moving toward \nindependence rather than dependence. Obviously, it has fantastic side \neffects for rural America, agricultural America, which those who have \nbeen working on it for years have already spoken to, and many more \nwill.\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\n  Nonetheless, there are Senators who have concerns about the pending \namendment. There are Senators who want to amend it. I urge and ask \nthose Senators who have amendments to get them down here and let the \nSenate pass judgment on whether it wants the ethanol package that has \nbeen worked on for years, which is bipartisan and was introduced \nessentially by the majority and minority leaders, with cosponsors in \nample numbers from both sides of the aisle as an indication of \nits support. I hope Senators who we understand have amendments will \nbegin to bring them down so we can debate and vote on them.\n\n  I understand that at this point the distinguished Senator from Ohio, \nMr. Voinovich, desires to speak in favor of the amendment. As manager \nof the bill, even though we are operating under no time agreements, I \nyield the floor at this point, assuming he will give his 15-minute \naddress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nthis opportunity to speak in favor of the ethanol amendment, No. 539.\n  This amendment has been offered by the distinguished majority leader \nand the distinguished minority leader. As I have often stated, it is \nabout time this Nation had an energy policy. I have said that, I think, \n3 years in a row. Last year, we worked very hard to come up with what \nwe considered to be a decent package. Unfortunately, that package did \nnot come out of conference committee and we are here today, this week, \nto see if we cannot resurrect part of that and enhance it with some of \nthe improvements that were done in the Energy Committee under the \nchairmanship of Senator Domenici.\n  When the President released his national energy policy in May of \n2001, he noted that America was too dependent upon foreign oil; that we \nneeded to increase our use of renewable fuels, such as ethanol and \nbiodiesel; and that we needed to protect the environment while \nproducing the energy that drives our economy. President Bush was right \nabout that 2 years ago and, quite frankly, the urgency is greater today \nthan it was then.\n  The United States has a responsibility to develop a policy that \nharmonizes the needs of our economy and our environment. These are not \ncompeting needs and too often are looked upon as if they are. A \nsustainable environment is critical to a strong economy. A sustainable \neconomy is critical to providing the funding necessary to improve our \nenvironment.\n  We need a policy that broadens our base of energy resources to create \nstability, guarantee reasonable prices, and protect America's security. \nIt has to be a policy that will keep energy affordable. Finally, it has \nto be a policy that won't cripple the engines of commerce that fund the \nresearch that will yield environmental protection technologies for the \nfuture.\n  I believe that increasing our use of alternative and renewable fuels, \nsuch as ethanol and biodiesel, is a key element in our effort to \nconstruct a viable energy policy.\n  During the last Congress, I worked with a number of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Hagel, Daschle, Jeffords, Inhofe, Grassley, Bond, \nand Bingaman, to develop an ethanol package that would not only \nincrease the use of renewable fuels in America but would provide other \ntangible benefits for the American people. That package was included in \nthe comprehensive energy bill passed by the Senate in an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote.\n  This year, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Inhofe, we were able \nto vote language out of the Environment and Public Works Committee that \nreflects that bipartisan agreement we reached last year on a bipartisan \nbasis. Thanks to the leadership of our distinguished majority and \nminority leaders, as well as a large number of Senators, we again have \nthe opportunity to pass legislation that contains a renewable fuels \npackage.\n  Mr. President, passage of an ethanol bill will protect our national \nsecurity, economy, and our environment. Amendment No. 539 contains the \nlanguage in S. 791, the Renewable Fuels Act of 2003, which was \nintroduced and shepherded through the EPW Committee by Chairman Inhofe. \nThis language establishes a nationwide renewable fuels standard of 5 \nbillion gallons by 2012, repeals the Clean Air Act's oxygenate \nrequirement for reformulated gasoline, and phases down the use of MTBE \nover a 4-year period.\n  This language has strong, bipartisan support and is the result of \nlong negotiation between the Renewable Fuels Association, the National \nCorn Growers Association, the Farm Bureau Federation, the American \nPetroleum Institute, the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use \nManagement, and the American Lung Association.\n  It is hard to get all those people together on any piece of \nlegislation. I think it is wonderful.\n  I happen to come from a State that is an oil State. We have Ashland \nMarathon Oil in Ohio. I also come from a State that has a large number \nof people who belong to the Corn Growers Association. I think we are \nfifth or sixth in the Nation in producing corn.\n  I recall a couple of years ago them coming to me and asking me to \ntake their cause on this particular issue. I suggested to them, rather \nthan do that, I wanted them to go into a room and start to negotiate \nand start talking to each other.\n  I will never forget it. We were in the LBJ Room. I saw a bunch of \npeople on stage at a big news conference. A year before, if anyone had \nsaid those people would stand on the same stage together, they had to \nsay they had something wrong with their head.\n  My colleagues in the Senate should realize this is an unusual \nsituation for all of these people to get together, and that is why it \nis so important that we do not allow any amendments to this very \ncarefully put together compromise by all of these various organizations \nand groups.\n  In fact, I suggest we ought to be looking to do that in so many more \ninstances around here where people just talk past each other instead of \ntalking to each other.\n  It is with no small irony we are discussing issues affecting our \ngasoline supply so shortly after our troops were engaged in a war in \nthe Middle East. As we know, they are still engaged and will be for a \nlong time.\n  While our purpose in Iraq was to end a regime that sought to become \nthe arsenal of terrorism and liberate the Iraqi people from oppression \nand violence, our mere presence in that part of the world highlights \nthe fact that we are entirely too dependent on the oil we import from \nthe Middle East.\n  The amendment the majority leader has offered, a compromise that will \ntriple the amount of domestically produced ethanol used in America, is \none essential tool in reducing our dependence on imported oil.\n  It is no secret we currently import over 58 percent of the oil we \nuse. Last year, we imported an average of 4,558,000 barrels per day \nfrom OPEC countries and 442,000 barrels per day from Iraq. It is \ninteresting; all during the last several years while we were bombing \nIraq occasionally and maintaining the no-fly zone, we were getting an \nenormous amount of oil from Iraq. In some instances, almost 5 percent \nof our oil for this country was coming from Iraq.\n  Again, last year we imported nearly a half million barrels from Iraq. \nThis dependence is not getting better. The Energy Information \nAdministration estimates that our dependency on imported oil could grow \nto nearly 70 percent by 2020.\n  Although our troops were successful in the liberation of Iraq, our \ngreatest energy challenge remains the need to reduce our reliance on \nforeign sources and to meet our energy needs.\n  President Bush has stated repeatedly that energy security is a \ncornerstone for national security, and I agree. It is crucial that we \nbecome less dependent on foreign sources of oil and look more to \ndomestic sources to meet our energy needs, and ethanol is an excellent \ndomestic source. It is a clean-burning, home-grown renewable fuel that \nwe can rely on for generations to come. The renewable fuels standard in \nthis language will displace 1.6 billion barrels of oil.\n\n  Ethanol is not only good for our Nation's economy, tripling the use \nof renewable fuels over the next decade will also reduce our national \ntrade deficit by more than $34 billion. A lot of our trade deficit has \nto do with importing oil. It will increase the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct by $156 billion by 2012. It will create more than 214,000 new\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\njobs. It will expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion. \nIt will save taxpayers $2 billion annually in reduced Government \nsubsidies due to the creation of new markets for corn.\n  The benefits for the farm economy are even more pronounced. Ohio is \nsixth in the Nation in terms of corn production and is among the \nhighest in the Nation in putting ethanol into its gas tanks. Over 40 \npercent of all gasoline in Ohio sold contains ethanol.\n  An increase in the use of ethanol across the Nation means an economic \nboost to thousands of farm families across my State and across the \nStates throughout this country.\n  Currently, ethanol production provides 192,000 jobs and $4.5 billion \nto net farm income nationwide. Passage of this amendment will increase \nnet farm income by nearly $6 billion annually. Passage of this \namendment will create $5.3 billion of new investment in renewable fuels \nproduction capacity.\n  Phasing out MTBE on a national basis will be good for our fuel supply \nbecause refiners are under tremendous strain from having to make \nseveral different gasoline blends to meet various clean air \nrequirements. And no new refineries, as you know, Mr. President, have \nbeen built in the last 25 years.\n  The effects of various State responses to the threat of MTBE \ncontamination, including bans and phaseouts on different schedules, \nwill add a significant burden to existing refineries. That is why we \nhave to get this bill done this year. States are banning it, and \nrefiners are trying to figure out how they are going to deal with this \nnew marketplace.\n  We went through this a couple of years ago when we had a shutdown of \none of the oil supplies from Michigan and then from Texas. They were \nreformulating gas, and we saw the price of gasoline skyrocket at that \ntime.\n  The MTBE phaseout provisions in this package will ensure that \nrefiners will have less stress on their system and that gasoline will \nbe more fungible nationwide. That is very important.\n  Expanding the use of ethanol will also protect our environment by \nreducing auto emissions, which will mean cleaner air and improved \npublic health. Use of ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and \nhydrocarbons by 20 percent. Ethanol also reduces emissions of \nparticulate by 40 percent. Use of ethanol reformulated gas helped move \nChicago into attainment of the Federal ozone standard, the only RFG \narea to see such an improvement.\n  In 2002, ethanol use in the United States reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions by 4.3 million tons, the equivalent of removing more than \n630,000 vehicles from the road.\n  It is my hope and expectation that the Senate will adopt this fuels \npackage. These issues have been in front of us for far too long, and \nnow that we have everybody in the same room at the same time agreeing \nto the same legislation, we need to move it. We need to get this \namendment done. I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 539.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Ohio if he can \nremain in the Chamber for a few moments. An amendment is going to be \noffered to the bill, and I have to be elsewhere. Will the Senator do \nthat for the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I will be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from California.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 542 to Amendment No. 539\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I very much respect the Senator from \nOhio. He has been both a distinguished mayor and a distinguished \nGovernor of his State. I hate to disagree with him, but in this case I \nfind the ethanol mandate in this bill to be egregious, to be \nwrongheaded, to be just terrible public policy. I will go through my \nconcerns about this mandate point by point, and then I will end by \noffering a second-degree amendment.\n  My first concern is this: Only 2.1 billion gallons of ethanol were \nproduced in 2002. The ethanol mandate before us requires 5 billion \ngallons by 2012.\n  This fuel additive is not necessary to make clean-burning gasoline. \nYet it is mandated into our fuel supply. Under the credit trading \nprovisions of the ethanol mandate, States are going to be forced to pay \nfor ethanol whether they use it or not. Let me repeat that. Under the \ncredit trading provisions in this bill, States are going to be forced \nto pay for it, whether they use it or not.\n  Secondly, this is going to drive up the price of gasoline. It can \nonly do so. The Council of Economic Advisers and the Federal Trade \nCommission have advised President Bush that the ethanol mandate is:\n\n       Costly to both consumers and the Government and will \n     provide little environmental benefit.\n\n  So this provision will force up prices. California's costs are \nalready high. I just paid $50 for a tank of gasoline when I was home in \nCalifornia. Wait until this bill goes into operation.\n  Ninety-nine percent of all ethanol production is based in the \nMidwest. States outside the Corn Belt have severe infrastructure and \nethanol supply problems. This, too, means higher gas prices.\n  Finally, we have a dangerously high market concentration in this \nbill. The ethanol industry today is highly concentrated, with the \nlargest supplier, Archer Daniels Midland, controlling 46 percent of the \nmarket, and the top seven firms controlling 71 percent of the market. \nThat is according to the GAO.\n  ADM admitted to price fixing in 1996. Its executives went to jail. \nLast year, ADM purchased its largest competitor, Minnesota Corn \nProcessers, which controlled 5 percent of the ethanol market. I believe \nwe are taking a great risk by allowing one firm to control such a large \npercentage of the ethanol market, and this shows it: 46 percent, ADM; \nWilliams Bio-Energy, 6 percent; Cargill, 5 percent; High Plains \nCorporation, 4 percent; New Energy Corporation, 4 percent; Midwest \nGrain, 3 percent; Chief Ethanol, 3 percent. These are the top seven \nethanol producers in the United States.\n  So you have a huge market concentration by a company that pled guilty \nto price fixing. It makes me, a Californian, very uneasy about what the \nfuture may bring under current law.\n  Gasoline is taxed by the Federal Government at 18.4 cents per gallon. \nYet gasoline blended with ethanol is only taxed at 13.1 cents per \ngallon. The other 5.3 cents per gallon is credited to ethanol producers \ninstead of funding the highway trust fund. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, over the past 20 years, this ethanol \nsubsidy has cost the highway trust fund over $11 billion in foregone \nincome.\n  Under the proposal in the Energy Tax Bill, these ethanol subsidies \nwill be paid not from the highway trust fund, as was before us last \nyear, but from the general fund, at the expense of taxpayers. So \ninstead of spending money for education or Cops on the Beat, or parks, \nwe are funding ethanol with billions in subsidies. It makes no sense to \nme.\n  The Congressional Research Service has indicated that the ethanol \nmandate will cost approximately $7 billion. This means $7 billion is \ndiverted away from either the highway trust fund or the general fund, \nwhich means either we will have fewer jobs and roads or taxpayers will \nhave to pick up the tab.\n  As I said, this future $7 billion loss is on top of the $11 billion \nin gas tax revenue that has already been lost by giving ethanol a \npartial exemption from the fuel tax.\n\n  My sixth reason is that ethanol has mixed environmental and health \nresults. Evidence suggests that ethanol reduces carbon monoxide air \npollution. However, evidence also suggests that mandating more ethanol \nwill produce more smog in the summer months because ethanol produces \nnitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions. Studies also show ethanol \naccelerates the ability of toxic gasoline additives, such as benzene, \nto break apart and seep into the ground water. Recently, the EPA \ndisclosed that ethanol plants are emitting many more dangerous toxins \nthan previously thought. I do not believe we should mandate so much use \nof something we know so little about.\n  One other thing on the benzene plumes, once they break away, they \nactually spread faster in water and soil than MTBE plumes. We know \nbenzene is carcinogenic.\n  My seventh reason is that there is unprecedented liability \nprotection. A safe harbor provision in the ethanol mandate will prevent \nlegal redress if ethanol and other fuel additives harm the environment \nor public health. How\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\nwill communities afford cleanup costs if there is liability protection \nfor ethanol? I find this really egregious.\n  This reduces carbon monoxide but it increases nitrous oxide. The \nbenzene plumes will break away. They spread more rapidly than MTBE. \nThey can pollute our ground water but there is no remedy. There is no \nliability. They are liability-free. One of the reasons you now have the \nlarge oil companies going along with this bill is because they have \nliability protection.\n  So we are mandating something we do not know all of the results of in \nhuge amounts, that are unnecessary in the first place, that may have \nadverse consequences, and then we are saying to the consumer, sorry, \nthe damage is your problem, you cannot even go to court to get redress \nin the form of damages. What a sweetheart bill. My goodness, people \nshould be embarrassed.\n  Ethanol already has a high tariff to keep imports out. If there is an \nethanol shortage in the United States, States will not be able to \nimport ethanol from countries abroad because of a high 54-cent-per-\ngallon tariff on foreign ethanol. So what are they doing? They already \nhave a high tariff on foreign ethanol. Now we are mandating 5 billion \ngallons? That is egregious. It is wrong public policy.\n  My ninth reason is an ethanol mandate will strain the fuel supply. \nUsing ethanol will constrict the overall gasoline supply because mixing \nMTBE with gasoline produces more fuel than mixing gasoline with \nethanol. Consequently, in a State such as California where you have no \nextra refinery availability, you have to produce more than you did with \nMTBE because of the properties of ethanol which take more gasoline. \nThat is going to be a real problem and that, too, will force up prices.\n  Tenth, ethanol is not a renewable fuel. According to many scientists \nand experts, including Cornell Professor David Pimentel, it takes more \nenergy to make ethanol than we save by using it. So we can hardly call \nethanol a renewable fuel.\n  Eleven, the ethanol mandate will largely benefit producers, not \nfarmers. Ethanol subsidies pay more money to ethanol producers like ADM \nthan farmers.\n  Twelve, the bottom line, this is a very bad deal. The ethanol mandate \nreflects a deal worked out behind closed doors, between ethanol \nlobbyists and oil interests that is going to harm consumers. Mandating \n5 billion gallons by 2012 is terrible public policy. Since there are \nhigh costs for States like California to comply with any mandated \nFederal fuel requirement, these costs will only be passed on to drivers \nat the pump.\n  The ethanol mandate, as I have said, will drive up the price of \ngasoline. Instead of imposing a new mandate on our fuel supply, we \nshould be lifting the one that already exists.\n  On July 29, 1999, the nonpartisan broad-based U.S. EPA blue ribbon \npanel on oxygenates and gasoline recommended that the 2 percent \noxygenate requirement be removed in order to provide flexibility to \nblend adequate fuel supplies in a cost-effective manner while quickly \nreducing usage of MTBE and maintaining air quality benefits.\n  It is long past the time for Congress to act on that. Instead of \nmandating ethanol into our fuel supply, we should be lifting all \nmandates or at least allow States a choice. We need to provide \nflexibility to refiners to allow them to optimize how and what they \nblend instead of forcing them to blend gasoline with MTBE or ethanol.\n  California has long sought a waiver of the 2 percent oxygenate \nrequirement. I have written and called former EPA Administrator Browner \nand the current Administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, both former \nPresident Clinton and President Bush, urging approval of the waiver for \nthe State. Yet both the Clinton administration and the Bush \nadministration have denied California's request. I know during the \nClinton years an affirmative finding came from EPA to the White House. \nI also know that Members of both parties went to the White House to \nstop it from happening. I believe EPA would have no objection.\n  In the campaign, when I heard both Al Gore and George Bush say: We \nare for ethanol--I thought, oh boy, here it comes. And here it is \ntoday.\n  MTBE, methyl tertiary butyl ether, has been the oxygenate of choice \nby main refiners in their effort to comply with the Clean Air Act's \nreformulated gasoline requirements. Governor Davis of California has \nordered a phaseout of MTBE in our State by the end of this year while \nthe Federal law requiring 2 percent oxygenate remains, putting our \nState in an untenable position. This is because the most likely \nsubstitute for MTBE to meet the 2 percent requirement is ethanol, but \nit is tremendously costly to blend ethanol from the Midwest into the \nspecially formulated California gasoline.\n  Without eliminating these mandates, we can expect disruptions and \nprice spikes during the peak driving months of this summer on top of \nthe high prices motorists are already paying. Just remember, you heard \nit here.\n  California has developed a gasoline formula that provides flexibility \nand provides clean air. Refiners use an approach called the predictive \nmodel which guarantees clean-burning RFG gas with oxygenates, with less \nthan 2 percent oxygenates and with no oxygenates.\n  As Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said \nin March before the Energy Committee:\n\n       Refiners have been saying for years that they can produce \n     gasoline meeting clean-burning fuels and federal reformulated \n     gasoline requirements without the use of oxygenates. . . . In \n     addition, reformulated blendstocks--the base into which \n     oxygenates are added--typically meet RFG requirements before \n     oxygenates are added.\n\n  So they are not necessary. These facts demonstrate oxygenates are not \nnecessary.\n  I believe it is egregious to require this Nation to use more ethanol \nthan we need in our fuel supply. Mandating 5 billion gallons into our \nfuel supply is terrible public policy. This amounts to a wealth \ntransfer of billions of dollars from every State in the Nation to a \nhandful of ethanol producers. It is families and businesses who will \npay the higher costs that result from increased gas prices.\n  This sweeping policy will have long-term repercussions in our \nenvironment, on our health, our fuel supply, and the price of gasoline. \nSince ethanol production is subsidized by the Government with a credit \nfrom the Federal motor fuels tax, $1 for ethanol firms like ADM means \n$1 less to improve our Nation's roads and bridges.\n  The Congressional Research Service has indicated the ethanol mandate \nin this energy bill will divert $7 billion away from the highway trust \nfund. If the energy tax bill is passed into law, this money will no \nlonger come from the highway trust fund. It will come from the general \nfund. As I said, it will be paid for by taxpayers.\n  This future $7 billion payout is on top of the $11 billion in gas tax \nrevenue that has already been lost by giving ethanol a partial \nexemption from the fuel tax. Ethanol is a subsidized product. It is \nprotected from foreign competition by high trade barriers. And now we \nare going to mandate a market for it. This is unconscionable. Forcing \nStates to use ethanol we do not need, and forcing States to pay for \nethanol we do not use amounts to a transfer of wealth from all States \nto Midwest corn States.\n  Under the credit trading provisions in this bill, if we do not use \nethanol, we still have to pay for it.\n  Proponents of the ethanol mandate argue that gas price increases will \nbe minimal, but the projections do not take into consideration the \nreal-world infrastructure constraints and concentration in the market \nthat can lead to price spikes. I believe everyone outside of the \nMidwest will have to grapple with how to bring ethanol to their States \nsince the Midwest controls 99 percent of the production.\n  California has done more analysis than any other State on what it \nwill take to get ethanol to the State. The bottom line is that it \ncannot happen without raising gasoline prices.\n  I am particularly concerned, as I pointed out, about the limited \nnumber of suppliers in the ethanol market. This leaves consumers \nvulnerable to price spikes as it did when electricity and natural gas \nprices soared in the West because a few out-of-State generating firms \ndominated the market. If we have learned anything from the recent \nwestern energy crisis, it is that when there is not ample supply and \nadequate competition in the market, prices soar and consumers pay.\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\n  I also mention that Archer Daniels Midland is the dominant producer \nin the highly concentrated ethanol market. It has purchased its largest \ncompetitor. It controls 46 percent of the market, and that is only what \nis now produced. The company has an even greater control over how \nethanol is distributed and marketed.\n  I am also concerned about the long-term effects of mandating such a \nlarge amount of ethanol in our gasoline supply.\n  I mentioned the health effects about which we do not know much. I \nmentioned the environmental effects.\n  The scientific evidence is mixed. I believe it is bad public policy \nto mandate this amount before scientific and health experts can fully \ninvestigate the impact of ethanol on the air we breathe and the water \nwe drink.\n  We made this mistake with MTBE and now we have learned that MTBE may \nwell be a human carcinogen.\n  Ethanol is often made out to be an ideal renewable fuel, giving off \nfewer emissions. Yet, on balance, ethanol can be a cause of more air \npollution because it produces smog in the summer months. Smog is a \npowerful respiratory irritant that affects large segments of the \npopulation, and it has an especially pernicious effect on the elderly, \non children, and individuals with existing respiratory problems, as I \nmentioned, such as asthma.\n  Earlier this month, the American Lung Association named California \nthe smoggiest State, by listing nine counties and six metropolitan \nareas as having the worst conditions. A 1999 report from the National \nAcademy of Sciences found:\n\n       The use of commonly available oxygenates [like ethanol] in \n     reformulated gasoline has little impact on improving ozone \n     air quality and has some disadvantages. Moreover, some data \n     suggest that oxygenates can lead to higher Nitrogen Oxide \n     emissions.\n\n  Nitrogen oxides, as we have said, cause smog.\n  The American Lung Association report also noted that half of \nAmericans are living in counties with unhealthy smog levels. Why would \nwe want to take the chance of increasing these unhealthy smog levels by \nmandating billions of unnecessary gallons of ethanol into our fuel \nsupply?\n  Ethanol can be both good and bad for air quality. To me, it would \nmake sense to maximize the advantages of ethanol while minimizing the \ndisadvantages. This is exactly why States should have flexibility to \ndecide what goes into their gasoline in order to meet clean air \nstandards. All we should care about is if the clean air standards are \nmet. Let the States have the flexibility. If we are mandating, why \nexempt manufacturers and refiners from their legal responsibility to \nprovide a safe product?\n  Evidence also suggests that ethanol accelerates the ability of toxins \nfound in gasoline to seep into our ground water supplies. The EPA Blue \nRibbon Panel on Oxygenates found ethanol:\n\n       . . . may retard biodegradation and increase movement of \n     benzene and other hydrocarbons around leaking tanks.\n\n  According to a report by the State of California entitled ``Health \nand Environmental Assessment of the Use of Ethanol as a Fuel \nOxygenate,'' there are valid questions about the impact of ethanol on \nground and surface water. An analysis in the report found that there \nwill be a 20-percent increase in public drinking water wells \ncontaminated with benzene if a significant amount of ethanol is used. \nBenzene is a known human carcinogen, and we are giving them liability \nprotection.\n  At a hearing held on the House side last year, Professor Gordon \nRausser of UC Berkeley commented on the potential harm of ethanol in \nthe ground water. Professor Rausser testified:\n\n       When gasoline that contains ethanol is released into ground \n     water, the resulting benzene plumes can be longer and more \n     persistent than plumes resulting from releases of \n     conventional gasoline. Research suggests that the presence \n     of ethanol in gasoline will delay the degradation of \n     benzene and will lengthen the benzene plumes by between 25 \n     percent and 100 percent.\n\n  This evidence on the potential harm of ethanol is extraordinarily \ntroubling.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support the amendment offered by the \nmajority leader. I would like to offer a second-degree amendment that \nwould require the Governor of a State to opt into the ethanol mandate. \nIf the ethanol mandate is such a great mandate, then Governors should \nwant to include their States in it. Why are we forcing them to do it? \nEverybody who comes down here for ethanol says it is the best thing \nsince sliced bread. If it is so good, let that case be made to the \nGovernors of States and let them opt into the program.\n  The Senators from Alaska and Hawaii have worked it out so that their \nStates are exempted from this mandate. I believe each and every State \nshould have this choice, so I am sending an amendment to the desk at \nthis time that would do the same thing that Alaska and Hawaii have \nachieved. The Governor is able to opt into the mandate. If this is so \nwonderful, Governors will opt in. If it is not, Governors will not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 542 to amendment No. 539.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize the Governors of the States to elect to \n               participate in the renewable fuel program)\n\n       Section 211(o)(2) of the Clean Air Act (as added by the \n     amendment) is amended by inserting after subparagraph (B) the \n     following:\n       ``(C) Election by states.--The renewable fuel program shall \n     apply to a State only if the Governor of the state notifies \n     the Administrator that the State elects to participate in the \n     renewable fuel program.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask the floor leader, the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, what is his pleasure? I understand there are no votes \ntoday. Shall I ask the amendment be set aside?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, I believe we will leave the amendment pending. The \norder is not that there will be no votes today but, rather, no votes \nuntil all Senators have returned. It could be this evening, but there \nis no order to do that or not to do it at this point, so it will remain \nthe pending amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to yield momentarily to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, who has worked for many years on this \namendment. Suffice it to say, every argument the distinguished Senator \nfrom California made, and she made many of them, has been brought \nbefore the Committee on Environment and Public Works. They have been \nraised time and time again at many of the informal and formal hearings \nregarding this legislation. In the end, in the interest of getting \nsomething done that was uniform and that would work, they have all been \ndenied. Efforts as she has put before us have been denied heretofore. I \nsubmit it is time for the Senate, at the earliest possible time, when \nwe can, to vote. We should turn it down and leave in effect the \nnational policy that is before us on ethanol, that has been so \neloquently discussed on a number of occasions already in the Senate, \nand even today discussed by the distinguished Senator from the State of \nOhio.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Ohio for further comments. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I respectfully disagree with some of the information that was \nprovided to us by the distinguished Senator from California. First, I \nwould like to say this second-degree amendment would create more \nbalkanization of the fuel supply. We need a national fuel policy. This \namendment, in my opinion, would further constrain the fuel supply in \nthis country.\n  The bipartisan agreement that was negotiated last year between \nvarious organizations was not done behind closed doors. It was \nrelatively transparent. In spite of some of the comments made about the \nenvironmental threat of ethanol, that agreement was supported by the \nAmerican Lung Association. I am sure if they had any concern that this \nwas going to harm the environment, they certainly would not have signed \non to the agreement that was entered into last year.\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\n  The fuels agreement passed by the Senate last year includes the \nestablishment of a renewable fuels standard. The RFS would provide for \ngreater refinery flexibility in the fuels marketplace and the existing \nclean air oxygenate requirement, particularly as MTBE is phased out of \ngasoline. It does not require that a single gallon of renewable fuels \nbe used in any particular State or region. Rather, the requirement is \non refiners.\n\n  The RFS will allow much greater flexibility in the use of oxygenates, \nwhich should reduce the chances that localized supply disruptions of \ngasoline or oxygenates will result in retail supply shortages and price \nspikes.\n  The additional flexibility provided by the RFS credit trading \nprovisions in the House and Senate bills would result in much lower \ncosts to refiners and thus to consumers. The credit trading system will \nensure that renewable fuels are used when and where it is most cost \neffective to do so.\n  In California, according to the information I have, nearly all of the \nrefiners have voluntarily switched from MTBE to ethanol in advance of \nthe State's MTBE phaseout deadline of January 1, 2004. The results can \nonly be described as seamless. There have been no ethanol shortages, \ntransportation delays, or logistical problems associated with the \nincreased use of ethanol in the State.\n  In fact, according to an April 2003 California Energy Commission \nreport, the transition to ethanol, which began in January of 2003, is \nprogressing without any major problems. Today, approximately 65 percent \nof all California gasoline is blended with ethanol, and it is estimated \nthat 80 percent of the fuel will contain ethanol by the summer.\n  As a result, while only about 100 million gallons of ethanol were \nused in the State last year, California refiners will use between 600 \nand 700 million gallons in 2003. Thus, efforts to carve out California \nfrom the RFS, while unjustified, are also completely unnecessary.\n  I would also like to make the point that any State may petition EPA \nfor a waiver of the renewable fuels requirement for any year. If EPA, \nin consultation with the Departments of Energy and Agriculture, finds \nthat there would be substantial harm to the economy or environment of a \nState, region, or the United States, or that there would be an \ninadequate domestic supply for distribution capacity to meet the \nrequirement, EPA may reduce the volume of renewable fuel required in \nwhole or in part. Such a waiver would be good for 1 year but could be \nrenewed. Under this circumstance, the overall renewable fuel volume \nrequirement would be reduced nationwide.\n  In addition, I would like to point out that the use of ethanol \nsignificantly reduces the tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide, an \nozone precursor, and VOCs and fine particulates that pose a health \nthreat to children, seniors, and those with respiratory ailments. \nPerhaps that is one of the reasons the American Lung Association is \nsupporting this compromise.\n  Importantly, renewable fuels help to reduce greenhouse gases emitted \nfrom vehicles, including carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases that \ncontribute to global warming--another answer to the problem of carbons.\n  The fuels agreement included protects against any backsliding on air \nquality. First, the agreement tightens the toxic requirements of \nreformulated gasoline by moving the baseline that refiners must meet to \n1999-2000. Secondly, refiners have agreed to meet southern-tier RFG \nstandards for VOC emissions.\n  Other adjustments to the existing mobile source air toxics rule will \nensure additional environmental protections. The agreement allows \nStates and the Ozone Transport Assessment Group--I have been dealing \nwith that group for many years and have had some large disagreements \nwith them, but the agreement allows them to opt into RFG whether the \nState is in attainment for ozone or not.\n\n  Finally, the bill allows EPA, as I mentioned before, to waive a \nState's volatility to tolerance for ethanol-blended fuels, if \nnecessary, for air quality. In other words, if there is a problem with \nethanol in a period of time, the State can waive out of the requirement \nduring that period of time.\n  I could say many other things, but I think most of the issues raised \ncan be answered very easily. The last thing I would like to point out \ndeals with the issue of cost. The Department of Agriculture has \nconcluded that the ethanol tax incentive program actually--actually--\nsaves the Government money by reducing farm program costs and \nstimulating rural economies. This is a big deal for rural economies in \nthe United States of America.\n  I will also say that there was some statement about Archer Daniels \nMidland being the big supplier. In my State, the farmers and \ncooperatives are in the process of going forward with building \nprocessing plants for ethanol. You are going to have a lot more people \nin the marketplace when this legislation passes.\n  The USDA has stated that the net impact of the tax incentive on farm \nprograms is a net savings of more than $3 billion annually. I point \nout, just as I mentioned before, there are 11 new ethanol facilities or \nunder construction in the United States. Twenty or more ethanol \nfacilities are in the planning stages.\n  Last but not least, the concern that has been raised regarding the \nFederal ethanol tax incentive's impact on the highway trust fund has \nbeen addressed in legislation introduced by Senators Grassley and \nBaucus. It is supported by a broad coalition of transportation, local \ngovernment, business, and agricultural people. The proposal returns \nfull funding to the highway trust fund while restructuring and \npreserving the Federal tax incentives for ethanol.\n  So on all of these points, this amendment that we have offered, that \nis being sponsored by the majority leader and the minority leader, and \nso many Members of the Senate, is good for America, is good for our \neconomy, is good for our security, and is good for the environment. And \nthe amendment from the Senator from California, I think, would \ncertainly make it less effective, if it were agreed to by the Senate. I \nurge its defeat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to address the Senate for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              health care\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this past weekend my wife and I met up \nwith some life-long friends from my home area of East Saint Louis, IL. \nWe had a good time together. We sat around and talked about our lives \nand some of the challenges we face.\n  My friends own a small business. It is a trucking company with about \nsix or eight employees, and about the same number of trucks. It has \nbeen in their family for decades. They are very proud of it. They put \ntheir life work into it. We talk about business every time I see them. \nThis time the conversation was not so much about business; it was about \nan issue which was clearly on their minds, and I believe the minds of \nsmall and large businessmen across America. The issue was health \ninsurance.\n  Something they had taken for granted for so many years has now become \na challenge not only to their business but to their personal lives. A \nfew years ago, one of their employees' wives had a baby with some \nserious medical problems. As a result of that, when the health \ninsurance for their small company came up for renewal the next year, \nthey saw their premiums double.\n  This small company struggling to get by was faced with an impossible \nburden, how to continue to provide health insurance for the families \nand the workers in their employ at costs that were now out of reach. \nThey tried for a year. When the rates continued to go up, in \ndesperation they made a desperate decision. They called their employees \nin and said: We can no longer offer health insurance to you as an \nemployee of this company. We will give you the amount of money we were \npaying monthly as a premium as an increase in your pay, but you have to \ngo out in the open market and find health insurance.\n  The sad reality is one of the families, the one with the sick child, \ncould not find health insurance, and still has not. The others found it \nwith costs going up every year. But that was not the end of the story. \nThey went on to tell me the insurance they now have to buy in the open \nmarket is almost worthless. If they should ever turn in a claim during \nthe course of the year for any medical problem, they can count in the \nnext year that that will be excluded from coverage and protection. If \nyou have a problem with your foot, of any kind, in the next year the \nhealth insurance policy offered to you will exclude anything to deal \nwith feet, either one of them, any condition.\n  The woman told me at this get-together: When I go to get a mammogram \nnow and they ask me who my doctor is, I tell them I do not have one. \nSend the results to me personally. She said: I try to decide whether or \nnot something serious has been found. I cannot let this get into my \nmedical records because, frankly, I will find an exclusion to coverage \nif any question is raised.\n  This was a very startling conversation for me. It was an eye opener. \nWhat troubled me the most about this, I do this for a living. I am a \nSenator, and I am proud of it. I have devoted my life to public service \nand I hope I have done some good, but when my friends, family members, \nand businesses across my State all come to me with the same concern \nover and over again, I cannot explain the feeling of helplessness and \nfrustration I have.\n\n  I think about that in the context of the debate in which we are \nengaged. Of all the debate in the last several years in Washington, DC, \nof all of the proposals from this administration and from the leaders \nin this Congress, why is it we can never get close to the issues that \nreally count, the issues that are tearing families and businesses \napart? The cost of health insurance is one of those issues. As a \nnation, is it expensive for us to try to come up with a new approach \nwhich says that every American, regardless of their wealth or poverty, \nwill have a basic level of protection of health insurance? That cannot \nbe beyond us.\n  This is a country and a society which took a look at its impoverished \nparents and grandparents over 50 years ago and said, we are going to \ncreate Social Security. We want these people whom we love to live in \ndignity. This is the same country and society which in the 1960s took a \nlook at the same parents and grandparents and said, for goodness sakes, \nthey ought to have basic health insurance. If they have retired, we are \ngoing to create Medicare. And we did. This is a country which stepped \nback and said we are no longer going to discriminate against people \nbecause of their disabilities or handicaps. We are going to provide \nthem protection, and we did.\n  Time and time again, we have risen to the challenge. But what do we \nhave before us now? A debate on the floor of the Senate about a tax \ncut, the range of the cost of this tax cut over a 10-year period, $420 \nbillion to $550 billion, a significant sum of money, on top of a tax \ncut we just passed 2 years ago.\n  How will this tax cut benefit my friends who are struggling with the \ncost of health insurance? How will it benefit families across America \nwho cannot find health insurance and cannot find work? The answer, \nsadly, is that it is not designed to help them at all.\n  President Bush comes before us with a tax cut proposal that is a \nnonstarter. It serves his political philosophy, which is to propose a \ntax cut whether we are in good times or bad, but it does not serve \nAmerica and its needs. Our fear of government, our fear of working \ncollectively to solve problems, has driven this Senate and this \nCongress away from the reality of the challenges of life in America.\n  We passed a bill called No Child Left Behind. The President said: \nThis is my answer to education in America. And then the President comes \nback and refuses to fund it. It is an unfunded mandate on the schools \nof Illinois, Ohio, New Mexico, and Nevada, when these States are facing \ndeficits.\n  When it comes to health care, this administration has no proposals or \nsuggestions to help the families and businesses struggling to provide \nhealth insurance to cover their kids.\n  When it comes to prescription drugs, there is lip service--nothing \nthat will provide real and meaningful relief from the cost of \nprescription drugs, particularly for senior citizens and disabled \npeople.\n  Instead, what are we suggesting? We are discussing a tax cut with the \nBush approach, a tax cut that will say to people making over a million \ndollars in income a year, this elite class will receive about $90,000 \nmore in breaks from the Federal Government.\n  What is wrong with this picture? I will tell my colleagues what is \nwrong, from my point of view. It depends on one's outlook on the future \nof America. If they believe the future of America is driven and \ncontrolled by elite investors, the highest-income people in America, \nthen they should sign on quickly to the Bush tax cut. That is what it \nis designed to do, to provide to those elite investors, those dividend \nearners, extra benefits so they can have a more comfortable life and \nperhaps spend their money in ways to help the economy. That is the Bush \napproach. For most Republicans--not all,\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\nbut for most Republicans--that is their approach.\n\n  There are others, such as myself, who take a different approach. We \nbelieve the future of this country has always been based on hard-\nworking families, those middle income working families which have made \nthis country great. They have played by the rules. They paid their \ntaxes. They have raised their families. They have been conscientious in \nmaking certain their schools and neighborhoods are strong and safe.\n  What do we give them in this tax cut? Not $90,000 a year, like the \nmillionaires in the Bush tax cut, but around $400 or $500 a year. That \nis not fair and it is not right. It is what we face time and time again \nwhen it comes to dealing with the problems across America.\n  This week, the Senate will consider amendments to this tax bill. \nRepublicans and Democrats will be given choices as to whether they want \nto cut taxes at the highest levels in the highest brackets or whether \nthey want to provide real tax relief to working families and small \nbusinesses across America. The choices will be stark. They will \ncontrast our attitude toward life and our attitude toward America's \nfuture.\n  Is it worth it to reduce the tax cuts of people making over $300,000 \na year or give a tax credit to small businesses that offer health \ninsurance to their employees? I would like to take that issue back to \nIllinois. In fact, I will take it back to any State, and I know what I \nwill hear from small businesspeople and their workers: For goodness \nsakes, it does not make any sense to give a tax cut to people making \nover $300,000 a year. Give a helping hand to the families struggling to \nget by.\n  Senator Schumer of New York is going to offer his amendment, which \ngoes to the heart of the future of America. It goes to the cost of \neducation.\n\n  We now know what happens to young men and women, accepted to the best \nschools, finally graduate and find themselves deep in debt. Senator \nSchumer and others and I have joined to offer an amendment that says \nthe cost of college education should be deductible so families wanting \nto give their kids the best, wanting their kids to achieve the most in \ntheir lives, will have a helping hand from this Government.\n  What makes more sense, a tax break for an individual already \nsuccessful in America making over $300,000 a year or a tax deduction \nfor a working family whose son or daughter has been accepted to the \ncollege of their dreams, the best school possible, who just need a \nhelping hand from this country so they can be all that they can be, \nachieve greatness?\n  That is an easy call, too. I will take that home to Illinois, and I \ninvite President Bush to come to Illinois and debate that. Pick the \ntown, Mr. President. Whether he is going to be visiting Nebraska or \nIndiana, I would like the people in those environs to have the choice \nthe Senate will face this week, choices that are meaningful.\n  I close on this point. We have lost more jobs under this President \nthan anyone ever imagined. In the Clinton 8 years, 22 million new jobs \nwere created in America. Under the Bush administration, with this \nrecession, we have lost more than 2 million jobs. In fact, we have lost \nmore than 2 million jobs since the President's last tax cut, that \nfailed policy which took more than $1 trillion from the Treasury and \ndid not create jobs in America. It was a failure then and this \nreplacement, even if it is smaller, will fail as well.\n  Sadly, the unemployed people across America are reaching a level of \ndesperation. They cannot find jobs in this economy with this recession.\n  My home State of Illinois announced last week an unemployment rate of \n6.3 percent. We are in the top four States of unemployment across \nAmerica.\n  I met some of the workers while I was back this weekend. One man who \nwas in the communications industry lost his job last December after \nworking more than 30 years. He is desperately looking for a job and \ndoes not know which way to turn.\n  Unemployed people like him across America, victims of this recession, \ncannot get a helping hand from this Bush administration. The helping \nhand is extended to the wealthy, to the millionaires, to those with all \nthe dividends who want all the tax breaks, but no helping hand to the \npoor unemployed family member trying to keep it going.\n  During President Bush's father's recession in the early 1990s, we \nextended unemployment benefits five different times; three times under \nPresident Bush senior, twice under President Clinton. In this \nadministration, with this terrible recession, we have extended them \nonly twice. Individuals are falling off eligibility. What happens to a \nperson unemployed, no longer eligible for unemployment compensation?\n  You can count on the following: First, they will find it difficult to \npay their utility bills. Second, they will find they have to make real \nsacrifices on the basis of family, food, clothing. You will find many \nof them moving in with family and friends. You can count on one of the \nfirst items to go being health insurance. They have just enough money \nnot to qualify for Medicaid for the poor but sadly not enough money to \nprovide health insurance for their family.\n  Over the weekend, my friends talked about health insurance and said, \nwe feel very badly for people who are poor, those who are unemployed, \nbut it is the working families of America who are losing today. This \ntax break, this $400 to $500 billion tax bill, ignores those families, \nignores that reality, and in ignoring that reality, it calls into \nquestion whether those who have dedicated our time to public service \nare really listening to the people we represent.\n  I hope during the course of this week as we debate this bill and we \ndebate the debt limit, as we get into these important issues, some of \nmy friends on both sides of the aisle will reflect on what they have \nheard at home from the real working families of America. They need \nhelp. The Bush tax program does not help. It is irresponsible. It is \nunfair. It will not move this economy forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak as \nin morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici and Mr. Reid pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1051 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is pending \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Feinstein second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Feinstein second-degree amendment to the ethanol \namendment to S. 14, the comprehensive energy bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I might say, if anyone cares to speak on either the \namendment or the underlying bill or, for that matter, the comprehensive \nenergy bill, the floor is open for that purpose. I have asked the \nmajority leader if it would be appropriate to have a vote on the \nFeinstein amendment, a vote on it or in respect to it, this evening. He \nhas indicated that sometime after 7 o'clock that might be in order. I \nam not asking for that at this point, but I am just saying to Senators \nthat probably will happen.\n  If there are no other Senators desiring to do so, I will myself move \nto table it sometime after 7 o'clock, when it is deemed appropriate by \nthe majority and minority leaders.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Relief for Tchisou Tho\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for giving me this opportunity to make this presentation. \nI am very appreciative.\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\n  I wish to talk about a young man I read about in the Minneapolis Star \nTribune last Friday. It was the story of Tchisou Tho, an 18-year-old \ncurrently facing two situations: in three weeks, high school graduation \nand, in one day, the threat of deportation.\n  Yesterday, I introduced legislation that would grant citizenship to \nTchisou, a senior at Como Park High School in St. Paul, MN who would \nbecome the first member of his family to attain a high school diploma.\n  In 1975, Tchisou's parents fled Communist rule in Laos and settled \ntheir family in France. At age 5, with his parents having visitors' \nvisas, Tchisou's family came to the United States, first settling in \nCalifornia before eventually moving to Minnesota in 1993, mainly for \nthe quality schools and educational opportunities for their children. \nAs Tchisou's mother commented, ``We consider it a precious thing to \nwear the gown and receive the diploma with honor and applause.''\n  The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service states that the Tho \nfamily defied a judge's order to leave the United States voluntarily \nbefore March 26 of this year. Mr. and Mrs. Tho had been granted work \nauthorizations, but a meeting with immigration officials to request \nmodifications of their status resulted in knowledge of the March \ndeadline and consequently the deportation order.\n  I have great respect for the folks of Immigration. They do their job. \nthey do it well. They are following the law. Unfortunately, Tchisou is \na good kid experiencing a bad situation.\n  The sins of the parents should not automatically fall upon the \nshoulders of the children. Actively involved in his church, Tchisou \nteaches Sunday school, belongs to the youth group, and sings in the \nchoir. At Como Park High, he is registered for challenging courses such \nas advanced-placement calculus. Furthermore, Tchisou has been accepted \nby the University of Minnesota, where he plans on studying either \naerospace engineering or natural resources.\n  The situation Tchisou faces is not all that uncommon. It is a \ncircumstance that, I am sorry to say, many children have to experience. \nIn response, it is my understanding that my good friend and colleague \nSenator Hatch reintroduce the Dream Act in the near future, a bill that \nwill address tough circumstances such as this, in a comprehensive \nmanner, and I look forward to working with Senator Hatch on this \nimportant legislation. However, Tchisou can't wait for the Dream Act to \nbecome law, and that is why I introduced private relief legislation for \nhim last night.\n  Mr. President, good kids like Tchisou should not pay for the mistakes \nof others. Tchisou should graduate from high school with his friends, \nand I believe the bill I introduced last night will make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we are speaking as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not the order of business. The Senate \ncurrently has before it the Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   The Real Cure for Our Sick Economy\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the health of the American economy has \nbeen deteriorating for more than 2 years and the patient's vital signs \nare getting steadily worse.\n  President Bush's response has been to prescribe sugar pills--tax cuts \nfor the wealthy that may taste good for a moment but do nothing to cure \nthe patient's illness. Like a quack doctor who knows only one remedy, \nwhile the patient keeps getting worse despite the treatment, the \nPresident just keeps prescribing larger and larger doses of sugar \npills. The Bush administration's policies will never revive this sick \neconomy.\n  I am deeply concerned about the continued stagnation of the economy. \nUnemployment is still on the rise. We climbed to 6 percent in April. \nThere are now 8.8 million men and women unemployed across the Nation. \nThe economy has lost more than a half million jobs in just the past 3 \nmonths, and there is no end in sight. In the absence of an effective \nstimulus from the Federal Government, the economy is not likely to \nimprove quickly.\n  Behind such disturbing statistics are people who need our help. A \nstrong economy allows working men and women to have greater control \nover their lives and more opportunity to pursue their personal dreams. \nA stagnant economy takes much of that control out of their hands, \nleaving families vulnerable to circumstances they cannot control.\n  Across America in the last 2 years, workers have lost their job \nsecurity. As layoffs mount, they live in fear of being the next to be \nlet go. There are 2.7 million fewer private sector jobs in America \ntoday than there were in January of 2001. Those looking for a job are \nfinding it increasingly difficult to obtain one. The number of long-\nterm unemployed has tripled.\n  The pain caused by this destructive wave of economic stagnation is \nnot limited to those who have lost their jobs. Health insurance is \nbecoming less and less affordable for workers and their families across \nthe country. The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that over \nthe course of a year, 60 million Americans go without health insurance. \nOne in ten small businesses which offered their employees health \ninsurance in 2000, no longer do so.\n  Nationally, the average cost of health insurance is rising at double \ndigit rates, up by 11 percent in 2001, and another 12.7 percent in 2002 \nnearly 4 times the rate of inflation. The health care squeeze on \nworking families is getting tighter and tighter.\n  Senior citizens who desperately need prescription drug coverage are \nsuffering, too. While their incomes are stagnating because of low \nSocial Security cost-of-living adjustments, the cost of prescription \ndrugs is escalating at double digit rates, increasing an average of 16 \npercent each year. Children who are being asked to do more in school \nare receiving less support. School districts faced with declining tax \nreceipts have increased class sizes, cut weeks from school calendars, \nand laid off teachers. Our economy's inability to support public \neducation is setting up America's children to fail in the global \nmarketplace.\n  There is a crisis in public higher education as well that has been \ncreated by a weak economy. States are being forced to sharply cut aid \nto public colleges. State and community colleges in turn have increased \ntuition to an unprecedented rate to cope with State budget cuts.\n  Nationally, the gap between the cost of college tuition and the \ntuition assistance provided by the Federal Government has grown by \n$1,900 in the last 2 years.\n  Millions of families have seen their retirement savings seriously \neroded. The value of savings in 401(k) plans and other defined \ncontribution plans has declined by $473 billion in the last 2 years.\n  These are the realities American families face today.\n  It is imperative that the National Government respond to the growing \neconomic crisis. There is much the Government can do to stimulate \neconomic growth in the near term without generating huge deficits that \nwill undermine prosperity in the long term. Unfortunately, the Bush \nadministration has consistently refused to follow such a course of \naction.\n  Historically, Republicans and Democrats have had fundamentally \ndifferent views on how to strengthen the economy. Republicans believe \nif you give tax breaks to the wealthiest taxpayers, they will invest \nmore and the economy will grow. It is called trickle-down economics. \nThe problem with this theory is the wealthy may not immediately use the \nmoney to create jobs and expand production. If there is no demand \nbecause consumers are not buying, companies will not produce more. They \nwill just wait until the economic climate improves.\n  Democrats believe that tax relief and public resources should go to \nAmerica's working families. They are the ones who are struggling most \nin this brutal economy, and they will quickly spend the money. They \nwill create the demand which is needed to get the economy moving again.\n  It is an old debate. We have very different approaches to stimulating \nthe economy. Republicans keep making the same mistake. If trickle-down \neconomics worked, the economy would not\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\nbe stagnating today. In 2001, at President Bush's insistence, Congress \npassed one of the largest tax cuts in history, and wealthy taxpayers \ngot the lion's share of the tax benefits. America has lost more than \n2.5 million jobs since the first Bush tax cut passed. The Republican \nresponse is more of the same. But the American people want a new \napproach.\n  The President has repeatedly rejected the pragmatic advice of \nmainstream economists and opted instead for an ideologically rigid and \nineffective strategy. His single-minded commitment to ever larger tax \ncuts for the wealthy as the cure to every economic ailment has made a \nbad situation worse. The administration has ignored remedies that would \nprovide a significant stimulus this year, while implementing policies \nthat will undermine our future economic strength. As a result, the \neconomy continues to stagnate, and the number of families facing \nhardships continue to grow. The budget presented to Congress by \nPresident Bush this year calls for over $1.6 trillion in new tax cuts, \nin addition to the massive tax cuts already enacted in 2001. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, if the President's budget is \naccepted, the on-budget deficit will grow to $4 trillion by 2013. More \nthan three-quarters of that amount would be directly attributable to \nthe Bush tax cuts. A deficit that large would make it impossible for \nthe Federal Government to meet its most basic obligations to the \nAmerican people in national security, in health care, in education, and \nin retirement security.\n  While imposing this enormous long-term burden on the economy, the \nPresident's economic growth plan would not even provide the immediate \nstimulus the economy needs. The economy needs a real stimulus plan. A \ngenuine economic stimulus must meet three criteria. It must have an \nimmediate impact. It must be temporary. And it must be fair in bringing \nthe recovery to all Americans and not just the wealthy few.\n\n  The Bush proposal fails on all three counts. Only $40 billion of the \n$726 billion cost of the administration's plan would reach the economy \nin 2003, when it is needed to stimulate growth. Most of the revenue \nwill be spent long after the recession has ended. Eighty percent of \nthat total amount would not be spent until 2005 or later. What we need \nis just the reverse. We need to put much more money into the economy in \n2003 and keep the long-term costs low. Temporary tax cuts to stimulate \nthe economy are affordable, but the President's large, permanent, new \ntax cuts are not.\n  The Republican plan will not provide the timely and targeted stimulus \nthat the economy needs.\n  Under the President's so-called economic growth package, households \nwith annual incomes over $1 million would receive an average tax cut of \n$90,000 each year. They are not the ones who are struggling to make \nends meet in this faltering economy. They are not the ones who need our \nhelp. Nor are they the ones who will quickly spend the money they \nreceive.\n  In contrast to this windfall for the richest taxpayers, households in \nthe middle of the income spectrum would receive an average of less than \n$300 per year in tax benefits.\n  The Bush plan is simply not an effective stimulus. A recent analysis \nof the administration's economic growth plan by a respected independent \nfinancial research firm, Economy.Com, determined that elimination of \nthe income tax on corporate dividends, the centerpiece of the \nPresident's plan, is one of the least effective forms of stimulus, \ngenerating less than a dime of stimulus for every dollar of Federal \nrevenue lost. By comparison, extending unemployment benefits and \nproviding aid to State and local governments would produce \nsubstantially more than a dollar of stimulus for every dollar of \nFederal revenue spent.\n\n  The plans announced by House and Senate Republicans in the past few \ndays both contain the same fundamental flaws as the Bush plan. They put \nfar too little money in the economy this year and cost far too much in \nthe long term. Only $60 billion of the House's $550 billion tax cut \nwould go into the economy this year, and even less, just $33 billion of \nthe Senate's $420 billion tax cut, would reach the economy in 2003, \nwhen it is needed to create jobs.\n  The Senate Republican bill reported out of the Finance Committee last \nweek would give taxpayers who earn more than $1 million a year an \naverage annual tax cut of $64,400, while middle-income taxpayers would \nonly receive an average tax cut of $233. Sixty percent of all the tax \nbenefits in the legislation would go to the wealthiest 10 percent of \ntaxpayers.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber reflects that. This chart is the \nresult of an analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The \naverage tax cut for middle-income families is $233 a year, and for the \nmillionaires, $64,400 a year.\n  While the Senate Republican bill is not as extreme as the Bush \nadministration proposal, it still fails the test of an effective and \nimmediate stimulus. It does not maximize the economic impact in 2003. \nWe can create many more jobs much sooner by better targeting the \nresources provided in the legislation. Senate Republicans are still \nproposing to spend $80 billion on a permanent dividend tax cut and $35 \nbillion on lowering the tax rate on the highest incomes. These cuts, \nwhich constitute one-third of the entire cost of the bill, do not \nprovide the needed effective stimulus, and they take resources away \nfrom proposals that would.\n  It is incredible that Republicans could not find the dollars to \nextend unemployment benefits and to provide tax relief for low-income \nworkers but they could find the money to pay for these tax breaks \nbenefitting the wealthiest taxpayers. These priorities are all wrong \nfor America.\n  Let me just point out that in their Republican tax proposal, there \nare virtually no provisions for unemployment compensation for American \nworkers--either the almost 3 million American workers who have lost \ntheir jobs over the period of the last 2 years or those who have \nalready seen their unemployment compensation expire because of the \ndownturn in the economy, let alone the hundreds of thousands of part-\ntime workers and low-income workers, who are primarily women. There is \nno proposal whatsoever in the Republican tax proposal to have an \nextension of unemployment compensation in spite of the fact that the \nunemployment compensation fund is in heavy surplus. At this time, it is \nwell able to afford it.\n  A well-designed stimulus plan could generate far more economic \nactivity at a small fraction of the cost of the Republican proposals. \nThe Senate Democratic plan would inject $125 billion into the economy \nthis year and is designed to maximize the stimulus effect of each \ndollar. There is twice as much stimulus effect in 2003 as the House \nRepublican plan and three times as much as the administration's plan \nand the Senate Republican plan.\n  Three widely respected economic models all show that the Democratic \nplan would generate substantially more growth in 2003 and create a half \nmillion more jobs this year than the Republican plan.\n\n  In the Democratic plan, half of the total amount would be used to \nprovide immediate tax relief to working families. It would provide tax \nrelief to all those who pay either income tax or payroll tax and would \nprovide additional tax cuts to families with children. The tax cuts are \ndirected to hard-working families who need them most and are most \nlikely to spend the dollars quickly.\n  The current installment of Federal unemployment benefits runs out at \nthe end of this month, and the Democratic plan would extend those \nbenefits.\n  An effective stimulus plan also needs to provide immediate, targeted \ntax relief for businesses to stimulate new investment. Accelerating \ndepreciation to 50 percent for this year and tripling the amount small \nbusinesses can expense this year makes sense. The goal is to provide \nbusinesses with strong tax incentives to invest in new plants and \nequipment now, rather than postponing those expenditures until future \nyears.\n  To be credible, a stimulus plan must recognize the dire fiscal \nproblems that State and local governments across America are facing. \nThe current fiscal crisis in the States is the most severe in decades. \nCollectively, States are facing budget deficits of nearly $100 billion \nand making up for it by cutting education programs.\n  Last Congress we passed a good bill, a bipartisan bill, in the No \nChild Left\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nBehind Act, in order to ensure we had smaller classrooms, better \ntrained teachers, improved curricula, and after school services. We had \na whole range of commitments: improving literacy, and putting \nadditional kinds of expectations on schools to perform. We did all of \nthat.\n  But we have found now that the administration has backed out of that \ncommitment at the same time we are finding the States are backing out. \nWe have a golden opportunity to strengthen and enhance K through 12 \neducation, but we are undermining that possibility with the cuts that \nare taking place at the State level as a result of the first Bush tax \ncut. And we know that this new tax request by this administration will \npermanently undermine our ability to fund these programs into the \nfuture.\n  It is important to remember that more people need to rely on State \nand local programs in an economic downturn. The number of people \neligible for Medicaid grows substantially in times of recession, and \nmany other costs rise as well. Without jobs and without health care, \nfamilies have nowhere else to turn. They don't have the health \ninsurance, so they have to go to the neighborhood health centers. Who \ndo we think picks up the cost in terms of the neighborhood health \ncenters? It is the local communities that are going to be required to \ndo this. We should make certain that the needed resources are available \nfor them.\n  Our stimulus plan would provide at least $40 billion to hard-pressed \nStates and communities. It would provide additional dollars to maintain \nhealth care, education, and social services. It would also help with \nthe substantial costs of dealing with the threat of terrorism. It is \nmoney well spent which will help stimulate the economy now. \nUnfortunately, the President's plan completely ignores this need.\n  We had the hearings in our human resources committee not long ago \nabout the dangers associated with the outbreak of SARS and about how \nlocal, State, and public health services are so heavily burdened in \nresponding to various kinds of inquiries and tension in local \ncommunities on this, and how they are stretched to the breaking point.\n  SARS is not the result of a terrorist activity, but if it had been or \nif we should have one now, we know our public health systems are \nstretched to their limit. And they are our first responders. We also \nknow that the major hospitals now are overstretched because of the \nreductions in their budgets. They need to be ready to contain any kind \nof an outbreak of a major terrorist attack that is going to use \nchemical or biological agents. So we are talking about matters that \ninvolve the security of this Nation in terms of terrorism and the \npotential use of anthrax and other dangerous substances.\n  The best way to stimulate real economic growth is to make sound \ninvestments in our human capital and in our infrastructure.\n  That is what the Bush administration does not realize. That is the \nessential element missing from all their economic plans. If we deny the \nnecessary resources now, we are jeopardizing the future well-being of \nour people. We are also jeopardizing our future prosperity. Today we \nneed an economic growth plan that recognizes the real forces which \ndrive our economy and invests in them. As President Kennedy said 43 \nyears ago, at the time of another Republican recession: It is time to \nget America moving again.\n  As debate on the tax bill progresses, I intend to offer amendments to \nreverse the misguided priorities of the Republican bill. One of my \namendments will eliminate the dividend tax cut and the accelerated \nreduction in the rate of the top brackets in order to provide the \nnecessary funding for a Medicare prescription drug benefit that will \neffectively meet the needs of the elderly. The people's representatives \nwill have a chance to say what is more important for the American \npeople, a tax cut for the wealthy or a solid prescription drug program \nwhich was effectively left out of the Medicare program when we passed \nMedicare in 1965. We got the hospitalization. We got the physician \nservices. But we left out prescription drugs. We made a commitment to \nAmerican seniors: Work hard and your health care needs are taken care \nof. We didn't say they would be taken care of with the exception of \nprescription drugs, but that is exactly what has happened. Every day \nthat we have Medicare without prescription drugs, it is a violation of \nthat commitment.\n  We will have an opportunity tomorrow to make a decision whether we \nare going to as a nation place the funding of a good prescription drug \nprogram ahead of providing additional kinds of tax reductions for the \nwealthiest individuals in this country. It is an issue of choice. It is \nan issue of priorities. The Members of the Senate will be able to make \nthat judgment and decision. One will take place; the other will not. \nWhich way will the Senate go?\n  Too many of our elderly citizens choose between food on the table and \nthe medicine their doctors prescribe. Too many elderly are taking half \nthe drugs their doctors prescribe or none at all because they cannot \nafford them. The Republican budget shortchanges senior citizens who \ndesperately need prescription drug coverage. Prescription drug spending \nfor senior citizens will cost $1.8 trillion over the next decade, but \nthe Republican budget allocates only $400 billion additional dollars \nfor Medicare. This $400 billion is not even reserved just to pay for \nprescription drug coverage. The additional $115 billion my amendment \nprovides will help us to enact a real drug benefit without coverage \ngaps and high deductibles and will meet the needs of all seniors. It is \na statement by the Senate that mending the broken promise of Medicare \nand providing seniors with the lifesaving prescription drugs they need \nis far more important than additional tax breaks for millionaires.\n  The Republican budget also seriously underfunds education. I am \nplanning to offer an amendment that would reduce the size of the tax \ncut and use the funds to make real the promise of No Child Left Behind.\n  We made a commitment to parents and children, with No Child Left \nBehind, that we were going to guarantee a well-qualified teacher in \nevery classroom. We made a commitment that they would be in smaller \nclasses. We made a commitment that parents would be informed as to the \nprogress those children were making and the school was either making or \nnot making. We made a commitment that we would hold schools \naccountable, and if the schools were not going to perform, they would \nbe altered or changed. And if they still were not performing \neffectively, they would be completely reorganized. We made that \ncommitment to parents. We made that commitment to the American people.\n\n  But we also made a commitment to the American people that we were \ngoing to do our share by providing the resources to get that done. We \nhave failed them.\n  My amendment will also address the needs of college students caught \nup in the widening financial gulf between tuition assistance and the \ncost of higher education.\n  We make choices in the Senate. We are going to give the Members of \nthe Senate the opportunity to make a choice about which is more \nimportant: Investing in our youngest children, and those children who \nare continuing their education into college as well who today are in \nmany instances spending their time during the breaks, rather than \ntalking about their books or the courses they are taking in school, are \ntalking about when their next job will be and how much they will get \npaid and how much their student loan is going to take out of that. We \nknow so many of the most talented and most gifted students come from \nhard-working, middle-income families and they turn down the opportunity \nto go on to school and college because they do not want to assume that \ndebt or assume the debt for their families.\n  We are going to provide an opportunity for the Senate of the United \nStates to make a choice. Do you want to provide more tax breaks for the \nwealthiest or do you want to invest in schools? They will have that \nchance tomorrow.\n  Unemployment benefits expire 2 weeks from now. My third amendment \nwill extend the current program for 6 months and help the 1.1 million \nAmericans who are long-term unemployed, and the hundreds of thousands \nof part-time, low-wage workers. These are men and women who have worked \nhard and paid into the fund. If they haven't paid\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\ninto the fund, they are not eligible. Make no mistake. These are men \nand women who, through no fault of their own, because of the downturn \nin the economy, are thrown out of work. They are able to collect some \nunemployment compensation. But then after a period of time, that \ncompensation expires.\n  Historically, in a nonpartisan way, Republicans and Democrats \ntogether have said: We will provide a helping hand to you until we get \nthe economy back. And then, when they are on their own feet, they repay \nback into that fund. That is the way it has worked historically. But \nnot under this Republican proposal. There isn't 5 cents in here, not \none nickel for these fellow Americans who are trying to pay a mortgage, \neducate their children, and put food on the table. We will have a \nchance tomorrow to vote on this issue and to find out the decision of \nthe Members.\n  The debate will only last for 2 days because of the rules of the \nSenate. We are limited to 25 hours under the process that was accepted \na number of years ago, with which I have great difficulty when we have \na situation such as this.\n  We know that national economic policy has a most dramatic and \nimportant impact in terms of the national economic well-being and \nwelfare. In the early 1960s, sound fiscal policy led to a long period \nof economic growth and price stability. We did see a reduction in taxes \nunder President Kennedy at that time, when taxes were up to 90 percent \nof income. Imagine that. They went down to 70 percent.\n  The distribution in that tax bill, which eventually was signed into \nlaw in 1964, was for middle income and low income working families, and \nover $3 billion went to reduce and close tax loopholes. We don't have \nthat now. There are some provisions in here that raise the taxes on \nAmericans who are working overseas. But I wish we had a committee that \nwould review the tax expenditures the same way that we review the \nexpenditures in terms of spending.\n  We hear a great deal about reduced spending, and there are areas \nwhere it should be reduced. But what we don't see is any call for \nreducing the tax expenditures that have been building up over years and \nyears and benefit just the few, the privileged, in the Tax Code. They \nhave been growing and growing and growing.\n  Make no mistake about it, the working families make that up every \ntime we see another tax loophole created. If we are going to get back \nto a balanced budget, somebody has to fill it in, and it turns out to \nbe the working families who are the ones filling that in. That is \nwrong.\n  When we saw a strong tax program in the early 1960s, we saw, as a \nresult, economic growth and price stability. It continued for a number \nof years until we found additional expenditures as a result of the \nVietnam war. Then we saw the same thing as the result of President \nClinton's economic program in 1993. After that we had the longest \nperiod of economic growth and price stability in this country in years, \nwith the creation of millions of jobs as a result of the economic \npolicy decided on the floor of the Senate.\n  We are going to be debating how to recreate this success this week in \nthe Senate. I believe that is the most important question that will be \ndecided by this Congress this year--outside of the particular assurance \nof our own national security and defense and the battle against terror.\n  The challenge the American people should give to us is to make sure, \none, that the economic policy is going to be fair and, two, it is going \nto be a stimulus to the economy and, three, it is going to be \ntemporary. If we do that, whatever the program, Democrat or Republican, \nwe will have met our responsibilities.\n  We should put an emphasis on meeting the Nation's priorities with \nrespect to education, health care and unemployment insurance.\n  America should be watching this debate and paying close attention \nbecause the decisions that are going to be made in the next 36 hours \nwill have a profound impact on our economy and what kind of country we \nare going to be over the period of these next several years.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                              Junk E-mail\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to talk \nabout what we are going to be considering for the next couple of days, \nwhich is the fiscal policy of this country. Before I do, I am compelled \nto share again with my colleagues the brief remarks I had made this \nmorning about an experience I had yesterday in my Tampa office. Having \nopened up the office from the weekend, our employees in the Tampa \noffice went into their e-mail account for the Senate. What they found \nwas their e-mail mailbox was filled with unwanted junk, so much so that \none of my employees in the Washington office talks about the unwanted \ne-mail junk, including pornography, that comes to the Senate office in \nWashington. In the course of the day's activities, it takes her some 45 \nminutes to clean up this unwanted e-mail.\n  We are already seeing the statistics that it is upwards of 45 and 50 \npercent now of an average person's e-mail that is unwanted. Therefore, \nthe normal course of commerce of e-mail, this new and wonderful \nmechanism for instant and cost-effective communication, is being denied \nto our everyday consumers because their e-mail mailbox is so cluttered \nand, in fact, is imposed on them. Then they have to go through the \nprocess of deleting it.\n  I thought it was also instructive that the intern we have in our \nTampa office happened to be gone for the last week and came back and \nchecked on her own personal e-mail, and she had 321 unsolicited e-mail \nmessages that had accumulated in the course of a week.\n  This is getting out of control and it needs to be addressed. In part, \nwe addressed it last year in the Senate Commerce Committee, but \nlegislation never flowed because there was so much of whose ox was \ngoing to get gored.\n\n  Various e-mail companies certainly do not want to impair their \ncommerce, and so in the past they did not want any kind of check and \nbalance on the ability to e-mail. But now we are seeing those companies \nsuch as AOL coming around and suddenly they are recognizing their \nability to use their mechanism of e-mail is being impaired because \nthere is so much unwanted junk.\n  As I was in the Tampa office yesterday, I happened to look through \nthis single-spaced page of all the e-mail messages that had just come \nin that morning. The third one on the list was all about salacious sex \npictures. Well, that is obviously not something that is appropriate and \nyet this kind of information is being forced on the consumers of \nAmerica, and the American people are saying enough already.\n  What we are going to do in this session of Congress is stop it. There \nare only 20-some States that have addressed this issue, the most recent \nof which is the Commonwealth of Virginia. They have passed the most \nsevere penalties for this kind of junk e-mail. As we address it in this \nCongress, what we should be doing is recognizing that if a State wants \nto adopt an even higher standard than the penalties we are going to set \nin law at the Federal level, then a State clearly ought to have the \nright to make it even more punitive.\n  The bill I introduce will basically have two parts. The first part of \nthe legislation is going to set up criminal penalties, both financial \nand jail time, for unwanted e-mail.\n  Now, it is not going to catch the unsuspecting person whose post \noffice you cannot trace--in other words, masking their identity because \nthey did not intend it to. It is going to be intentional masking that \nwe are going to stop or else they are going to get heavy fines and/or \nup to 5 years' jail time.\n  The second act we are going to prevent is we are not going to let \nbulk e-mails, which I think is defined in terms of over 10,000 e-mail, \nfalsify information. If they do, they are going to suffer the \nconsequences.\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\n  Third, we are going to try to work out some process so that normal \ncommerce will not be impeded but that excessive junk that clutters your \ne-mail box will be stopped. That is the first part of the bill.\n  If you violate those three standards, you are going to be subject to \nprosecution, and the penalty is already in law for fines and/or jail \ntime.\n  There is a second part to the legislation. We are going to make that \nfirst criminal act a component part of the RICO statute. That is the \nRacketeering Influence and Corruption Organizations Act. It was the \nstatute passed some two decades ago giving prosecutors new tools to go \nafter the criminal enterprise, the enterprise of many different \ncriminal activities which had a pattern of criminal activity that \nbecame a criminal business. The prosecutors had a new tool to go after \nthem because they could seize the assets of the criminal enterprise--\nnot just the fine and the jail time.\n  If we want to be serious about stopping this, we need to get serious \nabout fines and criminal penalties and giving prosecutors the \nadditional tools to stop this terrible invasion of individual privacy \nby invading an individual's mailbox.\n  That is the bill I introduce today. Clearly, I have not seen a \nreaction like this. I mentioned this yesterday to some assembled press \nwhen I was in the Tampa office. I am getting all kinds of reaction.\n  The senior Senator from Virginia has arrived. I have been talking \nabout the Senator's Commonwealth of Virginia. They just passed the \nstrongest antispam legislation in the entire country. Virginia now has \nthe strongest in penalties against those who clutter our consumers' e-\nmail boxes with unwanted mail, including pornographic stuff.\n  To the Senator from Virginia I tell of my personal experience in \nTampa yesterday and in the Washington office today, the amount of time \nit takes our staff to delete this unwanted e-mail. It has become such a \nburden for our consumers.\n  I yield to the Senator from Virginia, my distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I came on the floor to see my colleague. \nI was aware of the Governor's action. The Governor and I have the same \nname, although we are not related. He has shown great leadership on \nthis issue. We hope for the best.\n  Virginia has often struck out and led America in the right direction \nto correct what is perceived as an invasion of privacy and a wrong. I \nthank the Senator for his remarks.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I look forward to working with the Senator \nfrom Virginia. Clearly, his State will be protected. There are some 27 \nother States that do not have laws. They are begging the Federal \nGovernment to step in and establish a standard that will stop this \nobnoxious practice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. DOLE). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Debt Extension and the Tax Cut\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise to talk about the legislation \nwe are scheduled to deal with this week, the debt limit extension bill \nand the tax cut.\n  The debate over the debt ceiling may seem esoteric to the folks back \nhome, but it is actually a fairly simple issue. The President has \ndecided to borrow more money on our Nation's credit card and now he is \nasking his credit be enlarged. The President's credit card is very \nclearly over the limit. He is asking the bankers in this room to \napprove his credit expansion.\n  So we are going to talk about it because we want to be sure he can \nafford to take on this much debt based on the fiscal management he is \ndirecting. By the end of this month, the President's card will be \nrevoked because his balance will far exceed the credit card limit. What \nis that limit? The limit the President cannot comply with is $6.4 \ntrillion. That is the amount of indebtedness we are currently permitted \nto have.\n  Now he is asking us, the bankers in this case, the 100 Senators, to \nextend his limit by another $984 billion. But the President does not \nhave to pay that back. That debt is going to be deferred to future \ngenerations, about $3,400 for every man, woman, and child in America.\n  Right after he gets the extension of the debt limit, the President \nwants to charge at least another $350 billion on the credit card for a \ntax cut that goes primarily to the wealthy among us. The best part for \nthe President is that he doesn't have to worry about paying the \nbalance. He will hand the credit card off to someone else in a few \nyears and say: You deal with this. All of us will be stuck with the \nbill--all of our children, all of our grandchildren. I personally was \nblessed with the birth of a ninth grandchild last Monday. I did not \nwant to greet him with the news he might be inheriting a debt of $3,400 \nas he starts life. That will be his part of the deficit we are facing. \nAt the rate President Bush is going, maybe our great grandchildren will \nparticipate as well.\n  The flawed economic budget policies have been nothing short of a \ndisaster. It is a disaster of the administration's own making. Now the \nPresident wants to make the situation worse with another bloated, \nirresponsible tax cut.\n  I thought it was common knowledge when trapped in a hole you stop \ndigging. Our President wants us to keep on digging and digging until we \nare in a budgetary canyon.\n  This chart tells a tale of three administrations and fiscal \ndiscipline, between the growing deficits of the two President Bushes, \nthen the Clinton administration. We see the bars go from red deficit to \na white surplus in the Clinton administration. And now we are headed \nback for deep deficits.\n  We see what has been happening with our fiscal conditioning in the \nlast years. Under the first President Bush we had a fairly rapidly \ngrowing mass deficit. And then we had a new President come in with a \ndifferent view of how we ought to manage our financial affairs. In 8 \nyears, we see an amazing change. From 1992-1993 when President Clinton \ntook over, we see it going rapidly into a surplus.\n  As a coauthor of the 1997 balanced budget agreement, I was proud to \nwork with President Clinton to attain that surplus. At the signing of \nthe agreement as the official Senate representative, I escorted \nPresident Clinton, along with Vice President Gore and Speaker Gingrich, \nacross the White House lawn to permit the entire country to see this \nhistoric agreement put into effect--a balanced budget agreement. We \nmade tough choices and they paid off and we put the country's fiscal \nhealth back on track.\n  But shortly after President George W. Bush took over, we saw the \ndownward slide to fiscal irresponsibility. President Bush inherited \nBill Clinton's surplus and it was squandered in short order. While \nthere are many factors in such a slide, President Bush's irresponsible \n2001 tax cut undid any hope of staying in surplus. Now the President--\nand this is just an honest policy disagreement--now the President's \nanswer is to borrow more and more. That is why we are talking about \nexpanding the debt with yet another tax cut.\n  We already passed an irresponsible, bloated tax cut in the last \nCongress and it has not helped the economy. Circumstances have gotten \nworse and worse.\n  Just look at the job situation in America: How people earn their \nliving, pay their bills, take care of their families. Those folks get a \nheck of a tax cut. Half of the taxpayers of middle income get about \n$100 a year--basically nothing. If they should lose their jobs, heaven \nforbid, they will be darned lucky to find new work, and this \nadministration is unwilling to expand their unemployment benefits.\n  I recently saw President Bush talking about this tax cut plan in \nfront of a board that had written on it: Jobs, growth, jobs, growth--\nall over it. The White House staff made sure those words would be in \nevery television image, every photograph of the President at that \nevent. But simply printing the words ``jobs'' and ``growth'' on a board \nwill not turn the President's irresponsible tax cut plan into a job \ncreation plan.\n  No one seriously believes this program will do anything to create \njobs anytime soon. Beyond the slogans, the reality is this \nadministration has, unwittingly or otherwise, been a job eliminator. \nThey have done nothing to\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\nstimulate the economy or create jobs. They say, ``Trust us, and if we \nget more tax cuts, some will surely dribble down to the job market.''\n  Look at this chart:\n\n       If You Want to Keep Your Job, Stay Out of the Bushes.\n\n  Unemployment rate grows rapidly under the Presidents Bush. The higher \nthe bars go, the worse the situation is for thousands of working \npeople. After the high unemployment rates of the first President Bush, \nwe saw President Clinton bring the unemployment rate steadily down, all \nthe way to 4 percent. Virtually no economist thought we could get to 4 \npercent, but we did. Now we look at how President Bush, George W. Bush, \nhas handled employment. We see unemployment rising again. Just this \nmonth we hit 6 percent.\n  The first Bush tax cut was supposed to create jobs, but we haven't \nseen any. Since January of 2001, the number of unemployed has increased \nover 45 percent, with 8.8 million Americans out of work. Since the \nbeginning of the Bush administration, 2.7 million private sector jobs \nhave been lost--over 500,000 jobs have been lost in the last 3 months, \nwith 48,000 lost in the month of April just past.\n  On top of that, the administration has indicated it would like to \neliminate 850,000 Federal employee jobs. In historical context, \nPresident George W. Bush has had a rather grim picture, the worst job \ngrowth record since the Great Depression. What is growing is \nunemployment.\n\n  Just look at this chart: From the highest job growth to the worst job \ngrowth in 58 years. That is terrible.\n  The chart has a certain attractiveness about it. But if you look \nbeyond the colors, you see a very grim picture. All of these people who \nare presently out of work are struggling--this shows it very \ngraphically--with an almost impossible situation.\n  The chart shows President Truman on the left. We see job growth in \nall the administrations except one. That administration is the current \nBush administration. This administration is in the red. It is not \ncreating jobs. We are losing 74,000 jobs on average each month.\n  Compare this administration with either of the two terms of the \nClinton administration. We averaged over 200,000 new jobs throughout \nthe Clinton administration. We are losing jobs in this country. But \nPresident Bush's preference is to give more huge tax breaks that go \nprimarily to the wealthiest among us. He is addressing the problem with \nsymbols and signs that suggest a rosier future, but it does not happen, \nand that adds outrage to neglect. In almost every category, these \neconomic policies are failing.\n  Real GDP growth is another example. Look at this chart. It shows the \naverage annual percent change in real GDP in Clinton's two terms and so \nfar in President Bush's tenure. It is a stark contrast, as you see--the \nClinton first and second terms here and the present George W. Bush \nterm. President Clinton had us above 4 percent real GDP growth, and \nPresident Bush's average is barely above 1 percent.\n  President Clinton practiced fiscal discipline and it paid off. Under \nPresident Clinton, we attained a budget surplus. Under President Bush, \nwe are back in deficits as far as the eye can see. Just as a reminder, \nwhen President Clinton left office we were looking at the prospect of a \n$5 trillion surplus over a 10-year period. Now it is expected we will \nhave a $2.2 trillion deficit. Look at the change--$7.2 trillion in a \nperiod of 10 years. Under President Clinton, tremendous job growth; \nunder President Bush, losing jobs at a record pace.\n  President Bush's economic policies are not working the way we would \nlike them. I am sure they are not working the way he would like them to \neither. Our economy and the Federal budget are in real trouble and it \nis my hope there will be a reexamination of the tax cut plan in front \nof us. The first Bush tax cut didn't stimulate anything except the \nwallets of some of the most wealthy among us. Are we going to make the \nsame mistake twice? It seems as if we are on the verge of doing just \nthat.\n  We should not have to increase our Nation's debt limit. We should not \nhave to pass the irresponsible tax bill we are considering. But the \nreason we are going to have to increase that debt limit $984 billion is \nto accommodate another tax cut, a tax cut that will not stimulate the \neconomy, will not reward those who are working hard to make a living, \ntaking care of their families, providing for education and a roof over \ntheir heads, health care, all that is essential in this day and age to \nprovide good, responsible leadership for a family. It will not help.\n\n  It is alleged that the tax cut will produce something like $2,000 for \nthe middle class, but it is untrue. It is more like $100 or $200. When \nyou get rid of or reduce the tax obligation for the wealthiest among \nus, there is not enough left to do more than $100, on average, for half \nof the taxpayers in the country.\n  So I hope we will take a second look at what we are doing and curb \nthe expansion of debt that this country is going to have to suffer for \nmany years, maybe decades, to come and not proceed with a tax cut that \nextends, again, the best benefits to the wealthiest among us, people \nwho need it the least.\n  I have had many conversations with people, and we have heard from \ndistinguished entrepreneurs such as Warren Buffett, who said he would \nrather not have a tax cut because he knows that if he pays more taxes, \nhe is left with a higher result in his pocket. I think we have to look \nat it realistically.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, for the remainder of this week we are \ngoing to be discussing some very important fiscal policy issues dealing \nwith increasing Federal debt limits and proposals to reduce taxes in \nour country. We will have a substantial amount of debate about both of \nthose issues. Both of them relate to the question of whether our \ncountry's economy is growing or whether it is stagnant, whether it is \nproducing jobs or losing jobs. I want to talk just a bit about that.\n  In the last couple of weeks, we have heard all of the discussions \nabout our country having lost some 2 million jobs over the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears. In fact, in the last week or so even Michael Jordan got laid \noff. It tells you a little something about the state of our economy, I \nguess.\n  Some while ago, I was reading about an opening for the Oscar Mayer \nWienermobile driving position. They had an opening for a driver for the \nOscar Mayer Wienermobile. Most people remember what that is because \nthey have seen it in parades or on television. So they posted this in \nthe newspaper: We have an opening for a driver for the Oscar Mayer \nWienermobile. Eight hundred college graduates applied to be the driver \nfor the Wienermobile. That also says a little something about the state \nof our economy and the state of jobs.\n  As we discuss these issues of jobs and economic expansion, I think \nthe first place to start is with this understanding: Both political \nparties in the Senate want the same thing for our country. We want an \neconomy that expands, that provides opportunity and jobs and growth and \nhope for the American people. That is what we all want. There is no \ndisagreement about the goal here. The question is, What is the menu of \npolicies we can implement in the Congress that might help achieve this \ngoal?\n\n  I recall, going back 10 years to the year 1993, when our economy was \nat that point stagnant, in deep trouble. We had the largest deficits in \nthis country's history at that point.\n  President Clinton came to office, and he said: I want to put this \neconomy of ours on a different track. I want to change some policies. \nAnd they were controversial. They passed the Senate by one vote, and \npassed the House by one vote, were signed into law by the President, \nand put this country on a different track altogether. They were not \neasy to vote for. I voted for them. But the easiest vote was simply to \nsay no.\n  In the 1990s--as a result of fiscal policy that the American people, \nthat Wall Street, that Main Street, that the\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\nbond market could look at and say: This is a sound policy. It puts the \ncountry on the right track. It gets rid of these Federal budget \ndeficits. It makes tough choices--but people had confidence, and that \nconfidence was manifested by doing the things you might not otherwise \ndo.\n  If you are confident about your job, about your family, about the \nfuture, about your security, then you buy a home, buy a car, take a \ntrip, make a purchase, and do the kinds of things that manifest that \nconfidence you have in the future for yourself and your family and your \ncountry. And that is the expansion side of the American economy.\n  In the 1990s, this economy grew and grew and grew. Millions and \nmillions of new jobs were created in the private sector in this \neconomy. But things have changed. We have run into some tough sledding \nthese days. Let me describe some of the circumstances that occurred.\n  We began to run into an economic slowdown which then became a \nrecession. On top of that recession, we had the terrorist attack in \nthis country on 9/11. We had the bursting of the technology bubble and \nthe pancaking of values in the stock market. We had the largest \ncorporate scandals in American history. Companies such as Enron, Arthur \nAndersen, Tyco, and others were splashed across the front pages of \nAmerica's newspapers. We saw some of America's best known executives \nled away in handcuffs. And we had a range of other circumstances that \ncaused great uncertainty in this country.\n  As a result, instead of gaining jobs, in the last couple of years we \nhave lost jobs. At the start of this period, President Bush was elected \nand came to town and said: My policy is, I want a $1.7 trillion tax cut \nover 10 years. And the reason I want that tax cut, he said, is because \nI can see surpluses as far as the eye can see. This money belongs to \nthe American people, and we ought to give it back. If we are going to \nhave surpluses for 10 years, let's put in place permanent, deep tax \ncuts for 10 years.\n  Some of us said: Well, we support tax cuts, but perhaps we ought to \nbe a bit conservative. What if something happens? What if we run into \nsome tough times? What if we find some white water on these economic \nwaters of ours? What if we find some difficult circumstances?\n  No, never mind about that, they said. This is about tax cuts right \nnow that are permanent. And they won--by one vote. And the result is \nlong-term, permanent tax cuts. Very shortly thereafter we discovered \nthat we had a recession, and then the terrorist attack, then the war on \nterrorism, and corporate scandals. And guess what happened. Very \nquickly, those long-term, big-budget surpluses turned into large \nprojected Federal budget deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  So things have changed dramatically. What do we do about that? The \nAmerican people are concerned about the future. They lack the \nconfidence that is necessary to provide a boost for the expansionary \nphase of the economy. What do we do about that? The President says: I \nhave a recipe. My menu is, let's cut taxes once again.\n  Let me describe in economic terms where we find ourselves. In fiscal \npolicy, we have this year a budget deficit of over $1 billion a day \nthat we spend more than we take in--over $1 billion a day. That is our \ndeficit, every day, 7 days a week, 365 days in the coming year. It is \npretty hard to be more stimulative to the economy than that. You talk \nabout Keynesian; that is Keynesian economics. Those are very large \ndeficits. How can you be more stimulative than that to the economy? \nThat is a huge fiscal policy stimulus.\n  Monetary policy: The Federal Reserve Board has driven short-term \ninterest rates down about as far as they can go, a percent and a \nquarter. It is hard to see a monetary policy that is more stimulative \nthan that.\n  So we have policies in place, both monetary and fiscal policies, that \nare stimulative. Yet our economy is barely moving. It is not producing \nnew jobs; it is losing jobs. So what do we do about that? The President \nsays: Let's cut taxes again.\n  What the President has said is that he wants to cut taxes at this \nmoment. I want to show the consequences of that. On page 4 of the \nBudget Act, the concurrent resolution passed by both the House and the \nSenate, it says: Debt subject to limit. This is the Federal debt. It \nsays, in fiscal year 2003, it will be $6.7 trillion.\n  The President says: If I get all that I want from you, Members of \nCongress, I propose we grow the Federal debt from just over $6 trillion \nto $12 trillion.\n  What he is saying is: Adopt my plan and double the Federal debt in 10 \nyears.\n  I don't know, I come from a really small town, but that doesn't seem \nto me like it is moving forward. It seems to me like this is losing \nground. We have lost 2 million jobs. We are proposing to double the \nFederal debt in the next 10 years. I just don't understand how this \ninspires confidence in the American people that we somehow have our \nfiscal house in order.\n  I don't understand where conservatives are hiding. I thought being a \nconservative was to say: Let's be a bit conservative in the way we deal \nwith this. Let's make sure we will have a sound dollar in the future. \nLet's make sure we have our fundamentals right. Let's make sure we are \nmoving towards some balance in the budget. And let's make sure we are \ninvesting in things that produce big dividends for the people.\n  Let me say what the President has talked about. He says his dividend \nfor the American people is to cut taxes. That all sounds good. The \neasiest lifting in American politics by far is for any politician to \nsay: My proposal is to cut taxes.\n  I guarantee you, that makes you popular.\n  How about the alternative that says: My proposal is to double the \nFederal debt? The President is not going to say that, but that is what \nhe is proposing. He won't get on Air Force One and go to Indianapolis \nto say: I have a great proposal for the people; I propose we double the \nFederal debt to $12 trillion.\n  I would just like to hear it once because here it is. It is in black \nand white. It is not me saying it. It is the President proposing it \nhere on this document. That is the end result of this fiscal policy. \nWill that inspire confidence about the future? It will not.\n  So we will have a debate this week on these proposals, and these \nproposals will be to increase the Federal debt limit by nearly $1 \ntrillion. Let's make sure we understand that. It is actually just $984 \nbillion. It is hard to keep billions and trillions separate in the \nCongress some days. They have constructed this debt ceiling increase so \nthat it is just under $1 trillion.\n  So let's understand what this means. We will vote this week to \nincrease the debt ceiling by nearly $1 trillion. I want to tell you how \nmany times we will do that again in order to meet what the President \nproposes to happen with this fiscal policy. We will increase it $1 \ntrillion now, $1 trillion later, $1 trillion after that, another $1 \ntrillion later, another $1 trillion, and finally another $1 trillion. \nThose debt ceiling increases will all be necessary in order to meet the \nPresident's objective with a fiscal policy that results in doubling the \nFederal debt from $6 trillion to $12 trillion.\n  Is that putting this country on track? Is that making tough choices? \nIn McCullough's book I have mentioned previously, John Adams writes to \nAbigail frequently, as he is serving his country in France and England. \nHe writes to Abigail plaintively asking, in different words: Where is \nthe leadership going to come from? Where on Earth, he asks 200 years \nago, will the leadership come from to help create this new country of \nours? Who will provide it?\n  He laments: There is only us. There is myself, George Washington, Ben \nFranklin, Mason, Madison, Thomas Jefferson. There is only us.\n  Of course, we understand now, with the hindsight of two centuries, we \nhad some of the greatest talent in human history thinking through how \nto put this country of ours together. But it seems to me that it is \nimportant to constantly ask the question: Where is the leadership going \nto come from?--in this case on fiscal policy.\n  We have good people on all sides of the political aisle. The \nPresident is a good person. Members of the Senate, Republican and \nDemocrat, come here because they have a passion in their heart to want \nto do good things for the country. They all share the same goal. They \nwant this country to expand and provide opportunity and jobs and \nprosperity.\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\n  The fact is, they have different visions about how to approach the \ngoal. Some believe this economic engine runs because you put something \nin at the top and somehow it trickles down; that which is put in at the \ntop one day will benefit everyone. There are others who believe you \ngive everyone a little something to work with, jobs, especially for \nworking people, and things percolate up, and this engine runs best that \nway. We have had plenty of opportunities to test those theories.\n  Let me submit that the test in recent years has been quite clear: Put \nyour economic house in order. Give people some confidence that you are \nmaking tough choices, that you will carve out a future for their \nchildren and grandchildren that is one we can be proud of, and have \nthem inherit a growing economy rather than be saddled with the burden \nof debt. If we do that, it is quite clear that people will do what is \nnecessary to expand this economy. If we don't, the economy languishes \nand contracts.\n  I will offer some amendments to the tax bill. I don't intend to vote \nfor a large permanent tax cut on top of what we did in 2001. I don't \nintend to vote for it because every single dollar that is used for this \ntax cut--most of which will go to upper income people--is going to come \nfrom the Social Security trust funds. Let me use Donald Trump's name \nbecause he doesn't mind. Donald Trump puts his name on everything, and \nI am sure he doesn't mind. He is a very successful American \nbusinessman. Assume that a successful American businessman makes $1 \nmillion a year in net income. My assumption is that Donald Trump does \nmuch better than that. But assume he made $1 million a year in income. \nUnder the President's plan, he will get a $90,000-a-year tax cut. Now, \nI have just described to you that this process is going to double the \nFederal debt. You know and I know and everyone in the Chamber knows it \nis going to make it much more difficult to fund Medicare and Social \nSecurity. This plan is going to use the trust funds that we were \nsupposed to save for Social Security. My Aunt Blanche is dependent upon \nSocial Security. And Aunt Blanche is not going to like it when she \ndiscovers that Congress has decided to use the trust fund surpluses to \nprovide a tax cut to people at the top of the income ladder. That is \njust not something she and many other senior citizens want to have \nhappen in this country. It is not something they expect the Congress or \nthe Government to do; yet, we are just hours away from making that \nmistake.\n\n  Let me try to describe a couple of amendments I am going to offer as \nwe go through this process. There is a $323 million expenditure \nincluded in the large tax cut legislation that will be coming to us \nfrom the Senate Finance Committee that is interesting and troubling to \nme as well. Do you know what it is for? It is to have the IRS go out \nand hire private collection companies to collect Federal tax bills. I \nwill say that again. In this bill is $323 million, I believe, to have \nthe Internal Revenue Service go out and hire private collection \nagencies to collect taxes. That is quite a departure. We spend a lot of \nmoney on the IRS. They want to hire--the Finance Committee and those in \nCongress who support this--private collection agencies.\n  Let me give you an example of what happened. They did a pilot project \nof this in 1996, a test. I didn't support it then and I don't support \nit now. I will offer an amendment to strike this. They did a little \ntest in which they hired private collection agencies to collect tax \ndebt. The test was a failure. Among other things, an IRS internal audit \nfound some collectors violated their contracts with the IRS by placing \ntelephone calls outside the time frames specified by the Fair Debt \nCollection Practices Act. In this little test, there were 294 calls \nplaced before 8 a.m., or after 9 p.m. The earliest call was received at \n4:19 a.m. How would you like to get a call from a debt collection \nagency at 4:19 in the morning about a tax bill?\n  I don't support that at all. The IRS ought to collect their own \nreceivables. They ought not turn them over to private collection \nagencies. This is, after all, the most sensitive of people's financial \ninformation. That test also discovered problems with the safeguarding \nof that information. I am going to offer an amendment that will strike \nthat provision. I don't know whether it will prevail, but it is a \nterrible idea to suggest we ought to spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars turning some of the Internal Revenue Service collection rolls \nover to private collection agencies.\n  I will, with my colleague, Senator Reid, offer an amendment dealing \nwith the issue of concurrent receipt for retired military personnel. At \nthe moment, as most in this Chamber know, if somebody served our \ncountry for 20 years in the armed services and they were disabled \nduring that period, they cannot receive both their full military \nretirement pension as well as veterans' disability compensation. That \nis outrageous and that ought to be changed. Of all the things to do to \ndisabled veterans, this makes no sense at all. We tried to fix this \nlast year and the President blocked it by threatening to veto the \nDefense Authorization bill. I hope to offer an amendment with Senator \nReid to solve this problem..\n\n  I also intend to offer an amendment that will provide a trigger, and \nperhaps some other colleagues will. If they do, I will probably not \noffer this. But there needs to be an amendment that decides that we \nwill have these tax cuts, provided we have the capability to offer \nthem. If the on-budget deficit exceeds a certain amount, or the \nSecretary of the Treasury cannot certify that it such deficit doesn't \nexceed a certain amount, two things would happen: One, we would freeze \nsome of the tax cuts and, two, we would identify the spending in \nFederal agencies that represents overhead burden and cut that spending \nby 5 percent at the same time. So you have a combination of both \ndelaying a tax cut and also cutting some Federal spending.\n  I believe also the income tax increase on Social Security benefits \nthat occurred in 1993 should be repealed. It seems to me the question \nis, what has more priority, dividend exclusion for those at the upper \nincome level, or dealing with this Social Security tax increase? I will \nsubmit an amendment to repeal the 1993 income tax increase on Social \nSecurity payments. These and other things, I think, represent a number \nof approaches we ought to take.\n  Also, this week when we deal with the increase in the debt limit, we \nare going to increase that by nearly $1 trillion--but not with my vote, \nbecause I didn't vote for the fiscal policy that creates this. But for \nthose who support it, have at it. You really ought to vote for this \nincreased debt limit.\n  I am going to also propose an trade deficit amendment. The structure \nis not complete, but I will make this point. We have a debt limit with \nrespect to fiscal policy in this country. When you reach that limit, \nbump up against it, you either have to extend it, or cut back in \ncertain areas, or freeze spending. The fact is, there is no similar \nlimit with respect to the trade debt.\n  The trade deficit on an annual basis is $470 billion at the moment \nand growing rapidly. It is Katie bar the door, whatever it is, it is; \nnobody has to approve it, nobody has to do anything about it. The \nPresident and the trade ambassador and the Congress can sleep through \nit and never utter a sentence, knowing that all their newspaper \nfriends--the major daily newspapers, friends of the Republicans and \nDemocrats who support this trade policy--will never say a critical word \nabout the trade deficit threatening to undermine this country's economy \nas well. I will offer an amendment that deals with that.\n  I will finish by saying this. What most American families want from \ntheir Government is pretty simple. It is what they sit around the \nsupper table and talk about. There are very simple questions they ask \neach other. The questions are: Do I have a decent job? Does my job pay \nwell? Do I have job security? Do I have decent benefits on my job? Are \nwe sending our kids to schools we are proud of? Do we live in a safe \nneighborhood? Do Grandpa and Grandma have access to good health care \nwhen they reach their limited income years? Are we treating our two \nuncles who served this country in the Second World War fairly on \nveterans' health care? All of these are issues families ask about every \nday. It is what matters to them. It is what makes a difference in their \nlives.\n  The answers to these questions, in many cases, are what has made this \na\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\ngreat country. Just go around the globe and you will see the same green \nplaces where there are trees and grass, and you will see the same \nground where there is sand and you will see a world that looks pretty \nmuch the same. But there is one spot that is dramatically different, \nand that is this great country of ours. We are lucky to be Americans \nand lucky to be alive now. We have inherited an obligation for us not \nto just think about today, but to think about our kids and about \ntomorrow. The one thing that has made this country, I think, really a \nremarkable, unique country is that we decided two centuries ago that \nevery child in the country shall be able to become whatever their God-\ngiven talents allow them to become. We are not going to separate kids \nin the education process and say you are going to go to this school, or \nyou will go to trade school and you will go to college. We don't do \nthat. We say every kid who enters a classroom has the opportunity to be \nwhatever their God-given talent allows. It is a wonderful thing. This \nnotion of universal education is a wonderful thing for our country.\n  I told this story before. I will do it again. When I came to \nCongress, the oldest member was Claude Pepper from the State of \nFlorida. He had, behind his desk, above his chair, two pictures I have \nnever forgotten that were autographed to him. One picture was of \nOrville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. It was \nautographed to Congressman Claude Pepper with admiration from Orville \nWright. Before he died, he apparently autographed a picture for Claude \nPepper. And Claude Pepper had an autographed picture of Neil Armstrong \nsetting foot on the Moon. One human being in a picture of the first \nperson to fly and leave the Earth, and the first person to walk on the \nMoon.\n\n  What is the difference between those two autographed pictures in one \nperson's lifetime? The distance is education--the science, the math, \nand the learning that allows us as a country to produce men and women \nwho learned to fly and then take off and fly to the Moon. That is how \nimportant education is. It is about progress in this country.\n  The question for us, it seems to me, as we consider this issue of \nfiscal policy and tax cuts, is about choices. What is it in the choices \nwe make in public policy in America that strengthens our country? What \nproduces dividends, growth, opportunity, and hope in our country? What \nmakes our country unique?\n  Those are the choices we have to make, and part of that, in my \njudgment, has always been we have been willing to choose the kinds of \nthings that give people an opportunity. Education is about opportunity. \nEducation, health care--one can think of a whole series of these \npolicies that we have over many years said: Let's set these policies in \nplace to give people opportunity.\n  The policies we see today coming from the Finance Committee and from \nthe White House are to say the choice for us in every circumstance, \nwhether it is tax cuts versus Medicare for the elderly, tax cuts versus \nSocial Security, tax cuts versus education, tax cuts versus veterans' \nhealth care, you name it, the choice for us is tax cuts.\n  I know there are some in this country who say that is a pretty \nlogical choice because, frankly, we pay too much in taxes. The fact is, \nwith these tax cuts, we will inherit a deficit that will burden our \nchildren and their children.\n  The President often says: This is your money; people should be able \nto keep more of their money. That is certainly true. It is also the \ncase that this is your debt, and when this $6 trillion debt turns to a \n$12 trillion debt, the question is, Isn't this debt something with \nwhich we are saddling America's children and grandchildren, and is that \nsound public policy? Is that the seedbed for economic growth? Does that \nproduce and inspire confidence in the American people about the future \nof this economy?\n  The answer clearly is no. That is why my hope would be, in the coming \ndays at least, that we could find some common ground. Perhaps there is \nan appetite for tax cuts that says we have to do this unabated under \nany circumstance, but there is perhaps another appetite by people who \nsay: Let's do a series of things. Let's together both deal with Federal \nspending and Federal taxes and also the choices of investment in \neducation, health care, and other issues. Let's do it in a way that \nrepresents sound thinking, sober thinking; in a way that gives people \nconfidence and inspires them that we are going to have a better future.\n  I do not know how this is going to come out this week. I worry a \ngreat deal that we have a viewpoint that has been expressed that says: \nThere is only one way and that is our way. It is tax cuts, tax cuts, \ntax cuts. You have big surpluses, then tax cuts. Big deficits, tax \ncuts. The economy is doing well, tax cuts. The economy is in the \ntank, tax cuts.\n\n  It seems to me that for every politician who ever has run for public \noffice, the instinctive reaction to understanding how to be popular is \nto propose tax cuts. The American people, in my judgment, deserve \nbetter than that. They deserve an answer to the question John Adams \nkept asking: Where is the leadership going to come from to make tough \nchoices; choices that may not be so popular, not so attractive in the \nshort run but, in the long run, will produce opportunity, economic \ngrowth, and new jobs?\n  Those sometimes are choices that we are required to make in public \nservice. I think this is one of those times.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I stand \nbefore the Senate today to pay tribute to the life of CWO Hans \nGukeisen.\n  Just before 8 p.m. on Friday, May 9, Hans was sitting in the copilot \nseat of an Army UH-60 air medical helicopter somewhere near Smarrah in \nnorthern Iraq. Gukeisen and his crewmembers were involved in the rescue \nof an Iraqi child injured by a landmine when they came upon hostile \nfire.\n  While the circumstances remain unclear, the helicopter crashed in the \nTigris River killing three crewmembers. The wounded child was riding in \nanother helicopter.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Gukeisen, 31, became the first South Dakota \ncasualty of the war in Iraq, and he will be sorely missed. His mother \nMargaret of Hill City and his father, Terry of Lead remember their son \nas a considerate and easygoing young man who enjoyed hunting, fishing, \nand stock car racing. A member of a proud military family, Hans was \ndedicated to the military and had dreamed of becoming a warrant officer \nand helicopter pilot. He is survived by his brother Ray, a Special \nForces instructor at Fort Bragg.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to the Gukeisens. Their son has made \nthe supreme sacrifice while working to protect an innocent child.\n  I join with every South Dakotan and every American in expressing my \nheartfelt gratitude to Hans and his family for his years of brave and \ndedicated service on behalf of our country and its ideals. We grieve \nhis death but celebrate the life he chose to lead.\n\n\n                               Debt Limit\n\n  Madam President, I come to the floor, in addition to speaking of this \nvery tragic moment in the life of the Gukeisen family, to talk about an \nissue of great concern that will be the subject of significant debate \nlater on this week. I will take a minute, while we are waiting for \nothers to come to the Senate floor, to talk about the issue of the debt \nlimit.\n  Last June, Congress was forced to raise the national debt limit by \n$450 billion to avoid defaulting on our loan obligations for the first \ntime in American history.\n  Now the administration informs us that we must raise our Nation's \ndebt limit again. House Republicans have already acted to raise the \ndebt ceiling by nearly $1 trillion, the largest increase in debt in our \nNation's history. If the Senate follows their lead, our national debt \nwill increase by $1.4 trillion in less than 12 months, by far the \nlargest 1-year increase in debt in our Nation's history.\n  The debt figures by themselves are shocking, but even more shocking \nis\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\nthe fact that at the same time there are many who, while requesting the \nAmerican people take on this record new debt, but also insist on \nanother massive round of new tax breaks that would increase the \nnational debt by another trillion dollars or more over the next decade.\n  Supporters of these new tax breaks insist that they will pay for \nthemselves. The Republican request for another nearly $1 trillion \nincrease in the Nation's debt limit shows that that is not so.\n  There are no free lunches. And there are no cost-free tax cuts.\n  War, recession, and terrorism have all taken a toll on America's \neconomy over the last 2 years. But they are not the only reasons we are \nbeing forced to consider raising the national debt limit. Another major \nreason is the massive tax cut of 2001.\n  Republican economic policies are undermining the fiscal strength of \nthe United States.\n  Before the 2001 tax cut, we had not had to raise the debt limit once \nin nearly 4 years. Now we are being asked to raise the debt limit twice \nin one year, for a total of $1.4 trillion in new debt.\n  In 2 years, we have gone from record surpluses to record deficits.\n  Late last week, the Congressional Budget Office announced that the \ndeficit this year is likely to exceed $300 billion--an all-time high. \nThat is without any new tax cuts, so the actual deficit this year is \nlikely to be even higher. Many private economic forecasters warn that \nit could exceed $400 billion.\n  Deficits and debt do matter.\n  The national debt clock is in the Capitol today. It shows that every \nman, woman and child in America already owes more than $22,260 toward \nour national debt.\n  Last year, Americans paid $332,536,958,599.42 just in interest on the \nnational debt. That is money that cannot be used to educate one child, \ncure one illness, build one tank, or make America one bit safer.\n  Bigger deficits and a larger national debt also hurt America's \nfamilies by driving up interest rates, which will make it more \nexpensive for consumers to buy homes and cars and pay their credit card \nbills.\n  Yet instead of reducing the deficit--or even just slowing its \ngrowth--the administration is insisting that the American people take \non more debt.\n  The tax and spending plans proposed by the administration will add \nanother $2.7 trillion in deficits to the national debt over the next \ndecade. Just the interest on that new debt would cost taxpayers an \nextra $500 billion.\n  Actions have consequences. Tax cuts have costs. And those costs have \na real impact on the fiscal strength of our Nation and on the economic \nwell-being of working families in my State of South Dakota and all \nacross America.\n  For that reason, we sought consent yesterday, and again today, that \nthe Senate take up and consider the Republican request to raise \nAmerica's debt limit by another nearly $1 trillion today--before we \nvote on the administration's request for another trillion-plus dollars \nin new tax breaks and additional debt.\n  America has lost more than 2.7 million jobs since January 2001, \nnearly 100,000 jobs a month. A half-million jobs were lost in the last \n3 months alone.\n  We are proposing a plan to get America back to work and put the \nFederal Government back on the path to fiscal discipline.\n  Our plan will create jobs, opportunity and prosperity for all \nAmericans. It will create twice as many jobs as the Republican plan, at \na fraction of the cost. It will also provide a tax cut to every working \nAmerican this year, when our economy needs the boost.\n  We look forward to making a strong case for our plan on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Before we move to that debate, however, the Senate should level with \nthe American people about the costs and consequences of the Republican \neconomic policies. We should admit that the Republican plan for even \nmore tax breaks for the elite will be paid for the same way the first \nround is being paid for: by heaping even more debt on America's \nfamilies.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield before he leaves the floor?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The distinguished Democratic leader, I am certain, is aware \nof the fact that during the last 3 years of the Clinton administration \nthere was an actual paydown of the national debt. Is the leader aware \nof that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. The record is very \nclear. In those years, we had surpluses for the first time in almost 40 \nyears. We were able to begin paying down the debt some $600 billion \ntotally, and if the Senator will recall, there was even debate by those \nwho were concerned we were paying down the debt too quickly. It sounds \nalmost too hard to believe, but that indeed was part of the discussion.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the distinguished Senator from South Dakota if he is \nas concerned as I am about there being no concern as to the unbalanced \nbudget we now have. I have in front of me statements made by Republican \nleaders in years past where they said, among other things:\n\n       The real threat to Social Security is the national debt. If \n     we do not act to balance the budget and stop adding to the \n     debt, then we are truly placing the future of Social Security \n     in jeopardy.\n\n  That is a direct quote from a Republican leader in 1997. I have \nseveral pages of quotes about the Republicans feeling the importance of \nbalancing the budget. Is the Senator as concerned as I am that they no \nlonger are concerned about balancing the budget?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, there are those who appear to argue that not only \ndo they not want a balanced budget but they are using the deficits to \nshrink the Government--a very crass, clumsy, and dangerous way of \nreducing Government expenditures. The majority leader in the House even \nargued a few weeks ago that tax cuts are the most important matter \nbefore the country, even more important than war, he argued. So clearly \ntax cuts have a special place in the minds of many on the other side, \nbut as the Senator says, I do not think there is the same degree of \ninterest or commitment to fiscal responsibility.\n  I was on Wall Street yesterday, and I was taken aback by the \nextraordinary concern expressed to me by so many people in the \nfinancial community, people who are concerned about what message we are \nsending about fiscal responsibility and what international investors \nare saying about our position. The euro continues to increase in \nstrength against the dollar, in part because in some circles people \nhave more confidence in the euro today than they do the dollar. Why is \nthat the case? Because they are very concerned about the implications \nof U.S. fiscal policy today.\n  So I believe that whether it is our fiscal policy, our trade policy, \nour long-term circumstances with regard to the budget in particular, we \nare going to pay dearly for the consequences of what some have proposed \nin tax cuts this week.\n  Mr. REID. I listened to a speech just delivered, and the leader \nindicated we are going to be asked in the next few days to increase the \nnational debt by almost a trillion dollars--not a billion, almost a \ntrillion dollars. Is that what the leader said?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, unfortunately, the request by the administration \nis to increase the debt by $984 billion. That is the single biggest \nincrease in our Nation's history. Never before has there been a request \nof that kind.\n  I would add, as I did just a moment ago, that that is in addition to \nthe $425 billion request that was made less than a year ago--last \nsummer. We were told then that that increase in the debt limit would \nlast for some time. Unfortunately, those predictions were erroneous. So \nnow we are back again, in large measure because of the consequences of \nthe tax cuts of 2001. So it is all the more ironic that in the very \nweek we are going to be passing this increase in the debt limit by \nclose to a trillion dollars, we are going to be passing the first \ninstallment of yet another trillion-dollar tax cut that will be \nenacted, if the Republicans have their way, before the end of this \nyear.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great American: \nRetired Colonel Don Williams, who is stepping down as Executive \nDirector of the CORE Committee of Fort Knox on May 31, 2003. Since \nretiring from the Army in 1990 as Chief of Staff at Fort Knox, \nKentucky, Don has remained in Kentucky and tirelessly fought for that \ninstallation and the community surrounding Fort Knox.\n  For nearly as long as I have been a Senator, Don has been a valuable \nsource of expertise for both me and my staff. I am grateful for his \nfriendship and his tremendous assistance on Army and Fort Knox matters \nthroughout the years. Although Don will be retiring from his position \nas Executive Director, I am heartened that he will remain an active \nmember of the CORE Committee, and will continue to be an eloquent and \ninfluential advocate for Fort Knox.\n  Don's efforts as Executive Director of the Fort Knox CORE Committee, \nVice Chairman of the Kentucky Commission on Military Affairs, Chairman \nfor Legislative Affairs of the Fort Knox Chapter of AUSA, Vice \nPresident of the Board of Directors of the Patton Museum, and Executive \nCommittee Member of the Armor and Cavalry Association illustrate the \nextent of his dedication to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Don's \ncontributions to Fort Knox and Kentucky are lasting, and I will \ncontinue to support federal funding for Fort Knox projects that live up \nto Don's vision of Fort Knox's central role in the future of the Army.\n  Many of the tremendous high-tech assets at Fort Knox for which I have \nworked to provide Federal funding came to my attention through the \nefforts of Don Williams. Don deserves credit for highlighting the \nimportance of projects such as the Zussman Mounted Urban Combat Trainer \nsite and the high-tech research at the Mounted Maneuver Battle Lab to \nthe Congressional Delegation. These assets have allowed Fort Knox to \nplay an important role in training our soldiers for urban combat and \ndesigning the requirements for the Army of the Future. I will always \nview these important assets as just a couple of Don's legacies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6061-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to inform my colleagues about why I \nwould object to a unanimous consent request to proceed to the \nintelligence authorization bill or any other legislation that may \ncontain a provision undoing or modifying a straightforward law \nestablishing congressional accountability for the Total Information \nAwareness Program.\n  Just this past February, as part of the fiscal year 2003 supplemental \nappropriations bill, the Senate considered, debated and adopted \nunanimously an amendment sponsored by myself and Senators Feinstein, \nReid, Boxer, Corzine, Leahy, Cantwell, Harkin, Levin, Durbin, Biden, \nDaschle, and Clinton. That amendment requires specific congressional \napproval for any deployment of technology developed by the Defense \nDepartment's Total Information Awareness Program; the Defense \nDepartment must seek authorization and appropriation for any deployment \nof the TIA technology to another agency or department. DARPA may \ncontinue to research and develop TIA technology as long as it submits a \nreport required by the amendment. The report is due May 20, 2003, and \nit requires an explanation of the intended and actual use of funds for \neach project and activity of the TIA Program, the schedule for proposed \nresearch and development of each project and activity and target dates \nfor the deployment of each project and activity. The report will also \naddress the efficacy of systems such as TIA in predictive assessments \nof terrorist capabilities and plans, the likely impact of the TIA \nProgram on privacy and civil liberties, the laws that will require \nmodification to use the TIA Program and recommendations for eliminating \nor minimizing the adverse effects of the TIA Program on privacy and \nother civil liberties.\n  The TIA technology will give the Federal Government the capability to \noperate the most massive domestic surveillance program in the history \nof our country. It will put the financial, medical and other details of \nAmerica's private lives at the fingerprints of tens of thousands of \nbureaucrats. The American people have the right to know if the federal \nGovernment intends to deploy this technology against them, when it will \ndo and how, and Congress should preserve its oversight over the \nprogram. The amendment enacted in February provides that \naccountability.\n  Just last week the American people got a painful reminder about the \nshameful abuse of power and secrecy in the McCarthy era, and are \nrightfully wary about the protection of their privacy. In fact, \nalthough some in the Defense Department and elsewhere claim they are \nonly interested in mining ``lawfully-collected'' information, just \nabout any piece of information about any U.S. citizen can be \n``lawfully'' collected or obtained by the federal government. It is for \nthese reasons that I will object to any motion to proceed to any \nlegislation affecting the Total Information Awareness Program unless \nand until I have fully reviewed it to guarantee that the accountability \nin the TIA amendment is preserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6061-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6061-S6063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CHANGES TO COMMITTEE ALLOCATIONS AND BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, section 310(c)(2) of the Congressional \nBudget Act, as amended, provides the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee with authority to revise committee allocations, functional \nlevels, and budgetary aggregates for a reconciliation bill which \nfulfills an instruction with respect to both outlays and revenues. The \nchairman's authority under 310(c)\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\nmay be exercised if the following conditions have been satisfied:\n  One, the reconciled committee reports a bill which changes the mix of \nthe instructed revenue and outlay changes by not more than 20 percent \nof the sum of the components of the instruction, and,\n  Two, the reconciled committee still complies with the overall \nreconciliation instruction.\n  I find that the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2003, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee on May 13, 2003, \nsatisfies the two conditions above and, in addition, satisfies the \ncondition imposed by section 202 of H. Con. Res. 95, which limits the \ncost of a reconciliation bill initially considered by the Senate to no \nmore than $350 billion over the 2003-2013 period.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on September \n15, 2001, in Houston, TX. Upon leaving a nightclub in southwest \nHouston, a Hispanic man was confronted by a group of nine men. The \ngroup assaulted and beat the man while shouting racial epithets and \ncomments about Osama bin Laden.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6063-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6063-S6064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in 1985 the National PTA and the \nNational Education Association announced the creation of Teacher \nAppreciation Week to be celebrated during the first week of May. This \nyear that celebration occurred from May 4 to 10. I want to add my voice \nto those who have come to the floor of the United States Senate to \nrecognize this special occasion.\n  While every society places a premium on education in terms of \ndeveloping a skilled and trained workforce in the next generation, \neducation in America also represents a ladder of opportunity. We take \ngreat pride in being an open society in which people can move up and \nforward. Education provides a path by which our young people can \nimprove themselves and develop their full potential. And, of course, \nteachers are at the forefront of this critical effort.\n  My own admiration and respect for the teaching profession began at an \nearly age. Both of my parents were Greek immigrants and, while there \nwere no diplomas on their walls at home, they understood the importance \nof hard work and the value of education. After putting in countless \nhours at our family restaurant in Salisbury, MD, my father would come \nhome at night, tired and weary. Yet, I remember watching him night \nafter night taking down books and reading them late into the evening, a \nlesson I have never forgotten.\n  And, of course, I have a deep personal connection to the teaching \nprofession. My wife Christine was a teacher in Baltimore for many years \nand my brother\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\nTony was a school administrator in Wicomico County, MD. His daughter \nBeth Sheller is currently a public school teacher in Wicomico County. \nFew other professionals are able to touch so many people in such a \nlasting way as do teachers. I have been privileged to witness this \nfirst hand through the experiences of my family members who have spent \ntheir careers in the education profession.\n  Today's teachers are in the midst of incredible struggles. Being a \nteacher has never been easy, but our modern society has only increased \nthe challenges. Today, our teachers face the task of educating children \nwith limited English skills, meeting the requirements of the recently \nenacted No Child Left Behind Act and the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, staying abreast of new technology, and doing so in aging \nschools that are in need of extensive repairs and updating. With so \nmany schoolchildren living in families with both parents working or in \nsingle-parent homes, our schools and teachers are being asked to assume \nmuch of the responsibility for after school care as well.\n  Compared with many professions, our Nation's teachers are overwhelmed \nand underpaid, shouldering major responsibilities that often go \nunappreciated. Our citizens are considered to be among the best \neducated in the world and for that we have our teachers to thank. While \nwe frequently hear tales of failing schools, many success stories are \noverlooked. This week is a fitting time to tell the stories of the many \ncaring, dedicated and talented educators who perform their jobs with \nexcellence every day. Their successes motivate children and other \nteachers and increase our confidence in our education system. We need \nto hear more about teachers like Robin Nussbaum, this year's winner of \nthe Agnes Meyer Outstanding Teacher Award for Howard County. Ms. \nNussbaum is a special education teacher at Cedar Lane School in \nColumbia, MD. Her students and their families acknowledge it is her \ntireless work in and out of the classroom, coupled with her deep \nconcern for student success that make her an extraordinary educator.\n  I would like to read for the Record a list of the 2002-2003 Maryland \nTeachers of the Year from all 23 Maryland counties and Baltimore City. \nThese professionals have demonstrated incredibly high performance in \ntheir fields in a very challenging time.\n\n\n                2002-2003 Maryland Teachers of the Year\n\n       Allegany, Heather Michele Morgan, Parkside Elem., \n     Kindergarten\n       Anne Arundel, Mattie A.

Mr. President, I rise today to welcome home the members \nof the 28th Bomb Wing stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base.\n  The B-1 bombers and crews of the 28th Bomb Wing are returning home \ntoday, and over the next few weeks, from their service in Operation \nIraqi Freedom. As they did in Kosovo and Afghanistan, the B-1 bombers \nperformed superbly in the war in Iraq. They have once again \ndemonstrated that they are the backbone of America's bomber fleet. The \nB-1's unique ability to linger over the battlefield and provide \nresponsive firepower at the time and place required by military \ncommanders was an integral part of our victory in Iraq.\n  I want to specifically honor four members of a B-1 crew stationed at \nEllsworth Air Force Base who were acknowledged for their service during \nthe war. CPT Chris Wachter, LTC Fred Swan, CPT Sloan Hollis, and 1LT \nJoe Runci were each awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross medal for \ntheir April 7 attack on a suspected hideout of Saddam Hussein.\n  While in the course of another assigned mission, this four-member B-1 \ncrew was tasked with striking a building in which current intelligence \nindicated Saddam Hussein was meeting with top Iraqi officials. This \ninformation was relayed to the B-1 crew which confirmed the \ncoordinates, flew to the target, and accurately released four 2,000-\npound bunker-buster bombs. This all occurred within 12 minutes. Having \nsuccessfully hit this leadership target, the B-1 and her crew went on \nto strike an additional 17 targets in two separate locations.\n  Although B-1s flew fewer than 2 percent of the combat sorties in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, they dropped more than half the satellite-\nguided Air Force Joint Direct Attack Munitions, JDAMs. The B-1s were \ntasked against the full spectrum of potential targets in Iraq, \nincluding command and control facilities, bunkers, tanks, armored \npersonnel carriers, and surface-to-air missile sites. They also \nprovided close air support for U.S. forces engaged in the field. The \nbombers and crews accomplished all of this while maintaining over an 80 \npercent mission capable rate. This record of success proves B-1 is a \nvital, versatile, and potent component of our military force structure.\n  Like all South Dakotans, I am proud of the men and women who are \nstationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base. They are an essential part of \nour South Dakota community, and are doing their duty to keep our Nation \nsafe. I am pleased CPT Wachter, LTC Swan, CPT Hollis, and 1LT Runci \nwere each recognized for their remarkable actions during Operation \nIraqi Freedom. But I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge all \nthe men and women at Ellsworth who keep the B-1s in the air and ready \nto respond. It is the work of all the crews and all the support teams \nthat keep the B-1 at the forefront of our military.\n  Once again, I want to welcome home the members of the 28th Bomb Wing, \nand thank them for their service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6064-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6064-S6065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF LEWIS J. BUCKLEY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last Friday, my Senate colleagues and I \nvoted unanimously to confirm the nomination of Lewis J. Buckley to the \nrank of captain in the United States Coast Guard. This confirmation is \nwell-deserved and bears a particular significance to the United States \nCoast Guard.\n  Captain-Select Buckley is the conductor of the Nation's Coast Guard \nBand. Since its formation in 1925, this organization has developed an \ninternational reputation as one of the finest professional concert \nbands in the world. And since 1965, the Coast Guard Band has been the \npermanent, official musical representative of the nation's oldest \nmaritime service.\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\n  However, unlike its counterparts in the nation's four other military \nservices, the Coast Guard Band has never been led by an officer over \nthe military grade of O-5. Captain-Select Buckley's promotion \ndemonstrates the ascendance of an institution with a laudable and grand \ntradition. Once regarded as the Coast Guard Academy's local music \nensemble, the Coast Guard Band now routinely tours throughout the \nUnited States. It also often represents the Coast Guard around the \nworld and will certainly promote a distinguished image of the country's \nnew Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Coast Guard could not have found a finer leader to oversee the \nongoing evolution of this important institution. Captain-Select Buckley \nis an accomplished jazz trumpeter as well as music composer, arranger, \nand director. He is the recipient of the American Legion's \nDistinguished Service Citation and two Meritorious Service Medals.\n  Since his appointment as conductor of the Band in 1975, Captain-\nSelect Buckley has led the Coast Guard Band to play more concerts on \nair on National Public Radio than any other wind band, military or \ncivilian--a fine testament to his able leadership and to the musical \ntalent of the Coast Guard Band's men and women.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that my colleagues acted to confirm this \nnomination, to honor my constituent, Captain-Select Lewis J. Buckley, \nand to pay tribute to an historic musical institution, headquartered in \nNew London, Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6065-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the dedication and \nsacrifice of the men and women who have lost their lives while serving \nas public safety officers.\n  Tonight, in a candlelight vigil, the names of 56 officers who lost \ntheir lives last year will be added to the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial here in Washington, DC. This is a somber time to \nremember the perilous duties that law enforcement officers take on each \nand every day to protect our communities. The Memorial is a fitting \ntribute to honor those we have lost in the line of duty.\n  Sadly, Wisconsin owes three officers a special tribute for their \nservice. I would like to honor them by placing their names in the \nRecord along with the date of their untimely passing.\n  Officer Robert Etter, Hobart-Lawrence, July 22, 2002; Officer \nStephanie Markins, Hobart-Lawrence, July 22, 2002; Deputy Melvin \nSharpless of Waushara County, December 16, 2002.\n  I hope that these moments of recognition bring some solace to the \nofficers' families and express our appreciation for their service. We \nare forever in their debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6065-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          PLANNED PARENTHOOD: SHASTA-DIABLO'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to share \nwith my colleagues my thoughts on the 40th anniversary of Planned \nParenthood: Shasta-Diablo, located in my home State of California.\n  It is my great honor to recognize the extraordinary contributions of \nPlanned Parenthood: Shasta-Diablo, PPSD, as it celebrates its 40th \nanniversary. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America was founded \nin 1916 by visionary social reformer Margaret Sanger. In 1962, PPSD \nbegan serving Contra Costa County and now provides essential \nreproductive health care and public education to more than 100,000 \nwomen, men, and teenagers in 13 northern California counties. During \nthese 40 years, PPSD has shown an unwavering commitment to providing \nthe highest quality reproductive health services, regardless of income. \nFor many low-income residents in these 13 counties, PPSD may be their \nonly source of health care.\n  PPSD's dedication and leadership place it at the cutting edge of \nPlanned Parenthood affiliates. PPSD has the distinction of having the \nlargest education department of any Planned Parenthood affiliate in the \nUnited States. PPSD has been at the forefront of the fight against the \nspread of HIV/AIDS because it was the first Planned Parenthood \naffiliate in the United States to provide HIV testing in 1987. In 1990, \nPPSD was also one of the first affiliates to begin providing prenatal \nservices. PPSD recognized that it is critically important to the health \nof a woman and her baby that she receive health care as early as \npossible in the pregnancy.\n  In addition to providing services at traditional health centers, PPSD \nhas the largest number of express sites in the United States. At these \nexpress sites, PPSD partners with a wide range community groups to \nprovide birth control, including emergency contraception. Through the \nexpress sites, PPSD is able to serve high schools and colleges, \nhomeless shelters, social service offices, and rural health \ndepartments. Underserved populations are able to get lifesaving \nservices that might not otherwise be available to them. And high-risk \nyouth are well served by PPSD's express sites and teen peer educators \nwho offer advice that youth can really relate to.\n  Planned Parenthood: Shasta-Diablo would not have reached its 40th \nanniversary without the outstanding and exemplary leadership of two \nvery special women. It is my pleasure to recognize Rosalie Ross, who \nserved as executive director of PPSD for 10 years, and current \npresident and CEO Heather Saunders Estes. Their dedication, foresight, \nand compassion are extraordinary and inspirational.\n  PPSD is ``Celebrating Our Past, Protecting Our Future: 40 Years of \nService, 30 Years of Choice'' because this year we also commemorate the \n30th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. The Roe decision saved countless lives \nby getting women out of the back alleys and into clean and safe \nfacilities. The Roe decision has kept women from being forced to \ncontinue pregnancies that could endanger their health or render them \ninfertile. The 30th anniversary of Roe commemorates not an isolated \nevent, but a long and unending struggle for women's equality.\n  PPSD is an important part of that struggle. For the past 20 years, I \nhave been fighting in Congress for reproductive rights. PPSD has stood \nby me, working hand in hands to protect a woman's right to choose. \nPlanned Parenthood: Shasta-Diablo has been there for women, men, and \nteens for 40 years and I wish them another 40 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6065-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING DEVELOPMENT OF SISTER CITIES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two \ncommunities that will become ``sister cities'' on May 31, 2003. This \nassociation began in 1986, by chance, between the communities of \nWebster, SD and the borough of Dewangen Germany, in the town of Aalen. \nTheir friendship arose when the Dewangen wrestling team and their \ncoach, Tony Abele, visited the city of Webster for one week. This \n``match'' has grown and flourished through the efforts of several \nmembers of the Webster community and their Mayor, Mike Grosek.\n  The Contract of Friendship will improve the mutual understanding \nbetween the people of these two nations, with the exchange of \ninformation to include sportive, cultural and municipal events. It will \nfocus, above all, on the young people of both communities, imparting to \nthem the understanding of each other's world view, problems and \nachievements and the importance of mutual responsibility for a peaceful \nco-existence.\n  Both communities and their elected representatives have entered into \nthis contract of friendship in the name of their respective citizens. \nIt is their request to accept and honor the joint responsibility for \nglobal peace and environment; to support exchanges in the field of \nculture, sports and economy, and to deepen the good relations based on \nfriendship and common understanding.\n  I commend the city of Webster for its diligence in pursuing this \ncontract of friendship, and I welcome the citizens of Dewangen, Germany \nto the great State of South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6065-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6065-S6066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING THE KAHUKU HIGH AND INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the team of \nstudents from\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\nKahuku High and Intermediate School of Kahuku, HI, on logging yet \nanother bright performance for their school at the ``We the People . . \n. the Citizen and the Constitution'' national competition recently held \nhere in our Nation's Capital. The team traveled over 5,000 miles to \nrepresent Hawaii in this competition, and won the Unit 3 award, ``How \nthe Values and Principles Embodied in the Constitution Shaped American \nInstitutions and Practices,'' for the second consecutive year. On \nbehalf of the people of Hawaii, I am proud to congratulate the Kahuku \nteam.\n  As my colleagues are familiar, the We the People competition, \nadministered by the Center for Civic Education, is a comprehensive \nprogram that assists students in understanding the history and \nprinciples of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The academic \ncompetition simulates a congressional hearing where students, acting as \nexpert witnesses, testify before a panel of prominent professionals \nfrom across the country to demonstrate their knowledge of \nconstitutional issues. The program provides an excellent opportunity \nfor students to gain an appreciation of the significance of our \nConstitution and its place in history and our lives today. As a former \nteacher, it heartens me to see our young people taking interest in \nlearning about the sacred document which we in this Chamber work to \nuphold and defend, every day. It is only through the understanding of \nour Constitution and the Bill of Rights that we are able to perpetuate \nthe democratic foundation upon which this great Nation was built. I \napplaud all students who participate in this competition for their hard \nwork and dedication to civic education. We might well have future \nSenators and Members of Congress who are encouraged to enter public \nservice because of their experiences in the We the People competition.\n  I am pleased to enter the names of the Kahuku team members for the \nrecord: Adriana Alghussein, Daniel Allen, Dexter Bacon, Nicole Cameron, \nAriane Cameros, Li Shieh Chen, Anthony Ching, William Ellis, Brooke \nJones, Shantel Kaululaau, April Kekaula, Helene Keys, Malia Love, \nLeilani Miller, Andrew Savini, Jessica Schiaretti, Kristen Sickler, \nBethany Smith, Ericka Staples, and Elizabeth Torres. I also take this \nopportunity to recognize their teacher Sandra Cashman, State \nCoordinator Lyla Berg, and District Coordinator Sharon Kaohi for all of \ntheir contributions in helping the Kahuku team prepare for the national \ncompetition.\n  Again, I congratulate the students and the faculty of Kahuku High and \nIntermediate School for their outstanding achievements. I am pleased to \nnote that a team from this school has represented Hawaii in 9 of the \npast 11 national competitions. I join the people of Hawaii in \nexpressing my pride in their impressive achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6066-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GRUNDY CENTER RECEIVES PE4LIFE ACHIEVEMENT AWARD\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \npeople of Grundy Center, Iowa for their hard work and success in \ndeveloping one of the Nation's best-all around physical education \nprograms, in their schools and in the entire community. As a result of \ntheir leadership and dedication to physical fitness, Grundy Center has \nbeen selected to receive the PE4LIFE Community Achievement Award. In \naddition, the community will now serve other Iowans and the rest of the \nNation as the second PE4LIFE Institute.\n  This is a great achievement, thanks in large part to Beth Kirkpatrick \nand Rick Schupbach, who for 15 years have served this community and \ndedicated themselves to building an innovative physical education \nprogram. The PE4LIFE program effectively reaches and inspires every \nstudent, regardless of athletic ability or experience, to become \nphysically active for a lifetime. It is the kind of inclusive approach \nthat will make a difference in Iowa and throughout the country. The \nneed for what Rick and Beth will do as codirectors of the new PE4LIFE \nInstitute has never been greater.\n  Obesity has become our Nation's fastest rising public health threat. \nThe number of overweight and obese Americans has more than doubled in \nthe last 30 years. The problem is especially serious for children; the \nnumber of overweight children is growing at a rate faster than the \nnumber of adults. If we don't do something to halt and reverse the \ntrend, we will face a significant health care crisis. If we don't do \nsomething, our children, as they grow into adults, will face greater \nthreats from diabetes, heart disease and other serious maladies related \nto being out of shape and overweight. It is now estimated that the \nannual cost of treating obesity related diseases is over $100 billion \nper year.\n  Unfortunately, the solution is getting away from us. Physical \neducation in our Nation's schools has declined. In 1991, only 42 \npercent of our Nation's students had daily physical education. Today \nthat number is around 29 percent.\n  Physical education and daily physical activity go a long way to \nimproving the overall health of our children. We need to improve on \ncardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, flexibility, help with \nweight regulation, bone development and posture. Teaching active \nlifestyle habits to children will go a long way to helping our children \ngrow up to be active and healthy adults. An active lifestyle also \npromotes the constructive use of leisure time. Improving physical \neducation in our schools is a sure way to influence these behavior \npatterns in our children.\n  Our kids are not in shape. They spend too much time in front of the \nTV, playing video games or working on their computers. The best way to \nget them back on their feet is to improve the physical education they \nreceive while they are in school. Programs like the new PE4LIFE \nInstitute in Grundy Center are critically important to tackling this \nproblem.\n  Before he was inaugurated, President-elect John F. Kennedy wrote an \narticle for Sports Illustrated entitled, ``The Soft American.'' He \nwrote:\n\n       For physical fitness is not only one of the most important \n     keys to a healthy body: it is the basis of dynamic and \n     creative intellectual activity.

Mr. President, on February 18, New York lost one \nof its finest citizens. Thomas Shepardson was a Syracuse funeral \ndirector who helped change the way our Nation responds to incidents of \nmass fatality.\n  The Disaster Mortuary Operational Rescue Team, D-MORT, plan was \ncreated because Mr. Shepardson was disturbed by news reports of the \nexploitation of victims' families after a Texas air disaster in 1986. \nHe convened a group of local morticians, first responders, and medical \nprofessionals to create a strategy that would be humane and team-\noriented. Fortunately, the plan would never be used locally, but State \nofficials would enlist Shepardson to devise a similar plan for the \nState of New York. He subsequently worked with FEMA and other \ngovernment agencies to incorporate the D-MORT model into our national \ndisaster medical system.\n  Tom Shepardson responded to the major disasters of the last decade \nincluding the Oklahoma City bombing. On September 11, 2001, he oversaw \nthe national D-MORT response in New York, Pennsylvania and the \nPentagon. Tom Shepardson was described by Gary Moore, deputy director \nof the Federal Office of Emergency Response, as ``a man who spent his \nwhole life working to help everyone . . . He was a one-man show who \nbrought so much energy and commitment to this that it now involves \nabout 5,000 people nationwide and made him known all around the \nworld.'' I am grateful for Tom Shepardson's legacy of personal \nsacrifice and leadership.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6067-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n                         TRIBUTE TO FRED TAYLOR\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize and honor an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. Mr. Fred \nTaylor of Oxford, MS has recently retired from the Board of Directors \nof First National Bank. Mr. Taylor and his wife of 70 years, Jewett, \nhave served the Oxford and Lafayette County community for 45 years.\n  Fred Taylor has a history of outstanding achievements that can be \ntraced back to his high school days in Gallman, MS. Mr. Taylor was a \nstandout in football, basketball, and baseball at Copiah-Lincoln \nAgricultural High School and, for his ability, was inducted into the \nCopiah-Lincoln Athletic Hall of Fame in 1989. After high school Mr. \nTaylor attended Mississippi State University before transferring to \nTransylvania University in Lexington, KY, where he lettered in football \nand basketball and received a degree in economics.\n  In his professional career, Mr. Taylor has spent time in a variety of \njobs, from coaching high school football and basketball, to selling \ninsurance, to operating his 600-acre cattle farm in Oxford, \nMississippi. He has also served as the Commissioner for the Lafayette \nCounty Soil and Water Conservation District, Director of the State Soil \nand Water Conservation Commissioners, President of the Mississippi \nCattlemen's Association, Director of the Oxford/Lafayette County \nChamber of Commerce, and numerous other prestigious positions of public \nservice.\n  During these years, Mr. Taylor has been recognized numerous times by \nhis colleagues and peers for excellence in his work and dedication to \nhis community. In 1984 he was inducted into the Mississippi Agriculture \nand Forestry Museum Hall of Fame. He has also been the recipient of the \nCitizen of the Year Award given by the Oxford-Lafayette Chamber of \nCommerce, as well as numerous agricultural, soil, and conservation \nawards.\n  As I am sure you can see, Mr. Taylor has distinguished himself both \npersonally and professionally, and he has been a valued asset to \nMississippi. His record of service is not only a testament to his \nabilities, but also to the quality of his personal character. Oxford \nand Lafayette County have been well served by his commitment, guidance, \nand leadership and would not have been the same if it were not for his \ndirection. It is for these reasons that I feel the need to pay tribute \nto him and to share his record of contributions to Mississippi with all \nof you here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6067-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6067-S6069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LETTER FROM DAVID A. HARRIS\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask that the following letter \nbe printed in the Record. The letter follows.\n\n   Letter From an Endangered Species, by David A. Harris, Executive \n         Director, American Jewish Committee, January 10, 2003\n\n       Let me put my cards on the table right up front.\n       I consider myself a potentially endangered species. I am--\n     gasp!--a committed transatlanticist. Until just a short time \n     ago that was a rather unexceptional thing to be; most people \n     I knew on both sides of the Atlantic were, to varying \n     degrees, in the same club. Now, in some places, it could get \n     my picture on a ``Wanted'' poster.\n       Seemingly overnight, significant swaths of European public \n     opinion--most strikingly in Germany, but in other countries \n     as well--appear to have concluded that the Bush \n     administration is hell-bent on imposing its ``imperialist'' \n     vision on the world, that the American ``infatuation'' with \n     the use of force as a solution to global challenges is \n     downright hazardous, and that America pays little more than \n     lip service to its European allies, with the possible \n     exception of Britain, while single-mindedly pursuing a \n     unilateralist agenda.\n       According to this line of thinking--often promoted by \n     opinion molders, including, in the recent German elections, a \n     few leading politicians--America is run by a group of modern-\n     day ``cowboys,'' with precious little sophistication in the \n     ways of the world, determined to use their unchallenged \n     superpower status to get their way on everything, be it Iraq, \n     global warming, the International Criminal Court, or \n     genetically modified foods, and let the rest of the world be \n     damned if they don't like it. In response, Europe must draw \n     appropriate conclusions and rise up essentially as a \n     counterweight to otherwise unchecked American global \n     domination.\n       This disparaging and distrustful view extends beyond \n     politics. A new American Jewish Committee survey in Germany \n     found that only 36 percent of the respondents rated America's \n     cultural achievement as ``very substantial or substantial,'' \n     while 48 percent thought it either ``hardly substantial'' or \n     ``insubstantial,'' and 16 percent had no opinion.\n       And a recent grisly case involving the Internet, \n     cannibalism, and homicide in Germany produced a telling \n     comment from the influential Munich newspaper Suddeutsche \n     Zeitung, as reported in the International Herald Tribune \n     (December 19): ``It is all so unreal. So haunting that one \n     thinks such a case would only happen in the movies, \n     perhaps in America, but not in Germany. . . .'' Yes, \n     America, of course, is capable of such bestial violence, \n     but Germany never, we are led to believe.\n       Meanwhile, new generations of Europeans, increasingly fed \n     this diet of overtly or subtly anti-American thinking, too \n     often lose sight of the larger picture. They cannot relate \n     easily to the backdrop of history.\n       That America came to Europe's rescue in two world wars of \n     Europe's making, that America became history's most benign \n     occupier in postwar Germany, that the U.S.-funded Marshall \n     Plan was a key to Western Europe's astonishing reconstruction \n     efforts, that American-led resolve and strength prevailed in \n     the Cold War and contributed to the unification not only of \n     Germany but of all Europe, and that America prodded a largely \n     paralyzed Europe into decisive action against ethnic \n     cleansing (on European soil) in the Balkans, may at best have \n     an abstract hold on younger people's thinking, but little \n     more.\n       Like their American counterparts, younger Europeans are \n     largely focused on the here and now. They may relate to \n     American music, fashion, idiom, or, heaven forbid, fast food, \n     but have an increasingly jaundiced view of America's larger \n     place in global affairs.\n       At the same time, on too many levels, America largely \n     ignores Europe, even as some voices emphasize the oceanic \n     divide.\n       Perhaps the most talked-about recent essay on the subject \n     was Robert Kagan's ``Power and Weakness,'' which appeared in \n     the June & July 2002 issue of Policy Review. It is a \n     provocative piece well worth reading. Here's a brief excerpt:\n       ``It is time to stop pretending that Europeans and \n     Americans share a common view of the world, or even that they \n     occupy the same world. On the all-important question of \n     power--the efficacy of power, the morality of power, the \n     desirability of power--American and European perspectives are \n     diverging. Europe is turning away from power, or to put it a \n     little differently, it is moving beyond power into a self-\n     contained world of laws and rules and transnational \n     negotiation and cooperation. It is entering a post-historical \n     paradise of peace and relative prosperity, the realization of \n     Kant's `Perpetual Peace.'\n       ``The United States, meanwhile, remains mired in history, \n     exercising power in the anarchic Hobbesian world where \n     international laws and rules are unreliable and where true \n     security and the defense and promotion of a liberal order \n     still depend on the possession and use of military might.\n       ``That is why on major strategic and international \n     questions today, Americans are from Mars and Europeans are \n     from Venus.''\n       And noting the wide gap in perceptions of America between \n     Eastern and Western Europe, columnist Charles Krauthammer \n     suggested jokingly--I think--in the Weekly Standard (August \n     26) that had America let Western Europe fall under the sway \n     of the Kremlin for a few decades, perhaps, like the nations \n     of Eastern Europe today, it would be far more appreciative of \n     America's world role.\n       In essence, the caricatured image of America in Europe has \n     its counterpart here.\n       Europeans are seen as sanctimonious, self-adulatory, and \n     wobbly at the knees. Rather than display a willingness to \n     confront evil--that is, if they can even recognize it these \n     days--they all too frequently seek to engage it through \n     rationalization, negotiation, and, if necessary, appeasement \n     via one Faustian bargain or another, all in the name, however \n     it may be packaged, of realpolitik.\n       Look, the critics point out, at the European Union's so-\n     called ``critical dialogue'' with Iran, which has been much \n     longer on dialogue than on criticism.\n       Or the French flirtation with Iraq, going back to the 1970s \n     when Jacques Chirac, as prime minister, negotiated the Osirak \n     nuclear deal with Baghdad. Apropos, according to the Wall \n     Street Journal, the last foreign country Saddam Hussein \n     visited was France, in 1979.\n       Or the quiet deals several European countries, most notably \n     France and Italy, sought to make with Palestinian terrorist \n     groups to avoid being targeted by them.\n       Or the EU's unwillingness, even post-9/11, to agree on \n     classifying Hizballah as a terrorist organization on the \n     ostensible grounds that the group is also a ``legitimate'' \n     political party in Lebanon, but actually motivated by a \n     desire to avoid offending Syria and its satellite, Lebanon.\n       Or the state visits accorded to the Syrian president in \n     London last month, complete with an audience with Queen \n     Elizabeth, no less, or previously in Paris, Madrid, and other \n     European capitals, while Syria illegally occupies neighboring \n     Lebanon and cossets terrorist groups bent on Israel's total \n     destruction.\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\n       Or the EU's stance on Israel-related UN resolutions, almost \n     always opting to work out ``acceptable'' final language with \n     the Arab bloc rather than joining the United States in \n     opposing outright those objectionable texts that inevitably \n     end up condemning Israel, regardless of the facts on the \n     ground.\n       Some Americans believe that, left to their own devices, \n     many Europeans would, in Churchill's memorable words, be \n     ``resolved to be irresolute'' when faced with the likes of \n     Saddam Hussein, the mullahs of Tehran, or, for the matter, \n     Slobodan Milosevic. And, ironically, the Europeans can get \n     away with it because they know that, at the end of the day, \n     there is an America that has both the will and capacity to \n     lead the fight when no other option is available.\n       Observing these issues being played out from both sides of \n     the Atlantic, I wouldn't for a moment underestimate the \n     current chasm. It is real, if not always as wide as it may \n     seem at first glance. Still, we can't ever afford to lose \n     sight of what unites us.\n       Call me hopelessly, irredeemably naive, but I remain \n     convinced that Americans and Europeans are umbillically bound \n     by common foundational values and common existential threats, \n     and thus, ipso facto, a common agenda.\n       Those common values emanate from the very essence of our \n     respective societies: democracy, the rule of law, and respect \n     for the dignity of the individual.\n       Even a brief glance at international socio-economic indices \n     reveals the striking fact that the democratic nations, as a \n     group, rank highest in personal freedoms, per capita income, \n     life expectancy, levels of educational attainment, and \n     overall standards of living, and lowest in infant mortality \n     and corruption rates.\n       No less importantly, the democratic nations have renounced \n     war as an instrument of resolving policy disputes among \n     themselves.\n       The ties that link this precious fraternity of kindred \n     nations must never be permitted to fray, for they represent \n     the best--indeed, I would argue that only--hope for the \n     ultimate realization of a peaceful and prosperous world.\n       And the threats are transnational.\n       Just as democratic nations were at risk during World War II \n     and again during the Cold War, today those democratic nations \n     are in the crosshairs of the radical Islamic terrorist \n     network.\n       True, some European countries initially convinced \n     themselves that this threat was about America and not them.\n       But as Islamic terrorist cells have been uncovered in \n     Britain, Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, \n     Germany, and elsewhere in Europe, there is a growing \n     realization that we are all in this together. The targets are \n     not just specific countries, but the overarching values of \n     freedom, secularism, religious tolerance, pluralism, women's \n     rights, and openness that are enshrined in every democratic \n     society.\n       The threat from terrorist groups and their supporters \n     operating in just about every Western country is heightened \n     by the prospect of increasingly available weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       Even at the risk of stating the obvious, the United States \n     and Europe need each other, as much now as ever, in the face \n     of this worldwide, long-term menace.\n       We must maintain full cooperation in the gathering and \n     sharing of intelligence and a hundred other fields if we are \n     to emerge on tops in this daunting conflict.\n       We have to do a better job of coordinating policy, not only \n     on terrorist groups, but also on those nations that help and \n     harbor these groups. Can we afford to let such nations \n     continue to play us off one against the other, as they so \n     often have in the past?\n       And if I could be permitted to dream for just a moment, \n     imagine our collaborating on developing alternative energy \n     sources that would eventually wean us all off Middle East oil \n     and gas--and, perhaps way down the road, fossil fuels in \n     general--and do something good for Planet Earth in the \n     process.\n       In the final analysis, this struggle against the radicals \n     also entails strengthening the moderates in the Islamic \n     world, and, here again, the United States and Europe, working \n     together, increase the odds of success.\n       Put another way, we must win two epic battles, not one. We \n     must win the war, and we must win the peace. Winning one \n     without the other will eventually prove a Pyrrhic victory. \n     The United States cannot go it alone on both fronts and hope \n     to prevail. Nor can Europe.\n       Both of us have a profound stake in finding constructive \n     ways to encourage the forces of democratization, civil \n     society, and greater openness in countries that by and large \n     have been remarkably resistant to the political and economic \n     revolutions of recent times. Otherwise, further regression \n     will take place, with still greater division between their \n     world and ours, and all the attendant implications for \n     conflict, terrorism, and the spread of fundamentalism.\n       Take, as an example, the case of Pakistan. Imagine for a \n     moment the catastrophic global consequences if it descended \n     into civil war or fell into the hands of the Islamists.\n       Here's a turbulent country of 150 million, twice the size \n     of California, with 40 percent of its population under the \n     age of 15. Not only does Pakistan have weapons of mass \n     destruction, but the world was on edge recently when India \n     and Pakistan engaged in nuclear brinkmanship.\n       Moreover, there are nearly one million youngsters studying \n     full-time in Muslim religious schools, where the Koran and \n     jihad, and not civics and biology, are the principal \n     educational fare, and Osama bin Laden could win his share of \n     popularity contests. What's the future for these young \n     people, and how will their future impact on us?\n       The unraveling of Pakistan would hit the jackpot on the \n     political Richter scale and send massive shock waves through \n     its neighbors--Afghanistan, a country that has just been \n     brought back from the edge but remains far from secure, \n     China, India, and Iran. It would also have staggering \n     geopolitical, strategic, and economic implications for both \n     Europe and the United States.\n       Once again, therefore, we have a common agenda.\n       So, too, with Turkey.\n       Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was one of the most influential \n     statesmen of the twentieth century. He established the modern \n     Turkish Republic on the rubble of the collapsed Ottoman \n     Empire, courageously separated religion from state, and \n     recognized that the nation's future belonged squarely with \n     Europe. Eighty years later, Turkey is closer to that goal \n     than ever before, but the outcome is by no means certain.\n       Whether to admit Turkey to the European Union is a \n     European, not an American, decision. While the United States \n     has a profound interest in seeing this happen, it must exert \n     its influence without overplaying its hand and infuriating \n     the Europeans, as it managed to do last month in the run-up \n     to the Copenhagen summit of EU leaders. Close cooperation \n     between the United States and Europe can encourage Turkey to \n     take the additional steps necessary to persuade Brussels that \n     Ankara is a truly viable candidate for EU membership, and \n     thereby outflank its European opponents.\n       (Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president, \n     expressed this opposition most bluntly when, in November, he \n     declared in the French daily Le Monde that Turkey ``is not a \n     European country'' and inviting it into the EU would mean \n     ``the end of Europe.'')\n       The challenges of integrating Turkey into the EU should not \n     be minimized. At the time of accession, a decade or more from \n     now, it would almost certainly be the single most populous--\n     and, by far, poorest--EU member country. Further, it would \n     extend the EU's boundaries to the turbulent Middle East. \n     Turkey shares borders with, among others, Syria, Iran, and \n     Iraq. And, in the process, Europe would inherit an unknown \n     percentage of the Turkish population that is Muslim \n     fundamentalist, adding to Europe's already considerable \n     challenges in this regard.\n       Even so, the successful integration of Turkey into the \n     European Union could create a powerful and perhaps contagious \n     role model for other Muslim countries, beginning with those \n     Central Asian nations in the Turkish sphere of interest, such \n     as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, and extending far beyond.\n       The United States and Europe should have a similar interest \n     in extending the reach of genuine democracy, especially in \n     the Arab world, much of which is located practically at \n     Europe's doorstep. Here, too, there's room for collaboration \n     driven by the common overall objective of stabilizing the \n     region and increasing prospects for peace and regional \n     cooperation.\n       The United States, by dint of its size, influence, and \n     global reach, has a great deal to offer. So does the European \n     Union.\n       Let me digress for a moment. I am a long-time admirer of \n     the European Union. The more I understand the inventive \n     genius of Jean Monnet, the Frenchman called upon by Robert \n     Schuman, the postwar French foreign minister, to \n     conceptualize a structure that would prevent future wars with \n     Germany, the more in awe I am and the more I appreciate the \n     need for similarly bold thinking today.\n       (And it should be pointed out that such a structure, \n     envisioned to fully integrate a rebuilding Germany, was a far \n     cry from 1944 Morgenthau Plan, named after President \n     Roosevelt's secretary of the treasury, which would have \n     converted a defeated Germany into a primarily pastoral \n     country.)\n       Indeed, following Monnet's recommendations, the six-nation \n     European Coal and Steel Community was formally established in \n     1952, once the member countries--Belgium, France, Italy, \n     Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany--ratified the \n     Treaty of Paris. Along the way, on May 9, 1950, Schuman \n     publicly declared:\n       ``It is no longer a time for vain words, but for a bold, \n     constructive act. France has acted, and the consequences of \n     her action may be immense. We hope they will. She has acted \n     essentially in the cause of peace. For peace to have a \n     chance, there must first be a Europe. Nearly 5 years to the \n     day after the unconditional surrender of Germany, France is \n     now taking the first decisive step toward the construction of \n     Europe and is associating Germany in this venture. It is \n     something which must completely change things in Europe and \n     permit other joint actions which were hitherto impossible. \n     Out of all this will come forth Europe, a solid and united \n     Europe. A Europe in which the standard of living will rise. . \n     . .''\n       The European Union's evolution over the past 50 years has \n     been nothing short of breathtaking.\n       It is a remarkable case study in the emergence of a \n     democratic and ever-more prosperous grouping based on the \n     vision of political giants, with the core objective of \n     preventing future wars. A European Union of 15\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\n     nations, soon to be 25, with Bulgaria and Romania poised to \n     join a few years hence, has much to teach other regions, most \n     notably the Arab world, about institution-building and \n     integration.\n       This sounds, I realize, like the stuff of distant, perhaps \n     impossible, dreams. Many reasons can be offered why the \n     European experience cannot take root in the Arab world. There \n     are, needless to say, countless political, cultural, \n     historic, and economic differences between Europe and the \n     Arab bloc.\n       Still, I refuse to abandon hope because there is no more \n     promising alternative, certainly not over the long term, and \n     I am unwilling to accept the proposition that the Arab people \n     have no choice for the future but to live under corrupt, \n     autocratic, stifling filial dynasties.\n       Here, too, the United States and Europe, working in \n     concert, can help lead the way and reap the benefits of their \n     efforts.\n       And while it may seem far-fetched today, it is entirely \n     conceivable that the United States and Europe could one day \n     be talking about Israel's entry into the European Union, and \n     perhaps even NATO, as part of a comprehensive solution to the \n     Arab-Israeli conflict.\n       In short--and I've only skimmed the surface--leaders on \n     both sides of the Atlantic Ocean need to stress constantly \n     our common values, common threats, and common goals.\n       To be sure, there are, and inevitably will always be, \n     differences between Europe and the United States rooted in \n     political rivalry, economic competition, divergent interests, \n     and the like. In the larger scheme of things, however, these \n     differences however, ought to be quite manageable and, in any \n     case, must never be permitted to overshadow the \n     commonalities.\n       The American Jewish Committee has long been in the business \n     of building bridges between Europe and the United States, \n     precisely because it understands what is at stake. At \n     turbulent moments such as this, the work becomes only more \n     important.\n       For us, it means recognizing that Europe, given its size \n     and significance, cannot easily be ignored or dismissed even \n     when we don't like what we see; rather, it must be engaged \n     with skill, sophistication, and sensitivity, with ever more \n     points of contact established.\n       Moreover, it means never losing sight of the larger picture \n     of Europe and America as the likeliest of strategic allies, \n     even we raise tough issues with our European interlocutors, \n     as we at AJC do regularly in Berlin, Paris, Madrid, Brussels, \n     and other centers of power.\n       Among these issues currently are: (a) the slow and \n     stumbling reaction of too many Europeans to the indisputable \n     rise in anti-Semitism during the past 2 years; (b) the \n     unacceptable moral equivalence (or worse) with which a number \n     of European governments view the Israeli-Palestinian \n     conflict; (c) the political expediency all too evident in \n     molding relations with dictatorial regimes in the Arab world \n     (and Iran); (d) the rapidly declining impact of the Shoah on \n     European attitudes toward Israel and the Jewish people; and \n     (e) the growing anti-Americanism that too often goes \n     unchecked.\n       On a lighter but related note, I had a good laugh when I \n     saw a cartoon in the New Yorker (October 28, 2002) which \n     showed a hostess at a cocktail party introducing two men to \n     each other. The caption read: ``Francophobe, meet \n     Francophile.'' In my case, though, I sometimes feel that both \n     individuals are living within me. No European country \n     attracts me more culturally, or exasperates me more \n     diplomatically, than France.\n       At the same time, I fully understand that generalizations \n     can be dangerous.\n       Not all of Europe is anti-American, anti-Israel, or anti-\n     Semitic, far from it. Britain, Denmark, Italy, and Spain are \n     today very close to Washington; Germany, Britain, and the \n     Netherlands are the EU countries most sympathetic to Israel; \n     and there are some European nations that have experienced \n     few, if any, anti-Semitic incidents in recent years.\n       Even in France, described by proche-orient.info (the \n     principal French-language source for balanced Middle East \n     coverage) as the country that ``takes the lead in the \n     European Union's anti-Israel policies,'' roughly 20 percent \n     of the parliamentarians in the National Assembly belong to \n     the France-Israel Caucus. That may not be a sufficient \n     critical mass to sway a nation, but it's still a rather \n     impressive number to work with.\n       Moreover, though often overlooked, the situation in Central \n     and Eastern Europe is actually quite encouraging. By and \n     large, these countries are pro-American--Poland, Bulgaria, \n     and Romania being three outstanding examples; they have close \n     links with Israel, and, for a variety of reasons, have \n     reached out to world Jewry in the past decade in a way that \n     offers real hope for the future.\n       To sum it up, it would be well to revisit the eloquent \n     words expressed by President Bush at the NATO summit in \n     Prague 6 weeks ago. The American head of state said:\n       ``The trans-Atlantic ties of Europe and America have met \n     every test of history, and we intend to again. U-boats could \n     not divide us. The threats and standoffs of the Cold War did \n     not make us weary. The commitment of my nation to Europe is \n     found in the carefully tended graves of young Americans who \n     died for this continent's freedom. That commitment is shown \n     by the thousands in uniforms still serving here, from the \n     Balkans to Bavaria, still willing to make the ultimate \n     sacrifice for this continent's future.\n       ``For a hundred years, place names of Europe have often \n     stood for conflict and tragedy and loss. Single words evoke \n     sad and bitter experience--Verdun, Munich, Stalingrad, \n     Dresden, Nuremberg, and Yalta. We have no power to rewrite \n     history. We do have the power to write a different story for \n     our time. . . .\n       ``In Prague, young democracies will gain new security, a \n     grand alliance will gather strength and find new purpose, and \n     America and Europe will renew the historic friendship that \n     still keeps the peace of the world.''\n       These stirring words--and their policy implications--\n     deserve a long life span, as well as permanent top-priority \n     status, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The question, of \n     course, is whether they will get it.\n       Given the global challenges piling up one on top of \n     another, from Iraq to North Korea, it's safe to say that we \n     should have a pretty good idea quite soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6069-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6069-S6070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2318.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nsimilar to measures I have introduced in previous Congresses that will \nhelp protect our Nation's natural resources and improve the visitor \nexperience in our national parks and other public lands. The Transit in \nParks Act, or ``TRIP,'' establishes a new Federal transit grant \ninitiative to support the development of alternative transportation \nservices for our national parks, wildlife refuges, Federal recreational \nareas, and other public lands. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nAkaka, Alexander, Baucus, Corzine, Dodd, Graham, Kennedy, Lautenberg, \nLevin, Reid, Schumer, Stabenow, and Wyden, who are cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  I want to underscore again today some of the principal arguments I \nhave made in past years as to why this legislation is urgently needed. \nMemorial Day weekend, the opening of the summer travel season, is just \nweeks away. Millions of visitors will soon head to our national parks \nto enjoy the incredible natural heritage with which our Nation was \nendowed. But too many of them will spend hours looking for parking, or \nstaring at the bumper of the car in front of them.\n  Clearly, the world has changed significantly since the national parks \nfirst opened in the second half of the nineteenth century, when \nvisitors arrived by stagecoach along dirt roads. At that time, travel \nthrough parklands, such as Yosemite or Yellowstone, was long, \ndifficult, and costly. Not many people could afford or endure such a \ntrip. The introduction of the automobile gave every American greater \nmobility and freedom, which included the freedom to travel and see some \nof our Nation's great natural wonders. Early in this century, landscape \narchitects from the National Park Service and highway engineers from \nthe U.S. Bureau of Public Roads collaborated to produce many feats of \nroad engineering that opened the national park lands to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Yet greater mobility and easier access now threaten the very \nenvironments that the National Park Service is mandated to protect. The \nongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for our national park system. Today, record numbers of \nvisitors and cars have resulted in increasing damage to our parks. The \nGrand Canyon alone has almost five million visitors a year. As many as \n6,000 vehicles arrive in a single summer day. They compete for 2,400 \nparking spaces. Between 32,000 and 35,000 tour buses go to the park \neach year. During the peak summer season, the entrance route becomes a \ngiant parking lot.\n  In 1975, the total number of visitors to America's national parks was \n190 million. By 2002, that number had risen to 277 million annual \nvisitors--almost equal to one visit by every man, woman, and child in \nthis country. This dramatic increase in visitation has created an \noverwhelming demand on these areas, resulting in severe traffic \ncongestion, visitor restrictions, and in some instances vacationers \nbeing shut out of the parks altogether. The environmental damage at the \nGrand Canyon is visible at many other parks: Yosemite, which has more \nthan four million visitors a year; Yellowstone, which has more than \nthree million visitors a year and experiences such severe traffic \ncongestion that access has to be restricted; Zion; Acadia; Bryce; and \nmany others. We need to solve these problems now or risk permanent harm \nto our Nation's natural, cultural, and historical heritage.\n  Visitor access to the parks is vital not only to the parks \nthemselves, but to the economic health of their gateway communities. \nFor example, visitors to Yosemite infuse $3 billion a year into the \nlocal economy of the surrounding area. At Yellowstone, tourists spend \n$725 million annually in adjacent communities. Wildlife-related tourism \ngenerates an estimated $60 billion a year nationwide. If the parks are \nforced to close their gates to visitors due to congestion, the economic \nvitality of the surrounding region would be jeopardized.\n  The challenge for park management has always been twofold: to \nconserve and protect the nation's natural, historical, and cultural \nresources, while at the same time ensuring visitor access and enjoyment \nof these sensitive environments. Until now, the principal \ntransportation systems that the Federal government has developed to \nprovide access into our national parks are roads, primarily for private \nautomobile access. The TRIP legislation recognizes that we need to do \nmore than simply build roads; we must invest in alternative \ntransportation solutions before our national parks are damaged beyond \nrepair.\n  In developing solutions to the parks' transportation needs, this \nlegislation builds upon the 1997 Memorandum of Understanding between \nSecretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and Secretary of the Interior \nBruce Babbitt, in\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\nwhich the two Departments agreed to work together to address \ntransportation and resource management needs in and around national \nparks. The findings in the MOU are especially revealing: Congestion in \nand approaching many national parks is causing lengthy traffic delays \nand backups that substantially detract from the visitor experience. \nVisitors find that many of the national parks contain significant noise \nand air pollution, and traffic congestion similar to that found on the \ncity streets they left behind. In many national park units, the \ncapacity of parking facilities at interpretive or scenic areas is well \nbelow demand. As a result, visitors park along roadsides, damaging park \nresources and subjecting people to hazardous safety conditions as they \nwalk near busy roads to access visitor use areas. On occasion, national \npark units must close their gates during high visitation periods and \nturn away the public because the existing infrastructure and \ntransportation systems are at, or beyond, the capacity for which they \nwere designed.\n  In addition, the TRIP legislation is designed to implement the \nrecommendations from a comprehensive study of alternative \ntransportation needs in public lands that I was able to include in the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, as section \n3039. The Federal Lands Alternative Transportation Systems Study \nconfirmed what those of us who have visited our national parks already \nknow: there is a significant and well-documented need for alternative \ntransportation solutions in the national parks to prevent lasting \ndamage to these incomparable natural treasures.\n  The study examined over two hundred sites, and identified needs for \nalternative transportation services at two-thirds of those sites. The \nstudy found that implementation of such services can help achieve a \nnumber of desirable outcomes: ``Relieve traffic congestion and parking \nshortages; enhance visitor mobility and accessibility; preserve \nsensitive natural, cultural, and historic resources; provide improved \ninterpretation, education and visitor information services; reduce \npollution; and improve economic development opportunities for gateway \ncommunities.''\n  In fact, the study concluded that ``the provision of transit in \nfederally-managed lands can have national economic implications as well \nas significant economic benefits for local areas surrounding the \nsites.'' The study determined that funding transit needs would support \nthousands of jobs around the country, while also providing a direct \nbenefit to the economy of gateway communities by ``expand[ing] the \nnumber of visits to the site and expand[ing] the amount of visitor \nspending in the surrounding communities.''\n  The study identified ``lack of a dedicated funding source for \ndeveloping, implementing, and operating and maintaining transit \nsystems'' as a key barrier to implementation of alternative \ntransportation in and around federally-managed lands. The Transit in \nParks Act will go far toward helping parks and their gateway \ncommunities overcome this barrier. This new Federal transit grant \nprogram will provide funding to the Federal land management agencies \nthat manage the 388 various sites within the National Park System, the \nNational Wildlife Refuges, Federal recreational areas, and other public \nlands, including National Forest System lands, and to their State and \nlocal partners.\n  The bill's objectives are to develop new and expanded transit \nservices throughout the national parks and other public lands to \nconserve and protect fragile natural, cultural, and historical \nresources and wildlife habitats, to prevent or mitigate adverse impact \non those resources and habitats, and to reduce pollution and \ncongestion, while at the same time facilitating appropriate visitor \naccess and improving the visitor experience. The program will provide \ncapital funds for transit projects, including rail or clean fuel bus \nprojects, joint development activities, pedestrian and bike paths, or \npark waterway access, within or adjacent to national parks and other \npublic lands. The Secretary of Transportation may make funds available \nfor operations as well. The bill authorizes $90 million for this new \nprogram for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2009, consistent with \nthe level of need identified in the study. It is anticipated that other \nresources--both public and private--will be available to augment these \namounts.\n  The bill formalizes the cooperative arrangement in the 1997 MOU \nbetween the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the \nInterior to exchange technical assistance and to develop procedures \nrelating to the planning, selection and funding of transit projects in \nnational park lands. The bill further provides funds for planning, \nresearch, and technical assistance that can supplement other financial \nresources available to the Federal land management agencies. The \nprojects eligible for funding would be developed through the \ntransportation planning process and prioritized for funding by the \nSecretary of the Interior in consultation and cooperation with the \nSecretary of Transportation. It is anticipated that the Secretary of \nthe Interior would select projects that are diverse in location and \nsize. While major national parks such as the Grand Canyon or \nYellowstone are clearly appropriate candidates for significant transit \nprojects under this section, there are numerous small urban and rural \nFederal park lands that can benefit enormously from small projects, \nsuch as bike paths or improved connections with an urban or regional \npublic transit system. No single project will receive more than 12 \npercent of the total amount available in any given year. This ensures a \ndiversity of projects selected for assistance.\n  In addition, I firmly believe that this program will create new \nopportunities for the Federal land management agencies to partner with \nlocal transit agencies in gateway communities adjacent to the parks, \nboth through the TEA-21 planning process and in developing integrated \ntransportation systems. This will spur new economic development within \nthese communities, as they develop transportation centers for park \nvisitors to connect to transit links into the national parks and other \npublic lands.\n  The ongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for the National Park Service. Today, that challenge has new \ndimensions, with overcrowding, pollution, congestion, and resource \ndegradation increasing at many of our national parks. This \nlegislation--the Transit in Parks Act--will give our Federal land \nmanagement agencies important new tools to improve both preservation \nand access. Just as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is \nessential to moving large numbers of people in our national parks--\nquickly, efficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact. At the \nsame time, transit can enhance the economic development potential of \nour gateway communities.\n  As we begin a new millennium, I cannot think of a more worthy \nendeavor to help our environment and preserve our national parks, \nwildlife refuges, and Federal recreational areas than by encouraging \nalternative transportation in these areas. My bill is strongly \nsupported by the National Parks Conservation Association, Environmental \nDefense, the American Public Transportation Association, Community \nTransportation Association, Amalgamated Transit Union, Surface \nTransportation Policy Project, Natural Resources Defense Council, \nFriends of the Earth, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, America Bikes and \nothers, and I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a section-by-section \nanalysis, and letters of support be printed in the record, along with \nthe USA Today article, ``Save Parks: Park Cars.''\n  I believe that we have a clear choice before us: we can turn paradise \ninto a parking lot--or we can invest in alternatives. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Transit in Parks Act to ensure that our \nNation's natural treasures will be preserved for many generations to \ncome.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a section-by-\nsection analysis, letters of support, and an article from the USA Today \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1032\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The act \n     responds to the need for alternative transportation systems \n     in the national parks and other public lands identified in \n     the study conducted by the Department of Transportation \n     pursuant to section 3039 of TEA-21, by establishing Federal \n     assistance to finance alternative transportation projects \n     within and in the vicinity of the national parks and other \n     public lands, to increase coordination with gateway \n     communities, to encourage public-private partnerships, and to \n     assist in the research and deployment of improved alternative \n     transportation equipment and methods.\n\n                         Section 4: Definitions\n\n       This section defines eligible projects and eligible \n     participants in the program. A ``qualified participant'' is a \n     Federal land management agency, or a State or local \n     governmental authority acting with the consent of a Federal \n     land management agency. A ``qualified project'' is a planning \n     or capital alternative transportation project, including rail \n     projects, clean fuel vehicles, joint development activities, \n     pedestrian and bike paths, waterborne access, or projects \n     that otherwise better protect the eligible areas and increase \n     visitor mobility and accessibility. ``Eligible areas'' are \n     lands managed by the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, as well \n     as any other Federally-owned or -managed park, refuge, or \n     recreational area that is open to the general public. \n     Qualified projects may be located either within eligible \n     areas or in gateway communities in the vicinity of eligible \n     areas.\n\n           Section 5: Federal Agency Cooperative Arrangements\n\n       This section implements the 1997 Memorandum of \n     Understanding between the Departments of Transportation and \n     the Interior for the exchange of technical assistance in \n     alternative transportation, the development of alternative \n     transportation policy and coordination, and the establishment \n     of criteria for planning, selection, and funding of projects \n     under this section.\n\n                     Section 6: Types of Assistance\n\n       This section gives the Secretary of Transportation \n     authority to provide Federal assistance through grants, \n     cooperative agreements, inter- or intra-agency agreements, or \n     other agreements, including leasing under certain conditions, \n     for a qualified project under this section.\n\n           Section 7: Limitation on Use of Available Amounts\n\n       This section specifies that the Secretary may not use more \n     than 5% of the amounts available under this section for \n     planning, research, and technical assistance; these amounts \n     can be supplemented from other sources. This section also \n     gives the Secretary discretion to make grants to pay for \n     operating expenses. In addition, to ensure a broad \n     distribution of funds, no project can receive more than 12% \n     of the total amount available under this section in any given \n     year.\n\n                      Section 8: Planning Process\n\n       This section requires the Secretaries of Transportation and \n     the Interior to cooperatively develop a planning process \n     consistent with TEA-21 for qualified participants which are \n     Federal land management agencies. If the qualified \n     participant is a State or local governmental authority, the \n     qualified participant shall comply with the TEA-21 planing \n     process and consult with the appropriate Federal land \n     management agency during the planning process.\n\n               Section 9: Department's Share of the Costs\n\n       This section requires that in determining the Department's \n     share of the project costs, the Secretary of Transportation, \n     in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, must \n     consider certain factors, including visitation levels and \n     user fee revenues, coordination in project development with a \n     public or private transit provider, private investment, and \n     whether there is a clear and direct financial benefit to the \n     qualified participant. The intent is to establish criteria \n     for a sliding scale of assistance, with a lower Departmental \n     share for projects that can attract outside investment, and a \n     higher Departmental share for projects that may not have \n     access to such outside resources. In addition, this section \n     specifies that funds from the Federal land management \n     agencies can be counted toward the local share.\n\n              Section 10: Selection of Qualified Projects\n\n       This section provides that the Secretary of the Interior, \n     in cooperation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall \n     prioritize the qualified projects for funding in an annual \n     program of projects, according to the following criteria: (1) \n     project justification, including the extent to which the \n     project conserves resources, prevents or mitigates adverse \n     impact, and enhances the environment; (2) project location to \n     ensure geographic diversity and both rural and urban \n     projects; (3) project size for a balanced distribution; (4) \n     historical and cultural significance; (5) safety; (6) the \n     extent to which the project would enhance livable \n     communities, reduce pollution and congestion, and improve the \n     mobility of people in the most efficient manner; and (7) any \n     other considerations the Secretary deems appropriate, \n     including visitation levels, the use of innovative financing \n     or joint development strategies, and coordination with \n     gateway communities.\n\n              Section 11: Undertaking Projects in Advance\n\n       This provision applies current transit law to this section, \n     allowing projects to advance prior to receiving Federal \n     funding, but allowing the advance activities to be counted \n     toward the local share as long as certain conditions are met.\n\n      Section 12: Full Funding Agreement; Project Management Plan\n\n       This section provides that large projects require a project \n     management plan, and shall be carried out through a full \n     funding agreement to the extent the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n\n                 Section 13: Relationship to Other Laws\n\n       This provision applies certain transit laws to projects \n     funded under this section, and permits the Secretary to apply \n     any other terms or conditions he or she deems appropriate.\n\n                    Section 14: Innovative Financing\n\n       This section provides that a project assisted under this \n     Act can also use funding from a State Infrastructure Bank or \n     other innovative financing mechanism that is available to \n     fund other eligible transit projects.\n\n                      Section 15: Asset Management\n\n       This provision permits the Secretary of Transportation to \n     transfer control over a transit asset acquired with Federal \n     funds under this section to a qualified governmental \n     participant in accordance with certain Federal property \n     management rules.\n\nSection 16: Coordination of Research and Deployment of New Technologies\n\n       This provision allows the Secretary, in cooperation with \n     the Secretary of the Interior, to enter into grants or other \n     agreements for research and deployment of new technologies to \n     meet the special needs of eligible areas under this Act.\n\n                           Section 17: Report\n\n       This section requires the Secretary of Transportation to \n     submit a report on projects funded under this section to the \n     House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the \n     Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, to be \n     included in the Department's annual project report.\n\n                       Section 18: Authorization\n\n       $90,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for the \n     Secretary to carry out this program for each of the fiscal \n     years 2004 through 2009.\n\n                   Section 19: Conforming Amendments\n\n       Conforming amendments to the transit title, including an \n     amendment to allow 0.5% per year of the funds made available \n     under this section to be used for project management \n     oversight.\n\n                    Section 20: Technical Amendments\n\n       Technical corrections to the transit title in TEA-21.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The undersigned organizations want \n     to thank you for introducing the Transit in Parks Act that \n     will enhance transit options for access to and within our \n     public lands. We applaud your leadership and foresight in \n     recognizing the critical role that mass transit can play in \n     protecting our public lands and improving the visitor \n     experience.\n       Visitation to America's public lands has skyrocketed during \n     the past two decades. The national parks, for example, have \n     seen their visitation increase from 190 million visitors in \n     1975 to approximately 286 million visitors last year. \n     Increased public interest in these special places has placed \n     substantial burdens on the very resources that draw people to \n     these lands. As more and more individuals crowd into our \n     public lands--typically by automobile--fragile habitat, \n     endangered plants and animals, unique cultural treasures, and \n     spectacular natural resources and vistas are being damaged \n     from air and water pollution, noise intrusion, and \n     inappropriate use.\n       As outlined in your legislation, the establishment of a \n     program within the Department of Transportation dedicated to \n     enhancing transit options in and adjacent to public lands \n     will have a powerful, positive effect on the future \n     ecological and cultural integrity of these areas. Your \n     initiative will boost the role of alternative transportation \n     solutions for many areas, particularly those most heavily \n     impacted by visitation such as Yellowstone-Grand Teton, \n     Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Acadia, and the Great Smoky Mountains \n     national parks. For instance, development of transportation \n     centers and auto parking lots outside the parks, complemented \n     by the use of buses, vans, or rail systems, and/or bicycle \n     and pedestrian pathways would provide much more efficient \n     means of handling the crush of visitation. The benefit of \n     such systems has already been demonstrated in a number of \n     parks such as Zion and Cape Cod.\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\n       Equally important, the legislation will provide an \n     excellent opportunity for the NPS, BLM and FWS to enter into \n     public/private partnerships with states, localities, and the \n     private sector, providing a wider range of transportation \n     options than exists today. These partnerships could leverage \n     funds that the federal land managing agencies currently have \n     great difficulty accessing.\n       Finally, we support the legislation because it addresses \n     the critical lack of resources for maintaining and operating \n     alternative transportation systems once they are established.\n       We wholeheartedly endorse your bill as a creative new \n     mechanism to protect and enhance both the resources and \n     visitor experiences associated with America's public lands.\n       We look forward to working with you to move this \n     legislation to enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas C. Kiernan,\n       President, National Parks Conservation Association.\n     Anne Canby,\n       President, Surface Transportation Policy Project.\n     Dale S.

Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the more than 550,000 \n     members of the Natural Resources Defense Council, I am \n     writing to support your Transit in Parks Act. Many of our \n     national parks are suffering from the impacts of too many \n     automobiles: traffic congestion, air and water pollution, and \n     disturbance of natural ecosystems resulting in both the \n     degradation of natural and cultural resources and the \n     visitor's experience. Providing dedicated funding for transit \n     projects in our national parks, as your bill would do, is a \n     priority solution to these problems in the National Park \n     System.\n       It is essential in many parks to get visitors out of their \n     automobiles by providing attractive and effective transit \n     services to and within national parks. A sound practical \n     transit system will improve the visitor's experience--making \n     it more convenient and enjoyable for families and visitors of \n     all ages. Better transit is critical to diversifying \n     transportation choices and providing better access for the \n     benefit of all park visitors. Air pollutants from automobiles \n     driven by visitors can exacerbate respiratory health \n     problems, damage vegetation, and contribute to haze that too \n     often obliterates park vistas. And the more we get people \n     into public transit and out of their individual cars, the \n     more energy will be conserved. Lastly, a positive park \n     transit experience will demonstrate to visitors that transit \n     could serve them at home too, which should provide the \n     indirect benefit of higher ridership on other transit \n     systems. In short, this bill would help to reduce reliance on \n     automobiles by authorizing the funding so our national parks \n     can build and operate efficient and convenient transit \n     systems.\n       With their great biodiversity and their recreational and \n     educational value for all Americans, national parks make up \n     some the nation's most valuable land. As driving increases in \n     parks and on our roadways, it is critical to find ways to use \n     existing infrastructure more efficiently and to reduce the \n     impacts of transportation on these vital and sensitive lands.\n       We commend and thank you for your dedication and leadership \n     on this issue and more generally to the protection of our \n     national parks. Please look to us to help you establish \n     better public transit in our national parks.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles M. Clusen,\n     Senior Policy Analyst.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Environmental Defense,\n\n                                        New York, NY, May 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing on behalf of \n     Environmental Defense and our 300,000 members to express \n     support for the Transit in Parks Act, which will provide \n     dedicated funding for transit projects in our national parks. \n     Many parks suffer from the consequences of poor \n     transportation systems, traffic congestion, air and water \n     pollution, and disturbance of natural ecosystems.\n       Increased funding for attractive and effective transit \n     services to, and within our national parks is essential to \n     mitigating these growing problems. An effective transit \n     system in our national parks will not only make the park \n     experience more enjoyable for millions of families every \n     year, it will improve environmental conditions. Environmental \n     conditions such as air pollutants that exacerbate respiratory \n     health problems, damage vegetation and contribute to haze, \n     which too often destroys the natural beauty of our parks. \n     Enhancing transit within our national parks system would also \n     aid in providing access to for all citizens to our parks, \n     including those who do not own cars.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this issue, your \n     dedication to the health of our national parks and, your \n     support for expanded transportation choices for everyone. We \n     look forward to working with you to get this vitally \n     important legislation enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Krupp,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Amalgamated Transit Union,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n         Urban Affairs, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the more than 180,000 \n     members of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), the largest \n     labor organization representing mass transit, over-the-road, \n     and school bus drivers in the United States and Canada, I am \n     writing to express our strong support for the ``Transit in \n     Parks Act'' (TRIP), which would provide increased funding for \n     public transportation in national parks and other public \n     lands. Without question, this legislation begins to address \n     the major congestion and environmental issues that currently \n     exist in U.S. National Parks from coast to coast.\n       Through the years, federal transit programs have enabled \n     public transportation providers to assist urban communities \n     to significantly reduce congestion and improve air quality by \n     investing in mass transit, either bus or rail. Like you, we \n     believe that this can also be achieved in our national parks, \n     which during peak months become the equivalent of American \n     cities, inundated with hundreds of millions of visitors each \n     year. Therefore, ATU supports the adoption of the Transit in \n     Parks Act as part of TEA 21's reauthorization.\n       We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this and any \n     other transit issues with you or your staff at any time. As \n     always, thank you for your continuous support of the people \n     who proudly provide public transportation services for \n     millions of Americans each day, and for recognizing that mass \n     transit can provide benefits beyond our cities and suburbs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James La Sala,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                America Bikes,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We are writing to express our \n     enthusiastic support for the Transit in Park Act. This \n     legislation will enhance alternative transportation, \n     including transit, bicycling and walking, on our public \n     lands. We appreciate your leadership in protecting our public \n     lands and expanding opportunities for people to safely travel \n     to and through these important places by foot and by bicycle.\n       The dramatic increase in the number of Americans enjoying \n     public lands makes this legislation even more important. In \n     1975, 190 million people visited national parks. Last year, \n     that number had risen to 286 million. These growing numbers \n     are straining available resources, including the \n     transportation infrastructure. Providing better facilities \n     for bicycling and walking will encourage more people to use \n     those modes. The benefits are numerous:\n       Traffic congestion will be reduced, along with the \n     accompanying problems of air and water pollution, noise, and \n     impacts on wildlife and vegetation;\n       The visitor experience is improved for all. Less congestion \n     on the roads means easier driving for those in cars, and \n     fewer conflicts with those on foot or on bike. Travel by foot \n     or bicycle offers a much more intimate connection with our \n     public lands;\n       Shifting trips from private automobiles to transit, bike \n     and foot decreases the need for road expansions, oversized \n     parking lots, and the impact on roads;\n       Improving access by bicycle and by foot from local \n     communities will promote volunteerism and local involvement \n     in the parks;\n       Encouraging bicycling and walking on our public lands will \n     help address the myriad of health problems caused by physical \n     inactivity; and\n       Improvements to facilities will improve safety and reduce \n     bicycle and pedestrian fatalities. Currently, 13.6 percent of \n     fatalities on our roads are bicyclists and pedestrians, while \n     accounting for 7 percent of trips made.\n       Bicycles are a wonderful way to enjoy national parks, \n     whether a multi-day adventure or a short afternoon pedal. \n     Walking is ideal for shorter trips. And both modes combine \n     well with transit to provide a wide variety of transportation \n     choices.\n       America Bikes is a coalition of the leaders of the seven \n     major national bicycling organizations and the $5 billion/\n     year bicycle industry. The bicycle community wholeheartedly \n     endorses this legislation. We thank you for your foresight, \n     and we applaud your vision of\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\n     a more balanced transportation system on public lands.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Martha Roskowski,\n     Campaign Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Sept. 27, 2002]\n\n                         Save Parks: Park Cars\n\n       When the first white explorers and traders pushed up the \n     scenic Yellowstone River two centuries ago, they brought back \n     tales of a mysterious area the natives avoided. ``There is \n     frequently herd (sic) a loud noise, like Thunder, which makes \n     the earth Tremble,'' William Clark of Lewis and Clark fame \n     later wrote. ``They seldom go there . . . and Conceive it \n     possessed of spirits.''\n       The place the locals thought was haunted is now Yellowstone \n     National Park and its centerpiece, Old Faithful. What they \n     avoided now attracts 3 million visitors a year, most in motor \n     vehicles. Congestion has become so great that authorities are \n     looking at shuttle buses to reduce traffic. While the \n     solution won't thrill those who see themselves as modern-day \n     explorers entitled to their personal mechanical steeds, it \n     beats gridlock or rationing access to the park.\n       Yellowstone has bought a fleet of yellow tour buses similar \n     to ones phased out in the 1950s, when the family car became \n     king. The idea is keep the park experience from becoming an \n     urban commuter's nightmare.\n       If the plan succeeds, it could join a list of common-sense \n     measures aimed at stopping the head-on collision between the \n     nation's simultaneous love affairs with the automobile and \n     its parks.\n       Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado began shuttle \n     service in 1978 to reduce congestion, parking problems and \n     damage to resources. Glacier Park in Montana has brought back \n     refurbished red 1930s tour buses. Yosemite and the Grand \n     Canyon are moving in the same direction.\n       Massive Denali Park in Alaska long ago stopped private \n     vehicles a few miles inside the entrance, limiting travel to \n     buses to protect the fragile landscape. Zion Canyon, Utah, \n     has done likewise. Even small parks such as Harpers Ferry, W. \n     Va., have had to keep cars a couple miles away and bus \n     visitors in.\n       Mass transit and national parks sound like an oxymoron. But \n     as the thunder, not of geysers, but of auto traffic threatens \n     to drown out the beauty of nature and the dignity of the \n     past, public transportation is one key to keeping the parks \n     accessible to all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6078-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6078-S6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1044. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to \nprohibit the use of certain anti-competitive forward contracts; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we are having a crisis in the West. \nActually, we are having a crisis anywhere that there are people who \nraise livestock. The crisis comes about as a result of neither fair \ntrade nor free trade--in fact, the elimination of both. This bill is \ndesigned to make a correction in that. It is a clarification. I do not \nthink the clarification would be necessary if enforcement were done, \nbut this bill will clearly set out that a part of the problem can be \nsolved.\n  Part of the crisis that particularly the small farmers and ranchers \nwho raise livestock have is the drought we are having in the West. We \nare in the fourth year of a drought right now. That is resulting in a \nlot of for sale and auction signs going up on ranches. This is partly \nbecause they are not getting the proper price for their product. It is \na controlled market; it is not a free market.\n  To bring it to a level that more people would understand, imagine \ntrying to sell a house where the U.S. tradition might have changed so \nthat everybody worked through a realtor, or at least 80 percent of the \npeople worked through a realtor, and the realtor did not really show \nthe house to other people. The realtor bought the house and then put it \non the market themselves. The realtor had the capability to set the \nmarket price because of the other houses they owned.\n  That is what is happening with captive supply. There are a lot of \ntechnicalities to it. I sincerely hope my colleagues will take a look \nat it and understand it a little bit. It is very difficult. It is very \ndetailed. It is very complicated to understand, but it is very \nimportant to understand. It is important to understand on behalf of the \nranchers and consumers.\n  Now, one would think that if the price were being driven down for the \nrancher, those of us buying meat at the supermarket would get it for \nless. But if one tracks the price the ranchers are getting and the \nprice the consumers are paying when the price goes down for the \nrancher, everything stays level for the consumer. So where is the money \ngoing? It is staying in the middle somewhere. We know where it is \nstaying, and we know why it is staying, and it is control of the \nmarket. We do not usually allow that in the United States, but in this \ninstance we allow it.\n  So 80 percent of the market is controlled by four packers, and they \nset the price. They set it in a way that the rancher has no control \nover it whatsoever. So the ones suffering this drought and suffering \nall the risk are the ones receiving the least money from the entire \nprocess. We do not believe in that in America. My bill is designed to \nchange that.\n  Packers who practice price discrimination toward some producers and \nprovide undue preferences to other producers are clearly in violation \nof the current law, but this law is not being enforced. What we are \nleft with is unenforced laws or no laws at all to protect the \nindependent producer. Since the Packers and Stockyards Act is not being \nenforced, and the cost to enforcing the law on a case-by-case basis in \nthe courts is expensive and time consuming, today I propose the Senate \ntake action.\n  Most laws require enforcement. They are like speed limits on a \ncountry road. No one pays attention to the sign unless the driver is \nsharing the road with an agent of the law who will enforce it--like a \npolice car. This section of the Packers and Stockyards Act is like a \nsign on the road of commerce that no one is paying any attention to \nbecause the police are too busy doing something else.\n  The bill I am introducing today is not just another sign on the road, \nit is a speed bump. It does not just warn cars to go slower, it makes \nit more difficult for them to speed. Does it solve the whole problem? \nNo, but it is one speed bump on the way to solving the problem.\n  My bill does two things to create the speed bump. It requires that \nlivestock producers have a fixed base price in their contracts. It also \nputs these contracts up for bid in the open market where they belong. \nUnder this bill, forward contracts and marketing agreements must \ncontain a fixed base price on the day the contract is signed. Now, in \nother businesses, that sounds like how we already operate. But it is \nnot the way the packer operates. Producers are only given a contract \nthat says they will get a certain dollar above the average at the time \nof the slaughter. And then if the person who controls the market drives \nthe price down, the average can be well below what they ever \nanticipated it would be.\n  Under this bill, forward contracts and marketing agreements must \ncontain a fixed base price on the day the contract is signed. This \nprevents packers from manipulating the base price after the point of \nsale. You may hear allegations that this bill ends quality-driven \nproduction, but it does not prevent adjustments to the base price after \nslaughter for quality grade or other factors outside packer control. It \nprevents packers from changing the base price based on the factors they \ndo control.\n  Contracts that are based on the futures market are also exempted from \nthe bill's requirements. In an open market, buyers and sellers would \nhave the opportunity to bid against each other for contracts and could \nwitness bids that are made and accepted. That would be pretty unique if \nthey knew what the prices were on the products, particularly when it is \ncaptive supply. Whether they take the opportunity to bid or not is \ntheir choice. The key is they have the access to do so.\n  I have worked on a number of bills and we have had success getting \nthem through the Senate, and then the lobbying effort in conference \nknocks them out. That has sincerely convinced me there is a controlled \nmarket. Every attempt we make to provide a little speed bump is taken \nout and it is usually in conference. It usually passes the House, \npasses the Senate--not in identical form--but it has trouble in the \nconference committee. That is because there are a lot more lobbyists \nfor the packers than there are for the small ranchers and livestock \nproducers.\n\n  My bill also limits the size of the contracts to the rough equivalent \nof a load of livestock, meaning 40 cattle or\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\n30 swine. It does not limit the number of contracts that will be \noffered by any individual. This key portion prevents small- and medium-\nsized livestock producers like those found in Wyoming from being shut \nout of deals containing thousands of livestock per contract. The more \nanimals you have in the contract, the less likely it is that people can \nfreely participate in the bidding process. It eliminates people.\n  We are sticking a small number of animals in each contract, but lots \nof contracts will help us to arrive at a more fair price for the \nlivestock. Requiring a firm base price and an open and transparent \nmarket ends the potential for price discrimination, price manipulation, \nand undue preferences, the things mentioned in that 1921 act.\n  These are not the only benefits in my bill. It also preserves the \nvery useful risk management tool that contracts provide to livestock \nproducers. Contracts help producers plan and prepare for the future. My \nbill makes contracts and marketing agreements an even better risk \nmanagement tool because it solidifies the base price for the producer. \nHe is not guessing what he will sell it for; he has an exact price. \nOnce the agreement is made, a producer can have confidence on shipping \nday in his ability to feed his family during the next year because he \nwill know in advance how much he can expect to receive for his \nlivestock.\n  This bill also encourages electronic trading. An open and public \nmarket would function much like the stock market where insider trading \nis prohibited. The stock market provides a solid example of how \nelectronic livestock trading can work to the benefit of everyone \ninvolved. For example, price discovery in an open and electronic market \nis automatic. We tried a number of things to get price discovery so \nthat the producers out there would have an idea what the true market \nis, whether it is being bought from other producers or being bought out \nof the captive supply. Every attempt we have made has been thwarted. \nThey have found ways to put little loopholes in regulations so they do \nnot have to report prices. That is not fair. It does not provide an \nopen market.\n  Captive supply is still weighing on the minds and hurting the \npocketbooks of ranchers in Wyoming and across the United States. \nWyoming ranchers encourage me to keep up the good fight on this issue \non every trip I make to my home State. I wish I had time to share some \nof the heartrending stories of the way they have been taken to the \ncleaners on these unique contracts they are forced to sign if they want \nto be able to sell their product.\n  The economic soul of Wyoming is built on the foundation of small \ntowns and small businesses. All livestock producers, even small and \nmedium ones, should have a fair chance to compete in an honest game \nthat allows them to get the best price possible for their product. We \nmust do everything we can to keep our small producers in business and \nprotect the consumers. If there was a fluctuation out here on the other \nend where the consumer is, we might not have quite the same concern, \nbut the consumer is not getting the benefit of this fixed market. So we \nneed to change the fixed market.\n  We need to change captive supply. My bill removes one of the largest \nobstructions preventing livestock producers from competing, and that is \nformula price contracts. I ask my colleagues to assist me in giving \ntheir constituents and mine the chance to perform on a level playing \nfield. It will help the economy of the entire United States. I ask for \nyour help on this bill. We will be circulating some letters and further \nexplanations so that we can have cosponsors; and pass the bill \nunanimously, I hope. I know that is a little difficult to obtain around \nhere, but this is a very important issue and every State has livestock \nproducers. It is time we took care of the livestock producers in a way \nthat did not cost us a lot through enforcement.\n  I would love to see improved enforcement. I know there are other \npriority issues on enforcement, particularly since September 11, so I \nhave tried to bring a little speed bump to provide accurate pricing. I \nask for your help on the bill.\n  To reiterate:\n  Whenever there is a crisis the media has always served to focus the \nNation's attention on the problem and who has been affected by it. Then \nit has been up to us, in the Congress, to review the problem and \ndetermine whether or not there was anything we could do to ease the \nsuffering and repair the damage to someone's property and their \nlivelihood.\n  Most of the time, when the media spots a crisis it is of such a \nmagnitude that the pictures we see of the suffering are devastating and \npowerful. The images clearly cry out to us to take action and do what \nwe can to restore, as much as possible, the lives of these people to \nnormalcy.\n  We have all seen in these past few days the pictures of the \ndevastating tornadoes that have wreaked havoc wherever they have \ntouched down. Story after story has appeared in print and on television \nshowing property destroyed, places of business torn in pieces, jobs in \njeopardy and lives forever changed by the fury of a few moments of \nsevere weather. Tornadoes do not last a long time, but they leave a \npath of devastation in their wake that leaves those affected by it \nforever changed.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those who have been so \naffected and our hopes that they will be able to put their lives back \ntogether and go on as difficult as that will be to do.\n  As we view the devastation of those tornadoes, there are those in my \nState who have seen their livelihoods drastically affected by weather \nand unfair market policy, but they have not been so visible to us \nbecause we have not seen their faces on the nightly news or read their \nstories in the national newspapers. That is because not everyone who \nhas seen their livelihood so drastically affected can be portrayed with \nquite the same kind of powerful images that depict those who have been \ntouched by the ravages of severe weather patterns. Some problems that \ndestroy livelihoods and weaken industries are far more subtle and more \ndifficult to track.\n  Instead of being destroyed by a single blow, the industry I am \nreferring to is being slowly put to death by the cruelest of methods--\nthousands of small cuts brought on by the lethal combination of several \nyears of drought, ambiguous regulations that are too easily taken \nadvantage of and the lax enforcement of existing law which has allowed \nfor the manipulation of the system to one group's advantage.\n  Our Nation's ranching industry is in trouble, and, due to the slower \npace with which it has been affected, the only stark images we will see \nof the intensity of the problem are the ``for sale'' or ``up for \nauction'' signs that acknowledge the closing of a family owned ranch \nand the end of a family's dream that lasted for generations as the land \nand the business was handed down for many, many years.\n  Right now, as I speak, if you are a rancher in the West, you have two \nmajor problems affecting your ability to earn a living and provide for \nyour family. The first is the continuing drought which has made it so \ndifficult for ranchers to tend their cattle and provide them with good, \naffordable grazing.\n  The second is a regulatory nightmare that has held livestock \nproducers captive by the chains of unfair and manipulative contracts. \nIt is this regulatory nightmare that must be addressed, and which \nbrings me to the floor today as I offer legislation to break the chains \nand require livestock contracts to contain a fixed base price and be \ntraded in open, public markets.\n\n  So, what is this regulation that is destroying the health of our \nfamily ranchers? It's a practice called ``captive supply,'' a business \npractice not well known to those outside of the industry, but a \npractice that has had a tremendous impact on the ranchers of the West.\n  If you have not heard about the problem, I must point out that our \nranchers have tried to bring it to our attention, but we have not fully \nfocused on their needs. Whenever I travel to Wyoming, or hold a town \nmeeting, or go over the week's mail that I receive from my \nconstituents, I hear the cries for help from our ranchers in Wyoming, \nand throughout the West. One by one, and without exception, they are \nall clamoring for attention and relief so they can continue the work \nthat so many in their family have done for so many years.\n  I could bring a stack of letters that come from people all across my \nState\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\nabout the problems they face. But, in the interest of time, I will read \na small excerpt from one that will give you an idea of how bad things \nare in the ranching industry as our ranchers try to deal with captive \nsupply.\n  A letter I received from a rancher in Lingle said that the issue of \ncaptive supply needed to be reviewed and addressed because it was \n``slowly but surely putting small farmers/feeders out of business.'' He \nthen added:\n\n       Until the existing laws are enforced in this area of \n     illegal activities, all other plans or laws will be of very \n     little consequence.\n\n  So what is captive supply and how is it harming our Nation's ranchers \nto such an extent? Simply put, captive supply refers to the ownership \nby meat packers of cattle or the contracts they issue to purchase \nlivestock. It is done to ensure that packers will always have a \nconsistent supply of livestock for their slaughterlines.\n  The original goal of captive supply makes good business sense. All \nbusinesses want to maintain a steady supply of animals to ensure a \nconstant stream of production and control costs.\n  But captive supply allows packers to go beyond good organization and \nbusiness performance--to market manipulation--and this is where the \nproblem lies.\n  The packing industry is highly concentrated. Four companies control \nmore than half of all U.S. hog slaughter and more than 80 percent of \nU.S. fed cattle slaughter. Using captive supply and the market power of \nconcentration, packers can purposefully drive down the prices by \nrefusing to buy in the open market. This deflates all livestock prices \nand limits the market access of producers that have not aligned with \nspecific packers.\n  We made an attempt to address the problem of captive supply on the \nSenate floor, but the amendment to ban packer ownership of livestock \nmore than 14 days before slaughter did not survive the conference \ncommittee on the farm bill. However, the problems caused by captive \nsupplies are alive and well, just as Wyoming producers have testified \nto me in the phone calls, letters, faxes and emails I receive from \nthem. Although I supported the packer ban and still do, I do not think \nthat banning packer ownership of livestock will solve the entire \ncaptive supply problem. Packers are using numerous methods beyond \ndirect ownership to control cattle and other livestock.\n  Currently, packers maintain captive supply through various means \nincluding direct ownership, forward contracts, and marketing \nagreements. The difference between the three is subtle, so let me take \na moment to describe how they differ. Direct ownership refers to \nlivestock owned by the packer. In forward contracts, producers agree to \nthe delivery of cattle one week or more before slaughter with the price \ndetermined before slaughter. Forward contracts are typically fixed, \nmeaning the base price is set.\n  As with forward contracts, marketing agreements also call for the \ndelivery of livestock more than one week before slaughter, but the \nprice is determined at or after slaughter. A formula pricing method is \ncommonly used for cattle sold under marketing agreements. In formula \npricing, instead of a fixed base price, an external reference price, \nsuch as the average price paid for cattle at a certain packing plant \nduring one week, is used to determine the base price of the cattle. I \nfind this very disturbing because the packer has the ability to \nmanipulate the weekly average at a packing plant by refusing to buy in \nthe open market. Unfortunately, marketing agreements and formula \npricing are much more common than forward contracts.\n  In fact, the data published by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service \nindicates that in the first week of May 2003, 39,149 of the cattle \nslaughtered were sold through a forward contract. By comparison, \n207,955 of the cattle slaughtered were marketed through formula pricing \nmarketing agreements. Packers were using five times as many formula \npricing marketing agreements as forward contracts to purchase their \nslaughter cattle. As we can see, packers use more marketing agreements \nbecause of the advantages those ambiguous contracts give them over \nproducers.\n  In the same week, 36,899 of the cattle slaughtered were directly \nowned by packers. These numbers demonstrate that the problem of captive \nsupply is far more extensive than just packer ownership. In the first \nweek of May, packer owned cattle only comprised 13 percent of captive \ncattle slaughtered. This is why we must act to solve the entire captive \nsupply problem.\n  I realize it may be difficult to grasp the seriousness of the \nsituation if you are not familiar with the cattle market. Most of us \nhave not signed a contract to sell a load of livestock, but many of us \nhave sold a house. To illustrate the seriousness of the problem, let's \nexplore how you would sell a house using a formula-priced contract in a \nmarket structured like the current livestock market.\n  It is May, and you know you will be selling your home in September. \nAs a wise seller, you want to find a buyer for your home before that \ntime. It turns out that other people do not really buy homes from each \nother anymore. In fact, four main companies have taken over 80 percent \nof all real estate transactions. You really have no choice but to deal \nwith one of these companies.\n  One of them offers you a contract, stating you will receive $10,000 \nover the average price of what other, similar homes are selling for in \nyour area in September. To manage your risk and ensure a buyer, you \nhave just been practically forced to sign a contract that doesn't \nspecify how much you will receive for your house.\n  That tingle of fear in the pit of your stomach becomes full-fledged \npanic when you close the deal in September. You see, the four real \nestate companies have been planning ahead. They decide to pull away \nfrom the market. All the homes selling in September that are not \ncontracted to the companies flood the market and the price for homes in \nyour area drops $12,000. By trying to manage your risk, you sold your \nhome for $2,000 below average.\n  As a homeowner, you would be outraged, wouldn't you? You would want \nto know why anyone had the ability to legally take advantage of you. \nLivestock producers have the same questions when they lose to the \nmarket pressures applied by captive supply. Captive supply gives \npackers the ability to discriminate against some producers. And those \nproducers pay for it with their bottom line. At the same time, packers \nuse contracts and marketing agreements to give privileged access and \npremiums to other producers regardless of the quality of their product. \nThese uses of captive supply should be illegal. In fact, they are.\n  Section 202 of the Packers and Stockyards Act states in (3) (a) and \n(b):\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any packer with respect to \n     livestock . . . to:\n       (a) Engage in or use any unfair, unjustly discriminatory, \n     or deceptive practice or device; or\n       (b) Make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or \n     advantage to any particular person or locality in any \n     respect, or subject any particular person or locality to any \n     undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any \n     respect.\n\n  Packers who practice price discrimination toward some producers and \nprovide undue preferences to other producers are clearly in violation \nof the law. But this law is not being enforced. So what we are left \nwith are unenforced laws or no laws at all to protect the independent \nproducer. Since the Packers and Stockyards Act is not being enforced \nand the cost of enforcing the law on a case-by-case basis in the courts \nis expensive and time-consuming, today I propose that the Senate take \naction.\n  Most laws require enforcement. They are like speed limits on a \ncountry road. No one pays the sign any attention unless the driver is \nsharing the road with an agent of the law who will enforce it--like a \npolice car. This section of the Packers and Stockyards Act is like a \nsign on the road of commerce that no one is paying attention to because \nthe police are busy doing something else. The bill I am introducing \ntoday is not just another sign on the road. It is a speed bump. It does \nnot just warn cars to go slower, it makes it much more difficult for \nthem to speed.\n  My bill does two things to create the speed bump. It requires that \nlivestock producers have a fixed base price in their contracts. It also \nputs these contracts up for bid in the open market where they belong.\n  Under this bill, forward contracts and marketing agreements must \ncontain a fixed, base price on the day the contract is signed. This \nprevents packers from manipulating the base price\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\nafter the point of sale. You may hear allegations that this bill ends \nquality-driven production, but it does not prevent adjustments to the \nbase price after slaughter for quality, grade or other factors outside \npacker control. It prevents packers from changing the base price based \non factors that they do control. Contracts that are based on the \nfutures market are also exempted from the bill's requirements.\n  In an open market, buyers and sellers would have the opportunity to \nbid against each other for contracts and could witness bids that are \nmade and accepted. Whether they take the opportunity to bid or not is \ntheir choice, the key here is that they have access to do so.\n  My bill also limits the size of contracts to the rough equivalent of \na load of livestock, meaning 40 cattle or 30 swine. It does not limit \nthe number of contracts that can be offered by an individual. This key \nportion prevents small and medium-sized livestock producers, like those \nfound in Wyoming, from being shut out of deals that contain thousands \nof livestock per contract.\n  Requiring a firm base price and an open and transparent market ends \nthe potential for price discrimination, price manipulation and undue \npreferences. These are not the only benefits of my bill. It also \npreserves the very useful risk management tool that contracts provide \nto livestock producers. Contracts help producers plan and prepare for \nthe future. My bill makes contracts and marketing agreements an even \nbetter risk management tool because it solidifies the base price for \nthe producer. Once the agreement is made, a producer can have \nconfidence on shipping day in his ability to feed his family during the \nnext year because he will know in advance how much he can expect to \nreceive for his livestock.\n  This bill also encourages electronic trading. An open and public \nmarket would function much like the stock market, where insider trading \nis prohibited. The stock market provides a solid example of how \nelectronic livestock trading can work to the benefit of everyone \ninvolved. For example, price discovery in an open and electronic market \nis automatic.\n  Captive supply is still weighing on the minds and hurting the \npocketbooks of ranchers in Wyoming and across the United States. \nWyoming ranchers encourage me to keep up the good fight on this issue \non every trip I make to my home State. The economic soul of Wyoming is \nbuilt on the foundation of small towns and small businesses. All \nlivestock producers, even small and medium-sized ones, should have a \nfair chance to compete in an honest game that allows them to get the \nbest price possible for their product. We must do everything we can to \nkeep our small producers in business.\n  My bill removes one of the largest obstructions preventing livestock \nproducers from competing--formula-priced contracts. I ask my colleagues \nto assist me in giving their constituents and mine the chance to \nperform on a level playing field.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1045. A bill to strengthen United States capabilities to safely \nand securely dispose of all greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive \nwaste; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Low-Level \nRadioactive Waste Act of 2003. I am pleased that the Ranking Member of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Bingaman, is a \ncosponsor of this important legislation. Our bill will address the \nefforts made by the Department of Energy, DOE, to recover and dispose \nof thousands of domestic Greater-than-Class-C, GTCC, radiological \nsources. These have the highest radiation levels and, in general, pose \nthe greatest concern in terms of being used in a so-called ``dirty \nbomb.''\n  Since September 11, we have faced the possibility that a terrorist \ncould use a dirty bomb in an attack in the United States. A dirty bomb \ncombines conventional explosives with highly radioactive materials. \nWhen exploded, it would disperse the radioactive materials, reducing \nthe impact from radiation. But, if set off in the downtown of a major \ncity, it could still contaminate a wide area with radiation, cause \ndeath and destruction due to the explosion, and panic and substantial \neconomic damage could result. It is not surprising that the Department \nof Homeland Security has chosen as one of its training scenarios a \nsimulated ``dirty bomb'' attack on an American city.\n  Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham told an International Atomic \nEnergy Agency conference in March, ``Radioactive sources can be found \nall over the world, and terrorist are seeking to acquire them.'' CIA \nDirector George Tenet told Congress in February that he was concerned \nabout Al Qaeda's attempts to build a dirty bomb. He said, \n``construction of such a device is well within Al Qaeda capabilities--\nif it can obtain the radiological material.''\n  Radiological sources are used widely in industry, agriculture, \nmedicine, and research. Appropriately, Secretary Abraham has made it \npriority for the Department of Energy to help other countries secure \ntheir radiological sources. But as the United States works \ninternationally to secure dangerous radiological sources, we also must \nbe sure our own house is in order.\n  As chairman of the International Security Subcommittee of the Senate \nGovernment Affairs Committee, I held hearings in the fall of 2001 that \ncovered the threat posed by dirty bombs. I also requested that GAO \nexamine U.S. efforts to secure radioactive sources within the United \nStates.\n  GAO recently finished their inquiry, and I am sorry to report that \nGAO found our house is not in order. Many of you may have seen the \nreport on NBC Nightly News last night that featured GAO's \ninvestigation.\n  GAO's report shows that not only the former Soviet Union, but also \nthe United States does not keep track of or account for its radioactive \nsources in a reliable manner. There is not a precise count of GTCC \nsources in the United States. Some quarter to half a million are \nestimated to exist. Some 24,000 new GTCC sources are being produced \neach year.\n  A central issue is what is being done with unwanted radioactive \ndevices. We don't have an accurate account of unwanted devices in this \ncountry, and the program for recovering and securing them is proceeding \ntoo slowly.\n  In 1985, Congress authorized DOE to provide a facility for disposing \nof GTCC waste, including GTCC sealed radiological sources that were no \nlonger wanted by their owners. GAO found that after 18 years, DOE still \nhas not developed a facility for storing GTCC wastes.\n  DOE assumes a facility for receiving GTCC sealed sources will be \navailable by FY 2007. But DOE has not taken serious steps to insure \nthis facility will be built.\n  Instead, DOES has an interim program for collecting and holding \nunwanted radiological sources. In 1999, DOE created an Off-site Source \nRecovery Project, or OSR, in the Office of Environmental Management for \nthese purposes.\n  The OSR Project has recovered about 5,3000 sealed sources. Another \n4,400 sources, held by 328 different owners across the United States, \nare known to be in need of recovery. DOE estimates a further 4,600 \nsources will need to be recovered by 2010, when the OSR Project is \nscheduled to end because the permanent storage facility should be \noperating.\n  Thousands more sources, however, will need to be recovered outside \nthe OSR project once a depository opens.\n  Every State in the Union has radioactive sources that need to be \nrecovered, according to the GAO report. States with more than a 100 \nsources to be recovered include Arizona, California, Illinois, \nMaryland, New York, and Texas. Another 25 States have between 10 and \n100 sources to be recovered.\n  The GAO report notes that many of these are small sources with small \namounts of radiation but hundreds are larger sources with large amounts \nof radioactivity.\n  Alarmingly, the question of dirty bombs aside, there are almost two \nnuclear bombs worth of unwanted plutonium-239 sources that DOE cannot \nrecover because they lack storage space. GAO reports that universities \nthat have this material want to give it up, but cannot, because the DOE \ndoes not have the space to store them.\n  We are concerned that the program to recover, secure, and store GTCC \nradiological sources is not receiving the\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\npriority it deserves. The disposal of thousands of radiological sources \nmust be addressed. But DOE will not be prepared to dispose of these \nsources permanently in the next seven years because DOE has not \nidentified the type of facility or provided a cost estimate and time-\nline for its construction.\n  This bill will address these concerns. To insure the permanent \ndisposal program gets the attention it needs within DOE, our \nlegislation requires DOE to designate a responsibility entity within \nDOE to develop a facility for disposal of GTCC wastes.\n  It also requires the DOE to report to Congress on the current \nsituation and future plans for the disposal of GTCC radioactive waste. \nAfter the completion of this report, the DOE must submit to Congress a \nreport on the cost and schedule to complete an environment impact \nstatement and record of decision on a permanent disposal facility for \nGTCC radioactive wastes. Finally, before the year is out, DOE must \ndeliver to Congress a plan to provide for the short-term recovery of \nthe GTCC radioactive waste until a permanent facility is available.\n  I am also concerned that the short-term Offsite Source Recovery \nProject may lack the funding required to ensure that all designated \nradiological sources are safety and securely recovered in a timely \nmanner. The program apparently will be funded adequately through the \nend of FY04. The FY02 emergency supplemental budget provided ten \nmillions dollars, and the President requested about two millions \ndollars in his FY04 budget proposal. But I caution Congress to keep an \neye on this program to guarantee sufficient funds are requested in the \nFY05 budget when it is submitted to Congress next year.\n  Thousands of sealed sources await disposal, some requiring security \nmeasures greater than those in place at current storage sites. The \nproblem posed by these sources will not go away by itself. Universities \nand industry do not have the means or facilities to secure these \nmaterials and are asking the federal government for help.\n  When the United States began non-proliferation efforts in the former \nSoviet Union, one of the first jobs was to begin consolidating nuclear \nweapons and fissile materials in secure facilities to await disposal or \ndestruction. As Secretary Abraham has said, due to worries about \nterrorists acquiring dirty bombs, the DOE now is working to secure \nradiological sources overseas.\n  I support these efforts. The bill Senator Bingaman and I have \nintroduced will give radiological sources and waste on American soil \nthe same consideration. Collecting and securing these sources was once \na matter of public safety. It is now a national security concern that \ndeserves the attention of Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1045\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Low-Level Radioactive Waste \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) section 3(b)(1)(D) of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste \n     Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 2021c(b)(1)(D)) requires the Secretary \n     of Energy to safely dispose of all greater-than-Class C low-\n     level radioactive waste (as defined in section 61.55 of title \n     10, Code of Federal Regulations);\n       (2) the Offsite Source Recovery Program, established by the \n     Department of Energy to recover and store sources of such \n     waste, is scheduled to cease operation by September 30, 2010;\n       (3) the Department of Energy estimates that about 14,000 \n     sealed sources of such waste will become unwanted and will \n     have to be disposed of through the Offsite Source Recovery \n     Program by that date;\n       (4)(A) in February 1987 the Secretary of Energy submitted \n     to Congress a comprehensive report making recommendations for \n     ensuring the safe disposal of all greater-than-Class C low-\n     level radioactive waste; and\n       (B) 16 years later, it is likely that the information \n     contained in the report is no longer current and does not \n     reflect the new security threat environment;\n       (5) the Department of Energy--\n       (A) does not have the resources or storage facility to \n     recover and store all unwanted sources of greater-than-Class \n     C low-level radioactive waste; and\n       (B) has not identified a permanent disposal facility;\n       (6) it is unlikely that a permanent disposal facility will \n     be operational by the time that the Offsite Source Recovery \n     Program ceases operation;\n       (7) the initial steps in developing a disposal facility \n     (including preparation of an environmental impact statement \n     and issuance of a record of decision) could take several \n     years and will require dedicated funding to complete; and\n       (8) before a final decision on the disposal alternative to \n     be implemented is made, Congress must have an opportunity to \n     review the alternatives under consideration and provide \n     input.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n       (a) Designation of Responsibility.--The Secretary of Energy \n     shall designate an entity within the Department of Energy to \n     have the responsibility of completing activities needed to \n     develop a facility for safely disposing of all greater-than-\n     Class C low-level radioactive waste.\n       (b) Consultation With Congress.--In developing a plan for a \n     permanent disposal facility for greater-than-Class C low-\n     level radioactive waste (including preparation of an \n     environmental impact statement and issuance of a record of \n     decision), the Secretary of Energy shall consult with \n     Congress.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Update of 1987 Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit \n     to Congress an update of the report referred to in section \n     2(4).\n       (2) Contents.--The update shall contain--\n       (A) an identification of the radioactive waste that is to \n     be disposed of (including the source of the waste and the \n     volume, concentration, and other relevant characteristics of \n     the waste);\n       (B) an identification of the Federal and non-Federal \n     options for disposal of the waste;\n       (C) a description of the actions proposed to ensure the \n     safe disposal of the waste;\n       (D) an estimate of the costs of the proposed actions;\n       (E) an identification of the options for ensuring that the \n     beneficiaries of the activities resulting in the generation \n     of the radioactive waste bear all reasonable costs of \n     disposing of the waste;\n       (F) an identification of any statutory authority required \n     for disposal of the waste; and\n       (G) in coordination with the Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an \n     identification of any regulatory guidance needed for the \n     disposal of the waste.\n       (b) Report on Permanent Disposal Facility.--\n       (1) Report on cost and schedule for completion of eis and \n     rod.--Not later than 180 days after the date of submission of \n     the update under subsection (a), the Secretary of Energy \n     shall submit to Congress a report containing an estimate of \n     the cost and schedule to complete an environmental impact \n     statement and record of decision for a permanent disposal \n     facility for greater-than-Class C radioactive waste.\n       (2) Report on alternatives.--Before the Secretary of Energy \n     makes a final decision on the disposal alternative to be \n     implemented, the Secretary of Energy shall--\n       (A) submit to Congress a report that describes all \n     alternatives under consideration; and\n       (B) await action by Congress.\n       (c) Report on Short-Term Plan.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2003, the \n     Secretary of Energy shall submit to Congress a plan to ensure \n     the continued recovery and storage of greater-than-Class C \n     low-level radioactive waste until a permanent disposal \n     facility is available.\n       (2) Contents.--The plan shall contain estimated cost, \n     resource, and facility needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Burns, Mr. Lott, \n        Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1046. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to preserve \nlocalism, to foster and promote the diversity of television \nprogramming, to foster and promote competition, and to prevent \nexcessive concentration of ownership of the nation's television \nbroadcast stations; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1046\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Preservation of Localism, \n     Program Diversity, and Competition in Television Broadcast \n     Service Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\n       (1) The principle of localism is embedded in the \n     Communications Act in section 307(b) of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 307(b)). It has been the pole star for \n     regulation of the broadcast industry by the Federal \n     Communications Commission for nearly 70 years.\n       (2) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \n     directed the Federal Communications Commission to increase \n     the limitations on national multiple television ownership so \n     that one party could not own or control television stations \n     whose aggregate national audience reach exceeded 35 percent. \n     Congress did so because it recognized that--\n       (A) further national concentration could not be undone;\n       (B) other regulatory changes, such as the repeal by the \n     Commission of its financial and syndication regulations, \n     would heighten the power of the national television networks; \n     and\n       (C) the independence of non-network-owned stations would be \n     threatened if network ownership exceeded 35 percent.\n       (3) If a limit to the national audience reach of television \n     stations that one party may own or control is not codified at \n     this time--\n       (A) further national concentration may occur whose \n     pernicious effects may be difficult to eradicate; and\n       (B) the independence of non-network-owned stations will be \n     threatened, placing local stations in danger of becoming mere \n     passive conduits for network transmissions.\n       (4) A cap on national multiple television ownership will \n     help preserve localism by limiting the networks ability to \n     dictate programming aired on local stations.\n       (5) The landscape of national ownership has changed \n     dramatically over the past two decades since the time when \n     the networks were limited to owning just seven television \n     stations nationwide:\n       (A) the Commissions financial and syndication regulations \n     have been repealed;\n       (B) the networks can own more than one television station \n     in many local markets;\n       (C) the networks have embraced programming ventures from \n     studios to syndication to foreign sales; and\n       (D) the networks own the most popular cable and Internet \n     content businesses.\n\n     Together these changes have strengthened the networks hands \n     and given them strong incentives to override local interests.\n       (6) Unlike non-network-owned stations which are only \n     concerned with local viewers, network-owned stations have \n     multiple interests they must consider: national advertising \n     interests, syndicated programming interests, foreign sales \n     interests, cable programming interests, and, lastly, local \n     station interests.\n       (7) The possibility of further nationalization threatens \n     the current give-and-take between non-network-owned \n     affiliates and networks which can result in programming being \n     edited, scheduled, or promoted in ways that are more \n     appropriate for local audiences.\n       (8) As network power has grown in recent years, the \n     networks have forced affiliation agreements to tilt the \n     balance of power even more in their favor. Contract \n     provisions encroach on the ability of non-network-owned \n     affiliates to reject programming that local stations \n     determine not to be in the best interests of their local \n     communities, and local stations are penalized for \n     unauthorized preemptions (as determined by the network) and \n     for exceeding preemption baskets.\n       (9) This Act will help to preserve localism in and to \n     prevent the further nationalization of the television \n     broadcast service.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote the values of localism in the television \n     broadcast service;\n       (2) to promote diversity of television programming and \n     viewpoints;\n       (3) to promote competition; and\n       (4) to prevent excessive concentration of ownership by \n     establishing a limit to the national audience reach of the \n     television stations that any one party may own or control.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL TELEVISION MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) Establishment of National Television Multiple Ownership \n     Limitations.--Part I of Title III of the Communications Act \n     of 1934 is amended by inserting after section 339 (47 U.S.C. \n     339) the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 340. NATIONAL TELEVISION MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP \n                   LIMITATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) National Audience Reach Limitation.--The Commission \n     shall not permit any license for a commercial television \n     broadcast station to be granted, transferred, or assigned to \n     any party (including all parties under common control) if the \n     grant, transfer, or assignment of such license would result \n     in such party or any of its stockholders, partners, or \n     members, officers, or directors, directly or indirectly, \n     owning, operating or controlling, or having a cognizable \n     interest in television stations which have an aggregate \n     national audience reach exceeding 35 percent.\n       ``(b) No Grandfathering.--The Commission shall require any \n     party (including all parties under common control) that holds \n     licenses for commercial television broadcast stations in \n     excess of the limitation contained in subsection (a) to \n     divest itself of such licenses as may be necessary to come \n     into compliance with such limitation within one year after \n     the date of enactment of this section.\n       ``(c) Section Not Subject to Forbearance.--Section 10 of \n     this Act shall not apply to the requirements of this section.\n       ``(d) Definitions.--\n       ``(1) National audience reach.--The term `national audience \n     reach' means--\n       ``(A) the total number of television households in the \n     Nielsen Designated Market Area (DMA) markets in which the \n     relevant stations are located, or as determined under a \n     successor measure adopted by the Commission to delineate \n     television markets for purposes of this section; divided by\n       ``(B) the total national television households as measured \n     by such DMA data (or such successor measure) at the time of a \n     grant, transfer, or assignment of a license.\n\n     No market shall be counted more than once in making this \n     calculation.\n       ``(2) Cognizable interest.--Except as may otherwise be \n     provided by regulation by the Commission, the term \n     `cognizable interest' means any partnership or direct \n     ownership interest and any voting stock interest amounting to \n     5 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of a \n     licensee.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 202(c)(1) of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1934 (P.L. 104-104; 110 Stat. 111) \n     is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``its regulations'' and all that follows \n     through ``by eliminating'' and inserting ``its regulations \n     (47 CFR 73.3555) by eliminating'';\n       (2) by striking ``; and'' at the end of subparagraph (A) \n     and inserting a period; and\n       (3) by striking subparagraph (B).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER\n  S. 1050.

INTEGRATION OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, \n                   AND RECONNAISSANCE CAPABILITIES\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As part of transformation efforts within the Department \n     of Defense, each of the Armed Forces is developing \n     intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities \n     that best support future war fighting as envisioned by the \n     leadership of the military department concerned.\n       (2) Concurrently, intelligence agencies of the Department \n     of Defense outside the military departments are developing \n     transformation roadmaps to best support the future \n     decisionmaking and war fighting needs of their principal \n     customers, but are not always closely coordinating those \n     efforts with the intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance development efforts of the military \n     departments.\n       (3) A senior official of each military department has been \n     designated as the integrator of intelligence, surveillance, \n     and reconnaissance for each of the Armed Forces in such \n     military department, but there is not currently a well-\n     defined forum where the integrators of intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities for each of the \n     Armed Forces can routinely interact with each other and with \n     senior representatives of Department of Defense intelligence \n     agencies, as well as with other members of the intelligence \n     community, to ensure unity of effort and to preclude \n     unnecessary duplication of effort.\n       (4) The current funding structure of a National Foreign \n     Intelligence Program (NFIP), Joint Military Intelligence \n     Program (JMIP), and Tactical Intelligence and Related \n     Activities Program (TIARA) might not be the best approach for \n     supporting the development of an intelligence, surveillance, \n     and reconnaissance structure that is integrated to meet the \n     national security requirements of the United States in the \n     21st century.\n       (5) The position of Under Secretary of Defense for \n     Intelligence was established in 2002 by Public Law 107-314 in \n     order to facilitate resolution of the challenges to achieving \n     an integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance \n     structure in the Department of Defense to meet such 21st \n     century requirements.\n       (b) Goal.--It shall be a goal of the Department of Defense \n     to fully coordinate and integrate the intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and \n     developmental activities of the military departments, \n     intelligence agencies of the Department of Defense, and \n     relevant combatant commands as those departments, agencies, \n     and commands transform their intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance systems to meet current and future needs.\n       (c) Requirement.--(1) The Under Secretary of Defense for \n     Intelligence shall establish an Intelligence, Surveillance, \n     and Reconnaissance Integration Council to provide a permanent \n     forum for the discussion and arbitration of issues relating \n     to the integration of intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance capabilities.\n       (2) The Council shall be composed of the senior \n     intelligence officers of the Armed Forces and the United \n     States Special Operations Command, the Director of Operations \n     of the Joint Staff, and the directors of the intelligence \n     agencies of the Department of Defense.\n       (3) The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence shall \n     invite the participation of the Director of Central \n     Intelligence or his representative in the proceedings of the \n     Council.\n       (d) ISR Integration Roadmap.--The Under Secretary of \n     Defense for Intelligence, in consultation with the \n     Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Integration \n     Council and the Director of Central Intelligence, shall \n     develop a comprehensive Defense Intelligence, Surveillance, \n     and Reconnaissance Integration Roadmap to guide the \n     development and integration of the Department of Defense \n     intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities \n     for 15 years.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than September 30, 2004, the \n     Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence shall submit to \n     the committees of Congress specified in paragraph (2) a \n     report on the Defense Intelligence, Surveillance, and \n     Reconnaissance Integration Roadmap developed under subsection \n     (d). The report shall include the following matters:\n       (A) The fundamental goals established in the roadmap.\n       (B) An overview of the intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance integration activities of the military \n     departments and the intelligence agencies of the Department \n     of Defense.\n       (C) An investment strategy for achieving--\n       (i) an integration of Department of Defense intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities that ensures \n     sustainment of needed tactical and operational efforts; and\n       (ii) efficient investment in new intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities.\n       (D) A discussion of how intelligence gathered and analyzed \n     by the Department of Defense can enhance the role of the \n     Department of Defense in fulfilling its homeland security \n     responsibilities.\n       (E) A discussion of how counterintelligence activities of \n     the Armed Forces and the Department of Defense intelligence \n     agencies can be better integrated.\n       (F) Recommendations on how annual funding authorizations \n     and appropriations can be optimally structured to best \n     support the development of a fully integrated Department of \n     Defense intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance \n     architecture.\n       (2) The committees of Congress referred to in paragraph (1) \n     are as follows:\n       (A) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Appropriations, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate.\n       (B) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Appropriations, and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 925.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to carry out \na demonstration program to assess potential water savings through \ncontrol of Salt Cedar and Russian Olive; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that is of paramount importance to the State of New Mexico \nand many other Western States. This bill will address the mounting \npressures brought on by the growing demands throughout the West of a \ndiminishing water supply.\n  A water crisis has ravaged the West for 4 years. Drought conditions \nare expected to expand into the upper Midwest this year. Last year snow \npacks were abnormally low, causing severe drought conditions. Snow pack \nconditions this year are still low, but marginally better in the \nSouthwest. The rest of the West does not look any more promising.\n  I know that the seriousness of the water situation in New Mexico \nbecomes more acute every single day. This drought has affected every \nNew Mexican and nearly everyone in the West in some way. Wells are \nrunning dry, farmers are being forced to sell livestock, many of our \ncities are in various stages of conservation and many, many acres have \nbeen charred by catastrophic wildfires.\n  The drought conditions also have other consequences. For example, the \nlack of stream flow makes it very difficult for New Mexico to meet its \ncompact delivery obligations to the State of Texas.\n  The bill that I am introducing today deals more specifically with the \nissue of in-stream water flows. To compound the drought situation, New \nMexico is home to a vast amount of salt cedar. Salt cedar is a water-\nthirsty non-native tree that continually strips massive amounts of \nwater out of New Mexico's two predominant water supplies--the Pecos and \nthe Rio Grande rivers.\n  Estimates show that one mature salt cedar tree can consume as much as \n200 gallons of water per day; over the growing season that's 7 acre \nfeet of water for each acre of salt cedar. In addition to the excessive \nwater consumption, salt cedars increase fire, increase river \nchannelization and flood frequency, decrease water flow and increase \nwater and soil salinity along the river. Studies indicate that \neradication of the salt cedars could increase river flows. Increasing \nriver flows could help alleviate mounting pressure to meet compact \ndelivery obligations--both on the Pecos and the Rio Grande.\n  The drought and the mounting legal requirements on both the Pecos and \nRio Grande rivers are forcing us toward a severe water crisis. Every \nriver in the intermountain West seems to be facing these same problems. \nSolving such water problems has become one of my top priorities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize for interrupting the Senator. I applaud and \ncommend the author of this legislation, with whom I joined, in \npresenting this legislation.\n  For the State of Nevada, with the limited agriculture we have, and \nthe very few rivers we have, the tamarisk is removing our agricultural \npossibilities, our recreational possibilities. If we can figure out a \nway to get rid of this salt cedar that has been ruining Nevada's rivers \nfor decades now, it will do as much to help the State of Nevada and the \nenvironment as any one thing we can do. This will actually improve the \nenvironment of the State of Nevada.\n  I want the record to reflect how much I, on behalf of the State of \nNevada, applaud the Senator from New Mexico for offering this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This map which we just showed indicates that your \nproblem is not just yours, my problem is not just mine. All the States \nthat are green on the chart have tamarisk or one of these foreign \nplants such as salt cedar, that have infested the area, sucking up \ntheir water for no good use.\n  Estimates show that a mature salt cedar tree can consume as much as \n200 gallons of water a day over the growing season or 7 acre feet of \nwater for each acre of salt cedar.\n  In addition to the excessive water consumption, the salt cedar \nincreases fire, increases river channelization, flood frequency, \ndecreases water flow, increases water and soil salinity over the \nvarious river basins.\n  Mr. REID. If I could just say one more thing to my friend from New \nMexico, in addition to that, they are not good for shade.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They are good for nothing.\n  Mr. REID. They are not good for birds to nest in. They are just an \nugly blight on Nevada's environment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for joining me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\n                                S. 1051\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1.

A bill to ensure that recipients of unsolicited bulk \ncommercial electronic mail can identify the sender of such electronic \nmail, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, unwanted e-mail has become a \nproblem of such gargantuan proportions that today's consumers find it \ndifficult to engage in the normal commerce of e-mail because their e-\nmail screen is so cluttered with so many unwanted messages.\n  Commercially, clearly there is a desirable reason to have commercial \nmessages, but a consumer ought to be able to opt out if that consumer \ndoes not want to continue to get those commercial messages. A consumer, \nparticularly, should not have to endure the affront of messages that \nare clearly inappropriate, including pornographic messages.\n  It is unbelievable. Yesterday, I was in my Tampa office, and in just \none day, in the Tampa office, a U.S. Senate office, we had an e-mail \nsheet filled with unwanted messages, including pornographic messages. \nYou can imagine if it is happening to a U.S. Senator's e-mail account \nwhat is happening across the land.\n  So today I am introducing legislation that will give the consumer the \nopportunity to opt out, that will create penalties, both in jail time \nand fines, for deceptive and untruthful messages, as well as messages \nthat do not have a return address where somebody is masking their \nidentity.\n  And, Mr. President, we are going to put some teeth in this \nlegislation because we are going to make the infraction of this \nparticular onerous activity of unwanted e-mail an element of the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the RICO Act, which \nwill give prosecutors the tools to go after the criminal enterprise and \ntake the assets of that criminal enterprise that has become such a \nplague upon the consumers of this Nation who want and desire and, in \nfact, use a new kind of communication, e-mail.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1052\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ban on Deceptive Unsolicited \n     Bulk Electronic Mail Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECEPTIVE UNSOLICITED ELECTRONIC MAIL.\n\n       (a) Violations.--It shall be unlawful for any person to \n     knowingly and intentionally use a computer or computer \n     network to--\n       (1) falsify or forge electronic mail transmission \n     information or other source, destination, routing, or subject \n     heading information in any manner in connection with the \n     transmission of unsolicited bulk commercial electronic mail \n     through, or into, the computer network of an electronic mail \n     service provider or its subscribers;\n       (2) transmit an electronic mail message to a recipient who \n     requests not to receive unsolicited bulk commercial \n     electronic mail; or\n       (3) collect electronic mail addresses from public and \n     private spaces for the purpose of transmitting unsolicited \n     bulk commercial electronic mail.\n       (b) Penalty.--Any violation of subsection (a) shall be--\n       (1) considered a predicate offense for the purposes of \n     applying the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization \n     Act (RICO) (18 U.S.C. 1961 et seq.);\n       (2) constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in \n     violation of section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 45(a)); and\n       (3) punishable by--\n       (A) a civil penalty; and\n       (B) a fine in accordance with title 18, United States Code, \n     or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both.\n       (c) Opportunity to Option Out of Receiving Unsolicited \n     Mail.--Any person sending unsolicited bulk commercial \n     electronic mail shall provide recipients of such electronic \n     mail a clear and conspicuous opportunity to request not to \n     receive future unsolicited electronic mail.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Electronic mail message.--The term ``electronic mail \n     message'' means a message sent to an electronic mail address.\n       (2) Electronic mail address.--The term ``electronic mail \n     address'' means a destination, commonly expressed as a string \n     of characters, consisting of a unique user name or mailbox \n     (commonly referred to as the ``local part'') and a reference \n     to an Internet domain (commonly referred to as the ``domain \n     part'') to which an electronic mail message can be sent or \n     delivered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/13/senate-section/article/S6142-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 142--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF RUSSELL B.

LONG, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF \n                               LOUISIANA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 142, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 142) relative to the death of Russell \n     B. Long, former United States Senator for the State of \n     Louisiana.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to former U.S. \nSenator Russell Long, who is being laid to rest today in his home State \nof Louisiana.\n  The U.S. Senate has a long history that is highlighted by public \nservice careers of a few highly talented legislative geniuses. I \nconsider Russell Long to be one of those Senators. I had the privilege \nof serving with Senator Long during my first terms in this Chamber. He \nwas undoubtedly as formidable a Senator as any who have served here.\n  For those freshmen Senators who paid attention, Russell Long provided \nus with example after example of how to serve as an effective public \nservant. His place in history is secure because he was so dynamic and \nproductive.\n  As a freshman Senator, I quickly learned to consider him one of the \nkindest and most considerate Senators. We were not of the same party or \nideology on many issues. But on more than one occasion, he went out of \nhis way to help me when I truly needed his help on the floor. He will \nnever be forgotten, not only for his leadership skills as a Senator, \nbut also for his kindness and generosity.\n  I extend my condolences to his wife Carolyn and the rest of the \nRussell Long family. He was a wonderful man.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table and that any statements relating to this matter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 142) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 142\n\n       Whereas Russell B. Long served in the United States Navy \n     from 1942 to 1945;\n       Whereas Russell B. Long succeeded both his parents as \n     members of the United States Senate;\n       Whereas Russell B. Long served the people of Louisiana with \n     distinction for 38 years in the United States Senate;\n       Whereas Russell B. Long served as Chairman of the Committee \n     on Finance of the United States Senate from 1965 to 1981; and\n       Whereas Russell B. Long was a tireless and effective \n     champion for the poor, the disabled, and the elderly: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow \n     and deep regret the announcement of the death of the \n     Honorable Russell B. Long, former member of the United States \n     Senate.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate \n     these resolutions to the House of Representatives and \n     transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the \n     deceased.\n       Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it stand \n     adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of the \n     Honorable Russell B.

Amendments are expected \nthroughout the day and, therefore, rollcall votes will occur during \nWednesday's session.\n  At this time, I remind my colleagues that reconciliation procedures \nlimit debate time on both the underlying measure and all amendments. I \nencourage all Senators who wish to participate in the economic growth \ndebate to contact the Finance Committee so that we may ensure an \norderly, disciplined, and efficient process.\n  We will complete action--we will complete action--on the jobs and \neconomic growth bill this week. Following the jobs bill, the Senate \nwill consider the bipartisan global HIV/AIDS bill. In order for the \nSenate to complete action on these measures, late nights and rollcall \nvotes will occur throughout the week.
