Mr. President, this morning we will be in a period of \nmorning business to allow Senators to make statements. Yesterday, along \nwith Members from both sides of the aisle, we had the honor to lead a \nSenate delegation to Houston for the memorial service for the Columbia \nastronauts. It was a touching and fitting tribute to those proud \npioneers, to those proud heroes, and today we continue to grieve along \nwith their families and their friends--many of them we had the \nopportunity, as a delegation, to visit with yesterday.\n  Later today, the Senate will adopt a resolution that will express the \nSenate's gratitude and appreciation for these heroes. A rollcall vote \nis expected on that resolution at approximately 12:15 or 12:30 today.\n  Today, by previous consent, the Senate will begin debate on the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada to be a circuit judge for the DC court. \nDebate will begin at 2:15. I know a number of Senators are prepared to \ncome to the floor to debate and discuss this nomination. I hope that we \ncan, after a full debate, reach an agreement as to when the Senate can \nvote on that particular nomination. I will be working with the \nDemocratic leader in an effort to find a time for that vote to occur.\n  As a reminder, the Senate will be in recess from 12:30 to 2:15 today \nfor the weekly party caucuses to meet.\n  Finally, this week, the Senate will need to act on another continuing \nresolution. I anticipate that we will receive a continuing resolution \ntonight or tomorrow morning from the House. I am unaware of any \nrequests for a rollcall vote, and we may be able to clear that \ncontinuing resolution by consent when it arrives.\n\n  I thank all Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a couple of questions for the \nmajority leader. Does the leader expect a vote on the resolution that \nis before the Senate today?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I believe at this point we plan a rollcall \nvote between 12:15 and 12:30.\n  Mr. REID. The other question I have for Members is this. I spoke to \nthe leader earlier this morning. There are a number of people who did \nnot go to the memorial service yesterday and are going to go to one at \nthe National Cathedral tomorrow. Does the leader expect any votes in \nthe morning?\n  Mr. FRIST. No. In response to the question, we will be in session \ntomorrow. There are a number of memorial services that have been \nconducted over the last 3 days and will continue through the week. Out \nof respect, we did close down yesterday so that a number of people \ncould go to Houston.\n  Tomorrow the Senate will be in session. We expect no rollcall votes, \nbut we will be in session. We can talk about what time to come in \ntomorrow morning, but I think we will be in until about 12 noon \ntomorrow, and we will not be in for the remainder of Thursday or \nFriday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have one additional question. We are in \nmorning business now until 12:30, or whenever the leader calls for the \nvote. I am wondering--because yesterday it got a little awkward--if we \ncan have an agreement that the time would alternate--one Republican, \none Democrat, back and forth. That way people have an idea of what to \ndo when they come here. If there are two Republicans here\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\nand no Democrats, OK. I don't think we need to do that in the form of \nan agreement, but at least the Chair would recognize we are going to do \nthat.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I think that would be very much something \nwe will agree to and appreciate. We have a lot to do in morning \nbusiness over the course of today and tomorrow. To be able to use that \ntime efficiently, alternating back and forth is certainly fine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1914-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today I rise to honor the memory and the sacrifice of \nthe seven astronauts whose lives were tragically cut short in pursuit \nof the newest frontier--space.\n  America is a word, a country, and a people. America is also a spirit, \nan indomitable spirit of adventure and courage, one that defies \ncomplacency and accepts challenge. The American spirit knows no bounds.\n  Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon also had that spirit, and so did Kalpana \nChawla, who was born in India and made America her home. It is that \nspirit which President Kennedy harnessed in 1961 when he made the bold \nclaim: Within a decade, America would put a man on the Moon and return \nhim safely home.\n  That same spirit enabled us to fulfill a great mission and make space \ntravel seem routine, although it was never routine.\n  It is that spirit which fueled the hearts and minds of those seven \nmen and women who launched into the sky on January 6, 2003.\n  On Saturday, we were reminded of the high price we sometimes pay for \nreaching new horizons. Our thirst for knowledge led us to explore \nspace. Our curiosity, sense of wonderment, and desire to improve life \non Earth prompted us time and again to defy the odds. Those heroes did \nnot take their task lightly, but they undertook it with joy.\n  Ilan Roman, the first Israeli astronaut, who was on that fated \nflight, wrote the following words from space:\n\n       The world looks marvelous from up here, so peaceful, so \n     wonderful and so fragile.\n\n  His serene vision came to a catastrophic end on Saturday morning, and \nthat moment when the world awoke to the news that seven astronauts \ndisappeared into the skies will be one etched in our collective \nmemories forever.\n  In recent years, America has borne too much tragedy and experienced \ntoo much grief, but our collective loss still sears our souls and the \npain is never easier to bear. Today, just 4 short days after they \nvanished into the crystal blue skies of Texas, we pause to remember \nthem and thank them from our hearts: Rick Husband, Kalpana Chawla, \nLaurel Clark, Ilan Roman, William McCool, David Brown, and Michael \nAnderson.\n  And though the families' loss cannot be diminished, their pain and \ngrief is shared around the world and our prayers are with them.\n  Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. Their lives were not lost in \nvain. We will send more brave astronauts into the cosmos to learn and \ndiscover. We will continue to explore the vast sky that envelops the \nEarth and their names will forever be etched into the history of space \nflight.\n  Rick Husband, a spiritual man, a Texan, the commander of the Space \nShuttle Columbia, often signed photos referencing Proverbs 3:5-6:\n\n       Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your \n     own understanding; acknowledge Him in all your ways and He \n     will direct your paths.\n\n  Throughout history, our young Nation has experienced great heartache \nand tragedy. Each time, we have overcome adversity with boldness and \ntenacity. We have come back stronger than ever.\n  With steely resolve and a firm determination, we rose from the ashes \nand embers of Ground Zero more resolute than ever before.\n  Christina Rossetti, the 18th century poet, wrote a poem called \n``Remember.'' She could never have envisioned what this poem would come \nto represent, but it did bring me some solace in this time of tragedy \nin my home State of Texas. She wrote:\n\n     Remember me when I am gone away,\n     Gone far away into the silent land;\n     When you can no more hold me by the hand,\n     Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.\n     Remember me when no more day by day\n     You tell me of our future that you planned;\n     Only remember me; you understand\n     It will be late to counsel then or pray.\n     Yet if you should forget me for a while\n     And afterwards remember, do not grieve:\n     For if the darkness and corruption leave\n     A vestige of the thoughts that I once had,\n     Better by far you should forget and smile\n     Than that you should remember and be sad.\n\n  We will hold these seven souls in our hearts and eventually we will \nsmile\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\nagain. We will rise from the ashes in the fields of Texas, Louisiana, \nand Arkansas. The quest for space exploration will not end with this \ntragedy. It will live on, it will prosper, for it is our duty, our \ncalling, and our destiny.\n  Yesterday, like so many Members of the Senate and House, along with \nthe President of the United States and our First Lady, I attended a \nbeautiful ceremony where we saw firsthand the families and the \nrealization of their personal loss. We were uplifted by seeing the \ngreatness of what these astronauts had done and what they are doing for \nthe future of our country and our world. It is much bigger than just \nthose seven astronauts, which I think their families and they \nthemselves believed. They know this was a higher calling and that their \nsacrifices will lay the groundwork for a better space shuttle, a better \nspace station, America staying preeminent in the world in national \nsecurity and in medical research. I think they knew they were \ncontributing to the future of our country.\n  The ceremony yesterday really began our time of closure, our time to \npay the respects to those brave young men and women who were willing to \nmake this sacrifice for their children and their future generations, \nand to say that America is going to renew our commitment. America is \ngoing to stay in the forefront, because we know if a country is static \nit will begin to fall behind. We know we have been the first to reap so \nmany benefits from space exploration, which we have shared with the \nworld. We know there are many more innovations to come and that America \nwill be there to find those discoveries.\n  On behalf of myself and Senator Nelson of Florida, who is the only \nMember of the Senate today who has been in space, he will come later to \nalso make a statement and then we will look forward to having a vote on \nthe resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues and millions \naround the world to express our enormous sorrow at the loss of the crew \nof the Space Shuttle Columbia and to extend sympathy to the crews' \nfamilies and friends.\n  This tragedy, like the loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger 17 years \nago, has left an empty space in our hearts. We struggle for the words \nthat might help to make sense of the events we witnessed last Saturday.\n  A return to Earth that we have come to view as ``routine,'' instead \nhas reminded us of the fragility of life. We are all subject to the \nflaws of man and the vagaries of nature. Yet these seven brave men and \nwomen accepted great risk as they strove to expand the intellectual \ncapital of all mankind.\n  For thousands of years, the heavens have inspired, intrigued, and \ncalled us to explore their boundaries. This unending quest for \nknowledge is the very essence of what makes us human. It is a flame \nthat burns so bright. It burns so bright that not even the depth of \nthis tragedy or the shock of our loss can quench the desire to learn, \nto seek and to explore.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that we will move forward to expand and \nstrengthen America's space program. And through the investigation that \nhas just begun, we will find out what caused this accident and then we \nwill fix it. But today, we mourn for those whom we have lost and offer \ncomfort to those who have been left behind.\n  The astronauts who fly the space shuttle are a unique and \nunparalleled breed of men and women. They inspire us with courage and \nintellect, and they sacrifice in service to their country and \nprofession. But perhaps their greatest service of all is rendered when \nthey reach out to future generations and plant the seeds of curiosity \nin a young student's mind.\n  I have visited classrooms in the company of astronauts to see faces \nof children alive with wonder and awe. Like any one of us, our children \nwant to know what it is like in space, what it is like to be a \nscientist, what it is like to be an explorer.\n  Seventeen years ago when the Challenger was lost, among the seven \nastronauts was a teacher from New Hampshire, Christa McAuliffe, who was \ndedicated to nurturing and inspiring students not just in New Hampshire \nbut all across the country. Her spirit and enthusiasm has been captured \nfor future generations in the Christa McAuliffe Planetarium in Concord, \nNH.\n  Each time I visit the planetarium, I am reminded that a child's \ncuriosity grows into a lifetime search for answers to the great \nquestions of our age. As long as we have astronauts to engage this \ncuriosity, the quest for knowledge will endure and our space program \nwill thrive.\n  Generations of Americans have been inspired by their courage and \nvision, but today, thoughts and prayers of millions are with the \nfamilies and friends of Columbia's crew. The sadness of this moment may \nwell one day fade, but the memory of these seven heroic figures will \nremain forever strong.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent during the \nallotted morning business period, the time used in quorum calls be \ncharged evenly against each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning's morning business has been \ndedicated to the Columbia tragedy which occurred over the weekend. I \nwant to take a few moments to speak from the heart about my experience \nyesterday, traveling to Houston to be there for the service that \nhonored these seven brave men and women who gave their lives in the \nColumbia tragedy.\n  It was a bright and sunny day in Houston, a day which brought out \nliterally thousands of people as they stood at the Space Center on the \ngrass and waited for hours for the moments of tribute to the fallen \nastronauts and to their families. It was a military service, as those \nwho followed it on television know, in the tradition primarily of the \nNavy. There was that touching moment where the bell was struck seven \ntimes for the loss of seven lives.\n  It also was a service which brought out, I thought, the very best in \nour Nation in terms of coming together in the grief that has really \nclouded our lives since last Saturday morning.\n  There were moments yesterday which I will not forget. The most \ncompelling moments involved the arrival of families. You come to \nrealize that these astronauts leave behind husbands and wives, \nchildren, parents, and many who loved them who will struggle for a long \ntime to understand what happened. Most of them, six of the seven, were \nin the military--of the United States and of Israel. They understood \nthe risk that was involved in their service to our country, as did the \nseventh astronaut. But with the success of so many space missions, I am \ncertain they went into this flight believing the odds were on their \nside--and they certainly were. But they knew the danger, too, that was \nassociated with it.\n  I am sure most people can recall where they were when they heard of \nthis tragedy. I was sitting with my wife in our kitchen in Springfield, \nIL, listening to NPR when they interrupted it and mentioned the shuttle \nradio transmission had been lost. It was clear something terrible may \nhave occurred. Then, of course, in the moments following, we heard the \ndetails.\n  I ran into a number of people in Illinois, both downstate in \nSpringfield and in Chicago, before I came back to Washington and then \nwent off to Houston, and all of them were touched by this tragedy, as \nthey should have been. Some of them said to me: Senator, don't forget \nalso the four soldiers who lost their lives last week in a helicopter \ncrash in Afghanistan--and they\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\nwere right. Our prayers should be not just for the astronauts and their \nfamilies but for all the men and women who have given their lives in \nservice to this country. I know they are in our hearts and prayers.\n  A lot of hard questions will have to be asked and answered in the \nweeks ahead. We will have to find out what caused this crash, to make \ncertain that it never happens again. There will be a lot of \nrecriminations and people pointing fingers as to whether or not \neveryone did their job as they should have, including Congress, this \nPresident, and the previous President. But that is the nature of an \nopen society--an open debate, an honest debate to try to come to some \nclosure as to the reason for this tragedy.\n  Larger questions will be asked, and I hope answered, about the space \nprogram itself. This is a program which has been generally accepted by \nAmerica as part of who we are and why we come together as a nation. We \nwant to lead the world in the pursuit of science and knowledge and \nunderstanding. Our space program has been part of that. We will have to \nstep back now and assess whether we are doing the right thing. We will \nhave to ask and answer questions about manned space flight and the \nfuture of the space station, whether the shuttle is the best approach \nto serving that station, and our future needs. All of these are \ndifficult but timely questions.\n  Having said all that, that is the working of government. That is the \nworking of the people of the United States, responding to this disaster \nin a rational, measured, linear way.\n  But yesterday it was about much more. It was about these astronauts \nand their families.\n  Ilan Ramon was the first Israeli astronaut. I read about him. I have \nheard suggestions that he was a man who was destined to be part of the \nspace program. No one in his country had ever done it. He is a great \nsource of pride in Israel and to the people who followed his career.\n  Yesterday, some of the prayers delivered by the Rabbi and others were \nin Hebrew, as they should have been. They hearkened back to the origins \nof the Judeo-Christian culture that also contributed to this great man.\n  Also, Kalpana Chawla, Indian--the important thing to recall is not \njust how good she was--and that story was repeated over and over \nagain--but to recall that she was an immigrant to this country.\n  I think that is something we should remind ourselves over and over. \nImmigrants to America throughout our history have made us a better and \nstronger Nation and have given us a special identity in the world. She \ncontributed to that heritage, and her courage has to be recognized.\n  The list of the astronauts involved--those who had been on previous \nmissions and those who were on their first--is a roster of excellence \nand courage. Now it is up to us not just to mourn their loss and to \ncomfort their families but to remember why they made their sacrifice \nand why they were prepared to run this risk. They were prepared to do \nmore than most of us do in our daily routines. But they understood it \nwas to meet a calling--a calling to which, frankly, all of us should \naspire, to show the courage and to step forward to look to the future, \nto say that we each have to do something that is risky and on the edge \nso that tomorrow may be better for our children, for their families. We \nextend not only our sympathy but also our pledge to stand by them at \nthis time of loss because they are part of the American family, an \nAmerican family deep in mourning over the loss of these great men and \nwomen.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in 1920, H.G. Wells wrote:\n\n       Life, forever dying to be born afresh, forever young and \n     eager, will presently stand upon this earth as upon a \n     footstool, and stretch out its realm amidst the stars.\n\n  We have long since realized that vision, voyaging from our planet, \nputting men and women and machines beyond the reach of the Earth, \ntraveling the ``airless Saharas'' of space, exploring new worlds.\n  What we have been able to do requires the best minds of science, an \naudacity of imagination, and people explorers of uncommon bravery.\n  Today, we mourn seven of those brave explorers. These men and women \nstood upon our Earth as a footstool, stretched out our realm amidst the \nstars, set out on a voyage of discovery--and did not return.\n  I can only hope that our words, our prayers, and a world's shared \nsorrow will help bring peace to their families and loved ones.\n  This space shuttle Columbia--like all space shuttles--was named for a \nsailing ship. The Columbia was the first American vessel to \ncircumnavigate the globe.\n  The crew of this Columbia were pioneers of the first order as well.\n  There was Rick Husband, the Air Force Colonel and commander of the \nColumbia. He was dedicated to God, his family, and his crew. While in \nspace, he sent an e-mail saying: ``I'm so proud of my crew, I could \npop.''\n  There was William McCool, the man at the controls of Columbia. He was \nan Eagle Scout, second in his class at the Naval Academy. Friends \ndescribe him as someone who always did everything perfectly but never \ndeveloped the arrogance that comes with such success.\n  There was Michael Anderson, who, as a child, dreamed of piloting his \nbunk bed to the moon. Michael Anderson never got to the moon, but he \ngot a lot closer than most of us.\n  There was David Brown, a physician, gymnast, and one-time circus \nperformer. For all of his many skills, as his mother said: ``flying was \nhis life.''\n  There was Laurel Clark, the medical doctor and mission specialist who \noffered this advice for aspiring astronauts: ``Do what it is you love \nto do. You'll do a really good job at it because you love it.''\n  There was Ilan Ramon--the child and grandchild of Holocaust \nsurvivors--who rode into space carrying with him the hope of a war-\nweary country.\n  Sadly, most of us are getting to know most of them only now.\n  Back in Rapid City, SD, there are dozens of schoolchildren who got to \nknow--and be inspired by--Kalpana Chawla.\n  Three years ago, I asked then-NASA Administrator Dan Goldin if he \nwould be willing to keynote a technology exhibition in Rapid City.\n  At the last minute, NASA called to say that they would have to send a \nsubstitute. They said: ``But the good news is she's even better. She's \nan astronaut, and she's brilliant.''\n  Dr. Chawla enchanted everyone who listened to her that day.\n  She stayed for a long time after her talk to sign autographs and pose \nfor pictures with children.\n  A lot of those children in South Dakota are probably looking at those \npictures today--and looking at how she signed them, for above her name \nshe wrote: ``reach for the stars.''\n  I can only hope that the excitement Dr. Chawla inspired in those \nchildren will never be diminished by her loss.\n  Inspiring the awe of discovery in others, that is what all of the \nmembers of the crew of Columbia lived for, and it is what they gave \ntheir lives for.\n  Yesterday, many of us were in Houston to honor their memories.\n  In the days ahead, I hope we can create a living memorial by \ncontinuing to strive for the stars.\n  In 1961, a satellite called Traac was launched from Cape Kennedy. \nInscribed in an instrument panel of that satellite was a poem written \nby Professor Thomas Bergin, from Yale University. It was the first poem \nto be launched into orbit around the Earth.\n  I want to read a few lines of it now:\n\n     And now 'tis man who dares assault the sky\n     And as we come to claim our promised place,\n     Aim only to repay the good you gave,\n     And warm with human love the chill of space.\n\n  The seven astronauts of Columbia represented different races, \ndifferent religions, different backgrounds, and, in one case, a \ndifferent country. But they were united by their desire to solve the \nmysteries of the universe and to make life better for all people.\n  In living that hope--and dying with it--their lives will forever \ninspire us.\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\nAnd their memories will warm the chill of space.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer some comments in \nresponse to the Columbia shuttle disaster that we all learned about \nlast Saturday. Since then, we Americans and most of the rest of the \nworld really have been in a state of grief again, a state of mind and \nheart that many of us, of course, have experienced both personally and \nnationally before. Once again, in this case of public grief, television \nbecame our common touchstone, binding us through the ether, informing \nus with gripping yet familiar scenes and words.\n  And once again, we learned things we wished we had known and thought \nbefore the great loss. We learned of the astronaut whose aunt and uncle \nhad lost a son on September 11 at the World Trade Center. Once again, \nthey share a personal loss with the whole Nation. We learned of the \nIsraeli astronaut who was part of the mission that destroyed an Iraqi \nnuclear reactor in 1981, an act that we now know saved the world from \nthe menace of Saddam Hussein with his finger on a nuclear button.\n\n  We learned of a woman who emigrated from India to the United States, \nbecame an American citizen, and then an astronaut. Surely that is one \nof the most vibrant and exciting realizations of what we call the \nAmerican dream I have ever heard.\n  I am sorry I did not know all this before the terrible news of last \nSaturday. That is both a testament to the success of the space program \nand a mark of how easy it is for all of us to forget the risks others \nhave taken and are taking to advance the frontiers of our knowledge. \nThe fact is, we take too much for granted, and it is sad it does take \ntragedy to shock us into an awareness of the sacrifices that are \nconstantly being made by others on our behalf.\n  That was certainly true about the role of our firefighters and police \nand emergency medical and health personnel after September 11. It is \ntrue when our military men and women go into combat to protect our \nsecurity. The loss of the Black Hawk crew in Afghanistan this past week \nis again a reminder of how much danger other Americans face on our \nbehalf.\n  It is true also with regard to the Columbia, when the loss of that \nshuttle has caused us once again to stop and think about the men and \nwomen who climb on top of rockets and head into the coldness of outer \nspace to advance the leading edge of human experience from which all of \nus benefit. We owe those seven brave souls our gratitude. We owe the \nsame to those who fly today aboard the International Space Station and \nto those who are preparing to fly back and forth in the months and \nyears to come.\n  Amidst the painful familiarity of the moment we are experiencing come \nthe calls for a thorough accounting of what happened; how did it \nhappen. There are some who say we should have done this and others who \nsay we should not have done that. Others will say we should abandon \nspace, echoing a refrain we have heard intermittently now for more than \n4 decades. Skepticism about space exploration, combined with the \neconomic restraints faced by our Nation for many of the years of the \npast 4 decades, has, in fact, lowered our sights and diminished our \nmomentum in space.\n  We must and we will investigate what happened to Columbia. No holds \nshould be barred and every step should be taken to discover exactly \nwhat went wrong and to set about making it right so people will never \nagain look aloft to see a fiery comet signalling the destruction of a \nspacecraft with its historic crew.\n  Yet we must be realists. No human advance comes without risk. In the \nhistory of human space flight, in fact, we have lost the crew of Apollo \n1, Soyuz 1 and 11, the Challenger, and now Columbia. This is the most \ndifficult, dangerous, and daunting work I can imagine. That in part is \nwhy we do it.\n  President Kennedy said more than 40 years ago:\n\n       We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other \n     things, not because they are easy but because they are hard.\n\n  There is no acceptable number of spacecraft lost in pursuit of what \nis hard and what is unknown. Obviously just one loss is too many. But \nwe must recognize that the sacrifice of those who have died has not \nbeen in vain. The space program has yielded enormous results. It has \nalso given our Nation and people throughout the world a sense of wonder \nthat cannot be easily recounted in mere dollars and cents.\n  Our gross spiritual product, if you will, GSP, is higher than it \nwould otherwise have been thanks to the efforts of the astronauts, the \nscientists, and all who make the exploration of space a noble part of \nour civilization.\n  We must emerge from this investigation of the Columbia tragedy and \nfrom our introspection about it resolved to do more, not less, to think \nbigger, not smaller, to aim higher, not lower. Just as we must build \nsomething great and beautiful where the World Trade Center towers once \nstood, a fitting tribute to the men and women of the Columbia is not \nreally to fix what went wrong but to do what is right, to do what is \ncharacteristically American, to continue--indeed, to expand--their \nmission and to lift our sights to the heavens once again and pursue new \nmissions--as Charles Krauthammer has written--``to the moon and \nbeyond.''\n  We should do so not because we know what knowledge and benefits that \npursuit of those goals will achieve; we should do so because we do not \nknow. Yet we can be confident, based on our experience, that the effort \nwill prove more than worth our while.\n  That is the wonder of exploration, to go beyond the next bend in the \nriver, over the next mountain, beyond the far horizon, not because we \nknow what is there, but because we do not and want to find out.\n  Most great feats of exploration in human history have yielded \nbenefits far in excess of what anyone could have predicted when they \nbegan. Surely we will find something on the Moon or Mars or elsewhere \nin the cosmos that will astonish us and transform the way we live. \nSurely we will discover things about ourselves in the process of \nmounting those great missions that will change our lives.\n  Spend the money here on Earth, some will say. Our problems are too \ngreat here to waste money in space or on the Moon or Mars.\n  First remember that not one single dollar will actually be left in \nspace, on the Moon, or on the surface of the red planet. Every dollar \ninvested in space is invested here on Earth, circulating throughout our \neconomy, creating a multiplier effect as the jobs and discoveries \nassociated with the space program lift in time our GDP, our gross \ndomestic product.\n  Our new missions in space should be as the International Space \nStation is: American-led but international in scope. People and \nresources of many nations can and should be pooled to ensure that the \ngreat space missions of the 21st century are global projects that make \nsense, because success is more likely, of course, if we tap the best \nminds of the broad community of nations, not just our own. The \ninvestment needed can best be realized through contributions from many \npeoples, not just the American people.\n  Such a common venture also has other salutary effects. As President \nClinton has said, We need a world with more friends and fewer \nterrorists. And what better way to expand our circle of friends than to \ninvite them to join us on an inspiring voyage together into the unknown \nwonders of space. What better way to showcase our own unique values and \ntechnological advances than to lead a team of many nations whose \ncitizens will share with us a stake in the outcome and a share of the \npride.\n  Finally, embarking on a bold new age of discovery will help revive \nthe American spirit. In the midst of terrorist threats from abroad, a \nshaken sense of security here at home, a troubled economy, and shocks \nto our system such as those we faced on September 11 and after from the \nanthrax and now from the loss of the Columbia, the American people may \nbe feeling uncertain about our future. These have been tough times. But \nI am confident we are at heart an optimistic people and that for us the \nbest truly is yet to come.\n  We have to find ways to strengthen our can-do spirit, to unleash our \noptimism and give us a stronger sense of national purpose and greater \nhope in a better future. No single enterprise can accomplish that goal. \nI do not mean to suggest that a visionary space program alone will turn \nthe national tide. There\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\nare other missions to consider as well that are closer to Earth--great \nmissions--which together we can accomplish to cure cancer, make our \nNation energy independent, and defeat the scourge of AIDS.\n  But remember that the American dream is not a zero-sum game. We can \ndo more than we realize. We can expand opportunity and vision and hope \nif we set our minds, our hearts, and our national will to the task.\n  We have all been reminded in recent days of all that President \nKennedy set in motion with his brief words to the Congress in 1961 when \nhe committed America to land a man on the Moon before that decade was \nout. We should remind ourselves, too, of how far we have come in the \nhundred years since the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk. We cannot \nknow how far and how fast mankind, humankind, will travel across the \ncountry or the universe by this century's end. That is the wonder of \nit. But if we fail to heed the call to explore, we will only succeed in \nstifling an astounding revolution that is bound to occur sooner or \nlater.\n  Centuries ago, William Shakespeare wrote:\n\n       Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft \n     might win by fearing to attempt.\n\n  We must not let our doubts make us lose the good we can win by \nventuring further into this special frontier in space of which we are \naware.\n  In words that are more American than Shakespeare's, Mark Twain \ncaptured that same sensibility in one of the great American novels--\nmaybe the greatest--``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' where Huck, \nwith Jim, on the raft delighted always in approaching the next bend in \nthe river, not knowing what they would find around the bend, but never \nfearful, always excited, and always confident of their ability to deal \nwith whatever they found. In those last sentences of that great novel, \nHuck says:\n\n       I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the \n     rest.\n\n  So he did, and so have we Americans before and since. We will not--\nthose of us who are blessed to be citizens of this great country now--\nreap all that we sow, not in our lifetimes. Yet we will find \nnourishment for our national spirit in the effort itself and from the \nknowledge that we are working to make a better tomorrow for those who \nwill follow us as citizens of this country and the world, whose faces \nwe will not live to see, whose names we cannot know, but whose lives we \ncan touch for the better by what we do today.\n  We do know the names of Rick Husband, Will McCool, Michael Anderson, \nKalpana Chawla, David Brown, Laurel Clark, and Ilan Ramon. May God have \nmercy on them, their families, and friends, and may their souls be \nembraced in eternal life. May they, like modern-day angels, experience \nforever the peace, joy, and beauty of space flight. And may we never \nturn back from the journey of discovery that inspired these heroes and \nmust still inspire our Nation and the world to ever greater heights.\n  Let's light out for the territory ahead of the rest, and today that \nterritory is beyond the sky. For that is the stuff of the American \ndream and the heart of the human soul. It must be our choice today, for \nsurely it is our destiny.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it was my sad privilege to attend the \nmemorial service for our great astronauts in Houston yesterday. As best \nI could, I carried the love and prayers of Minnesotans to that solemn \noccasion. It was heartbreaking; yet it was awe inspiring at the same \ntime. There was a lot of love in Houston yesterday that surrounded the \nfamilies of the brave astronauts.\n  I should note how blessed we are to have the President we have at \ntimes such as this. His words are good and true, but it is his heart \nthat communicates to the hearts of Minnesotans.\n  How much we all owe to the explorers, the inventors and the pioneers. \nIn Minnesota, we marvel at the thought that a Charles Lindberg from \nLittle Falls, a small town on the Mississippi, was the one who opened a \nnew door by traveling solo across the Atlantic. For almost every one of \nus, our presence in this country is a reality because some brave souls \nconquered their fears and headed off to an unknown place with the only \nhope that it meant a better life for their families.\n  The pain of this tragedy is made more acute because of the purity of \nthe sacrifice of these seven extraordinary and ordinary folks. They did \nnot climb into that rocket to get rich or to gain power or to become \ncelebrities. They assumed the risk to their lives for science, for \ndiscovery, for the pushing out of the horizons of mankind.\n  As we mourn, may we in this Chamber and throughout this society seek \nthat purity of motive and courage to take risks on behalf of others and \nin pursuit of a better future. May we express our appreciation far more \nfreely for all those who take enormous risks on our behalf. May we \nembrace a spirit of service and sacrifice for others rather than \nidealize safety and security for ourselves.\n  Thousands of years ago, an ancient Hebrew writer put down these \nwords, expressed as a prayer:\n\n     Where can I go from your spirit?\n     Where can I flee from your presence?\n     If I go up to the heavens, you are there;\n     If I make my bed in the depths, you are there.\n     If I rise on the wings of the dawn,\n     If I settle on the far side of the sea,\n     Even there your hand will guide me,\n     Your right hand will hold me fast.\n\n  We pray for that comfort, we pray for that embrace for the families \nwho are enduring this loss and that encouragement for all as we move on \nfrom here.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is with an especially heavy \nheart that I join Senator Hutchison of Texas as a sponsor of S. Res. 45 \ncommemorating the fallen astronauts on the Columbia mission and to \nexpress the Senate's support for continuing their legacy.\n  I, along with a number of other Senators and Members of the House and \nvarious parts of the NASA family, gathered yesterday in Houston. It is \ngetting to be a gathering that is not pleasant, for we had a similar \ngathering 17 years ago--17 years ago, almost to the day--when we lost \nanother space shuttle from a series of mistakes.\n  Oh, there were the technical reasons about why the Space Shuttle \nChallenger exploded, the technical reasons that the cold weather had \nstiffened the rubberized gaskets, called the O-rings, in the field \njoints of the solid rocket boosters, and that stiffened O-ring allowed \nthe hot gases of the SRBs to pass through those creases--those field \njoints--of the SRBs. It just happened to burn out right where the strut \nwas that held that SRB to the external tank. When that strut burned at \nthe bottom, it caused that SRB to rotate and puncture the big external \ntank. Seventy minutes into the flight, miles high in the Florida sky, \nit was a shock to the Nation that the symbol of America's technological \nprowess would disintegrate right in front of our eyes through a \ntelevision camera.\n  NASA realized its mistakes, and its mistakes were not only technical. \nArrogance had set in at NASA.\n  A basic fundamental of information is that it should flow both ways, \nnot only from the top to the bottom but from the bottom to the top. \nBecause of arrogance it had not. As the count proceeded the night \nbefore, there were two engineers at Morton Thiokol in Utah who were \nbegging their management to stop the count because they knew the frigid \nweather was going to stiffen those O-rings.\n  When we did the investigation, both in the Presidential Commission \nand in the committee I chaired at the time in the House of \nRepresentatives, the\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\nSpace Subcommittee of the full committee, the Science, Space and \nTechnology Committee, what we found was that although those engineers \nwere begging their management to send this information along, the \ninformation never got passed on to the NASA management.\n  There were mistakes of communication, there were mistakes of \nattitude, and there were mistakes as a result of arrogance that caused \nthe destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger. The NASA family went \nto work and really started improving on that.\n  The fact is, space flight is a risky business. When I flew 17 years \nago, our flight returned to Earth only 10 days before Challenger \nlaunched. When I flew, there were 1,500 parts on the space shuttle \ncalled ``critical one'' parts--any one of which, if it were to fail, \nwould mean the end of the mission. It was catastrophe.\n  So when one goes through a very unforgiving environment and returns \nin an unforgiving environment, there is risk. Probably the riskiest \npart is all of those parts have to work on the ascent. The ascent is \nonly 8\\1/2\\ minutes to orbit, but in order to defy the bounds of \ngravity and go Mach 25, 17,500 miles an hour, which is orbital \nvelocity, and to have that energy that puts the spacecraft in a \nposition to punch out of the Earth's atmosphere and insert into orbit, \nit is risky. So, too, upon reentering the Earth's atmosphere, that is \nrisky.\n  About an hour before landing, the orbiter is turned around and a \nthrust for 4 minutes of the two OMS engines, not the main engines but \nthe OMS engines, is given to slow the orbiter a little from Mach 25. \nThat slowly allows gravity to start pulling the spacecraft back to \nEarth. For about the next half hour, the spacecraft is basically in \nfreefall still going about 17,000 miles an hour, traveling about a \nthird of the way around the Earth, and at 400,000 feet the spacecraft \nstarts encountering the Earth's atmosphere.\n  At that point, the computers have to be working perfectly. The \norbiter has been turned around and the angle of attack has to be \nexactly perfect in order that those silicon tiles on the bottom of the \norbiter are repelling the heat which on the underside of the wings has \nrisen to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit and on the leading edge of the wing \nhas raised to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  If those computers are not working perfectly to keep that angle of \nattack so that the heat is repelled, the orbiter will burn up. If the \nnose gets too low, it will burn up. If the tail gets too low, it will \nburn up. Or if there is a ripping off of the aluminum skin, these \nprotective tiles that have been put there with a very high technology \ntype of glue--one or two tiles, the structure is going to be invaded \nbut it is not going to cause a catastrophe for the mission, but if many \ntiles are ripped off or if tiles have been damaged so that they are not \nsmooth on the surface and are now rough, causing new turbulence as the \norbiter comes crashing through the Earth's denser atmosphere, as it \ngets lower and lower, turbulence will be created and there will be an \nadditional opportunity for silicon tiles to rip off. If they rip off, \nthere is going to be a catastrophe.\n\n  We still do not know what the initial cause was for the destruction \nof Columbia. We do know that one of the suspects is a piece of \ninsulation came off of the huge external tank on launch. That \ninsulation is like a foam, like a consistency of Styrofoam in a \nStyrofoam cooler and it could have been more hardened by ice having \nformed on the outside of that supercooled external tank which has the \nliquid hydrogen and the liquid oxygen that fuels the main engines. It \ncould have been harder because of ice having formed on that Styrofoam-\ntype mixture, and that could have caused the initial damage or roughing \nup of some tiles, but we do not know at this point.\n  Some event started to occur as the shuttle was over California for \ndebris was first seen high in the skies coming off the shuttle over \nCalifornia and then over New Mexico before the shuttle started to come \napart over Texas.\n  We will find the cause and we will fix it, and we will get back to \nflight. Lord help us that we are not down for 2\\1/2\\ years as we were \nafter Challenger and it took us 2\\1/2\\ years to feel safe enough to fly \nthe first flight. I say, ``Lord help us'' because we have two \nastronauts and a cosmonaut in the space station right now. They are \nsafe. They have a lifeboat up there of a Russian Soyuz craft that can \nbring them home, but we do not want to have to bring them home. We want \nto send a replacement crew so we can keep science and experiments going \nin that magnificent structure of a laboratory in the heavens called the \nInternational Space Station.\n  We are going to find the problem, we are going to fix it, and \nhopefully we are going to be able to fix it soon. If it is a massive \nfailure of a thermal protection system, which is the tiles, then it is \ngoing to take us awhile.\n  In the early 1980s, we even looked at the possibility of going out on \nan EVA--that is a space walk--to fix damaged tiles. It was concluded in \nthe 1980s that it was too much of a risk. First, we did not have the \nkind of glue that, in the vacuum of space, could fix those tiles, and \nthen the risks of an astronaut going over the side where there was no \ncommunication in sight were considered so high. Remember, all of our \nspace walks are outside of the open cargo bay where we have instant \ncommunication and sight with our space walkers. The basic problem was \nthe EVA suit weighs 300 pounds and the boots are another 15 or 20 \npounds. What happens if that space walker gets out of control? He will \ndamage the tiles already there on the underside.\n\n  We are going to see if technology has advanced enough so we can \nrepair those delicate silicon tiles on the underside of the space \nshuttle if they are damaged on ascent and we can see significant \ndamage. We will have to look at that. We did look at it in the early \n1980s and we said we could not do it.\n  We were in Houston yesterday. NASA is a family. When a family member \nis taken, that family grieves. It was well known the commander of this \nmission, Rick Husband, had a deep and abiding faith. That had been \nspoken about quite a bit throughout the service, in sidebar \nconversations, in the remarks of the President, and today in a major \nfeature article in the Washington Post. That does not help relieve or \neliminate the grief. It does help console those who are grieving.\n  I saw a lot of macho, grizzled astronauts yesterday giving a lot of \nhugs. Those seven astronauts who died over Texas made the ultimate \nsacrifice in exchange for the benefits that their courageous \nexploration of the heavens will realize for all of mankind. It is with \nthe greatest respect and gratitude to the families of those fallen that \nwe say what we can--and we really cannot say anything that in the big \npicture is meaningful--to ensure their cause will continue.\n  To a man and a woman in this Senate, there is a determination that \ncause will continue. It will continue certainly as a memorial to those \nbefore them, all of those names that are on that significant astronaut \nmemorial at the Kennedy Space Center, astronauts who have died in the \nline of duty--not just the ones you know about--the Apollo fire on the \npad, the Challenger 7, and now the Columbia 7.\n  Not only will it continue as a memorial, but this program will \ncontinue because it is a reflection of the character of the American \npeople. We are by nature explorers and adventurers. That is a part of \nour character. It began when Europeans left the continent and crossed \nthe oceans. It is deep within our soul to be explorers and adventurers. \nWhen we settled this land known as New America, we had a frontier, and \nit was westward. We still have a frontier, and it is upward.\n  I believe in my lifetime we will see an international crew from \nplanet Earth go to the planet Mars. We may well go back to the Moon and \nestablish a lunar base. We might be mining things on the surface of the \nMoon, like helium 3. A cargo bay type load of helium 3 could generate \nthe electrical power for the entire United States for 1 year. Those are \nthe technologies that hold promise. We already see so many of the \ntechnologies developed in the space program, particularly when we went \nto the Moon. We had to have materials that were light in weight, small \nin volume, and highly reliable. In developing those for space \nexploration to go to the Moon, the spinoffs have been incredible. This \nwatch is a part of the spinoff. So is an artificial heart. So is a \nkidney dialysis machine. So is much of our modern-day materials and \nalloys.\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\n  We will continue exploration, not only in the memory of our fallen \ncomrades but for what it reflects as a character of the American people \nand the American spirit as well as the many benefits we derive from \nspace exploration, not the least of which is to find out about that \nmagnificent creation out there called the universe.\n  That is why I rise to join with Senator Hutchison in sponsoring this \nresolution commemorating our fallen brethren and sisters.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nadoption of the pending resolution on the Columbia occur at 2:20 today, \nwith 5 minutes prior to the vote equally divided between Senators \nHutchison and Nelson for closing remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the seven \nmen and women of the Space Shuttle Columbia who dedicated their lives \nto the future of this Nation and our Nation's space program. In \nparticular, seven men and women who knew the risk of strapping \nthemselves on top of a rocket, leaving the Earth behind and exploring \nthe heavens. Seven men and women who knew what they were doing but, \nnevertheless, volunteered for an extremely dangerous but critically \nimportant mission: Shuttle Commander Rick Husband, Pilot William \nMcCool, Payload Commander Michael Anderson, Mission Specialist Kalpana \nChawla, Mission Specialist David Brown, Mission Specialist Laurel Blair \nSalton Clark, and Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon.\n  These brave seven showed the Nation, indeed they showed the entire \nworld that our thirst for knowledge and exploration is not yet quenched \nand, God willing, will never be. These brave seven are shining examples \nof the courage, enthusiasm, and awe that runs through the veins of all \nof the men and women associated with our space program, as well as the \neager children across this Nation who look to the stars and see the \nbeginning, not the end, of their dreams.\n  These brave seven and their colleagues throughout the space program \ninspire not only our Nation and our children, they inspire the entire \nworld. Their actions, bravery, and achievement are a challenge to all \nhumankind, a challenge to dream more, to achieve more, and to reach \nfarther than ever thought possible.\n  As we know and as the President observed yesterday, high achievement \nis inseparable from great risk. These seven proved that in a terrible \nand tragic way.\n  I would also like to take a moment to honor the men and women in my \nState of Texas--the police, fire, and emergency services, as well as \nthousands of local volunteers who have worked so hard on the ground in \nthe aftermath of this terrible disaster to prevent further tragedy. In \naddition, they are in the process of collecting important evidence that \nwill ultimately, we trust, lead to determination of what caused this \nterrible tragedy so it will never ever happen again.\n  Literally within minutes of the tragedy, ordinary Texans did \nextraordinary things. By working together, they helped to ensure the \nsafety of their neighbors, and they helped speed the investigation so \nthat heroic astronauts on future space missions will return home \nsafely. These volunteers are still on site working together with law \nenforcement personnel. I want to express my gratitude, as I know the \nNation does, for their efforts.\n  The fact that America and the world delight in every takeoff and hold \ntheir collective breath at every landing is a testament to the power \nand hope embodied in our Nation's space program. The heroes who create, \nmaintain, and fly these amazing machines are a testament to the fact \nthat dreams are the beginning and not the end of the possible.\n  I would also like to remind my colleagues that more than one nation \nmourns this tragedy. The nations of Israel and India and the rest of \nthe world share in our grief as they share in our hope for the future.\n  Our space program inspired a young girl in the small town of Karnal, \nIndia to look to the heavens and see her future. Kalpana Chawla came to \nthe United States, studied hard, worked hard, and became part of the \ngreatest exploration force in the history of the world. Her efforts \nhave inspired thousands of schoolchildren, and her example will inspire \ncountless more in the future. She, in particular, has inspired \nschoolchildren in her hometown to watch in awe as she achieved what \nthey only dreamed.\n  In Israel, Ilan Ramon was the hope of a nation and the inspiration \nfor the next generation of scientists, fliers, and adventurers in the \nnation of Israel. And he no doubt inspired many young people in that \ncountry to reach beyond what now seems impossible--to dream beyond the \nunrest in that troubled area of our world and to dream about achieving \nthe impossible. He is a hero, there and here, and an inspiration to all \nwho dream of the stars.\n  As we mourn these fallen heroes, let us also take the opportunity to \nlook forward to the future when shuttle flights are as common as air \ntravel and the marvels of the space program are missions the mind has \nyet to imagine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the astronauts \nwho perished aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia last Saturday, and to \ntheir families. It was a terrible tragedy we all suffered with the \ndeath of seven astronauts this last Saturday. We have heard many moving \nand eloquent tributes to those brave souls since the Columbia was lost. \nWe have learned a great deal about the strength and courage and \nresourcefulness and humanity of each of those astronauts--Rick Husband, \nWilliam McCool, David Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Michael Anderson, Laurel \nClark, and Ilan Ramon. We have heard from the people who knew them \nbest. Clearly, I and most of us here did not know them personally.\n  However, I want to take just a moment more to speak about one of \nthose astronauts in particular--Laurel Salton Clark. She spent part of \nher youth in Albuquerque in my home State and she maintained roots \nthere. Her father lives with his wife in Albuquerque. And Laurel's \nbrother, John Salton, is an engineer at Sandia National Laboratories. \nLaurel attended Hodgin Elementary School and Monroe Middle School, and \nfrequently returned to Albuquerque for visits with family. She was a \nstellar student throughout her life. Her only B, according to her \nfather, was one she received in high school in the typing class. She \nwas a medical doctor. She was a flight surgeon in the Navy. And she \nmade the astronaut corps when she was 5 months pregnant.\n  She stood for what is best about our country. She was brave; she was \nstrong; she was full of life. We are all diminished by her loss. We are \nalso, of course, all diminished by the loss of each of the other brave \nastronauts who perished in that terrible tragedy on Saturday.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, at the height of the Renaissance, Leonardo da \nVinci said: ``When once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk \nthe earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and \nthere you will always long to return.''\n  From that day to this, men and women have toiled and sacrificed, even \ngiven their lives to the achievement of manned flight. Poems have been \npenned, speeches have been delivered, and history has been written \nhonoring those men and women who have lived and some, unfortunately, \nwho have died, to achieve our dreams--the dreams of all mankind.\n  To honor the memory of these gallant seven, we must devote the \nresources, and the far-reaching inquiry,\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\nneeded to find out what happened on February 1, 2003, and achieve the \nremedy so that this tragic accident will never be repeated.\n  As a nation we mourn the loss of the crew of Columbia, but as members \nof the family of man, we should celebrate their courage, their \ndedication, and their desire to better us all.\n  To the families of these heroes, here and abroad, we pledge to \npreserve and nurture the enterprise of space exploration. Our quest \nwill continue. They will guide us on our way.\n  I would like to close with an observation that speaks to the spirit \nof exploring the unknown. It is from another member of the NASA family, \nastronaut Michael Collins. He said: ``It is human nature to stretch, to \ngo, to see, to understand. Exploration is not a choice, really: it is \nan imperative.''\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I and all of my colleagues, and I think, \nall Americans, have been in a period of mourning as a result of the \nsituation that occurred about 9:15 or 9:16 this past Saturday, as many \nof us watched in horror, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrate over \nthe continental United States.\n  All of us in the Senate have had the privilege over the years of \nmeeting many of our astronauts, and certainly even serving with some of \nthem right here in the Senate. We have known of the phenomenal \ndedication and commitment of these men and women who do this very \nimportant work. It is a life of pursuing a challenge, and the reward \nwas the service itself. It was not financial, it was not a large \ntrophy. It was the challenge of the service and what they could provide \nfor our country and for all mankind. I think yesterday, as many \nwitnessed the memorial service at the Johnson Space Center in Houston--\nI was unable to attend--we were reminded once again of the phenomenal \ncaliber and capability of these seven people.\n  Barbara Morgan from my State has pursued being an astronaut for many \nyears. She was, up until now--and may still be--scheduled to fly into \nspace within the year. She was part of the original teacher's program--\none of those on standby and ready to go up when the Challenger went up \nand was lost. I have seen the excitement of being an astronaut and of \nachieving as an astronaut--for herself, yes, but for the American \npeople--through the eyes and enthusiasm of Ms. Morgan.\n  So I am reminded through her, and what I know of her, of the caliber \nand talent of these people who are selected to become our astronauts.\n  We will now set about trying to find out what went wrong, as we \nshould, because one wonderful thing about our space program from the \nvery beginning, is we always erred on the side of human safety. We were \nalways extremely cautious and we built phenomenal systems of redundancy \nto assure that the primary role was to guarantee--or at least provide--\nthe optimum safety that we were technologically capable of doing; and \nsomething clearly has gone wrong. It is now our job and the job of NASA \nto be able to find out and to rectify it for future space travel.\n  I just said future space travel. I am an enthusiast of the space \nprogram and always have been. In the 20-plus years I have served in \nCongress, I have always supported NASA and all of its efforts. It is \nwithin this country's capability, and it is within the full character \nof our country that we do as we have done in the space program, and \nthat is push and explore the unknown. We were founded, we became a \ncountry, we discovered our landmass. Some people thought they might \nfall over the edge of the earth because some who were on that maiden \nvoyage with Columbus thought the earth was flat and surely they would \nsail off into the unknown and go over the edge, never to be heard from \nagain. It was that kind of daring that made us what we are.\n  Just a few weeks ago, my wife and I had the privilege of traveling to \nMonticello for the commencement program of the bicentennial of Lewis \nand Clark. Of course, I am from Idaho. In those days, they didn't know \nthere was an Idaho; they just knew there was a wilderness out there \nthat nobody had penetrated before. It was the wisdom of Thomas \nJefferson on that day in 1803 to have written a letter to Congress \nasking for $2,500 to put a team together to explore the unknown. Did \nthey ever think they would return? They didn't know it. There was no \nguarantee. The risks were high. Of course, all the rest is history.\n\n  What we witnessed last Saturday morning was a phenomenal reminder of \nthe great spirit of adventure and the challenge that Americans have met \nfor literally centuries. We are also reminded it is not just going down \nto the airport and getting on a shuttle. We have become relatively \ncomplacent that shuttles flew and there was an inherent amount of \nsafety in them simply because they were flying so often--only to find \nout that simply was not the case. I hope--and I am confident of it--we \nwill find remedies to the obvious problem that took the lives of seven \nwonderful human beings last Saturday and, in finding that, we will make \nanother major step forward in allowing humans to travel into outer \nspace and explore, or to allow their genius to travel into outer space \nand explore. For the adventure of it? Sure, but also for the \napplications of adventure and the tools of exploration that we then \napply in our own lives--whether it is, in fact, velcro, or the \nminiaturization of the electronic equipment that is a direct result of \nspace travel that we use in all of our lives today to allow us to live \nmore efficiently and be more productive.\n  That is part of the total investment that is the space program--the \nability of this great country to push the outer limits and allow the \ngenius of our people the resources to do just that. So we stand in awe \nof those who travel in outer space. But Saturday and yesterday were \nreminders that they are human, and that it is a very dangerous and \nrisky business we pursue in the business of adventure, the business of \npushing the unknown, and the great reward for accomplishing and \nsucceeding in doing so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join my Senate colleagues and our Nation \nin honoring the seven astronauts who lost their lives as Space Shuttle \nColumbia returned home last Saturday. These brave individuals flew into \nspace in the name of all humanity, and together we mourn their loss.\n  Those who perished with Columbia represented not only the best of our \nNation, but the best of humankind. On board was a crew of seven: COL \nRick Husband; LTC Michael Anderson; CDR Laurel Clark; CAPT David Brown; \nCDR William McCool; Dr. Kalpana Chawla; and Ilan Ramon, a colonel in \nthe Israeli Air Force. They left behind 12 children, their spouses, \nalong with numerous family members and friends. The people of the State \nof Michigan and our Nation share the grief and the pride of those who \nlost a loved one aboard the shuttle.\n  When Columbia blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape \nCanaveral a few weeks ago, the astronauts aboard left earth in relative \nanonymity. In many ways this is a result of NASA's success: there have \nnow been 144 manned space missions. Consequently, many have come to \nview spaceflight as routine.\n  However, the journey of exploration which they shared posed great \nrisk. But the astronauts aboard Columbia, like those aboard Challenger \nand in Apollo I before them, understood those risks associated with \ntheir mission. Last Saturday, our Nation and the world once again \nreceived the ultimate and painful reminders that these are still our \nfirst steps into space. Nevertheless, space exploration will continue, \nfor exploring our world and the heavens above has been a dream of \nhumanity since long before the namesake of the Columbia set out across \nthe Atlantic Ocean seeking a new route to India.\n  I am confident that in the coming months we will leave no stone \nunturned in the quest to find the causes of this catastrophe. I am sure \nthe necessary changes will be made to safely transport the heroes of \ntoday and those of tomorrow.\n  A generation ago, the challenge of manned spaceflight inspired \nthousands\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\nof students to pursue careers in math, science and engineering. We are \nstill benefitting from the innovations that this generation is \nresponsible for. By rededicating ourselves to spaceflight and the \nwonders of science, we can produce another generation that will tackle \nnew challenges and inspire us with their discoveries.\n  I believe the comment of my friend and our former colleague John \nGlenn summarizes it best. Following the tragedy of the Space Shuttle \nChallenger, he remarked, ``they indeed carried our hopes and our dreams \nwith them. Let us carry their memory with us.'' The men and women of \nthe Space Shuttle Columbia carried with them the dreams of all of us \nand for that we thank them and hold them in our hearts.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this past Saturday, the world once \nagain became painfully aware of the risks inherent in manned space \ntravel. The Columbia tragedy has deeply wounded not only members of the \nNASA community, but also every American and indeed every person around \nthe world who has ever looked up into the night sky and gazed in \nwonderment.\n  Of course, space exploration has always been a dangerous venture, and \nthe seven astronauts who gave their lives on Saturday knew this full \nwell and accepted their mission witout reservation. Their long \ndedication to public service and their willingness to sacrifice, even \nat the risk of their own lives, in pursuit of knowledge and the \nbetterment of mankind should be celebrated. We honor these American \nheroes.\n  At the same time, all of our thoughts and prayers are with the \nfamilies of the crew during this terrible and difficult time. May they \nknow that every American is forever indebted to their loved ones for \ntheir bravery and devotion to the American space program.\n  As we sort out the causes of this tragedy over the next several \nmonths and years, however, we must not fear the exploration of outer \nspace. We must strive to return to space as soon as possible, maybe \nwith different means, maybe unmanned, until we can be most assured of \nimproved safety, for the benefits of the space program are innumerable \nand irrefutable.\n  Because of research performed in outer space, people all over the \nworld now benefit from, among other things, improved water and air \npurification systems, kidney dialysis machines, more efficient solar \ncollectors, artificial hearts and limbs, improved emergency rescue \nequipment, and fire retardant materials, In fact, more than 100 \ndocumented NASA technologies from the space shuttle are now \nincorporated into the tools we use, the foods we eat, and the \nbiotechnology and medicines used to improved our health.\n  In addition to these immense practical benefits, we must not forget \nthe power of space flight to inspire and motivate that those who will \neventually lead us in the future. In 1957, a group of six boys in my \nhome State of West Virginia observed Sputnik flying high overhead and \nrealized that rocketry was their calling in life. In the 45 years \nsince, the group, now known as the Rocket Boys, has mad space \nexploration a reality for countless children and adults in West \nVirginia. Early space flight inspired them, and it inspired space \neducation in West Virginia.\n  As a result of this inspiration, West Virginia is now the proud home \nof the NASA Independent Identification and Validation Center in \nFairmont where 150 NASA employees and contractors play a critical role \nin space shuttle mission control software. Our State is also the proud \nhome of the Challenger Learning Center at Wheeling Jesuit University \nwhich provides schoolchildren and teachers the chance to experience \nspace simulation and many opportunities for math, science, and \ntechnology education.\n  It is easy to support the space program during times of great success \nand spectacular achievement. But it is perhaps during times of tragedy \nand confusion that the program needs our support the most. Just \nyesterday, President Bush expressed his support for the continuation of \nthe space shuttle program, declaring that the ``American journey into \nspace will go on.''\n  NASA's remaining astronaut corps, as well as their flight directors \nand engineers, embody the very same bravery and dedication as their \nfallen colleagues. It is now up to all of us to echo support for our \nspace program so that this bravery is not wasted, so that the immense \nbenefits of the space program, as well as future astronauts, can be \nsafely brought back to Earth.\n Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, all Americans \nwere saddened by the terrible tragedy last weekend involving the Space \nShuttle Columbia. The world has lost seven incredibly talented people \nwho were striving to make this a better planet for us all. Our hearts \ngo out to the families of the astronauts. I hope God will provide them \ncomfort and healing during this difficult time.\n  For decades, Americans have been proud of our space program and the \nbrave men and women who have led our explorations in space travel. They \nhave been pioneers seeking a better understanding of our own planet and \nwhat lies in the deep, dark expanse of space.\n  In the coming days and weeks our Nation will mourn for the astronauts \nof the Space Shuttle Columbia as well as the friends and families they \nleft behind. We will also mourn for the thousands of dedicated workers \nat NASA who are suffering from this painful loss. We will take our time \nto carefully study and examine what went wrong and then we'll make the \nnecessary corrections and adjustments.\n  At the appropriate time, we will once again move forward into new \nfrontiers and new missions for space exploration. It is who we are. It \nis what we do. It is why we are Americans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, together, as a nation, we mourn the loss \nof the seven extraordinary men and women of the Columbia shuttle who \ngave their lives so unselfishly and courageously for our country. They \nknew the dangers they faced, but they believed in their mission, and \nthey represent the very best of America.\n  We know the great loss their families and the whole Nation have \nsuffered, and they are very much in our thoughts and prayers. They were \ndaring and brave explorers. Their extraordinary spirit and courage \nenabled them to reach for the stars and explore the universe and \ndiscover its truths. In serving America so well, they also served all \nhumanity.\n  The best way for all of us to honor the memory and sacrifice of these \nbrave young men and women is to carry on the work they were part of. \nThe tragedy reminds us again that those who venture into space place \ntheir own lives at risk as they try to benefit us all. We can vindicate \ntheir faith by keeping faith with them. Those whom we have just lost \nwould be the first to say to us, ``persevere, go forward,'' because \nthey were pioneers in the truest sense and in the greatest of American \ntradition. They were willing to take risks, even to risk their lives in \norder to benefit us all.\n  I know how deeply President Kennedy believed in the space program. He \ncalled it, ``the vast ocean of space,'' and he set our Nation firmly on \na course to explore it, understand it, and use it in ways that help and \nprotect us all. When America first embarked more than 40 years ago on \nthe great voyage into space, President Kennedy said, ``It will not be \none man going to the Moon: it will be an entire Nation.''\n  He knew that when we reach for the stars, sometimes we fall short. \nBut as he knew so well, the mission must go on. He would have been very \nproud of these seven astronauts, as all of us are today. Let us honor \nthese seven inspiring heroes by continuing the great enduring mission \nthey were part of, for the benefit of our country, our planet, and all \npeoples everywhere.\n  As my brother said on November 21, 1963, the day before he left us, \n``This Nation has tossed its cap over the wall of space, and we shall \nhave no choice but to follow it.'' In the quintessential spirit of \nAmerica, the crew of the Columbia have tossed their caps over that \nwall, too, and we shall never forget them.\n  I extend my deepest and heartfelt sympathy to the families who have \nso suddenly lost their loved ones. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an excerpt from President Kennedy's address to \nCongress on space in 1961, and the poem ``High Flight'' by John \nGillespie Magee, Jr., which President Reagan read after the loss of the \nChallenger in 1986.\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Excerpt From Address of President John F. Kennedy to a Special Joint \n                   Session of Congress (May 25, 1961)\n\n       . . . Now it is time to take longer strides--time for a \n     great new American enterprise--time for this nation to take a \n     clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways \n     may hold the key to our future on earth.\n       I believe we possess all the resources and talents \n     necessary. But the facts of the matter are that we have never \n     made the national decisions or marshalled the national \n     resources required for such leadership. We have never \n     specified long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or \n     managed our resources and our time so as to insure their \n     fulfillment.\n       Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with \n     their large rocket engines, which gives them many months of \n     lead-time, and recognizing the likelihood that they will \n     exploit this lead for some time to come in still more \n     impressive success, we nevertheless are required to make new \n     efforts on our own. For while we cannot guarantee that we \n     shall one day be first, we can guarantee that any failure to \n     make this effort will make us last. We take an additional \n     risk by making it in full view of the world, but as shown by \n     the feat of astronaut Shepard, this very risk enhances our \n     stature when we are successful. But this is not merely a \n     race. Space is open to us now; and our eagerness to share its \n     meaning is not governed by the efforts of others. We go into \n     space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must \n     fully share.\n       I therefore ask the Congress, above and beyond the \n     increases I have earlier requested for space activities, to \n     provide the funds which are needed to meet the following \n     national goals:\n       First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to \n     achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a \n     man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. . . . \n     But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the \n     moon--if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an \n     entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there . . .\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              High Flight\n\n                     (By John Gillespie Magee, Jr.)\n\n       (Magee was a 19-year-old American volunteer with the Royal \n     Canadian Air Force, who was killed in training December 11, \n     1941.)\n\n     Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth\n     And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;\n     Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth\n     Of sun-split clouds--and done a hundred things\n     You have not dreamed of--wheeled and soared and swung\n     High in the sunlight silence. Hov'ring there,\n     I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung\n     My eager craft through footless halls of air\n     Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue\n     I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace,\n     Where never lark, or even eagle, flew;\n     And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod\n     The high untrespassed sanctity of space,\n     Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President. I rise today with a heavy heart to honor \nseven fallen astronauts, the adventurers aboard Columbia. On Saturday, \nFebruary 1, after 16 days in space, their hero's homecoming abruptly \nturned into a national tragedy. As the space shuttle fell apart upon \nre-entry into Earth's atmosphere in the skies above Texas, the Nation \nonce again fell into mourning.\n  Each of the seven astronauts leaves behind family and friends who now \nbear the burden of immense sorrow and grief. May they find peace in the \ndays and years ahead. The loss of a spouse, father, mother, sibling, or \nchild brings immeasurable anguish, especially under such tragic, public \ncircumstances.\n  May they find comfort in the knowledge that their loved ones were \npursuing their lifelong dreams. The dreams of individuals whose \naspirations will benefit all of humanity. They leave behind for their \nchildren and grandchildren a legacy that will continue to inspire \ngenerations to come. The U.S. space program will continue. Their \nmission will not be forgotten.\n  In classrooms across America, Israel, India, and the world over, \nyoung impressionable minds can learn from these seven ambitious \nindividuals the values inherent to the human spirit: courage, \nadventure, discipline, discovery, commitment, exploration, and risk-\ntaking.\n  Each of the astronauts ought to be remembered in history for their \nwillingness to risk it all in pursuit of scientific discovery. The \nColumbia crew carried out 90 experiments to help solve problems here on \nEarth, including science experiments developed by students from 9 \nStates and 8 countries. Thanks to their selfless good work--ranging \nfrom tests developed to help fight cancer, improve crop yields, build \nearthquake-resistant buildings, and understand the effects of dust \nstorms on weather--human civilization stands to gain from their labors \nabove.\n  Like the explorers and frontiersman who traversed the unknown before \nthem, these seven men and women responded to a similar calling. Their \npredecessors navigated uncharted territory by way of oceans and open \nprairie: Ferdinand Magellan. James Cook, Lewis and Clark. It is a \ntimeless human quest to discover the undiscovered and to take risks.\n  These magnificent seven set out on heavenly horizons to explore, \ninvestigate, research, and navigate what for most of us Earth-bound \nfolks will remain a mystery. We are indebted to their courage, \ncommitment and contributions.\n  Mr. President, I wanted like to single out one member of the crew. \nOne of seven U.S. astronauts with Iowa ties, Laurel Clark was born in \nAmes. She leaves behind some family members in Iowa, including her 96-\nyear-old grandmother Mary Haviland and Doug and Betty Haviland, her \naunt and uncle. For the second time in 16 months, Reverend and Mrs. \nHaviland are coming to grips with devastating grief. They also lost \ntheir son in the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11. Friends and family \nmembers recall Clark as a high-achiever committed to science and the \nspace program. Last year, she visited an elementary school in Carroll, \nIA to educate a second-grade class about the space shuttle's mission. A \nwife and mother of an 8-year-old son, the 41-year-old Navy doctor was \non her first space flight. In her e-mails from Columbia, Clark wrote \nabout how ``glorious'' it was to see Earth from her position in space. \nMay her loved ones find peace as she watches over them now from the \nheavens above. The necessary investigations are underway to discover \nwhat went so terribly wrong on that bright Saturday morning in \nFebruary, just minutes before the crew's homecoming. May we fully \nascertain what went wrong to bring closure to the loved ones left \nbehind and avert another tragedy. Congress will need to continue strong \noversight and consider NASA's budgeting needs to ensure an effective, \nefficient, and safe space program.\n\n  It is sadly ironic to consider that for many Americans, these highly-\ntrained and dedicated astronauts would have remained to them anonymous \nif not for the tragedy that took their lives. Continuing and improving \nthe space program would be the best way to honor the legacy of the \nfallen Columbia crew. Consider the discoveries waiting to be made in \nmedicine, biology, physics, meteorology, and agro-sciences. Don't \ndiscount the advances already made in satellite communications and \nstrategic military defense systems thanks to space exploration.\n  Four decades ago, the first American astronauts launched us into \nspace. There is no turning back on destiny now.\n  Notwithstanding the loss of human life, I believe the Columbia crew, \nincluding Iowa-born Laurel Clark, would urge us to resume America's \nspace odyssey and get back to the future.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the seven heroes \nlost in the tragic explosion of the space shuttle Columbia on February \n1, 2003.\n  The seven members of the Columbia crew will be deeply missed by their \nfamilies, NASA, our entire country, and others following this historic \nmission.\n  Though I could recite an astonishing list of accomplishments for each \nof the seven astronauts, their most important contribution was the \nexample of bravery, courage, and excellence they set for men, women, \nand children across the land.\n  I am proud to say that one of these heroes, Air Force LTC Michael \nAnderson was a beloved son of the Spokane community and a cherished \nhero for men, women, and children in Washington. But Michael Anderson \nwas a hero long before the accepted the challenge of the Columbia \nmission.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Anderson knew he wanted to be an astronaut at the \nearly age of 3. This dream followed him to Washington, when he and his \nfamily\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\nmoved to the Spokane area at age 11 after his father was assigned to \nthe nearby Fairchild Air Force Base.\n  Throughout his early education in Spokane area public schools, \nAnderson remained focused on his goal of being an astronaut, becoming \nan exceptional science student, and overcoming all of the challenges \nfacing a young African-American man in this country.\n  He graduated from Cheney High School in Cheney, WA, in 1977 and \ncontinued his science education with a bachelor of science degree in \nphysics/astronomy from the University of Washington in 1981, when he \nwas also commissioned as a second lieutenant of the Air Force. Anderson \nlater completed a master of science degree in physics from Creighton \nUniversity in 1990.\n  After becoming an astronaut in 1994, Michael Anderson took to heart \nhis responsibility as a role model for children around the country and \nback home. After his 1998 flight on the space shuttle Endeavor to the \nMir Space Station, Anderson visited his alma mater, Cheney High School.\n  With a crowd of enthralled students listening on, Anderson told the \nstudents that they could do what he had done if they set goals and \nworked hard.\n  Anderson also left the students a reminder of his achievement, \nreturning a school pennant that he had taken to space with him on the \nmission. On display in the school's main entrance, this pennant, along \nwith a mission patch and small flag that also went into space, \ncontinues to serve as an inspiration to the school's students.\n  LTC Anderson is an amazing story of courage, achievement against many \nodds, and sacrifice for this country. He provided a demonstration of \nexcellence and offered a triumphant example of accomplishment for \nAmericans of all color, race, and background. He will be missed, but he \nwill never be forgotten.\n  The Washington family has also lost another friend in Navy CDR Willie \nMcCool, who made Anacortes, WA, his home during two terms of service at \nNaval Air Station Whidbey Island.\n  Commander McCool was not only well regarded during his time at \nWhidbey, but he continued his tie to the community after he left. \nCommunity members remember him for his kindness and professionalism and \nhis love of children; he often returned to Fidalgo Elementary School to \ndiscuss his work as an astronaut.\n  We lost a good friend in Commander McCool and also lost a piece of \nhome; he brought a bit of Anacortes with him on Columbia in the form of \na Douglas fir cone from the surrounding forest.\n  Though the loss of this crew is a sober reminder of the risks \ninvolved with human space flight, I join the President and many of my \nfellow Members of Congress in calling for the continued support of \nNASA's space shuttle program.\n  Critically, this support, together with a continued investigation of \nthis tragedy, must be focused on ensuring the safety of future space \nshuttle flights.\n  The space shuttle program remains a leading force in scientific \nresearch and in stimualting public interest in space exploration.\n  This leadership is exemplified by the numerous experiments conducted \nby the Columbia crew before the tragic re-entry, and the interest of \nscientists, schoolchildren, and people worldwide.\n  The space shuttle is also critical for the assembly and operation of \nthe International Space Station.\n  Importantly, the benefits of the experiments conducted on the space \nshuttle and the International Space Station extend beyond the \nscientific community to directly enhance the lives of individuals \nacross the globe, whether in finding cures to diseases or helping us \nunderstand the origin of the universe.\n  While the tremendous technical and scientific accomplishments of NASA \ndemonstrate vividly that humans can achieve previously inconceivable \nfeats, the exploration of space also humbles us by exhibiting the \nmiracle of this tiny ``blue marble'' in the cosmos and the wonder and \npreciousness of human life.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on January 16 the crew of STS-107 \nlaunched from Cape Canaveral, FL through the skies to space. They were \nsent on a mission to further space exploration and had the work of more \nthan 70 international scientists onboard. The Columbia crew of seven \nhad a research mission in the space, physical, and life sciences. After \na nearly flawless mission, the world witnessed their tragic death as \nthe Columbia Space shuttle shattered above the Earth upon its return on \nFebruary 1.\n  As is well known now, this crew, doing the work of international \nscientists, were quite international themselves. The diverse group of \nhuman researchers spanned the globe, hailing home to the United States, \nIndia, and Israel. Each country celebrated in their own way their \nnational heroes upon the launch of Columbia. But now, these countries \njoin together in sharing our sorrows with each other in the aftermath \nof such a heartbreaking tragedy.\n  These people each brought something special to the mission of NASA. \nCDR Rick Husband first dreamed of being an astronaut at the age of 4 \nand worked throughout his life to become an astronaut, fulfilling his \ndream in 1994 when he was selected by NASA. Pilot Willie McCool was the \nmost steady and dependable of men; his friends considered themselves \nblessed to know him. Payload CDR Michael Anderson always wanted to fly \nand along the way of achieving his goals, he became a role model for \nAfrican-American children across the United States. David Brown, \nmission specialist, probably most accurately said what we believe now, \nthat, ``This program will go on,'' no matter what happens. Kalpana \nChawla traveled an arduous path to becoming an astronaut and represents \nso well the diversity aboard the Columbia. Born in India, she moved to \nthe United States to fulfill her dream of reaching the stars. She has \nnow done that and more. Laurel Clark was a physician and a flight \nsurgeon who loved her work and her family. From aboard the shuttle \nLaurel said, ``Life continues in a lot of places and life is a magical \nthing.'' She could not have captured the feelings of so many any more \naccurately. Ilan Ramon, who brought so much attention and pride to this \nmission, was the first Israeli astronaut. The son of a Holocaust \nsurvivor, he brought with him aboard the shuttle a picture that a \nJewish boy had drawn before he died in the Holocaust.\n  The diversity of this crew so accurately represents the diversity in \nthe missions of NASA. Even through the cold war era and into today \naboard the International Space Station, NASA has been a leader in \ninternational relations. Taking giant steps for mankind, NASA often \ntimes set the example for the rest of the world to follow. It is in \nthat spirit that we sent the Columbia crew to do their work, and it is \nin that spirit that we will continue their work.\n  NASA has, from its inception, been charged with making the impossible \npossible. From the early days of the Mercury Program, through the \nadvancements in Gemini and the triumphant successes of Apollo, NASA has \ngiven us a sense of national pride. Yet we mustn't let our pride fool \nus into thinking that NASA's work is commonplace. Each time a shuttle \nlaunches and a mission is accomplished, it is a miraculous, humbling \nevent.\n\n  The mission of these seven astronauts did not end when the Columbia \nwent down. No. Their mission will go on. Space exploration is in our \nblood, a part of our national heritage. Manned space flight will \ncontinue, and these heroes would want it to. We will move on with space \nexploration and we will do so with pride, ensuring that these seven \nlives were not lost in vain.\n  America is strong. She is steadfast. And she is brave. God has called \nthese mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters, but we will not forget \nthem. We will never forget the inspiration they gave to so many hopeful \ncitizens on Earth. We must persevere and we must move on, for the honor \nof these seven fallen heroes.\n  As chairman of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee here \nin the Senate, I plan to take an active role in ensuring that the \ndreams of these seven astronauts are not forgotten. As NASA determines \nwhat went so terribly wrong, we will be diligent in doing everything we \ncan in the Congress to give NASA the support it needs to make sure we \npress forward with scientific advances, and that nothing like this \nhappens again.\n  Our next step will be to determine what the future of space \nexploration holds for Americans--what our goal is\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\nand how we get there. The tragedy that NASA is enduring will not \ndissuade or discourage America from venturing into space. Our \ncommitment to space exploration is firm.\n  For the families of the seven, I send my prayers. As Psalm 19 states, \n``The heavens declare the glory of God . . .''. The heavens are now \ndeclaring the glory of these seven heroes. There are seven more stars \nin the heavens tonight, and with each setting of the sun, the spirits \nof our seven heroes will shine brighter. Every time we look up into the \nstarry night, we can remember the lives of the seven cherished heroes \naboard the Space Shuttle Columbia and be proud, proud of their \ndedication, their diversity, and their dream.\n  I express my heartfelt sorrow and condolences to the families and \nfriends of these seven astronauts. I will never forget the sacrifices \nthey made in the name of exploration. May God bless them and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of Dr. \nLaurel Blair Salton Clark, one of the seven courageous astronauts \ntragically killed when the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated over \nTexas on Saturday, February 1.\n  Dr. Clark was born in 1961 in Ames, IA. She graduated in 1979 from \nRacine's William Horlick High School in Wisconsin. She received a \nbachelor's degree in zoology in 1983 and a doctorate in medicine in \n1987 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Dr. Clark joined the \nNavy, in part to finance her college education.\n  A flight surgeon trained as a Navy undersea medical officer, Dr. \nClark performed medical evacuations from submarines during assignment \nin Holy Loch, Scotland. She was assigned as a flight surgeon for a \nMarine Corps AV-8B Night Attack Harrier Squadron in Yuma, AZ, and for \nthe Naval Flight Officer Advanced Training Squadron in Pensacola, FL. \nIn April of 1996, Dr. Clark was selected by NASA, and she qualified for \nflight assignment as a mission specialist after completing 2 years of \ntraining and evaluation.\n  There were over 80 experiments conducted aboard Columbia, most \ndedicated to research investigating human physiology, fire suppression, \ndrug delivery techniques, and space communication technology. The \nresearch conducted during the 16-day mission was sponsored by NASA and \nthe European, Canadian, and German Space Agencies. Schools and \nuniversities around the world were involved in many of the experiments \nthe crew performed in Spacehab, a facility which offers scientists \naccess to microgravity aboard space shuttles.\n  Many have noted and applauded the diversity of the Columbia's crew, \nand Dr. Clark certainly hoped that the scientific experiments the crew \nconducted would benefit all mankind. In an e-mail sent to her family \nand friends on Friday, January 31, she spoke of feeling blessed to be \nrepresenting the United States and ``carrying out the research of \nscientists around the world.''\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Clark's 8-year-old son Ian and \nher husband Jonathan Clark. The loss of the space shuttle's crew is \ndevastating, and my hope is that we can identify the cause of the \nColumbia's breakup and prevent such tragedies in the future.\n  Dr. Laurel Clark told her loved ones of the Columbia mission, \n``magically, the very first day we flew over Lake Michigan and I saw \nWind Point clearly.'' Speaking on behalf of Wisconsin, we are honored \nthat she considered Racine her hometown. Today, we celebrate the brave \ncontributions Dr. Laurel Blair Salton Clark made during her life and \ncareer, and we honor her memory throughout the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr President, I rise to speak today on the Columbia \ntragedy. On Saturday, February 1, our Nation suffered a tragic loss. \nThe seven astronauts of the Space Shuttle Columbia gave their lives in \nservice of their country and all mankind. These brave men and women \ndisplayed a dedication to duty and scientific exploration that is an \ninspiration to all of us. India and Israel share in our shock and \ngrief. Israel lost a national hero, their nation's first astronaut, \nColonel Ilan Ramon. My thoughts and prayers are with all the families. \nThey should know that the United States Senate shares their sorrow and \nwill remember and honor the lives of their loved ones.\n  The best way to honor these seven brave men and women is to move \nforward with the space program. But first, there needs to be a \nthorough, rigorous and candid investigation of what went wrong. The \nissues confronting us are immediate and severe. Three American \nastronauts remain in space. The two investigative committees must \ngather the evidence, conduct their analysis and report to the Congress \nand to the American people with candor so the shuttle program can move \nforward in the safest way possible.\n  In my years as chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee, and now as \nits ranking member, shuttle safety has been my top priority. But, \nshuttle safety and astronaut safety have also been the priority of the \ncommittee--on a bipartisan basis. When I first joined the committee, \nSenator Jake Garn of Utah--himself a former astronaut--was my mentor. \nWe worked together using the findings of the Challenger and Augustine \nCommissions as blueprints for NASA's future. The Augustine report gave \nus guiding principles for a balanced space program. The Challenger \nreport told us what we needed to do on safety. Now, with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kit Bond, I share the same bipartisan spirit. We \nhave common goals and common values. He believes, as I do, that safety \nmust come first. Over the last few years, no matter which of us was \nchair and which was ranking, safety was the number one priority.\n  There has never been any question that we would fully fund the \nshuttle program and shuttle safety initiatives. Year after year, \nSenator Bond and I worked together to make sure everything that NASA \nasked for was put in the Federal checkbook. But, we went even farther \nthan that. For the last two years, while I was chair, I wrote into the \nreport language that NASA must make the safety of the shuttle program \nand the safety of our astronauts its highest priority. Last year, I \nsaid in the committee's report that NASA's budget must reflect its \nlong-term challenges. I asked for a detailed assessment of the agency's \nneeds and an accounting of what funding was needed.\n  The immediate need facing NASA is the Columbia investigation. This \nreport addresses an immediate problem for which there are immediate and \nsevere consequences. Then the long range issues must be addressed. What \ndoes NASA do about its aging infrastructure and aging workforce? How \nare we going to have a balanced 21st century space program that \nincludes human flight, space science and aeronautics?\n  To conclude, I salute the men and women of Texas and Louisiana. The \nlocal law enforcement, national guard, regular men and women who live \nin these small towns--everyone is pitching in to find fragments of the \nColumbia, to guard them, to make sure every piece gets to the NASA \ninvestigators. People are opening their homes to volunteers, cooking \nand delivering meals. Thank you for everything you are doing. You \nrepresent the best of the American spirit. Like we have seen after \nother tragedies--the rescue workers and volunteers at ground zero--in \nthe face of tragedy, America stands united.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this time to express my grief, as \nwell as the grief of all Mississippians, over the loss of the crew of \nthe Space Shuttle Columbia. Mississippians feel a strong bond to both \nthe space program and the crew of the Columbia. One reason for this \nbond is NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center. The Stennis Space Center, \nwhich is located in Hancock County, MS, tests every space shuttle's \nmain engine before it is installed for a launch. Also, the Stennis \nSpace Center's remote sensing experts are currently assisting NASA in \nlocating debris from the Columbia.\n  Another reason Mississippians feel closely connected to the Columbia \ntragedy is that Robert and Barbara Anderson, the parents of LTC Michael \nAnderson, were both born in Mississippi. While Mr. and Mrs. Anderson \nnow live in Spokane, WA, they still have family members who reside in \nMadison County, MS. While these ties to the space program and the crew \nof the Columbia provide Mississippians with a source of great honor and \npride, now that tragedy has struck, these ties make the loss of the \nseven Columbia astronauts that much more personal.\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\n  The loss of the Columbia crew was truly a national tragedy. While the \nUnited States has been blessed with many outstanding natural resources, \nno one will ever convince me that our most valuable resource is \nanything other than the outstanding individuals this country produces. \nOur NASA astronauts are outstanding individuals who represent the best \nof the best.\n  While I am sure that many here are familiar with the type of \noutstanding personal achievement that is required to become an \nastronaut, I would like to take a moment to give a brief synopsis of \nthe accomplishments of the seven crew members of the Columbia shuttle.\n  COL Rick Husband, commander. Rick Husband, 45, was a test pilot in \nthe U.S. Air Force. He received a bachelor of science degree in \nmechanical engineering from Texas Tech University in 1980 and a master \nof science degree in mechanical engineering from California State \nUniversity-Fresno in 1990. Husband had already completed a space \nmission as the pilot of STS-96 in 1999, on which the first docking with \nthe International Space Station was performed. Rick Husband leaves a \nwife and two children behind.\n  CDR William C. McCool, pilot. William C. McCool, 41, served as a \ncommander in the U.S. Navy and was also a former test pilot. In 1983, \nMcCool received a bachelor of science degree in applied science from \nthe U.S. Naval Academy, where he graduated second in his class. He \nlater received a master of science degree in computer science from the \nUniversity of Maryland in 1985 and a master of science degree in \naeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in \n1992. This was William McCool's first space flight. He leaves behind a \nwife and three children.\n  LTC Michael P. Anderson, payload commander. Michael Anderson, 43, was \na lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force, where he served as an \ninstructor pilot and tactical officer. Anderson received a bachelor of \nscience degree in physics/astronomy from University of Washington in \n1981 and a master of science degree in physics from Creighton \nUniversity in 1990. Selected by NASA in December of 1994, Anderson flew \non STS-89 in 1998 and has logged over 211 hours in space. Anderson \nleaves behind a wife and two daughters.\n  CAPT David M. Brown, mission specialist 1. David Brown, 46, was a \ncaptain in the U.S. Navy and served as a naval aviator and flight \nsurgeon. Brown received a bachelor of science degree in biology from \nthe College of William and Mary in 1978 and a doctorate in medicine \nfrom Eastern Virginia Medical School in 1982. This was Brown's first \nspace flight.\n  Dr. Kalpana Chawla, mission specialist 2. Kalpana Chawla was an \naerospace engineer and an FAA certified flight instructor. She received \na bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering from India's \nPunjab Engineering College in 1982, a master of science degree in \naerospace engineering from the University of Texas-Arlington in 1984, \nand a doctorate in aerospace engineering from the University of \nColorado-Boulder in 1988. Chawla was the prime robotic arm operator on \nSTS-87 in 1997 and had logged more than 376 hours in space prior to the \nColumbia flight. Chawla was the first Indian-born woman in space and \nleaves a husband behind.\n  CDR Laurel Blair Salton Clark, mission specialist 4. Laurel Clark, \n41, was a commander in the U.S. Navy and a naval flight surgeon. She \nreceived a bachelor of science degree in zoology from the University of \nWisconsin-Madison in 1983 and a doctorate in medicine from the same \nschool in 1987. The Columbia flight was Clark's first space flight. She \nleaves behind a husband and an 8-year-old son.\n  COL Ilan Ramon, payload specialist 1. Ilan Ramon, 48, was a colonel \nin the Israeli Air Force. Ramon received a bachelor of science degree \nin electronics and computer engineering from the University of Tel Aviv \nin 1987. He served as a fighter pilot during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s \nand was a veteran of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, as well as the 1982 \nwar in Lebanon. The Columbia flight was Ramon's first, and with it he \nbecame the first Israeli in space. He leaves behind a wife and four \nchildren.\n  As you can see, this group of individuals would stand out in any \ncompany, and it is right that the country should mourn their loss. And \nas the country mourns, it is especially important that we remember the \nfriends and family of the lost astronauts. If just their \naccomplishments and dedication to their countries can cause whole \nnations to mourn, I can only imagine the grief of those who knew them \npersonally and lost not only a national hero, but a friend, or spouse, \nor parent. I can only hope the knowledge that the thoughts and prayers \nof entire Nations are with them will provide some small comfort.\n  While our Nation grieves deeply for these men and women who have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice in the name of their countries, we take solace \nin the fact that we will benefit immeasurably for years to come from \ntheir dedication and hard work. The crew of the Columbia surely \nrepresented the best of this world. They entered space not just as \nmembers of one nationality, race, or religion, but as fellow human \nbeings. The crew members risked and ultimately sacrificed their lives, \nnot for personal gain, but for the advancement of science and the \nbetterment of humankind. It is for these reasons that I want to say \nthank you to COL Rick Husband, CDR William C. McCool, LTC Michael P. \nAnderson, CAPT David M. Brown, Dr. Kalpana Chawla, CDR Laurel Blair \nSalton Clark, COL Ilan Ramon, and all their friends and family who have \nshared in their sacrifice.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we are deeply saddened by Saturday's \nloss of seven astronauts as they returned from a 16-day voyage aboard \nthe space shuttle Columbia. The tragic loss of the crew of mission STS-\n107 touches not only all Americans, but also many members of our \nlarger, global community. As we honor the courageous men and women of \nthe Columbia and mourn their loss, our thoughts and prayers are with \ntheir families and loved ones.\n  The seven men and women aboard the Columbia were truly a select group \nof explorers. They represented the vast range and distinction of our \nnation's skills and achievements; all had extensive training in various \nfields of scientific inquiry. At the same time, they represented \nAmerica's finest aspirations. Diverse in their origins, they shared a \ndream of space travel, and they lived and worked together in a common \nspirit of cooperation, curiosity, and courage.\n  Michael Anderson, Columbia's payload commander, spoke for all the \ncrew when he said the following, in an interview appearing in the \nBaltimore Sun this past Sunday:\n\n       I take the risk because I think what we're doing is really \n     important. For me, it's the fact that what I'm doing can have \n     great consequences and great benefits for everyone, for \n     mankind.\n\n  Research was the primary mission of STS-107. The Columbia carried 32 \npayloads with material for 59 separate investigations. Among these \npayloads were student experiments from Australia, China, Israel, Japan, \nLiechtenstein, and the United States. State-of-the-art communications \nequipment allowed earthbound researchers and the global public to \nwitness experiments as they were being performed. To make the most of \ntheir 16 short days in space, the seven astronauts worked in two \nshifts, around the clock. We have suffered the grievous loss of our \nastronauts. But the astronauts completed much of their mission.\n  We can honor the crew of mission STS-107, Colonel Rick D. Husband, \nCommander William McCool, Lieutenant Colonel Michael P. Anderson, \nCaptain David M. Brown, Dr. Kalpana Chawla, Commander Laurel Blair \nSalton Clark, and Colonel Ilan Ramon, by rededicating ourselves anew to \nthe mission they so vigorously embraced. We must have a prompt and \nthorough account of the events that brought down the Columbia, but we \nmust not let our great sense of loss deter us from continuing their \nwork. For more than forty years, the space program has played a vital \nrole in our broader national research efforts. Our space explorations \nhave led to scores of new discoveries, which have given us not only \nbetter insights into the universe but also a better understanding of \nthe earth, and of life here on earth. We will remain forever grateful \nto the crew of the Columbia for the legacy they have left us, and the \nexample they set.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues and the\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\ncountry in remembering the seven brave crewmembers of the Space Shuttle \nColumbia who tragically lost their lives last Saturday morning, \nFebruary 1, 2003.\n  Rick Husband, William McCool, Michael Anderson, Kalpana Chawla, David \nM. Brown, Laurel Blair Salton Clark, and Ilan Ramon gave their lives \ntrying to expand our knowledge of science, advance our technology, and \nbroaden the limits of our universe.\n  These seven courageous astronauts sacrificed their lives for our \nfuture. While this is a time of great sadness, it is also a time to \ntake great pride in their achievements, their dedication, and their \nservice to the Nation and to the world.\n  They were seven different people with various skills, many talents, \nand different backgrounds, and they all came to work together as a \nteam. That is what most people believe America should be like: working \ntogether as a team to accomplish something greater than themselves. \nThey could have had very comfortable jobs somewhere else, but they \nchose to risk their lives for the country. They have not only found a \nplace in our hearts, but they have found a place in our imagination \nalso because, for me, they represent what this country is all about. \nThey came together. They came from modest circumstances. They used the \npower of education to prepare themselves not just for personal success \nbut to contribute to the Nation and to contribute to the world. They \nexemplify the best of this Nation.\n  They understood that great accomplishment and great achievement bring \ngreat risk. They knew this, yet they valiantly accepted, in the name of \nscience and exploration, all the risks. It is important we pay tribute \nto them and acknowledge the risks our astronauts take with every \nmission.\n  We tend to take these risks for granted and forget the extreme \nconditions and pressures these brave men and women face and will face \nin the future. In honor of the crew of Columbia, we must not take these \nrisks for granted any longer.\n  In their honor, we must pledge to continue the peaceful exploration \nof space. We have forged international partnerships. We have been able \nto share the pride of an international space station. We must continue \nto fund NASA, continue our space programs, and continue in the \ntradition of American and human accomplishment.\n  Later this year, we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the \nWright brothers' monumental 59-second flight on December 17, 1903. That \nflight forever changed the world. Fifty-four years later, we were able \nto put a man in space.\n  The process of innovation and exploration must go on, and America \nmust play its traditional significant, historic role.\n  We have in our process from the sands of Kitty Hawk to the stretches \nof the Moon experienced powerful joy and monumental success, and yet we \nhave faced tremendous setbacks and extreme sorrow. But we have \npersevered, and we have continued our missions into the heavens.\n  From our colleague John Glenn and Allan Shepherd to Neil Armstrong to \nan international space station, and from the crew of Challenger and the \ncrew of Columbia, we must continue to challenge ourselves as they \nchallenged themselves. We must continue to better ourselves as a nation \nand continue to grow.\n  President Kennedy challenged America to send a man to the Moon. We \nhave met that challenge and have gone far beyond.\n  As we continue with future missions, we must never forget these seven \nbrave souls. They gave the ultimate sacrifice for a noble cause. My \ndeepest condolences go out to their families and the Nation that mourns \nthem and the country of Israel that mourns its lost astronaut. This is \na time for mourning, but we must shortly move on and continue to run \nthe great risks they took, in their memory, so we can build upon their \nsacrifice, so we continue to reach for the heavens and beyond.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 5 minutes evenly divided.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to Senator Bennett from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, all that needs to be said has been said \nby the President and others about the shuttle disaster. I simply note \nthe people of Utah are particularly distressed, not only with the human \ntragedy that affects all Americans but because the space program is \nvery close to the hearts of all Utahans.\n  My predecessor in the Senate, Jake Garn, was an astronaut on the \nshuttle. The Jake Garn Space Center at Utah State University is named \nafter the Senator. The schoolchildren of Utah assembled project ``Star \nShine,'' which was a school science project that was carried into space \nby the shuttle. So all Utahans join in expressing our condolences to \nthe families, and our determination that space exploration by this \ncountry will nonetheless still go forward.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, Senator Nelson and I attended, along \nwith many other Senators, the beautiful service yesterday honoring \nthese brave astronauts that we now know so much more about. Today the \nSenate is commemorating these Columbia astronauts and reconfirming the \nimportance to our country that space research has been and will \ncontinue to be.\n  In the resolution we talk about U.S. Air Force COL Rick Husband, the \nmission commander, who was from Texas; U.S. Navy commander, William \nWillie McCool, the pilot; U.S. Air Force LTC Michael Anderson, payload \ncommander, mission specialist; U.S. Navy CAPT David Brown, mission \nspecialist; U.S. Navy commander Laurel Blair Salton Clark, mission \nspecialist; Dr. Kalpana Chawla, mission specialist; and Israeli Air \nForce COL Ilan Ramon, payload specialist. They were killed in the line \nof duty. The Senate is honoring them today.\n  Debris has been recovered in 38 counties of my State, spreading over \na surface area of 28,000 square miles, an area the size of West \nVirginia. The Space Shuttle Columbia broke up 40 miles above the \nground.\n  It is my honor to cosponsor this resolution with Senator Nelson, the \nonly Member of the Senate who has actually been on a manned space \nflight, and Senator Glenn, of course, before him. He has been a great \nresource on the committee.\n\n  Before turning it over to Senator Nelson of Florida, I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, how much time remains in the \ndebate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, it is with sadness that I \nrise to join my colleague from Texas to support this resolution. So \nmany of our colleagues have joined us. We thank you very much for \njoining us yesterday as we went to the space center in Houston.\n  This is a resolution that not only talks about the past, and about \nbravery, but it talks about the future. It talks not only about \nhonoring the legacy and the lives and the sacrifice of these brave \nsouls but also about fulfilling America's destiny as a nation of \nexplorers and adventurers.\n  This resolution is about the vision that ignites the heart of almost \nevery American, to think that we are pushing back the frontier. As we \ndeveloped\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\nthis country, we used to push westward. That was our frontier. Now we \npush upward and explore the heavens.\n  I urge our colleagues to join Senator Hutchison and me in supporting \nthis resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nFlorida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nMiller) would each vote Aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and proceed to the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. \nEstrada, of Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased that we have finally gotten \nto consider the nomination of Miguel Estrada to preside on the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which has \nbeen pending before the Senate since May 9, 2001. I strongly support \nthis nomination, and I hope we can vote on it soon. Also, I should say \nthat I truly hope that news reports are inaccurate about efforts by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to engage in a filibuster of \nthis nominee in an effort to deny him a vote by the full Senate. To \ndefeat this nominee in this manner would be unprecedented and a real \nshame for this body.\n  As many of us who are familiar with Mr. Estrada know, he represents a \ntrue American success story. His story can make us all proud to be \nmembers of this country, make us proud of our country. Born in \nTegucigalpa, Honduras, his parents divorced when he was only 4 years \nold. Mr. Estrada remained in Honduras with his father while his sister \nemigrated to the United States with his mother. Years later, as a \nteenager, Mr. Estrada joined his mother in the United States. Although \nhe had taken English classes during school in Honduras, he actually \nspoke very little English when he immigrated. He nevertheless taught \nhimself the language well enough to earn a B- in his first college \nEnglish course. In a matter of years, he not only perfected his English \nskills, but he exceeded the achievements of many persons for whom \nEnglish is their native tongue. He graduated magna cum laude and Phi \nBeta Kappa in 1983 from Columbia College, then magna cum laude in 1986 \nfrom Harvard Law School, where he was editor of the Harvard Law Review. \nThose are really difficult achievements.\n  Mr. Estrada's professional career has been marked by one success \nafter another. He clerked for Second Circuit Judge Amalya Kearse a \nCarter appointee--then Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. He worked \nas an associate at the law firm of Wachtell Lipton in New York City, \none of the great law firms of this country. He then worked as a Federal \nprosecutor in Manhattan, rising to become deputy chief of the appellate \ndivision. In recognition of his appellate skills, in spite of the fact \nthat he has a speech handicap, he was hired by the Solicitor General's \nOffice during the first Bush administration. He stayed with the \nSolicitor General's Office for most of the Clinton administration. When \nhe left that Office, he joined the Washington, DC, office of Gibson, \nDunn & Crutcher, where he has continued to excel as a partner. And \neverybody knows that the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher is one of \nthe great law firms of this country.\n  Most lawyers are held in high esteem if they have argued even one \ncase before the Supreme Court. Mr. Estrada has argued 15 cases before \nthe States Supreme Court. This is an impressive accomplishment by any \nstandard, but it is particularly remarkable when you take two \nadditional factors into consideration. First, as I have noted, English \nis not Mr. Estrada's native language. He has nevertheless mastered it \nto such a degree that he is considered to be one of the foremost \nappellate lawyers in our country. Second, his oral argument skills are \neven more extraordinary because, as I have mentioned, he has worked to \novercome a speech impediment.\n  Despite this disability, Mr. Estrada has risen to the top of the \nranks of oral advocates nationwide. People all over this country have \nadmiration for him.\n  The legal bar's wide regard for Mr. Estrada is reflected in his \nevaluation\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\nby the American Bar Association. The American Bar Association evaluates \njudicial nominees based on their professional qualifications, their \nintegrity, their professional competence, and their judicial \ntemperament. They do not have an official role in the confirmation \nprocess, but Senate Democrats did identify the group's evaluations last \nyear as the ``gold standard.''\n  They ask judges who have heard a nominee argue cases, lawyers on the \nother side of cases, and hundreds of lawyers with whom the nominee has \nworked. They also ask neighbors and friends and other critics, people \nwho have axes to grind. They really go into a lot of things, but mainly \nwith people in the profession.\n  Based on its exhaustive assessment of these factors, the ABA has \nbestowed upon Mr. Estrada its highest rating of unanimously well \nqualified. That is high praise indeed.\n  I have to say, as one who has been critical of the American Bar \nAssociation and their evaluation process in the past, in recent years I \nthink they have been doing an excellent job. We are gaining by the work \nthey are doing.\n  In the past I have seen them as a partisan organization that was not \nfair to Republican nominees, at least to some Republican nominees. But \nI don't find that bias any longer. I want to praise the American Bar \nAssociation for it.\n  I take the time to offer up this brief recitation of Mr. Estrada's \npersonal and professional history because I think it illustrates that \nhe is in fact far from some rightwing idealogue that some of the usual \nopposition groups have portrayed him to be. He clerked for Judge \nKearse, a Carter appointee; then Justice Kennedy, a moderate by any \nstandard. He joined the Solicitor General's office and stayed on \nthrough much of the Clinton administration. His supporters include a \nhost of well-respected Clinton administration lawyers, including Ron \nKlain, former Vice President Gore's chief of staff and a former staffer \non the Senate Judiciary Committee, a man we all respect; Robert Litt, \nhead of the criminal division in the Reno Justice Department or the \nClinton Justice Department; Randolph Moss, former assistant Attorney \nGeneral; and Seth Waxman, former Solicitor General in the Clinton \nadministration. All of these people are people we respect, we admire, \nall of them are Democrats, and all of them have been Democrat leaders, \nand all of them have had an awful lot of influence with the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate itself through the years.\n  Mr. Klain's letter to the committee in support of Mr. Estrada is \nparticularly insightful. He wrote:\n\n       Mr. Estrada will bring an independent streak to his \n     judging, that may serve to surprise those who nominated him--\n     and I think will give every litigant, from any point of view, \n     a fair chance to persuade Mr. Estrada of the rightness of his \n     or her case.\n\n  Another letter from more than a dozen of Mr. Estrada's former \ncolleagues at the Solicitor General's office states that:\n\n       . . . he is a person whose conduct is characterized by the \n     utmost integrity and scrupulous fairness, as befits a nominee \n     to the federal bench.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of these letters in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        O'Melveny & Myers LLP,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: When we talked recently, I told you \n     that I was supporting the nomination of Miguel Estrada to be \n     a Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit. Given that I did not have, at that time, a \n     chance to explain the basis for my position in depth, I \n     thought I might put my views in writing for your \n     consideration.\n       At the outset, let me be clear that I write this letter \n     with mixed emotions. Not mixed emotions about Miguel: if \n     President Bush is to fill this seat on the D.C. Circuit, I \n     believe Miguel is an outstanding candidate who merits \n     confirmation. Rather, I think it is unfortunate that this \n     vacancy exists at all due to the Senate's failure to confirm \n     two outstanding, and well-qualified candidates for this court \n     nominated by President Clinton. In this case, that unfairness \n     is particularly ironic, as I met both Elena Kagan--President \n     Clinton's nominee for this position--and Miguel Estrada--\n     President Bush's nominee--when we were all law students. The \n     federal judiciary would be better off if the Senate had \n     confirmed Professor Kagan last year--and then, with a \n     subsequent vacancy arising during the Bush administration, \n     Mr. Estrada were nominated and confirmed. But unfortunately, \n     that is not the way that things worked out.\n       That said, I would hope that Miguel Estrada would gain your \n     support for confirmation this year. I believe that Miguel is \n     a person of outstanding character, tremendous intellect, and \n     with a deep commitment to the faithful application of \n     precedent. I have known Miguel for 15 years, and have seen \n     him in a variety of contexts and circumstances. Though Miguel \n     is politically conservative, I support his confirmation for \n     three reasons that go beyond those factors that are obvious \n     on their face; i.e., three reasons that go beyond his \n     outstanding credentials, his intellect, and his incredible \n     record of achievement as a lawyer.\n       First, Miguel is a serious lawyer who takes the law very \n     seriously. Yes, Miguel has passionate views about legal \n     policy and can be a strong advocate in a debate. But I have \n     no doubt that, on the bench, Miguel will faithfully apply the \n     precedents of his court, and the Supreme Court, without \n     regard to his personal views or his political perspectives. \n     His belief in the rule of law, in a limited judiciary, and in \n     the separation of powers is too strong for him to act \n     otherwise. He will not be one of those ``conservatives'' who \n     gives speeches about judicial restraint, but then becomes an \n     unabashed judicial activist on the bench. He will do his job \n     as the law, the Constitution, and his duty requires. I do not \n     think we can ask more of a judge on an intermediate appellate \n     court.\n       Second, Miguel will rule justly toward all, without showing \n     favor to any group or individual. When I worked on the \n     Judiciary Committee staff, one of your colleagues once said \n     to me, ``Adversity in youth can affect potential judges one \n     of two ways: it can make them compassionate towards those in \n     need--feeling empathy for their plight--or it can make them \n     cold-hearted--feeling as if `I made it without help, so you \n     can, too.' '' Miguel is one of those individuals who falls \n     firmly in the first category: the challenges that he has \n     overcome in his life have made him genuinely compassionate, \n     genuinely concerned for others, and genuinely devoted to \n     helping those in need. In the political arena, Miguel favors \n     very different policies than you and I do to achieve these \n     ends. But his commitment to them is without question--and the \n     fact that he would bring this commitment with him to the \n     bench, in the dispensation of justice to all, is also without \n     question. Those without means or without advantage will get a \n     fair hearing from Miguel Estrada.\n       Third, Miguel will bring an independent streak to this \n     judging, that may serve to surprise those who have nominated \n     him--and I think will give every litigant, from any point of \n     view, a fair chance to persuade Miguel of the rightness of \n     his or her case. Make no mistake about it, Miguel is \n     conservative, and in cases where those sorts of labels \n     matter, is more likely to rule ``that way'' than the judges \n     nominated to the D.C. Circuit by President Clinton. Miguel \n     Estrada will not be ``the David Souter'' of the D.C. Circuit. \n     But I do think that Miguel will be more independent, more \n     open-minded, more likely to ``break ranks'' than other \n     potential nominees of this conservative President. Miguel is \n     a rigorous skeptic--and I have seen him be as skeptical about \n     conservative shibboleths as liberal ones. He will ask tough \n     questions of both sides, and give both sides a chance to win \n     him over. This powerful intellectual quality is not unhinged \n     from a compassion for people--rather, it is harnessed by \n     Miguel in service of that compassion. It is a quality that \n     will make Miguel a very fair judge.\n       In closing, I appreciate your consideration of this letter \n     and the views expressed here. I wish you the best in trying \n     to untangle the difficult mess that the confirmation process \n     has become. And I hope you will see fit to support Miguel \n     Estrada's confirmation when the Committee acts on that \n     nomination.\n       With best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ronald A. Klain,\n     O'Melveny & Myers LLP.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 19, 2002.\n     Re nomination of Miguel A. Estrada.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch: We are writing to \n     express our support for the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada \n     to be a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit. We served with Mr. Estrada in \n     the Office of the Solicitor General, and we know him to be a \n     person of exceptional intellect, integrity, and \n     professionalism who would make a superb Circuit Judge.\n       Miguel is a brilliant lawyer, with an extraordinary \n     capacity for articulate and incisive legal analysis and a \n     commanding knowledge of and appreciation for the law. \n     Moreover, he is a person whose conduct is characterized by \n     the utmost integrity and scrupulous fairness, as befits a \n     nominee to the federal bench. In addition, Miguel has a deep \n     and abiding love for his adopted country and\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\n     the principles for which it stands, and in particular for the \n     rule of law. We hold varying ideological views and \n     affiliations that range across the political spectrum, but we \n     are unanimous in our conviction that Miguel would be a fair \n     and honest judge who would decide cases in accordance with \n     the applicable legal principles and precedents, not on the \n     basis of personal preferences or political viewpoints.\n       We also know Miguel to be a delightful and charming \n     colleague, someone who can engage in open, honest, and \n     respectful discussion of legal issues with others, regardless \n     of their ideological perspectives. Based on our experience as \n     his colleagues in the Solicitor General's office, we are \n     confident that he possesses the temperament, character, and \n     qualities of fairness and respect necessary to be an \n     exemplary judge. In combination, Miguel's exceptional legal \n     ability and talent, his character and integrity, and his deep \n     and varied experiences as a public servant and in private \n     practice make him an excellent candidate for service on the \n     federal bench.\n       We hope this information will be of assistance to the \n     Committee in its consideration of Mr. Estrada's nomination. \n     He is superbly qualified to be a Circuit Judge for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, and we urge your favorable \n     consideration of his nomination.\n           Very truly yours,\n         Thomas G.

Mr. Estrada's supporters are not limited to prominent and \nwell-connected Democrats and Republicans. We heard during his \nconfirmation proceedings or hearings about Mr. Estrada's pro bono \nefforts before the Supreme Court to overturn the conviction of death \nrow inmate Tommy David Strickler. His cocounsel in that case, Barbara \nHartung, wrote the committee that Mr. Estrada:\n\n       . . . values highly the just and proper application of the \n     law. Mr. Estrada's respect for the Constitution and the law \n     may explain why he took on Mr. Strickler's case, which at the \n     bottom concerned the fundamental fairness of a capital trial \n     and death sentence. I should note that Mr. Estrada and I have \n     widely divergent political views and disagree strongly on \n     important issues. However, I am confident that Mr. Estrada \n     will be a distinguished, fair and honest member of the \n     federal appellate bench.\n\n  Again, that is high praise from Barbara Hartung.\n  Another letter in support of Mr. Estrada came from Leonard Joy, \nattorney in charge of the Legal Aid Society, Federal Defender Division \nin New York City, which is the community defender organization \nappointed to represent indigent defendants in Federal court at the \ntrial and appellate levels. Mr. Joy, who frequently represented \ndefendants whom Mr. Estrada prosecuted while he was an assistant U.S. \nAttorney, wrote that:\n\n       He clearly was one of the smartest attorneys in the office \n     which prides itself in attracting the best and the brightest. \n     Yet throughout he was eminently practical in the judgments he \n     made and he had a down-to-earth approach to his cases. I \n     found him to be a fair and straightforward prosecutor who did \n     not treat defendants unduly harshly.\n       It is fair to say that all lawyers in my office liked him. \n     Many of them are liberal in their politics and it is a credit \n     to Mr. Estrada that he was able to get along with people who \n     may have had different views than he.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The letters the committee has received from lawyers who \nknow Mr. Estrada both personally and professionally depict him as a \nbrilliant yet fair attorney who is willing to listen to both sides of \nan issue before making a decision. Inherent in this description is the \nnecessary conclusion that Mr. Estrada is not an idealogue but instead \nshows great respect for persons with divergent viewpoints. Indeed, as I \nnoted at the hearing, Mr. Estrada placed phone calls to my office to \nsupport the confirmation of two Clinton judicial nominees: Adalberto \nJose Jordan, who was confirmed to the Southern District of Florida, and \nElena Kagan, nominated for the DC circuit.\n  Beyond the letters of support we have received for Mr. Estrada, the \ncases he has taken on as an attorney illustrate his commitment to \nfollowing the law instead of imposing any political agenda. I know that \nthe issue of reproductive choice is one that is very important to many \nof my Democratic colleagues, although it is one on which we disagree. I \nam not sure how many of them saw the portion of the hearing when Mr. \nEstrada was asked about his work on the NOW--National Organization for \nWomen--case for the Clinton administration. Even if you assume that Mr. \nEstrada is pro-life as a matter of politics, which even I do not know, \nthat representation illustrates his ability to put aside his personal \nconvictions and follow the law as a good jurist has to do.\n  In addition, on the NOW web site there is an article by Vera Haller \nof Women's E-news. Although this article criticizes several of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees--unfairly, in my view--but that is a \ndifferent story--it applauds the selection of Mr. Estrada, noting that \n``[h]is presence on the list . . . was seen by some as a sign that \nPresident Bush hoped to avoid contentious confirmation battles in the \nSenate.''\n  I want to take a moment at the outset here to address a couple of \nissues that we are sure to hear more about as the discussion of Mr. \nEstrada's nomination progresses.\n  First, Mr. Estrada has been unfairly criticized by some for declining \nto answer questions at his hearing about whether particular Supreme \nCourt cases were correctly decided. Lloyd Cutler, who was White House \nCounsel to both President Carter and President Clinton, put it best \nwhen he testified before a Judiciary Committee subcommittee in 2001. He \nsaid, ``Candidates should decline to reply when efforts are made to \nfind out how they would decide a particular case.'' He further \nexplained, ``What is most important is the appointment of judges who \nare learned in the law, who are conscientious in their work ethic, and \nwho possess what lawyers describe as `judicial temperament.' '' Mr. \nEstrada's academic achievement, his professional accomplishments, and \nthe letters of support we have received from his colleague all indicate \nthat Mr. Estrada fits this description and deserves our vote of \nconfirmation.\n  Second, several opponents of Mr. Estrada have attempted to block his \nconfirmation by demanding that the Department of Justice release \ninternal memoranda he authored while he was an assistant to the \nSolicitor General in the Solicitor General's office. First, it is \nimportant to note that Mr. Estrada told the committee that he does not \nobject to the release of these documents. He is, rightfully, proud of \nhis legal work. But there is a larger institutional problem. What the \nopponents of Mr. Estrada, or those who are continuing to demand these \ndocuments, apparently ignore is the fact that all seven living former \nSolicitors General--four Democrats and three Republicans--oppose this \nrequest. Their letter to the committee explains that the open exchange \nof ideas upon which they relied as Solicitors General ``simply cannot \ntake place if attorneys have reason to fear that their private \nrecommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to public \ndisclosure.'' These seven former Solicitors General--four Democrats, \nthree Republicans--concluded that ``any attempt to intrude into the \nOffice's highly privileged deliberations would come at a cost of the \nSolicitor General's ability to defend vigorously the United States' \nlitigation interests--a cost that also would be borne by Congress \nitself.''\n  The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have also criticized \nattempts to obtain these memoranda--and they should. The seven former \nSolicitors General of the United States are right, and their wise \ncounsel should be followed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of the Solicitors General, as \nwell as the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post editorials, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\n\n\n\n                                   Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our concern about \n     your recent request that the Department of Justice turn over \n     ``appeal recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and \n     amicus recommendations'' that Miguel Estrada worked on while \n     in the Office of the Solicitor General.\n       As former heads of the Office of the Solicitor General--\n     under Presidents of both parties--we can attest to the vital \n     importance of candor and confidentiality in the Solicitor \n     General's decisionmaking process. The Solicitor General is \n     charged with the weighty responsibility of deciding whether \n     to appeal adverse decisions in cases where the United States \n     is a party, whether to seek Supreme Court review of adverse \n     appellate decisions, and whether to participate as amicus \n     curiae in other high-profile cases that implicate an \n     important federal interest. The Solicitor General has the \n     responsibility of representing the interests not just of the \n     Justice Department, nor just of the Executive Branch, but of \n     the entire federal government, including Congress.\n       It goes without saying that, when we made these and other \n     critical decisions, we relied on frank, honest, and thorough \n     advice from our staff attorneys, like Mr. Estrada. Our \n     decisionmaking process required the unbridled, open exchange \n     of ideas--an exchange that simply cannot take place if \n     attorneys have reason to fear that their private \n     recommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to \n     public disclosure. Attorneys inevitably will hesitate before \n     giving their honest, independent analysis if their opinions \n     are not safeguarded from future disclosure. High-level \n     decisionmaking requires candor, and candor in turn requires \n     confidentiality.\n       Any attempt to intrude into the Office's highly privileged \n     deliberations would come at the cost of the Solicitor \n     General's ability to defend vigorously the United States' \n     litigation interests--a cost that also would be borne by \n     Congress itself.\n       Although we profoundly respect the Senate's duty to \n     evaluate Mr. Estrada's fitness for the federal judiciary, we \n     do not think that the confidentiality and integrity of \n     internal deliberations should be sacrificed in the process.\n           Sincerely,\n       On behalf of: Seth P. Waxman, Walter Dellinger, Drew S. \n     Days, III, Kenneth W. Starr, Charles Fried, Robert H. Bork, \n     Archibald Cox.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 28, 2002]\n\n                             Not Fair Game\n\n       Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) \n     recently sought a series of internal Justice Department memos \n     in connection with the judicial nomination of Miguel Estrada. \n     Mr. Estrada, whom President Bush has named to the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, is a conservative who served as a \n     staff attorney in the Office of the Solicitor General, mostly \n     during the Clinton administration. Although his former \n     colleagues there generally speak highly of him, one, a man \n     named Paul Bender, has suggested publicly that Mr. Estrada's \n     conservatism would corrupt his judicial work. Apparently to \n     see if Mr. Estrada's paper trail within the office would \n     support this suggestion, Sen. Leahy has requested all of Mr. \n     Estrada's written recommendations to the office concerning \n     whether cases should be appealed and what positions the \n     government should take as a friend of the court. Such a \n     request for an attorney's work product would be unthinkable \n     if the work had been done for a private client. The legal \n     advice by a line attorney for the federal government is not \n     fair game either.\n       The desire to evaluate Mr. Estrada's performance is \n     understandable, and the problem of how to explore a nominee's \n     views is not trivial. Mr. Estrada has no significant record \n     of public statements or controversial writings, yet despite \n     scant evidence, liberal groups are convinced that he \n     threatens values they hold dear. Like most nominees, however, \n     Mr. Estrada likely will decline to discuss specific issues \n     that might come before him as a judge. So there is no good \n     way of exploring whether he would respect and apply precedent \n     faithfully or engage in judicial policymaking.\n       That said, there are plenty of bad ways, and few involve \n     greater institutional risk for the Justice Department than \n     letting appeals memos become fodder for wars about \n     nominations. Particularly in elite government offices such as \n     that of the solicitor general, lawyers need to be able to \n     speak freely without worrying that the positions they are \n     advocating today will be used against them if they ever get \n     nominated for some other position. Says Walter Dellinger, one \n     of President Clinton's solicitors general and one of Mr. \n     Estrada's bosses in the office: ``It would be very \n     destructive of all of the purposes served by the attorney-\n     client privilege to have attorneys in the solicitor general's \n     office looking over their shoulders when they write memos.'' \n     It is also needlessly destructive. A broad range of Clinton-\n     era Justice Department political appointees are perfectly \n     capable of describing Mr. Estrada's role at the solicitor \n     general's office.\n       On several occasions in recent years, Congress recklessly \n     has gone after work by line attorneys at the Justice \n     Department. Importing these excesses into the confirmation \n     process is a terrible idea. After a year of investigating, \n     liberal activists have not been able to find much on Mr. \n     Estrada, and the unfortunate result seems to be a fishing \n     expedition. But there's no logical end to it. Mr. Estrada \n     once clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, and it is perfectly \n     possible that he made comments in some of his memos there \n     that the Judiciary Committee might find interesting as well. \n     Why not ask for those? There are some ponds in which \n     activists--and Senators--should not fish.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 24, 2002]\n\n                           The Estrada Gambit\n\n       Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy keeps saying he's \n     assessing judicial nominees on the merits, with political \n     influence. So why does he keep getting caught with someone \n     else's fingerprints on his press releases?\n       The latest episode involves Miguel Estrada, nominated more \n     than a year ago by President Bush for the prestigious D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Estrada scares the legal briefs \n     off liberal lobbies because he's young, smart and \n     accomplished, having served in the Clinton Solicitor \n     General's office, and especially because he's a conservative \n     Hispanic. All of these things make him a potential candidate \n     to be elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court down the road.\n       Sooner or later even Mr. Leahy has to grant the nominee a \n     hearing, one would think. But maybe not, if he keeps taking \n     orders from Ralph Neas at People for the American Way. On \n     April 15, the Legal Times newspaper reported that a \n     ``leader'' of the anti-Estrada liberal coalition was \n     considering ``launching an effort to obtain internal memos \n     that Estrada wrote while at the SG's office, hoping they will \n     shed light on the nominee's personal views.''\n       Hmmm. Who could that leader be? Mr. Neas, perhaps, Whoever \n     it is, Mr. Leahy seems to be following orders, because a \n     month later, on May 15, Mr. Leahy sent a letter to Mr. \n     Estrada requesting the ``appeal recommendations, certiorari \n     recommendations, and amicus recommendations you worked on \n     while at the United States Department of Justice.''\n       It's important to understand how outrageous this request \n     is. Mr. Leahy is demanding pre-decision memorandums, the kind \n     of internal deliberations that are almost by definition \n     protected by executive privilege. No White House would \n     disclose them, and the Bush Administration has already turned \n     down a similar Senate request of memorandums in the case of \n     EPA nominee Jeffrey Holmstead, who once worked in the White \n     House counsel's office.\n       No legal fool, Mr. Leahy must understand this. So the \n     question is what is he really up to? The answer is almost \n     certainly one more attempt to delay giving Mr. Estrada a \n     hearing and vote. A simple exchange of letters from lawyers \n     can take weeks. And then if the White House turns Mr. Leahy \n     down, he can claim lack of cooperation and use that as an \n     excuse to delay still further.\n       Mr. Leahy is also playing star marionette to liberal \n     Hispanic groups, which on May 1 wrote to Mr. Leahy urging \n     that he delay the Estrada hearing until at least August in \n     order to ``allow sufficient time . . . to complete a thorough \n     and comprehensive review of the nominee's record.'' We guess \n     a year isn't adequate time and can only assume they need the \n     labor-intensive summer months to complete their \n     investigation. (Now there's a job for an intern.) On May 9, \n     the one-year anniversary of Mr. Estrada's nomination, Mr. \n     Leahy issued a statement justifying the delay in granting him \n     a hearing by pointing to the Hispanic groups' letter.\n       These groups, by the way, deserve some greater exposure. \n     They include the Mexican American Legal Defense and \n     Educational Fund as well as La Raza, two lobbies that claim \n     to represent the interests of Hispanics. Apparently they now \n     believe their job is to help white liberals dig up dirt on a \n     distinguished jurist who could be the first Hispanic on the \n     U.S. Supreme Court.\n       The frustration among liberals in not being able to dig up \n     anything on Mr. Estrada is obvious. Nan Aron, president of \n     the Alliance for Justice, told Legal Times that ``There is a \n     dearth of information about Estrada's record, which places a \n     responsibility on the part of Senators to develop a record at \n     his hearing. There is much that he has done that is not \n     apparent.'' Translation: We can't beat him yet.\n       Anywhere but Washington, Mr. Estrada would be considered a \n     splendid nominee. The American Bar Association, whose \n     recommendation Mr. Leahy once called the ``gold standard by \n     which judicial candidates have been judged,'' awarded Mr. \n     Estrada its highest rating of unanimously well-qualified. \n     There are even Democrats, such as Gore adviser Ron Klahin, \n     who are as effusive as Republicans in singing the candidate's \n     praises.\n       When Mr. Estrada worked in the Clinton-era Solicitor \n     General's office, he wrote a friend-of-the-court brief in \n     support of the National Organization of Women's position that \n     anti-abortion protesters violated RICO. It's hard to paint a \n     lawyer who's worked for Bill Clinton and supported NOW as a \n     right-wing fanatic.\n       We report all of this because it reveals just how poison \n     judicial politics have become, and how the Senate is \n     perverting its advise and consent power. Yesterday the \n     Judiciary\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\n     Committee finally confirmed a Bush nominee, but only after \n     Republican Arlen Specter went to extraordinary lengths to \n     help fellow Pennsylvanian Brooks Smith.\n       Mr. Estrada doesn't have such a patron, so he's fated to \n     endure the delay and document-fishing of liberal interests \n     and the Senate chairman who takes their dictation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 11, 2002]\n\n                          No Judicial Fishing\n\n       Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy has just received \n     the answer to his outrageous request for the private decision \n     memos written by judicial nominee Miguel Estrada: No fishing \n     now, or ever.\n       Last month Mr. Leahy followed orders from liberal interest \n     groups (as reported in Legal Times) to ask the Department of \n     Justice for all of the appeal recommendations, certiorari \n     recommendations and amicus recommendations that Mr. Estrada \n     worked on while at the Clinton-era Solicitor General's \n     office.\n       Internal deliberations are highly confidential documents, \n     protected by executive privilege. No White House would \n     disclose them, and sure enough, the Bush Administration has \n     now quickly refused to do so. Assistant Attorney General \n     Daniel Bryant wrote Mr. Leahy last week that future Assistant \n     Solicitors General would be ``chilled'' from providing ``the \n     candid and independent analysis that is essential to high-\n     level decision-making.''\n       The Justice Department ``cannot function properly if our \n     attorneys write these kinds of documents with one eye focused \n     on the effect that their words, if made public, might have on \n     their qualifications for future office,'' he added.\n       This is no surprise to anyone, certainly not to Mr. Leahy \n     and his liberal minders. Their goal here is delay, trying to \n     put off the day when Mr. Estrada takes a seat on the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, from which President Bush could \n     promote him to become the first Hispanic-American on the U.S. \n     Supreme Court. Mr. Estrada was nominated 13 months ago and \n     hasn't even had a hearing yet.\n       In the meantime, the D.C. Circuit, like the federal \n     judiciary overall, faces a severe vacancy crisis; four of its \n     12 seats are vacant. Mr. Leahy's ideological petulance grows \n     more costly by the day.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, let me say this to colleagues who insist \nupon seeking internal memoranda Mr. Estrada wrote during his tenure at \nthe SG's office. During the last Congress, the Senate confirmed \nJonathan Adelstein, whom I fully support, to an important position on \nthe FCC. Mr. Adelstein is a former aide to the distinguished minority \nleader, but the Republicans did not demand all of Mr. Adelstein's \nmemoranda to Senator Daschle on telecommunications issues before \nconfirming him. This is despite the fact that such memoranda probably \ncould have been useful in determining how Mr. Adelstein would have \napproached his decisions as a commissioner. The reason we did not seek \nthem was because of the obvious: To do so would have intruded into the \ndeliberative relationship between Mr. Adelstein and Senator Daschle. \nThis would have been an inappropriate intrusion, as all of the \nSolicitors General, including President Clinton's Solicitors, have \nwarned of the Judiciary Committee's request, regardless of how valuable \nthe memoranda would have been in deciding whether to support Mr. \nAdelstein.\n  Along the same lines, I must note the American public would probably \nfind insightful the internal memoranda written to any of my colleagues \nin the Senate by their staff. How would we feel about that? Do we think \nwe would get the most candid advice if our top counsel knew their \nprivate advice is not really private? Let's get real here.\n  These misguided efforts should not prevent our confirmation of a \nhighly qualified nominee who has pledged to be fair and impartial, and \nto uphold the law regardless of his personal convictions. I have no \ndoubt Mr. Estrada will be one of the most brilliant Federal appellate \njudges of our time. This is a picture of Miguel Estrada, who was found \nby the American Bar Association--unanimously--well qualified, the \nhighest rating given to any judicial nominee. I have no doubt Mr. \nEstrada will be one of the most brilliant Federal appellate judges of \nour time, and I urge every Member of this body to join me in voting to \nconfirm him.\n  Madam President, let me say just a few more things about the \nsignificance of this nomination. There have been many people who have \nbeen waiting for the confirmation vote on this nominee, and many more \npeople who are watching today for the first time as we display our \nAmerican institutions and the value we give to the independence of our \njudiciary.\n  It was no small matter that at our hearing for Mr. Estrada, we had in \nthe audience the Honorable Mario Canahuati, the Ambassador of Honduras \nto the United States. The Honduran community in this country, though \ncentered in Louisiana, is scattered throughout the U.S., from North \nCarolina to New York to California.\n  We welcomed also to our hearing the leaders of the many Hispanic \ncommunities and organizations in the U.S. who came to express support \nfor this nomination.\n  In this context, I want to make a general comment on judicial \nconfirmations. For over a year, we have had a very troubling debate \nover issues that we thought our Founding Fathers had settled long ago \nwith our Constitution. I have been heartened to read the scores of \neditorials all across this country that have addressed the notion of \ninjecting ideology into the judicial confirmation process, because this \nnotion has been near universally rejected--except, of course, for a \nhandful of well paid, special interest liberal lobbyists in Washington, \nand a few other diehards.\n  It seems to me the only way to make sense of the advise and consent \nrole our Constitution's Framers envisioned for the Senate is to begin \nwith the assumption that the President's constitutional power to \nnominate should be given a fair amount of deference, and that we should \ndefeat nominees only where problems of character, qualifications, or \ninability to follow the law are evident.\n\n  As Alexander Hamilton recorded for us, the Senate's task of advise \nand consent is to advise and to query on the judiciousness and \ncharacter of nominees, not to challenge, by our naked power, the \npeople's will in electing who shall nominate.\n  To do otherwise, it seems to me, is to risk making the Federal courts \nan extension of this political body. This would threaten one of the \ncornerstones of this country's unique success--an independent \njudiciary. Let me say this again. Such political efforts would threaten \none of the cornerstones of this country's unique success--an \nindependent judiciary.\n  Let's not take my advice here, let's listen to Presidents Carter and \nClinton's White House counsel, Lloyd Cutler, a person, though we \ndisagree on many issues, for whom I have the highest regard and always \nhave. He is a terrific human being and a wonderful lawyer, one of the \nbest who has ever served his country.\n  Moreover, these are not just my views, this is our Anglo-American \njudicial tradition. It is reflected in everything that marks a good \njudge, not the least of which is Canon 5 of the Code of Judicial \nConduct of the American Bar Association that expressly forbids nominees \nto judicial duty from making ``pledges or promises of conduct in office \n[or] statements that commit or appear to commit the nominee with \nrespect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come \nbefore the courts.''\n  I should expect no Senator would invite a nominee to breach this code \nof ethics, and it worries me that we are coming close, and that we now \nappear to complain that a nominee does not breach the code when we ask \nhim to. I can honestly say I fear that we are getting to or crossing \nover dangerous lines here I have not witnessed in my 27 years in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  As I have indicated by reciting his stellar record, Miguel Estrada's \nnomination is before us today because it deserves to be here under any \nstandard that any disinterested person could devise. He is qualified \nfor the position for which President Bush has nominated him. I know it, \nand after our debate, I think the American people will know it as well.\n  But notwithstanding all of Mr. Estrada's hard work and unanimous \nrating of highly qualified by the ABA, he has been subjected, so far, \nto a pinata confirmation process with which we have all become very \nfamiliar. The extreme left-wing Washington groups go after judicial \nnominees like kids after a pinata. And it is not specific to Mr. \nEstrada. They beat it and they beat it until something comes out that \nthey can then chew and distort.\n  In the case of Mr. Estrada, the ritual has been slightly different. \nThey have been unable to find anything they can chew on and spit out to \nus, so they now\n\n[[Page S1933]]\n\nsay that we simply do not know enough about Mr. Estrada to confirm him. \nAnd that is after more than 640 days of delay.\n  Well, it is not that we do not know enough. We had a full-day \nhearing, conducted by Senator Schumer. It was a full hearing. I commend \nhim for conducting and allowing all Senators the opportunity to ask any \nand all questions they wished to ask. I believe that was last \nSeptember. Mr. Estrada's nomination has been pending before us for \nalmost 2 years. We know as much about Mr. Estrada as we have known \nabout any nominee. Their complaint is that we know all there is and the \nusual characters haven't found anything to distort.\n  But surely we should not expect to hear it suggested today that Mr. \nEstrada doesn't have enough judicial experience. Only 3 of the 18 \njudges appointed to the DC circuit by Democrats since President Carter \nhad any prior judicial experience before their nominations.\n  These include Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Abner Mikva to select two. \nLikewise, judicial luminaries such as Louis Brandeis and Byron White \nhad no judicial experience before being nominated to the Supreme Court. \nAnd Thurgood Marshall, the first African American on the Supreme Court, \nhad no judicial experience before he was nominated to the Second \nCircuit. I could go on and on.\n  I wish to address another aspect of Mr. Estrada's background. I know \nMiguel Estrada and I know how proud he is, in ways that he is unable to \nexpress, about being the first Hispanic nominated to the D.C. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. So I will express it. This nomination is a matter of \npride for him for the same reason that it is for any of us, not just \nbecause Mr. Estrada is a symbol for Latinos in America, but because \nMiguel Estrada's story is the best example of the American dream of all \nimmigrants. He and I are proud because we love this great country and \nthe future it continues to promise to young immigrants. Miguel \nEstrada's success can make each of us love this country all the more.\n  In fact, I have never seen any Hispanic nominee whose nomination has \nso resonated with the Latino community, except for the partisans--the \npartisan Democrats.\n  As I said earlier, Miguel Estrada was born in Honduras. He was so \nbright at an early age that he was enrolled at a Jesuit school at the \nage of 5. He was raised in a middle-class family. At age 17, he came to \nlive with his mother who had immigrated to New York, knowing very \nlittle English. Today he sits before the Senate of the United States \nwaiting to be confirmed to one of the greatest courts in the land.\n  I am embarrassed, therefore, by the new lows that some have gone to \nattack Mr. Estrada. Detractors have suggested that because he has been \nsuccessful and has had the privilege of a fine education, he is somehow \nless than a fullblooded Hispanic. This is the most embarrassing tactic \nused against this nominee. I wonder if we would tolerate saying of a \nwoman nominee that because of this or that, she is not really a woman, \nor of a male nominee that because he is this or that, he is not fully a \nman. We would not tolerate that here, and I do not think we should \ntolerate it in the case of Miguel Estrada.\n  Even more offensive, it seems to me, are the code words that some of \nhis detractors use about him--code words which perpetuate terrible \nstereotypes about Latinos--used in effect to diminish Miguel Estrada's \ngreat accomplishment and the respect he has from colleagues of all \npolitical persuasions.\n  As chairman and founder 13 years ago of the nonpartisan Republican \nHispanic Task Force which, despite the name, is made up of both \nRepublicans and Democrats--I have tried to achieve greater inclusion of \nHispanics in the Federal Government. I have worked hard to do that. I \nlove the Hispanic people. They know it.\n  I am concerned by the obstacles they face. I fear that some Democrats \nare creating a new intellectual glass ceiling for Hispanics. If they do \nnot think a certain liberal way that they do, then they are not good \nenough for upward mobility and advancement.\n  Let me say that again. If they do not think a certain liberal way \nthat they do, then they are not good enough for upward mobility and \nadvancement. That is wrong, and this body should not perpetuate that.\n  Many liberals in this town fear that there could be role models for \nHispanics that might be moderate to conservative--despite the fact that \npolls show that the great majority of Hispanics are conservative. But \nsurely, the advancement of an entire people should not be dependent on \none party being in power.\n  This past year I met with a number of leaders of Hispanic \norganizations from all across the country. I asked them what they think \nabout the subtle prejudices that Mr. Estrada is facing and they agree. \nPerhaps, they are more offended than I could ever be, but I doubt it.\n  The best expression of this outrage was shown just last week by \nCongressman Herman Badillo in an article in the Wall Street Journal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 30, 2003]\n\n                            Que Pasa, Chuck?\n\n                          (By Herman Badillo)\n\n       New York.--Nothing makes Democrats more frenzied than when \n     a Hispanic or African-American goes off the reservation. \n     Witness now the opposition that the Puerto Rican Legal \n     Defense Fund and the usual Washington special interests are \n     giving Miguel Estrada, the young Honduran immigrant-turned-\n     New Yorker that President Bush has nominated to the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Congressional Democrats have gone so far as to say that Mr. \n     Estrada is a Hispanic ``in name only.''\n       But if their behavior is outrageous it is also par for the \n     course. Half of the Democrats' energy lately seems focused on \n     corraling the nation's two largest minority groups into an \n     intellectual ghetto. The vitriol we saw most famously \n     directed at Clarence Thomas, and more recently at Condoleezza \n     Rice, demands that blacks and Hispanics toe a political line \n     to have their success acknowledged by their own community.\n       When confirmed by the Senate, Miguel Estrada, a brilliant \n     lawyer with extraordinary credentials, will be the first \n     Hispanic on the second most prestigious court in the land. He \n     will be a role model not just for Hispanics, but for all \n     immigrants and their children. His is the great American \n     success story.\n       But his confirmation by the Senate will come no thanks to \n     Chuck Schumer, his home-state senator. Mr. Schumer has thrown \n     every old booby-trap in Mr., Estrada's way, and invented a \n     few new ones just for him. When the Senate held a hearing for \n     Mr. Estrada last year, Mr. Estrada's mother told Mr. Schumer \n     that she had voted for him and hoped that he would return the \n     favor. He hasn't yet.\n       It is hard to blame Democrats of course. They know how \n     their bread is buttered and by whom--the monied special \n     interest groups that have made a profitable business of \n     opposing the nominations of President Bush. The Hispanic \n     groups that shun Mr. Estrada, including the Congressional \n     Hispanic Caucus, which announced its opposition to his \n     nomination last September, are a different matter. They \n     should be ashamed of themselves.\n       Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who heads both the Senate \n     Judiciary and the Senate Republican Hispanic Task Force, put \n     it well when he said that these liberal Hispanic groups \n     ``have sold out the aspirations of their people just to sit \n     around schmoozing with the Washington power elite.''\n       Mr. Schumer's one-man campaign against Mr. Estrada has \n     grown tiresome too. Despite the rebuke of every living U.S. \n     solicitor general of both parties dating back four decades, \n     Mr. Schumer continues to make irresponsible demands, never \n     made before for a non-Hispanic nominee, and insists on making \n     backhanded and unfounded insinuations about Mr. Estrada's \n     career and temperament. This treatment of Mr. Estrada is \n     demeaning and unfair, not only to the nominee but also to the \n     confirmation process and the integrity of the Senate.\n       Mr. Schumer's petulance ignores Mr. Estrada's \n     qualifications, intellect, judgment, bipartisan support, and \n     that he received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating--the \n     highest possible rating--from the American Bar Association. \n     The liberal Hispanic groups that challenge Mr. Estrada's \n     personal identity as a Hispanic ignore his support by non-\n     partisan Hispanic organizations, such as the Hispanic \n     National Bar Association, the League of United Latin American \n     Citizens, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n       Mr. Schumer and his colleagues are fond of speaking about \n     the need for ``diversity'' on the courts. Apparently that \n     talk does not extend to President Bush's nominees, since the \n     confirmation of Mr. Estrada would provide just such diversity \n     on this important court. It is past time that Mr. Schumer put \n     an end to his embarrassing grandstanding on Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination.\n       One would think that a New York senator would know that, \n     whether Puerto Rican, Dominican or Honduran, Hispanics are \n     most\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\n     united in one thing--the pride we take in our advancement as \n     Americans regardless of where we started. One suspects that \n     Mr. Schumer may learn this lesson yet, and that Miguel \n     Estrada's name is one that Charles Schumer will hear repeated \n     when he runs for re-election all too soon.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. Badillo served four terms as a Democrat in the House \nof Representatives, as Deputy Mayor of New York City under Mayor Koch, \nas Bronx President and as Board Chairman of the City University of New \nYork. He is the best known Hispanic public leader in New York State \nwith five decades of public service to show for his efforts.\n  Mr. Badillo had this to say about how Mr. Estrada has been treated:\n\n       [It is] demeaning and unfair, not only to the nominee but \n     also to the confirmation process and the integrity of the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. Badillo notes that Mr. Estrada has had demands placed on him \n``never made before for a non-Hispanic nominee.''\n  The Hispanic experience, in fact, sheds new light on the debate we \nhave been having about ideology in judicial confirmations. Many new \nHispanic Americans have left countries without independent judiciaries, \nand they are all too familiar with countries with political parties \nthat claim cradle-to-grave rights over their allegiances and futures.\n  I have a special affinity for Hispanics and for the potential of the \nLatin culture in influencing the future of this country. Polls show \nthat Latinos are among the hardest working Americans. That is because \nlike many immigrant cultures in this country, Hispanics often have two \nand even three jobs. Surveys show they have strong family values and a \nreal attachment to their faith traditions and they value education as \nthe vehicle to success for their children.\n  In short, Hispanics have reinvigorated the American dream, and I \nexpect they will bring new understandings of our nationhood, that some \nof us some of us, Madam President--might not fully see with tired eyes.\n  Without trumpeting the overused word ``diversity,'' I have made it my \nbusiness to support the nominations of talented Hispanics for my entire \ncareer in the Senate. I hope that the desire for diversity that many of \nmy Democrat colleagues say they share with me will trump the reckless \nand destructive pursuit of injecting ideology into the judicial \nconfirmations process as we move forward on this particular nomination.\n  In Spanish-speaking churches all over this country and in every \ndenomination, Hispanics sing a song called DE COLORES. This means OF \nMANY COLORS. It celebrates the many colors in which we all are created.\n  Hispanics know they come in many colors, with all kinds of \nbackgrounds. They enjoy among themselves a wide diversity already. They \nleft behind countries filled with ideologues that would chain them to \nsingle political parties. Latinos share a commonsense appreciation of \neach other's achievements in this country without any regard whatsoever \nto ideology, over which some Americans have the luxury of obsessing.\n  Congressman Herman Badillo said it well--in fact, he said it \nbeautifully:\n\n       [W]hether Puerto Rican, Dominican or Honduran, Hispanics \n     are most united in one thing the pride we take in our \n     advancement as Americans regardless of where we started.\n\n  In fact, that is true for all of us.\n  It seems to me that any political party's attempt to control a group \nand to bar independent thought and belief, in effect to disallow \ndiversity of thought within the Hispanic community, is simply wrong and \nno people should stand for that. That is what I have come to call and \ndeplore as the ``intellectual glass ceiling.''\n  I have news for those engaging in this: Hispanic Americans--like all \nAmericans--have liberals and conservatives. No one should be so \narrogant as to demand that a whole community should think as they do. \nPeople who are demanding that all Hispanics should fit into one mold \nought to be ashamed of themselves. They have sold out the aspirations \nof their people just to sit around schmoozing with Washington's liberal \npower elite.\n  Let's be clear, these liberal groups are only two or three in number, \nand they are basically surrogates for the Democrat Party. They are \nmarginalized given the large number of Hispanic organizations that have \ncome out in support of Mr. Estrada. I should note that Mr. Estrada's \nsupporters include LULAC, the League of United Latin American \nCitizens,--the largest and oldest Latino organization in this country.\n  Like President Bush--I have the same feelings--I think it is high \ntime that a talented lawyer of Hispanic descent sits on the second most \nprestigious court in the land. Miguel Estrada is that man.\n  I wish to address one last thing. I noticed that the very liberal \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense Fund issued a report just last spring, \narguing that there were too few Hispanics on the bench and challenging \nthe Bush administration to nominate more.\n  I noticed, however, that they never mentioned Miguel Estrada's \nnomination. In fact, though they address all the other federal circuit \ncourts, the DC Circuit Court for which Mr. Estrada is nominated is \noddly missing from their analysis arguing for more Hispanic \nnominations.\n  In this respect, I want to commend President Bush. He has already \nsent us 9 since he began, and we expect by the end of this week to have \naltogether 12 well-qualified Hispanic nominees. At this rate, if he has \n8 years to serve, President Bush will have nominated close to 40 \nHispanic-American judges. This will be more than any other President \nbefore him, Democrat or Republican. Already, as this chart indicates, \nPresident Bush has a greater percentage of Hispanic nominations than \nany President before him.\n  Nevertheless, I too am concerned about the few Hispanic judges we \nhave, especially given that Hispanics are now the largest minority \ngroup in America. And I am concerned by the obstacles they face. \nCongressman Badillo, himself a former Democrat, describes it this way: \n``Nothing'' he says, makes some people ``more frenzied than when \nHispanics and African Americans go off the reservation.'' I hope that \nhe is not talking about any Senators here.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \neditorial by The Washington Post that expresses their support for Mr. \nEstrada.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 29, 2002]\n\n                           Exploiting Estrada\n\n       It is hard to image a worse parody of a judicial \n     confirmation process than the unfolding drama of Miguel \n     Estrada's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     D.C. Circuit. Opponents of Mr. Estrada, a well-regarded \n     appellate lawyer who served a stint in the solicitor \n     general's office, are convinced that the young, conservative \n     Hispanic represents a grave threat to the republic. Yet Mr. \n     Estrada has not done his foes the courtesy of leaving a \n     lengthy paper trail of contentious statements. And this \n     creates something of a problem for those bent on keeping him \n     off the bench: There is no sound basis on which to oppose \n     him. Mr. Estrada's other problem is that the White House does \n     not merely want credit for appointing a first-rate lawyer to \n     an important court but wants to use Mr. Estrada, who had a \n     hearing last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, to \n     curry favor with Hispanic voters. As a result, Mr. Estradas' \n     nomination has been turned into a political slugfest and \n     discussed in the crudest of ethnic terms.\n       On one side of this degrading spectacle, Mr. Estrada's \n     opponents question whether he is Hispanic enough, whether a \n     middle-class Honduran immigrant who came to the Untied States \n     to go to college can represent the concerns of ``real'' \n     Latinos. The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, \n     for example, complains that his ``life experiences [have not] \n     resembled .  .  . those of Latinos who have experienced \n     discrimination or struggled with poverty, indifference, or \n     unfairness.'' Such distasteful ethnic loyalty tests have no \n     place in the discussion. Yet on the other side, Republicans \n     have reduced Mr. Estrada to a kind of Horatio Alger story. \n     White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, in an article on the \n     opposite page on Thursday, described him as ``an inspiration \n     to Hispanics and to all Americans.'' But Mr. Estrada has not \n     been nominated to the post of inspiration but that of judge. \n     Both sides should remember that there is no Hispanic manner \n     of deciding cases.\n       Lost in all of this is a highly qualified lawyer named \n     Miguel Estrada. Democrats have suggested opposing him because \n     of general concerns about the partisan ``balance'' on the \n     D.C. Circuit or because they don't know enough about his \n     views to trust him. They also continue to fish for dirt on \n     him. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-NY.) grilled him at his \n     hearing about questions that have been raised anonymously \n     concerning his aid to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy in picking \n     clerks. And Democrats are still pushing to\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\n     see confidential memos Mr. Estrada wrote in the solicitor \n     general's office and trumpeting criticism of him by a single \n     supervisor in that office--criticism that has been \n     discredited by that same colleague's written evaluations.\n       Seeking Mr. Estrada's work product as a government lawyer \n     is beyond any reasonable inquiry into what sort of judge he \n     would be. Nor is it fair to reject someone as a judge because \n     that person's decision to practice law, rather than write \n     articles or engage in politics, makes his views more opaque. \n     And its is terribly wrong to demand that Mr. Estrada answer \n     charges to which nobody is willing to attach his or her name.\n       Democrats have a legitimate grievance concerning the D.C. \n     Circuit: Two excellent nominees of the previous \n     administration were never acted upon by Senate Republicans. \n     The White House is wrong to ignore this issue and does so at \n     its peril. But the answer is not attacks on high-quality Bush \n     administration nominees such as Mr. Estrada. At the end of \n     the day, Mr. Estrada must be considered on his merits. His \n     confirmation is an easy call.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. As one editorial puts it, his nomination is ``an easy \ncall.''\n  The Post was right to point out that we who support Miguel Estrada \nshould not do so simply because he is a Hispanic. As the Post points \nout there is no particularly ``Hispanic manner of deciding cases.'' \nThey reject the diversity argument.\n  I agree, and as I indicated Mr. Estrada has an exemplary record as a \nmagna cum laude of both Columbia University and Harvard Law School \ngraduate, and his extraordinary record of public service, including 15 \ncases argued before the Supreme Court. This record has not been met by \nmany of the nominees of either party over the 27 years I have been \nhere.\n  In addressing why he was before us at his hearing I did not say \nanything about confirming Miguel Estrada because he is Hispanic. I did \nnot have to make that argument because, as The Post points out, his \nrecord makes his confirmation ``an easy call.''\n  But this fact should not diminish the pride, that I have addressed, \nthat Miguel Estrada's supporters have in the compelling story of a \nyoung immigrant who arrives from Honduras at age 17 and rises to be \nnominated to the second most prestigious court in the land. This is a \npride I hope we can all share, Democrats and Republicans, when this \nSenate confirms him. It is a non-partisan pride.\n  I disagree with The Post, however, to the extent they minimize the \nsignificance of confirming a well-qualified Hispanic.\n  Confirming minority candidates, provided they are also well-qualified \nas Mr. Estrada is, is a positive good, in and of itself. It is \nimportant to raise role models in high office for young Hispanics in \nthis country, indeed for all immigrants, provided they are otherwise \nwell qualified or as in Miguel Estrada's case--unanimously well-\nqualified. Now, I will take a second with another chart because it is \nimportant to go through his qualifications. These are only a few \nqualifications, but they are very important.\n\n  Miguel Estrada not qualified? Give me a break. My friends on the \nother side have said the American Bar Association is the gold standard. \nI think the way they are doing it now is probably true. ABA rating: \nUnanimously well qualified.\n  He argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, winning most of \nthem; Columbia and Harvard Law, graduated magna cum laud; editor of the \nHarvard Law Review--there are a lot of lawyers in this body; I doubt if \nmany have been editors of law reviews--law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court \nJustice Kennedy; assistant solicitor general for President Bush 1 and \nPresident Clinton.\n  Those are very important qualifications. There are not many who come \nbefore this body who have been confirmed, even to the prestigious \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, that can match \nMiguel Estrada.\n  I believe he handled himself well before the committee, although some \non the other side do not. Be that as it may, Miguel does work very hard \nwith the speech impediment he has had all his life. In spite of that \nhandicap or disability, he has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. It has been hardly a disability to him. He is a terrific human \nbeing. He is a very upright person. He is an example to all of what we \ncan achieve in this great land. He certainly deserves confirmation by \nthis body. I hope we can do that within a reasonable period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent the call of the quorum be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, notwithstanding the misleading charts of \nmy good friend from Utah--we will get to the numbers--there is an easy \nnumber for everyone to remember. There are 10 Hispanics on the circuit \ncourt of appeals today. Eight were nominated by President Clinton. \nThere would actually be 13 on the circuit courts of appeals today \nexcept the Republican leadership in the last couple of Congresses \nblocked three of President Clinton's nominees for the court of appeals. \nPresident Clinton does have, by far, the record of having successfully \nappointed the highest number of Hispanics for circuit courts of appeals \nof either President of either party. As I said, it would be even larger \nif the Republican Party had not refused votes in committee on three \nnominations.\n  Madam President, in the wake of the tragic events of this week, all \nAmericans are grieving with the families of the crew of the Space \nShuttle Columbia and with the entire NASA community. The President \nacknowledged that loss with a prayerful statement Saturday afternoon \nand with his presence, and his eloquent words yesterday in Houston were \njoined by a number of Senators of both parties. Our Nation mourns the \nloss of another crew, the crew of the Black Hawk helicopter that went \ndown east of Baghram Afghanistan last Thursday.\n  Both were connected to important national missions, one the \nscientific quest into space, and the other part of the continuing \nstruggle to secure Afghanistan from those who have made it a haven for \ninternational terrorism. These actions remind us all of the courage and \nsacrifice of those who serve the Nation in our armed services and on \nthe frontiers of space. This week the Nation mourns, and much of the \nworld grieves with us.\n\n  This morning, Secretary of State Powell spoke to the Security Council \nof the United Nations on the situation in Iraq as the administration \nmoves forward with preparations for war, war that appears now \ninevitable. We know how precious to their families are each of the \nmembers of the Reserves and Armed Forces who may be about to take \nassignments in harm's way. In light of all these events, this week is \nreally a poor time for the leadership of the Senate and the \nadministration to force the Senate into an extended debate on the \nadministration's controversial, divisive plan to pack the Federal court \nwith activists. I had hoped the administration and the Republican \nleadership would reconsider that plan and the timing of this debate. I \nknow the Democratic leader raised the matter with the Republican \nleadership. I thank Senator Daschle for having done so.\n  I thought the Senate was right to begin the week with unanimous \nSenate action on S. Res. 41, commemorating the devotion and regretting \nthe fate of the Columbia space shuttle mission. Both the Republican \nleader and Democratic leader joined to put together that resolution. I \ncommend both of them for doing it.\n  In fact, memorials are taking place around the country this week, in \nour hometowns and small towns, as well as the one in Houston yesterday, \nand here at the National Cathedral in Washington tomorrow, at Cape \nCanaveral in Florida, and elsewhere. Of course, there are memorials in \nother countries affected, especially Israel and India.\n  So this is not the time I would have chosen for this debate. The \nSenate should be finding matters of consensus on which we can all work \ntogether in unity in these difficult days of grieving. It would be \ngood, just for once, to have things that could unite us rather than \nthings that divide us.\n  Under Democratic Senate leadership in the difficult days following \nthe terrorist attacks of 9/11, that is what we did. We joined together, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. We worked hard to\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\nput aside divisive issues. We focused exclusively on what America \nneeded most in the aftermath of those attacks. I recall how hard some \nof us devoted ourselves to what became the USA Patriot Act; the hours, \nthe days, the weeks we spent trying to forge consensus.\n  We also saw how the administration worked to demean that \nbipartisanship, and how during the election season it denigrated the \nwork of Democrats trying to help the security of this country and \nbegan, once again, to divide, not unite.\n  It would be good to see national leaders in national campaigns seek \nto unite us and not to divide us. But it has been sometime since we \nhave seen that.\n  So in the new 108th Congress, as we begin this initial nominations \ndebate in the Senate Chamber, we see an emboldened executive branch \nwielding its rising influence over both Houses of Congress, and ever \nmore determined to pack the Federal courts with activist allies, to \nturn this independent judiciary into a political judiciary.\n  That would be one of the greatest tragedies this Nation could face. \nThroughout the world, when people come to America they look at our \nFederal judiciary and say: This is a truly independent judiciary. \nShouldn't we be working to do that?\n  In upholding our constitutional oath, shouldn't we, as Senators, be \ndoing that? Shouldn't whoever is President be doing that?\n\n  I recall when the Soviet Union collapsed, Members of the new Russian \nDuma came here to the United States to see how we do it in a democracy. \nI recall sitting in my conference room with a number of people. I \nremember the Members of the Duma coming to my office. There were those \nwho were going to have to oversee the new judiciary. One of the things \nthat struck me is one of them said: We have heard that there are \ninstances where American citizens go into a court and they bring suit \nagainst the American Government. Is that true?\n  I said: Yes, it happens all the time.\n  They said: We have also heard there were times when Americans bring \nsuit against their Government and the individual citizen wins, the \nGovernment loses.\n  I said: That happens all the time.\n  And they said: You don't replace the judges if they rule with one of \nthe citizens and rule against the U.S. Government?\n  I said: If the U.S. Government is in the wrong, of course they do, \nthat's their duty. That is what we mean by judicial independence. That \nis how the same American citizen could come in on another issue and \nlose. The fact is, American citizens can come into our Federal courts \nand know they are going to be independent. They are going to know it \ndoesn't make any difference whether they are Republicans or Democrats, \nwhether they are rich or poor, no matter what their color, no matter \nwhat their religion, no matter whether they are liberal, conservative, \nmoderate, or whatever part of the country they are from, when they go \nto the Federal courts they can see they are independent.\n  Now, in this attempt to change the ideology of all the Federal courts \ninto one narrow ideological strata, we see a attempt not to unite \nAmericans but to divide them. But worse than that, because these are \nlifetime appointments, we see an attempt to irrevocably damage the \nintegrity and the independence of the Federal judiciary.\n  With unprecedented speed--certainly unprecedented in the last 15 or \n20 years--the Democratic-controlled Senate moved through and, in 17 \nmonths, confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees. The vast majority \nof them were conservative Republicans, and I voted for almost all of \nthem because I thought, having listened to them, at least we knew \nenough about them to know that they could be impartial on the bench. \nThere were some we did not take up because it was so obvious from their \nstatements that they were there to take a political, ideological view. \nThen we find some, of course, who will not tell us at all what they are \nthere for.\n  The fundamental checks and balances of our Federal system are at risk \nof being sacrificed to a one-party rule with the coequal branches of \nour Government collapsing into one.\n  The Senate should not abandon its critical role. I wish more people--\nI wish 100 Members of the Senate--would sit down and read history books \nand determine how we got here and what our advice and consent rule is. \nLook at the fact that even President George Washington had judges who \nwere turned down by the Senate at that time.\n  This is a great institution. I have given 29 years of my life here. \nIt is the main place of checks and balances in our Federal Government, \nespecially when it comes to advising and consenting to appointees. We \nare not talking about an appointment to an assistant secretaryship, or \nadministratorship somewhere in a job that may last for a couple of \nyears, important though it may be; we are talking about lifetime \nappointments, appointments of judges who will be there long after all \nof us have left.\n  Defending and upholding the Constitution is what we Senators are \nsworn to do. I can remember every time I walked down the aisle of this \nSenate and up to the Presiding Officer and raised my hand to take my \noath of office to begin another 6-year term. I can remember each one of \nthose times as though it was in crystal, as though time stopped, \nbecause what I remember is not the fact that I have become a Senator \nagain, or that my family may be in the Gallery, or that my friends are \nhappy. What I remember is I am taking a very awesome oath. This oath \nsays that I will uphold the Constitution, and I will uphold my duties \nas a U.S. Senator--not as a Democrat or as a Republican, and not even \nas a Vermonter but as a U.S. Senator. We are a nation of 275 million \nAmericans. Only 100 of us get the opportunity to represent this country \nat any given time. And it is an awesome responsibility.\n\n  I see the administration trying to pack the Federal court with \nactivists. I take that very seriously. I have voted against nominees of \nRepublican Presidents and of Democratic Presidents if I believed it \nwould not be upholding my duties as a Senator to vote for them. But, \nunfortunately, this debate will be contentious, and it may be split \nlargely along party lines.\n  Already, Republicans have charged those who have spoken or voted \nagainst this nomination as motivated by racism. I do not know any \nracist in this body in either party, and I resent the fact that some \nRepublicans have said those who have voted against this nominee in the \ncommittee were motivated by racism. There are none in this body.\n  The Associated Press reports that Republicans, last Thursday, charged \nthose who opposed this nomination of doing so ``because of ethnicity'' \nand with wanting ``to smear anyone who would be a positive role model \nfor Hispanics.'' Those who made such statements should begin this \ndebate by withdrawing those statements and disavowing that divisive \nrhetoric.\n  It is wrong for anybody to be declaring that Members of this body in \neither party are racists. I think it is wrong what has happened here.\n  Those who have done so should apologize to Democratic Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee who voted against this nomination, and also to the \nHispanic leaders--very respected Hispanic leaders--in this country who \nshowed the courage to examine this nomination, and, having examined the \nnomination of Mr. Estrada, decided to oppose it.\n  Last year, some Republicans made an outrageous and slanderous charge \nthat religious bigotry motivated votes by the Democrats on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee--even going so far as to say no Christians should \nget a vote, and basically made it very clear because there are four \nCatholics and four Jews on that committee. As one of those Catholics, I \nresent that, and I resent that more than anything I have heard in 29 \nyears in the U.S. Senate. We have not seen that outrageous and \nslanderous charge withdrawn.\n  Again, I have never met a Senator in either party who showed \nreligious bigotry. But I have heard Senators accuse Democratic members \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee of that. It is wrong. It is \nabsolutely wrong--and just as wrong to say if you vote against somebody \nit is out of racism. That is wrong.\n  I have voted on thousands upon thousands of nominees for Presidents \nof both parties. For most of them I had\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\nabsolutely no idea what their race or religion was. And when I did, it \nnever once entered into my thought. It may cause fundraising letters or \ncheap applause lines when speaking to different groups, but I must \nadmit as a member of a religious minority that I find that it is \nsomething which I resent greatly.\n  I had hoped the administration and the Republican leadership would \nnot do something so controversial and divisive with this nomination--\nnot with all this Nation has gone through and continues to go through, \nwith the tragedy of last weekend, and not knowing that we are coming to \nthe final decision on going to war.\n  Just as the President has, once again, chosen to divide rather than \nunite by sending controversial judicial nominations in an effort to \npack the courts, the Republican leadership in the Senate has chosen \nthis time to force that controversy forward.\n  I made efforts over the last 2 years to try to work with the White \nHouse to confirm and appoint judges to the judicial vacancies, \nincluding a very large number of vacancies that are there because \nRepublicans refused to allow a vote on nominations by President \nClinton--moderate nominations by President Clinton. The vacancies \nremain year after year after year because the Senate does not allow a \nvote on the nominee.\n  As I said, during the last 17 months of the last Congress under \nDemocratic leadership, the Senate confirmed 100 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees. Actually during that time, even though the \nRepublicans were in charge for 6 months, they did not confirm a single \none of President Bush's judicial nominees--but Democrats did, 100 of \nthem. We worked at a rate almost twice that averaged during the \npreceding years when a Republican-led Senate was considering nominees \nof a Democratic President.\n  Consensus nominees were considered first and relatively quickly. \nControversial nominees took more time but we considered many of them as \nwell.\n  The last judicial nominee considered by the Senate last December was \nfrom the neighboring State of the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nJudge Dennis Shedd of South Carolina. Judge Shedd's nomination was \nchiefly supported by Senator Strom Thurmond. Despite his record--and \ncertainly a record with which I disagree--in civil rights cases and his \nrecord on the bench, we proceeded. His record raised serious concerns \namong many--especially among African Americans living in the Fourth \nCircuit and across the Nation. But we brought the nominee forward. I do \nrecall when we did that some Republicans said it would bring adversity \nto the bench. I am not sure what they meant by that. But we brought it \nforward, nonetheless, as I had agreed to. The Senate vote was 55 to 44 \nto confirm him.\n  Shortly thereafter, the Nation and the Senate were confronted by the \ncontroversy over the remarks of the former Republican leader, and \npeople openly speculated whether the President would renominate that \nSenator's choice, Judge Charles Pickering. The nomination was defeated \nin our committee.\n  I do not know of any precedent for a President renominating a \njudicial nominee who was voted on and rejected by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Yet this President has chosen to renominate--to go against \nprecedent--both Judge Pickering and Justice Priscilla Owen, who both \nhad been voted on by the Judiciary Committee and whose nominations were \nrejected last year.\n  I am over the fact that we haven't seen them on the agenda, in case \nSenators have second thoughts. But we will see. But now we have a \ndifferent nomination before the Senate.\n  As I have said for some time, the Senate and the American people \ndeserve to have an adequate record and strong confidence about the type \nof judge Mr. Estrada would be in order to support a favorable vote on \nthis nomination. But we don't have that in the sparse record before the \nSenate on his nomination to the second highest court of the land, and \nas a Senator I certainly don't have confidence to support this \nnomination when basically all I can say about him is he is a pleasant \nperson to be with. We have seen different sort of constantly changing \nbiographies of him in the press--all impressive, whichever one is the \nlatest one being used. But what I want to know is what is he going to \nbe like in a court? You have to be concerned. Will he be an activist on \nthe DC court?\n  Throughout our earlier proceedings, I repeatedly urged Mr. Estrada \nand the administration to be more forthcoming--certainly to be \nforthcoming at least to the extent that the five previous \nadministrations I served with have been. But neither the nominee nor \nthe administration has shown any interest--any interest whatsoever--in \nbeing more forthcoming.\n\n  So what do we have? We have before us for consideration a nominee \nwith no judicial experience, and little relevant practical experience \nrelated to the jurisdiction of this court. He counts Justice Scalia, \nKenneth Starr, and Ted Olson among his friends and mentors, but any \ninformation about how his decisionmaking would go or what he thinks is \nnot there.\n  The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, asked him: Well, we are not \ngoing to ask you about a case that may actually be before the court. \nSenator Schumer said: We are not going to ask you how you would vote on \nthe WorldCom case because that may well be there. But if you look at \nSupreme Court cases, for example, can you name any you disagree with? \nAnd that was just to get some idea of what he thinks. He asked him: Can \nyou name any cases you disagree with? And he could not.\n  Even if you did not want to look at some very recent cases, I would \nthink somebody would think of a case, such as the Dred Scott decision, \nor Plessy v. Ferguson. These are a couple cases that would come to mind \nthat you might disagree with. I certainly would disagree with the court \nupholding, what everybody now realizes is unconstitutional, the locking \nup of Japanese Americans during World War II, the locking up of loyal \nAmerican citizens absent any due process just because of where their \nancestors came from, which was upheld by a very political Supreme \nCourt. I could have disagreed with that.\n  There has to have been some cases--over all these years. Upholding \nslavery? Upholding separate but equal? Upholding the internment of \nAmericans for no other reason than the color of their skin and where \ntheir parents or grandparents came from? That was a softball toss. We \nare not even going to be allowed to know what he thinks about that. \nMaybe he thinks those were good cases. But if that is the case, then \nsay they are good cases, which actually is what he did. He said there \nwere none he disagreed with.\n  So you have to think that maybe one of the reasons for the \ncontroversy over Mr. Estrada is because he appears to have been groomed \nto be an activist appellate judge and groomed by well-connected, \nideologically driven legal activists.\n  For example, those who he declares are his friends--you can have \nfriends whenever you want. I have friends who range across the \npolitical spectrum. But I think I also would be willing to state what \nmy political philosophy is, or certainly what my judicial philosophy is \nif I am going to ask for a lifetime appointment to the bench, just as I \nhave to state what my political philosophy is when I ask the people of \nVermont to elect or reelect me.\n  Last week, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional \nBlack Caucus restated their concerns, and the Puerto Rican Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, the Mexican American Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, and the Southwest Voter Registration and Education \nProject reiterated their concerns.\n  Some of the most respected Latino labor leaders, including Maria \nElena Durazo of HEAR, Arturo S. Rodriguez of the UFW, Miguel Contreras \nof L.A. County Fed., Cristina Vazquez of UNITE, and Eliseo Medina of \nSEIU have indicated their strong opposition to this nomination.\n  Let me quote from the letter from Antonia Hernandez and Antonio \nGonzalez:\n\n       As a community, we recognize the importance of the \n     judiciary, as it is the branch to which we have turned to \n     seek protection when, because of our limited political power, \n     we are not able to secure and protect our rights through the \n     legislative process or with the executive branch. This has \n     become perhaps even more true in light of some of the actions \n     Congress and the executive branch have taken after 9/11, \n     particularly as these actions affect immigrants.\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\n       After an extensive review of the public record that was \n     available to us, the testimony that Mr. Estrada provided \n     before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the written \n     responses he provided to the committee, we have concluded at \n     this time that Mr. Estrada would not fairly review issues \n     that would come before him if he were to be confirmed to the \n     D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. As such, we oppose his \n     nomination and urge you to do the same.\n\n  Two of the Nation's most respected Hispanic leaders.\n  They go on to analyze an array of issues that affect not only the \nLatino community but all Americans on which they find this nomination \nwanting. Of course, MALDEF outlined its concerns in advance of the \nhearing last fall in a memorandum to the White House. As their recent \nletter says:\n\n       [T]he Judiciary Committee gave Mr. Estrada ample \n     opportunity to address [their concerns]. Ultimately, Mr. \n     Estrada had the affirmative obligation to show that he would \n     be fair and impartial to all who would appear before him. \n     After reviewing the public record, the transcript and the \n     hearing, and all written responses submitted by Mr. Estrada, \n     we conclude that he failed to meet this obligation. He chose \n     one of two paths consistently at his hearing and in his \n     written responses: either his responses confirmed our \n     concerns, or he chose not to reveal his current views or \n     positions.\n\n  My view of the record is similar to theirs. It is also shared by the \nrespected Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n  Senator Schumer chaired a fair hearing for Mr. Estrada last \nSeptember. Every Senator--Republican and Democrat--had ample time to \nask whatever questions they wanted. I was hoping that the hearing would \nallay concerns because I have been impressed with Mr. Estrada as a \nperson in meeting with him. But what I wanted to know was not Mr. \nEstrada the person, somebody who lived next door to you, but what would \na Judge Estrada--the person sitting up at the bench when you appear \nthere--how would that person be?\n  When he avoided answering question after question after question, \nthen I ended up with more questions than answers.\n  The recent statement from Latino labor leaders makes the following \npoint:\n\n       Mr. Estrada is a ``stealth candidate'' whose views and \n     qualifications have been hidden from the American people and \n     from the U.S. Senate. Since his nomination, Mr. Estrada has \n     consistently refused to answer important questions about his \n     views and his judicial philosophy.\n\n  These Latino leaders went on to say that it would be ``simply \nirresponsible for the Senate to put him on the bench.''\n  After a thorough review, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \nFund concluded that Mr. Estrada was not sufficiently qualified for a \nlifetime seat on the Nation's second highest court and said that his \n``extreme views should be disqualifying; that he has not had a \ndemonstrated interest in or any involvement with the Hispanic community \nor Hispanic activities of any kind; and that he lacks the maturity and \njudicial temperament necessary to be a circuit judge.''\n  PRLDEF said Mr. Estrada has ``made strong statements that have been \ninterpreted as hostile to criminal defendants' rights, affirmative \naction and women's rights.'' They expressed concern about his \ntemperament. People they interviewed about Mr. Estrada described him as \n``arrogant and elitist'' and that he ```harangues his colleagues' and \n`doesn't listen to other people,''' that he is not even tempered and he \nis ``contentious, confrontational, aggressive and even offensive in his \nverbal exchanges'' with them.\n  As I said before, some of his supporters have said, if a Senator \nopposes him, that Senator is racist or anti-Hispanic.\n  These claims are offensive and absurd. Well-respected leaders of the \nHispanic community itself have raised very serious objections and \nconcerns about his nomination. In fact, to say that those who vote \nagainst him are racist or anti-Hispanic is as false as the statements \nmade last fall that those who voted against Judge Pickering were anti-\nChristian.\n  No one has worked harder to increase Hispanic representation on our \ncourts than PRLDEF, MALDEF, and the congressional Hispanic caucus. In \nfact, they didn't begin their review of Mr. Estrada's record with the \nexpectation of opposing his nomination. Instead, they started with \ntheir strong record of supporting more diversity on the Federal bench, \nsomething they have done for years, President after President, urging \nmore diversity on the Federal bench. This was before the 10 Hispanics \non the court of appeals. I know President Clinton listened to them \nbecause he appointed eight of those 10. They actually would have had \nthree more had the Republican-controlled committee allowed them to come \nto a vote.\n  Now there is all this talk about how can we possibly be stopping \nPresident Bush when he is trying so hard to have Latinos on the bench. \nThere are 42 vacancies that have existed in the 13 circuit courts of \nappeal during President Bush's tenure. Mr. Estrada is the only Hispanic \nhe has nominated. Unlike the eight that were confirmed of President \nClinton's and the other three that he had in there, 11 that he \nnominated, President Bush has nominated one, and he had 42 chances to \nnominate. Out of those 42 chances, the only one he nominates is not \nsomebody who could form a consensus within the Hispanic or non-Hispanic \ncommunity, but he has one that is rejected by much of the Hispanic \ncommunity, is guaranteed to be divisive. And one more time--one more \ntime but consistent as always--the administration seeks to divide, not \nto unite, something that has been their hallmark.\n  They didn't find any Hispanics to nominate for the four vacancies on \nthe Tenth Circuit. That includes New Mexico and Colorado, both States \nwith large Hispanic populations. They didn't find any Hispanics to \nnominate for the three vacancies in the Fifth Circuit, which includes \nTexas, certainly a State with a large Hispanic population, or the six \nvacancies on the Ninth Circuit. They couldn't find any Hispanics to \nnominate there, but that includes California and Arizona, certainly \nStates with large Hispanic populations. There are three vacancies on \nthe Second Circuit, no Hispanics, even though that includes New York \nand Puerto Rico. Certainly, they should have found some there. Or the \nThird Circuit, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, they couldn't find any \nHispanics there to appoint.\n  And we know that there are some outstanding Hispanic lawyers in each \nof those circuits. Some are sitting on the State courts doing a superb \njob where there is a record and where there would be a consensus and \nwhere you would have somebody who would unite rather than divide.\n  In fact, there are more than 1,000 local, State, or Federal judges of \nHispanic heritage, and out of those 1,000, for these 42 vacancies, the \nPresident finds one, and that one is there with no experience, no \nbackground as a judge, and is there solely because he has been put \nforward to carry on a particular judicial ideology.\n  I don't want to leave the impression that the President sent nobody \nup here of Latino descent. He did. And a Democratic-controlled Congress \nconfirmed them all. Judge Christina Armijo of New Mexico, Judge Phillip \nMarinez, and Randy Crane of Texas, Judge Jose Martinez of Florida, \nMagistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, and Jose Linares of New Jersey--they were \nall nominated. We confirmed every one of them. In fact, we just held a \nhearing on Judge James Otero of California. I told him at the end of \nthe hearing that I assumed we would be confirming him very quickly. \nActually, we would have, had the nominee had his hearing last year, had \nhis paperwork been completed.\n\n  But also, as I have said before, there are 10 Latino appellate judges \ncurrently seated in the Federal courts. Eighty percent of them were \nappointed by President Clinton. Even there, a number of them were \ndenied Senate consideration for years while the Republicans controlled \nthe Senate.\n  For example, the confirmation of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth \nCircuit took more than 1,500 days, even though he was strongly \nsupported by both his home State Senators. And after Republicans \ndelayed Judge Paez for 5 years, 39 voted against him.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is in the Second Circuit, my circuit; everybody \nagreed that she was a superb candidate, but then for month after month \nafter month--we wanted to bring her up for a vote--an anonymous hold on \nthe Republican side of the aisle blocked consideration--anonymous hold \nafter anonymous hold.\n  The irony there is that she had a strong court record. She had first \nbeen\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\nappointed to the Federal bench by the first President Bush. He \nappointed her. She had this record. She had a unanimously well \nqualified, the highest rating possible. They stalled her and stalled \nher with an anonymous hold. Finally, the embarrassment got too much. \nAnd when it came to a vote, 29 Republicans voted against her.\n  Now a number of the circuit court nominees President Clinton sent up \nhere never even received a hearing or vote. Jorge Rangel and Enrique \nMoreno of Texas were both nominated to the Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit. President Clinton was able to find qualified Hispanics \nfor the Fifth Circuit, but the Republican leadership would not allow \nthem to come to a vote. And Christine Arguello of Colorado was \nnominated to the Tenth Circuit. An awful lot of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees were never even given hearings or votes. Many of them \nwere qualified Hispanics, African American, or women.\n  That is why during the past Congress, in the year and a half the \nDemocrats were in control, we tried to restore fairness to the \nconfirmation process. We tried to address the vacancies we had \ninherited. Even though those vacancies were caused because Republicans \nwould not allow votes on Democratic nominees, we brought forward \nRepublican nominees for the same places. Diversity has been the \ngreatest strength of our Nation. That diversity of backgrounds should \nbe reflected in our Federal courts, not just on the streets of our \ncities and towns. We also should accept the fact that race or ethnicity \nor gender are no substitute for the wisdom, experience, fairness, and \nimpartiality that qualify someone to be a Federal judge--especially a \nFederal judge--entrusted with a lifetime appointment.\n\n  No potential candidate for a lifetime appointment to the Federal \ncourts should get a presumption of competence or entitlement. You are \nnot automatically competent or entitled simply because you are \nappointed. It makes no difference which party the President is from. If \nit were otherwise, we should do away with the advise and consent clause \nof the Constitution and change it to advise or rubber stamp, or \nsomething like that.\n  Nominees should be treated fairly, but the proof of suitability for a \nlifetime appointment rests on the nominee and on the administration. \nThe Senate is not required to prove they are qualified for a lifetime \nappointment. We have to satisfy ourselves as individual Senators, as \n100 Senators, that they are qualified and suitable for this lifetime \nappointment. It is up to the nominee himself or herself and the \nadministration to make the case that allows us to reach the conclusion \nthat they are qualified.\n  We have to look at their records, listen to their answers to the \nquestions--if they will answer the questions--and if they refuse to \nanswer the questions, I don't know why any Senator would think that he \nor she has an obligation to vote for this person if they will not even \nanswer the question of why they are qualified, beyond a political \nconnection, to a lifetime appointment on what is supposed to be an \nindependent, nonpolitical Federal bench.\n  Certainly, we know the benefits of diversity and how it contributes \nto achieving and improving justice in America. That is fine. We should \nlook at that and the President should. All of these questions should be \nlooked at, and the answers to the questions should be looked at. But if \nall we have are questions and no answers, where do we go?\n  As Antonia Hernandez wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The fact that a nominee is Latino should not be a shield \n     from full inquiry, particularly when a nominee's record is \n     sparce, as in Mr. Estrada's case.\n\n  She continued:\n\n       It is vital to know more about a nominee's philosophies for \n     interpreting and applying the Constitution and the laws.\n\n  It was in connection with the nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd, a \nwhite male and former staffer to Senator Thurmond, that Republicans \nargued he would bring diversity to the Fourth Circuit. Maybe that is \ntheir sense of diversity. I suspect it is not the sense of many others. \nBe that as it may, each Senator has to make up his or her mind about \nthe qualifications. I defy any Senator to make up his or her mind \nsatisfactorily when they don't have a record before them or answers to \nquestions.\n  The Fourth Circuit was a Federal circuit court that had the longest \nhistory without an African-American judge, speaking of diversity. It \nwasn't until President Clinton's recess appointment of Judge Roger \nGregory that the Fourth Circuit was finally desegregated.\n  The reason we were not able to get him through before was the \nRepublican majority used blue slips and secret objections to block the \nintegration of that court for years during the Clinton administration \nas the Clinton administration nominated one qualified African American \nafter another. He was accorded a hearing, but they did say Judge Shedd \nwould bring diversity to that court. In that regard, I am glad that \ncommon sense came out, and I applaud the two Senators from Virginia--\nRepublican Senators--for convincing the President to renominate Judge \nGregory, this outstanding African-American jurist. I commend both \nSenator Allen and Senator Warner for standing up for him. When he came \nto the Senate floor and we had a rollcall vote on him, every Senator, \nexcept one, voted for him. It shows the quality of the nominee, but \nalso it is a strong signal to that court that here is a judge who has \nbeen looked at by both Republicans and Democrats in 1990, and 100 \nSenators came to the conclusion that he was qualified.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and a CHC civil rights \ntask force scorecard.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus (CHC), we wish to inform you that the CHC has decided \n     to oppose Miguel Estrada's nomination to the United State \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After \n     reviewing Mr. Estrada's record and meeting with him in \n     person, we have concluded that he fails to meet the CHC's \n     evaluation criteria for endorsing judicial nominees.\n       As you know, the judicial nomination process is important \n     to the CHC because we believe that our nation's courts should \n     reflect the diversity of thought and action that enrich \n     America. Earlier this year, we launched the Hispanic \n     Judiciary Initiative to further formalize our involvement in \n     this issue by establishing a set of evaluation criteria and \n     an internal process for endorsing nominees. We hope that this \n     initiative will allow us to continue our work to ensure fair \n     treatment of Latino judicial nominees and tackle the lack of \n     diversity in the federal judiciary.\n       In evaluating Mr. Estrada, we considered not only his \n     honesty, integrity, character, temperament, and intellect, \n     but also his commitment to equal justice and advancement \n     opportunities for Latinos working in the field of law. \n     Because of the nature of the CHC's mission and the important \n     role that the courts play in achieving that mission, in order \n     to support a judicial nominee the CHC requires that he or she \n     has a demonstrated commitment to protecting the rights of \n     Latinos through his or her professional work, pro bono work, \n     and volunteer activities; to preserving and expanding the \n     progress that has been made on civil rights and individual \n     liberties; and to expanding advancement opportunities for \n     Latinos in the law profession. On this measure, Mr. Estrada \n     fails to convince us that he would contribute under-\n     represented perspectives to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit.\n       As stated by Mr. Estrada during his meeting with us, he has \n     never provided any pro bono legal expertise to the Latino \n     community or organizations. Nor has he ever joined, \n     supported, volunteered for or participated in events of any \n     organization dedicated to serving and advancing the Latino \n     community. As an attorney working in government and the \n     private sector, he has never made efforts to open doors of \n     opportunity to Latino law students or junior lawyers through \n     internships, mentoring or other means. While he has not been \n     in the position to create internships or recruit new staff, \n     he never appealed to his superiors about the importance of \n     making such efforts on behalf of Latinos. Furthermore, Mr. \n     Estrada declined to commit that he would be engaged in \n     Hispanic community activities once appointed to the bench or \n     that he would pro-actively seek to promote increased access \n     to positions where Latinos have been traditionally under-\n     represented, such as clerkships.\n       Mr. Estrada shared with us that he believes being Hispanic \n     would be irrelevant in his day-to-duties on the court, which \n     leads us to conclude that he does not see himself\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\n     as being capable of bringing new perspectives to the bench. \n     This is deeply troubling since the CHC's primary objective in \n     increasing ethnic diversity of the courts is to increase the \n     presence of under-presented perspectives.\n       Mr. Estrada's limited record makes it difficult to \n     determine whether he would be a forceful voice on the bench \n     for advancing civil rights and other protections for \n     minorities. He has never served as a judge and has not \n     written any substantive articles or publications. However, we \n     did note that in responding to inquiries about case law, Mr. \n     Estrada did not demonstrate a sense of inherent \n     ``unfairness'' or ``justice'' in cases that have had a great \n     impact on the Hispanic community.\n       The appointment of a Latino to reflect diversity is \n     rendered meaningless unless the nominee can demonstrate an \n     understanding of the historical role courts have played in \n     the lives of minorities in extending equal protections and \n     rights; has some involvement in the Latino community that \n     provides insight into the values and mores of the Latino \n     culture in order to understand the unique legal challenges \n     facing Latinos; and recognizes both the role model \n     responsibilities he or she assumes as well as having an \n     appreciation for protecting and promoting the legal rights of \n     minorities who historically have been the victims of \n     discrimination.\n       Based on the totality of the nominee's available record and \n     our meeting with him, Miguel Estrada fails to meet the CHC's \n     criteria for endorsing a judicial nominee. In our opinion, \n     his lack of judicial experience coupled with a failure to \n     recognize or display an interest in the needs of the Hispanic \n     community do not support an appointment to the federal \n     judiciary. We respectfully urge you to take this into account \n     as you consider his nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n           Sincerely,\n     Silvestre Reyes,\n       Chair, Congressional Hispanic Caucus\n     Charles A.

Mr. President, before my voice goes, I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah in the Chamber. Obviously, he will be \nrecognized next. Then I hope we will go to Senator Schumer. I will have \nmore to say, but the spirit is more willing than the vocal cords.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to Senator Schumer for a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nafter Senator from Utah finishes, I be recognized for a period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thought I would make some points here \nbecause the distinguished Senator from Vermont is mistaken in a number \nof accusations he makes.\n  I wish to list the following Hispanic groups or Hispanic-owned \nbusinesses that express their support for Miguel Estrada. One of the \noldest Hispanic organizations in the country is the League of Latin \nAmerican Citizens. It is well known, well respected, and bipartisan. \nThey are firmly behind Miguel Estrada. Next is the U.S. Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce; Hispanic National Bar Association; Hispanic \nBusiness Roundtable; National Association of Small Disadvantaged \nBusiness; Mexican American Grocers Association; ATL, Inc.; PlastiComm \nIndustries, Inc.; Phoenix Construction Services; Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce of Greater Kansas City; eHEBC Hispanic Engineers Business \nCorporation; Hispano Chamber of Commerce de Las Cruces; Casa Del \nSinaloense; Republican National Hispanic Assembly; Hispanic Engineers \nBusiness Corporation; Hispanic Contractors of America, Inc.; and the \nCharo-Community Development Corporation.\n\n  That is to mention a few. There are dozens of organizations that \nsupport Miguel Estrada. As anybody would understand, there is a lot of \npride in Hispanic organizations for this type of a nominee, who has \nachieved so much in his life, and has done it basically on his own and \nhas achieved the heights that very few lawyers and people have \nachieved, who has not had a glove laid on him in our committee \nhearing--other than complaints that they don't know his philosophy. My \ngoodness, they have had almost 2 years to learn his philosophy and they \ncould have asked any question, and they did ask a lot of questions.\n  Let me say there is a double standard here on judicial \nqualifications. On January 30, 2003, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nvoted 10 to 9 to approve the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the DC Circuit. On January 24, 2003, Senator Leahy \nquestioned Mr. Estrada's qualifications, saying he ``has no judicial \nexperience. He has no publications since law school.''\n  He is not a distinguished legal scholar or professor of law.\n  I might add that in 1997, the distinguished Senator from Vermont \npraised Merrick Garland--as did I, by the way; I supported him \nstrongly; he was another DC Circuit nominee with no judicial \nexperience, no professional experience, no publications--as ``highly \nqualified for this appointment'' and someone who would make ``an \noutstanding Federal judge.'' That is in the Congressional Record of \nMarch 19, 1997, at S2518.\n  That is what was said about Merrick Garland. I agree with Senator \nLeahy on that point. He was an excellent candidate, an excellent judge. \nI supported him strongly and broke down barriers to make sure he could \nbecome a judge on the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. Estrada's and Mr. Garland's credentials, or should I say Judge \nGarland's credentials, were exactly the same at the time. Let me go \ndown through a list of credentials.\n  The age of the nominee: Miguel Estrada was 41. That was 2 years ago \nalmost; Merrick Garland was 44.\n  Phi Beta Kappa: Yes for Miguel Estrada; yes for Merrick Garland.\n  Harvard Law School, magna cum laude: Yes for Miguel Estrada; yes for \nMerrick Garland.\n  Editor of the Harvard Law Review: Yes for Miguel Estrada; yes for \nMerrick Garland.\n  Law clerk, U.S. Court of Appeals, the Second Circuit: Yes for Miguel \nEstrada; yes for Merrick Garland.\n  Law clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court: Yes for both of them.\n  Private practice: 7 years for Miguel Estrada; 7 years for Merrick \nGarland.\n  Assistant U.S. attorney: 2 years for Miguel Estrada; 3 years for \nMerrick Garland.\n  U.S. Department of Justice: From 1992 to 1997 for Miguel Estrada; \nfrom 1993 to 1997 for Merrick Garland who now sits on the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Bipartisan support: Yes for Miguel Estrada; yes for Merrick Garland.\n  Race: Miguel Estrada is Hispanic. Merrick Garland is white.\n  Days from nomination to Judiciary Committee approval: 631 days for \nMiguel Estrada; only 100 for Merrick Garland. They are not quite equal \nthere.\n  Seven current Judiciary Committee Democrats served in the Senate in \n1997. Seven of them are current Democrats on the committee. Every one \nof those Democrats voted for Merrick Garland, and every one of them \nvoted against Miguel Estrada--all seven of them.\n  Let me say that the statement of Senator Kennedy, our distinguished \nformer chairman of the committee way back when, about Merrick Garland \nin the Congressional Record of March 19, 1997 at S2518 I think applies \nto Miguel Estrada. This is our distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts:\n\n       No one can question Mr. Garland's qualifications and \n     fitness to serve on the DC Circuit. He is a respected lawyer, \n     a former Supreme Court law clerk, a partner at a prestigious \n     law firm, and has served with distinction in the Department \n     of Justice under both Republican and Democratic \n     administrations. Support for him is bipartisan.\n\n  I think that statement in every detail applies to Miguel Estrada. I \ndo not think there is any question about it.\n  What is going on here? What is wrong with this tremendous lawyer who \nhas\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\nmade it on his own under very trying circumstances; who has an ABA \nrating of unanimously well qualified; who has argued 15 cases before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court--I am not sure Merrick Garland did that, \nalthough I think Merrick Garland is a terrific individual--Columbia and \nHarvard Law, magna cum laude; editor of the Harvard Law Review, \nsomething that is about as prestigious as it gets in law school; a law \nclerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Kennedy; Assistant Solicitor \nGeneral not only for George Bush I, but for President Clinton as well, \npraised by the person who supervised him, who later, not knowing we had \nall of those praises, besmirched him. But it is pretty hard to go \nagainst what he put in writing way back when, and I will get into that \nbefore we are through.\n\n  I have been listening very carefully to some of the comments of my \ndistinguished friend from Vermont, and I do not believe that bringing \nup the names of Clinton nominees who happen to be of Hispanic descent \nhas anything to do with how this Senate should treat Mr. Estrada. \nHowever, since my Democratic colleagues have criticized my treatment of \nthese nominees when I was chairman, I feel compelled to set the record \nstraight.\n  The fact is, under Republican leadership, most of President Clinton's \nHispanic nominees--14, to be exact--were, indeed, confirmed. Although \nmy Democratic colleagues would have you believe something more \nnefarious was at work, the fact is the nominations of Jorge Rangel and \nEnrique Moreno for the Fifth Circuit stalled because there was an utter \nfailure of consultation by the Clinton White House. There is no \nquestion about that. And neither sitting Senator in Texas was willing \nto return their blue slips because there was no consultation, which is \na requisite.\n  My colleagues on the other side are certainly raising consultation \nquestions all the time about this White House, and we have directed the \nWhite House to consult. Unfortunately, some of them, I think, take the \nattitude that unless the White House chooses who they want, it is not \nconsultation. That is not a good definition of consultation.\n  Tenth Circuit nominee Christine Arguello has been brought up. She was \nnot nominated until July of 2000. It was way too late in the session to \neffectively move her nomination under those circumstances. We did not \nreceive her questionnaire until August of 2000 and, if my records are \ncorrect, I do not believe we ever did receive her FBI file. So to raise \nthat is sophistry at best.\n  It is unfortunate for the nominee when he or she is not confirmed \nbecause of these obstacles, but none of these face Mr. Estrada. As we \nall know, he has been pending for 2 years now and has been rated \nunanimously well qualified, the highest rating by the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  As for Ninth Circuit Court nominee Richard Paez, I was a vocal \nsupporter of Judge Paez in the face of harsh criticism from some in my \nown party. I was one of two Republicans to vote for him in this \ncommittee, and I led the effort on the Republican side to get him \nconfirmed on the floor. I believe my Democratic colleagues know this, \nso I take exception when they cite his name as an example of my alleged \nstonewalling on Clinton nominees. There was none.\n  Let me talk about the hearing testimony of Mr. Estrada. Mr. Estrada \nrepeatedly answered the questions that were put to him. Let me give \nsome examples.\n  Mr. Estrada testified he was committed to following the precedents of \nhigher courts faithfully and giving them full force and effect, even if \nhe disagrees with them and even if he believes such precedents are \nerroneous. That is pretty important testimony, and it is testimony that \nshould be in his favor.\n  When asked how he would decide cases presenting an issue for which \nthere was no controlling authority, Mr. Estrada testified:\n\n       When facing a problem for which there is not a decisive \n     answer from a higher court, my cardinal rule would be to \n     seize aid from anyplace I could get it.\n\n  He testified this would include related case law and other areas of \nlegislative history and views of academics.\n  When asked if he sees the local process as a political game, Mr. \nEstrada testified: The first duty of a judge is to self-consciously put \nthat aside and look at each case by withholding judgment, with an open \nmind, and listening to the points. I think the job of a judge is to put \nall that aside and to the best of his human capacity to give a judgment \nbased solely on the arguments on the law.\n  Miguel Estrada said: I will follow binding case law on every case, \nand I don't even know if I can say whether I concur in the case or not \nwithout actually having gone through all the work of doing it from \nscratch. He further says: I may have a personal moral philosophical \nview on the subject matter, but I undertake to you that I would put all \nthat aside and decide cases in accordance with binding case law, and \neven in accordance with the case law that is not binding but seems \ninstructive on the area, without any influence whatsoever from a \npersonal view I may have about that subject matter.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on. What is clear from this \ntestimony is Mr. Estrada will be a judge who sets aside his personal \nconvictions, whatever they may be, and follow the law. This is \nprecisely the type of a person we want on the Federal bench.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from New York \nfor permitting me to go for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent before I speak \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania be given 5 minutes. I also ask unanimous \nconsent Senator Kennedy be allowed to speak at 5:40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to support the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada. We have heard a lot about his academic \nrecord. The Senator from New York knows what a taste of being magna cum \nlaude at Harvard is like. He is a Harvard graduate himself. I know what \nit is like to be magna cum laude of Harvard, too, and the Phi Beta \nKappa standing from Columbia and magna cum laude there, and editor of \nthe Harvard Law Review.\n  These academic credentials are unsurpassable. Fifteen cases argued \nbefore the Supreme Court, extraordinary. Clerk for the U.S. Supreme \nCourt Justice--again, an ``A+'' rating. There could be no doubt about \nthe qualifications of this man.\n  Now, there is an objection raised that not enough is known about his \nphilosophy. What is really being attempted here is to impose a test \nthat you have to be in philosophical agreement in order to get the vote \nof a Senator for confirmation. I suggest that is an inappropriate test. \nIt is not the traditional test. It is going much too far.\n  When Justice Scalia was confirmed, he would not even give his opinion \non whether he would uphold Marbury v. Madison. There have been many \nSupreme Court nominees and circuit court nominees with whom I have \ndisagreed philosophically on major points, but I have not withheld my \nvote in confirmation for Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia, \nJustice Kennedy and Justice Thomas because I did not like their views \non the issue of choice.\n  If a nominee is outside of the mainstream, that is one thing. I did \nnot hesitated to oppose the nomination of Judge Robert Bork, where he \nwas outside of the mainstream, even though he was nominated by my \nparty, where he articulated the view of original intent, which simply \ncould not be comprehended, and did not accept judicial review. He said \nabsent original intent, there is no judicial legitimacy, and absent \njudicial legitimacy there cannot be judicial review. That is beyond the \nmainstream.\n  No one can contend Miguel Estrada is beyond the mainstream. If there \nare specific objections, let's hear them. But we have not heard them.\n  Then you have the business about the refusal to turn over his \nmemoranda when he was in Solicitor General general's office, and you \nhave the letter from seven ex-Solicitors General, which I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record--both Democrat and Republicans.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\n\n                                       Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our concern about \n     your recent request that the Department of Justice turn over \n     ``appeal recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and \n     amicus recommendations'' that Miguel Estrada worked on while \n     in the Office of the Solicitor General.\n       As former heads of the Office of the Solicitor General--\n     under Presidents of both parties--we can attest to the vital \n     importance of candor and confidentiality in the Solicitor \n     General's decisionmaking process. The Solicitor General is \n     charged with the weighty responsibility of deciding whether \n     to appeal adverse decisions in cases where the United States \n     is a party, whether to seek Supreme Court review of adverse \n     appellate decisions, and whether to participate as amicus \n     curiae in other high-profile cases that implicate an \n     important federal interest. The Solicitor General has the \n     responsibility of representing the interests not just of the \n     Justice Department, nor just of the Executive Branch, but of \n     the entire federal government, including Congress.\n       It goes without saying that, when we made these and other \n     critical decisions, we relied on frank, honest, and thorough \n     advice from our staff attorneys, like Mr. Estrada. Our \n     decisionmaking process required the unbridled, open exchange \n     of ideas--an exchange that simply cannot take place if \n     attorneys have reason to fear that their private \n     recommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to \n     public disclosure. Attorneys inevitably will hesitate before \n     giving their honest, independent analysis, if their opinions \n     are not safeguarded from future disclosure. High-level \n     decisionmaking requires candor, and candor in turn requires \n     confidentiality.\n       Any attempt to intrude into the Office's highly privileged \n     deliberations would come at the cost of the Solicitor \n     General's ability to defend vigorously the United States' \n     litigation interests--a cost that also would be borne by \n     Congress itself.\n       Although we profoundly respect the Senate's duty to \n     evaluate Mr. Estrada's fitness for the federal judiciary, we \n     do not think that the confidentiality and integrity of \n     internal deliberations should be sacrified in the process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Seth P. Waxman,\n     On behalf of\n     Walter Dellinger,\n     Drew S. Days, III,\n     Kenneth W. Starr,\n     Charles Fried,\n     Robert H. Bork,\n     Archibald Cox.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is absolutely chilling to the operation of the \nSolicitor General's office or the operation of any governmental office \nwith lawyers working to say their work product, their views, will be \nsubject to review and scrutiny if they are later nominated to some \njudicial position.\n  I think it boils down to--I will not call the request for the \nopinions of the Solicitor General's office a red herring; that could be \na little too harsh--it certainly is a subterfuge. It is not what they \nare really looking for. They are looking for an excuse.\n  The news reports today are that the Democrats plan a filibuster. That \nis the headline: ``Democrats Plan Filibuster on Estrada Nomination.'' \nIf that is so, the Senate is going to come to a grinding halt. If \nMiguel Estrada cannot be confirmed, then I doubt that anybody can be \nconfirmed. We may be locked in debate on this matter--I heard an \nestimate of 3 months at lunch; that may be an understatement.\n  I don't think the American people are going to tolerate this. There \nhas been much too much judicial politics. Republicans are as guilty of \nit as are the Democrats. When President Clinton was in office and \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, nominations were blocked \ninappropriately. I was prepared to cross party lines where I thought it \nwas justified. Now that we have a Republican in the White House and the \nDemocrats have controlled the Judiciary Committee for most of the last \n2 years, the shoe is on the other foot and there have been \ninappropriate blocking of nominees.\n  The only filibuster which we can find is the one on Abe Fortis for \nChief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, which is hardly a \njudgeship for the court of appeals.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats \non the Judiciary Committee, and the Democrats generally, we have to \ncome to some accommodation. We have to come to a judicial protocol so \nwe consider the issues on the basis of merit and qualification without \npoliticizing and without looking for people who agree with us \nphilosophically.\n  I may come back to speak later, but I wanted to speak at an early \npoint in this proceeding because of my participation in the \nconfirmation hearings of some seven Supreme Court nominees and hundreds \nof lower Federal court nominees. I hope we will take Estrada out of \npolitics and confirm him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is going to be a long debate, \nwhatever happens. I very much appreciate the sincere concerns of my \ncolleagues from Utah and Pennsylvania.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania before he leaves, he asked, if \nMiguel Estrada cannot get confirmed, who can? I, for one, have voted \nfor 96 of the 102 judges President Bush has nominated. We passed over \n100 of them.\n  There seems to be an idea on the other side if we oppose a single \njudge we are totally blocking the President's program. I argue just the \nopposite. I argue to my friend, as he well knows because he knows the \nConstitution better than just about anyone else in this Chamber, with \nmaybe the exception of our good friend from West Virginia, the Founding \nFathers wanted debate. They wanted the Senate to have a role. Read the \nFederalist Papers. That is how it was for many years.\n  To sum up, the White House has started to nominate ideological \nnominees--not like President Clinton, not like the first President \nBush--but when we try to examine the ideology of these nominees, that \nis wrong. We do virtually no moderates before us. Everyone is from \nconservative, to way out of the mainstream, and we have voted for most \nof the conservative judges. Let's be honest about it. This debate was \nnot started by Democrats in the Senate. This debate was started by a \nWhite House that is intent on changing the character of the Federal \nbench, to go way beyond what is the mainstream of America. Everyone \nwill agree, Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas are the two most \nconservative judges on the court. President Bush said it in his \ncampaign. He said: I will nominate Justices like Scalia and Thomas.\n\n  That is not saying moderation. He promised the American people \nmoderation when he ran. But when it comes to the article III section of \nGovernment, we don't see a drop of moderation.\n  We will continue to make this argument because we believe we are \ndefending the Constitution. We are doing just what James Madison and \nJohn Jay and Alexander Hamilton and all of the great writers of this \nConstitution wanted us to do, which is have some influence on the \narticle III section of Government.\n  I am going to speak at some length, which is not what I usually do \nhere. I usually say I think you can say everything in 5 or 10 minutes. \nBut this issue is so important to me that I intend to be on the floor \nhere today for a period of time, and regularly after that.\n  I rise in opposition to the nomination before us today. Mr. Estrada \nhas been nominated to a lifetime appointment, a lifetime seat on the DC \nCircuit, the Nation's second most important court. If confirmed, this \n42-year-old man will spend the next half century making important \ndecisions that will affect our children, our grandchildren, our great-\ngrandchildren, and generations beyond. If we vote to confirm Mr. \nEstrada, there is no going back. There is no opportunity to look at \nwhat he does in his first years as judge and reconsider. The vote here \nis final. If he is confirmed, we are all going to have to live with the \nconsequences for decades to come.\n  So this is not a trivial matter. This is not a trifling matter. This \nis one of the most important matters that comes before us. The ability \nto ratify or reject a President's nomination to a lifetime appointment \nin article III, the third branch of Government, is a solemn obligation. \nIt is one that should not be taken lightly. To rush through the \nnomination, to not have questions fully answered and explored, does \nviolation to the very Constitution that we all revere. Yet that is what \nthe other side is asking us to do.\n  The Senate has a solemn, almost sacred duty when evaluating \napplicants for such powerful posts. I will quote my good friend from \nUtah, Senator Hatch:\n\n       The Senate has a duty not to be a rubberstamp.\n\n  Those are his words. That is every bit as true today as it was when \nhe uttered them.\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\n  The Founding Fathers, in my opinion--not just mine, almost \neverybody's--were really quite brilliant in devising a system of checks \nand balances. When it came to judicial nominations, they had a robust \ndebate. For a good period of time at the Constitutional Convention they \nwere considering vesting all the power in the Senate. There was a \nperiod where they considered vesting all the power in the President. \nThey realized, as they did with most matters, that our country was best \noff with a system of shared power.\n  The Framers gave the President the power to select nominees but gave \nthe Senate coordinate responsibilities to advise the President on whom \nto nominate, and to decide whether the nominees deserve confirmation. \nBy and large, the system has worked well for over 200 years. For those \nof us who revere the Constitution and who believe in the rule of law, \nit is a beautiful work of art.\n\n  I believe to this day what was said when America was founded, that we \nare God's noble experiment. We still are. That is why the debate today \nand in the following weeks has so much vitality. For this beautiful \nwork of art to maintain its beauty and brilliance, the Senate must hold \nup its end of the bargain. We have a duty, a responsibility, an \nobligation to the judiciary, to the Constitution, and, yes, to the \nAmerican people, to carefully evaluate these nominees and decide \nwhether they merit confirmation.\n  This cannot be a rote process where the President sends us names and \nwe just say ``OK,'' without undertaking an independent evaluation. As \nwe hear so often from Senator Byrd, the keeper of tradition in this \nbody, we have a duty to be vigilant defenders of constitutional \nprinciples and the Senate's role in checking executive power. For the \nSenate to retain its historical role in our system of government, we \nmust live up to the standards set by those who came before us and \nensure that we have balance in Government.\n  Too often, debates around here devolve into rancor and partisan \nbackbiting. Too often in the past, debates involved personal attacks on \npeople. Because we don't like a nominee, someone goes back and finds \nthey smoked marijuana when they were in college, or they took out the \nwrong kind of movie when they were a young man or woman. That demeans \nthe process.\n  To have a full debate and a fulsome discussion with the nominee about \nhow he or she feels about important issues such as the first amendment \nand the second and the fourth and the commerce clause and the \nsovereignty clause and the right to privacy is not simply fun. It is \nnot simply optional. It is deeply and solemnly necessary to uphold the \nwill of the Founding Fathers, to uphold the very structure of the \nGovernment we revere. We should focus on facts in what we do and, \nequally important, on what we know and, equally important to this \ndebate, what we don't know about this nominee.\n  When a nominee is seeking such a powerful post, this lifetime \nposition on the Nation's second highest court, I believe the nominee \nhas an obligation to answer questions. I believe the nominee has a duty \nto tell us what he thinks about the law, how he views vexing legal \nquestions of the day, and to share with us his approach to the \nConstitution and his judicial philosophy. These are not only reasonable \nareas of inquiry, they are urgent and important areas of inquiry. We \ncannot be expected to undertake our constitutional duties without \nanswers to these questions.\n  In the words of Mr. Dooley, ``this ain't beanbag.'' This isn't fun or \na political game. This isn't trying one-upmanship. This goes to the \nvery sacred obligation each of us has, when we take that oath of office \nupon our election or our reelection.\n  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle agree with me on \nthis fundamental view. While I expect they will take to the floor and \ndenounce the inquiries we have made, if we go back and look at the \nquestions they asked--my friend from Utah and all the members of the \nJudiciary Committee, the questions they asked of President Clinton's \nnominees--they will see our questions pale in comparison. The questions \nwe asked were exactly the kinds of questions the Founding Fathers \nexpected us to ask to ensure balance in our system of government and \njustice. We asked nearly 100 questions of this nominee and he refused \nto answer all too many of them. He refused to answer most of the \nimportant ones. It is his right to duck or dodge or hide behind legal \nsubterfuge. That he can do. But that doesn't mean we have to confirm \nhim, plain and simple.\n\n  I have sat through a good number of judicial hearings in my years in \nthe Senate. I followed many more in my career in the House. I have \nnever seen such an incredible sense of avoidance and of ultimate \nstonewalling in any confirmation process as I saw when Miguel Estrada \ncame before our committee. I chaired that hearing, as my good friend \nfrom Utah will remember, and one exchange we had was particularly \nmemorable to me. Mr. Estrada kept saying, when we asked him about his \nviews, that he didn't want to discuss it because future cases might \ncome before him.\n  I'm a lawyer. Many of us are lawyers. We know, when you are asked \nwhat's your view of the first amendment, and you say: Well, a case \nmight come before me on the first amendment and I can't discuss it, \nthat is not the appropriate response. Certainly, if we were to ask Mr. \nEstrada how he might rule on, say, WorldCom and the suits against \nWorldCom, or on an existing case before the lower courts, he would have \na right and an obligation not to answer that question. But to say he \ncannot discuss his views of the expansiveness or the narrowness of the \ncommerce clause because eventually he will have to rule on the commerce \nclause makes a mockery of every judicial hearing we have had or will \nhave.\n  But I kept trying. I decided if Mr. Estrada would answer nothing \nabout his prospective views, why not look at what happened in the past.\n  So I asked him to discuss cases that by definition could never come \nbefore him if he were confirmed to a lifetime seat on the District of \nColumbia Circuit. I asked him about Supreme Court cases which are \nalready decided. These cases are already the law of the land and can be \nreconsidered only by the Supreme Court. So there is no fear that a \nnominee would be doing something unethical by taking such a position. \nThere is not only nothing wrong with discussing these cases, but there \nis a lot right about discussing these cases.\n  Answers to these questions will give us insight as to what kind of \njudge he will be:\n  Whether the nominee will fairly assess the claims of average people \nwho want their basic rights vindicated in Federal courts;\n  Whether the nominee will approve the administration's environmental \nrollbacks against the interests of people who would protect the \nenvironment;\n  Whether the nominee has a general inclination to side with business \ninterests or labor interests;\n  And whether this nominee basically supports States' rights or the \nrights of individuals within those States.\n  We have seen in the Supreme Court in the last decade these decisions \nbeing carefully discussed by the Justices with great differences of \nopinion.\n  These are the things the public wants to know. These are the things \nthat determine, in my judgment, whether somebody should become a judge.\n  Everyone in this Chamber will come to a different conclusion once \nthey know those answers. People will weigh answers differently. That is \nfair, and that is good.\n  But there is no question, my colleagues, that we should know \nsomething about how this nominee views the first amendment, the second \namendment, the fourth amendment, the 11th amendment, and the 14th \namendment before we just hand him such an important job.\n  We should know whether the nominee has an expansive view of the \ncommerce clause or a narrow view; an expansive right to privacy or a \nnarrow view.\n  These are the issues that are the sinew, that are the warp and woof \nof what our Republic is about. When the Founding Fathers in their \nbeautiful and infinite wisdom decided that they would be careful with \nthe one unelected branch of government--article III section of \nGovernment, the Judiciary--they knew what they were doing. They didn't \nwant to vest too much power in any one person--the\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\nPresident, any Member of this body--and simply appoint judges, because \nthey knew with a lifetime appointment, which in its wisdom insulates \npeople from the vicissitudes of political pressures--that was too \nserious and solemn a happening to just pass off to one person.\n  So the questions we hoped Mr. Estrada would answer honestly and \nforthrightly are the kinds of questions the American people depend on \nus to ask. These are the kinds of questions that should be answered \nbefore we vote on a nominee. Realizing Mr. Estrada would not answer \nanything about the future, despite the fact that countless others \nhave--it hasn't interfered with their ability to be fine judges--I went \nback and asked him, Mr. Estrada, to answer questions about the past so \nwe might get some feeling for his views. I asked him to name any one \nSupreme Court case from the history of all Supreme Court jurisprudence \nhe was critical of. To the surprise of myself and some on the \ncommittee, he even declined to do that.\n  I asked him to tell me his views on a particular case I disagree \nwith, Buckley v. Valeo. I don't think a millionaire has an absolute \nfirst amendment right to spend all the money he or she wants on putting \non the same political commercial 411 times. I don't think it is what \nthe Founding Fathers intended. There are two views on that. The Court \ndisagrees with me. But I wanted to know Mr. Estrada's view. No matter \nhow many times I tried, no matter how many opportunities he was given, \nMr. Estrada insisted he could not state a view on a single court case--\nnot Korematsu, not Dred Scott, not Plessy 1v. Ferguson, not Brown v. \nBoard of Education, not Miranda v. Arizona, not Griswold v. \nConnecticut, not Roe v. Wade, not a single case.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is it not true that the question the Senator asked was \nwhether he could name three cases in the last 40 years and not in all \nof jurisprudence? The specific question was in the last 3 years, and he \nsaid there were cases. But that is a little different than saying in \nall the jurisprudence.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say to my colleague, if I might reclaim my time, I \nfirst asked him about the first 40 years. And when he refused to answer \nthat, frustrated as I was, I said, How about in all of jurisprudence?\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I just ask the question again? All I wanted to make \nsure of was the Senator said, Please tell us what three cases from the \nlast 40 years of the Supreme Court jurisprudence you are most critical \nof, and just give me all of the sentences and as to why for each one. \nThen Mr. Estrada said, Senator, I think there are cases that I have \nbeen critical of that I can think of--and then he goes on to say more. \nThen you asked again on page 210, With all your legal background and \nlegal work, you can't think of three or even one single case that the \nSupreme Court has decided that you disagree with. And then Mr. Estrada \nsaid he wasn't sure he was even in a position to disagree, et cetera. \nThen on page 211, you then asked this question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Could I reclaim my time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish this one last question. You don't know a \nsingle case in the last 40 years? I will tell you that for me, I think \nBuckley v. Valeo. But all I am trying to say is, Isn't it true that in \nthe last 40 years, not in all jurisprudence.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will say to my colleague, reading from the transcript, \nI asked 40 years first. And then I said to him, So with all of your \nlegal background and your immersion in the legal world, you can't think \nof three or even one single case that the Supreme Court has decided \nthat you disagree with? I didn't say in the last 40 years at that \npoint.\n  Mr. HATCH. On the next page, 40 years.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I asked both, as I said to my colleague. And he didn't \nsay. And I will argue to my colleague--I will not yield on that point--\nI asked him about 40 years. And then I asked him about it permanently \non page 211. But I will say this.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will say this. I think it is amazing he couldn't name \na case he disagreed with in 40 years alone. I don't think that is \nreally the point here, whether it is 40 years or all the way back in \njurisprudence. But I will continue with my remarks, and then I will \nyield for a question.\n\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for one last question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield for one last question.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is on the one page, the first page limited to 40 \nyears, and on the second page it was more broad. But it wasn't clear \nthat it meant all of jurisprudence. On the next page, again, 40 years.\n  That is just my point. All I am saying is in the heat of the moment \nsomeone may not be able to conjure up some cases. But be that as it \nmay, he indicated he had some he was critical of. But I think the \nSupreme Court advocate, not knowing whether he will be confirmed, he \nprobably wasn't about to antagonize anyone on the Court.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is for each of us to judge, whether a nominee who \nis worried about his confirmation should not speak about any case he \nmight disagree with, whether it be 40 years or in all of jurisprudence.\n  But I just wanted to say, if you look at the record, it is clear. I \ngave him many different opportunities to answer that question. I asked \nthe question in different ways. I came back to it. And Mr. Estrada \ndidn't answer. To the average citizen who looked at it, he was \nstonewalling. He was just not giving answers that every law professor, \nor law student, or lawyer when asked would venture a guess at.\n  Let me tell you why many of us think he refused to answer the \nquestion. I would like my colleagues to hear this, because I don't \nthink this has come out. Mr. Estrada stonewalled because that is the \ngame plan he was given by the Justice Department and the White House. \nThey told him not to answer questions. That was what they told him to \ndo. Because again, they know Mr. Estrada's views. They do not want \nanybody else to know, because I believe if they were revealed, they are \nso far out of the mainstream he would not be approved. I don't know if \nthat prediction will prove to be true. Maybe we will know, if we find \nthe views on the issue.\n  But there is no secret to this. This has been the game plan of those \nwho have sought to stack the judiciary to the far right side for years.\n  Let me review with my colleagues an article in the Legal Times which \ntalked about a meeting that Judge Laurence Silberman--a leading \nconservative judge, a very erudite man, but he shared his strategy with \nprospective judicial nominees at a Federalist Society meeting just last \nyear.\n  The Federalist Society is the breeding ground for most of the States \nrights agenda, supporting nominees the administration is sending us. It \nis no secret that Federalist Society members are among the most active \nin the White House and Justice Department in choosing judges. I will \nlet the American people judge for themselves, but most believe the \nFederalist Society is not moderate and not conservative but way over to \nthe hard right.\n  Judge Silberman appeared along with Senator Kyl and Fred Fielding, \nPresident Reagan's counsel, to discuss with the group how to get these \nout-of-the-mainstream nominees on the bench, because they realized if \nthey told the truth, they would have a difficult time because America \nis not far left or far right but moderate.\n  If President Clinton tried to stack the bench with far left nominees, \nwe heard howls. He did not. But that is just what President Bush is \ntrying to do. President Clinton, as I mentioned, nominated mostly \npartners in law firms and prosecutors, not many legal aid society \npeople, not many ACLU advocates. President Bush is not doing the mirror \nimage himself.\n  In any case, this is what was reported about that meeting. And I am \nquoting from an article in the Legal Times:\n\n       President George W. Bush's judicial nominees received some \n     very specific confirmation advice last week:\n\n  This is the article, not me--\n\n       \"Keep your mouths shut.''\n       The warning came from someone who has been a part of the \n     process. Laurence Silberman, a senior judge on the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit--\n\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\n\n  The very court we are talking about--\n\n       Told an audience of 150 at a Federalist Society luncheon \n     that he served as an informal adviser to his then-D.C. \n     Circuit colleague Antonin Scalia when Scalia was nominated to \n     the Supreme Court in 1986.\n\n  This is a quote from the article:\n\n       \"I was his counsel, and I counseled him to say nothing [at \n     his confirmation hearings] concerning any matter that could \n     be thought to bear on any cases coming before the Court,'' \n     Silberman said.\n       Silberman said his advice led to Scalia's speedy \n     confirmation by keeping the nominee out of trouble on Capitol \n     Hill. He also explained that the advice was intended to be \n     rather far-reaching.\n       Scalia called Silberman at one point, the latter recalled, \n     and told him he was about to be questioned about his views \n     about Marbury v. Madison, the nearly 200-year-old case that \n     established the principle of judicial review.\n       \"I told him that as a matter of principle, he shouldn't \n     answer that question either,'' Silberman said. He explained \n     that once a prospective judge discusses any case at all, the \n     floodgates open and he would be forced to discuss other \n     cases.\n\n  Does that help shed some light on why this nominee refused to discuss \nand answer an innocuous softball of a question: to name a case--whether \nit be in the last 40 years or all the way back--with which you \ndisagree?\n  My colleagues, is the idea that a nominee to a powerful lifetime post \non the Federal bench would be ``forced'' to discuss with the Senate his \nor her views on important historical cases really so terrifying?\n  If we cannot talk about Marbury v. Madison with nominees, if we \ncannot discuss the case that provides the foundation for jurisprudence \nin America, we are in pretty bad shape.\n  I was not in the Senate at the time of Justice Scalia's confirmation \nhearing, but I cannot imagine us confirming any nominee refusing to \ndiscuss a case that is 200 years old, a case that establishes the \njudiciary's power.\n  I do not think there was a philosophical reason by Judge Silberman. I \nthink he thought that if the nominee's real views were known, many of \nthe American people would rise up and say: This is not the kind of \nnominee we want. This is the kind of nominee who will not just \ninterpret the laws as the Constitution calls for but make law.\n  It so happens judges on the far right and on the far left have a \nproclivity to want to make law because they feel things are so bad that \nthey have to change them on their own.\n  I have to tell you that a nominee who refuses to discuss the single \nmost important case in the history of the Supreme Court will have a \nhard time winning many Senators' votes. Confirming such a nominee would \nconfirm that the Senate's role is nothing more than a mere formality. \nIf the President picks you, and we cannot find something in your \nancient past, some little personal transgression, then you go to the \nbench.\n  Balance becomes the baby that gets thrown out with the bath water. \nOur system of government gets thrown out of whack.\n  It is very interesting that Mr. Estrada seems to be executing the \nFederalist Society's game plan, remaining silent and stonewalling, \nwhile other nominees, who are generating less opposition, are simply \nanswering questions.\n  There were five district court nominees at the hearing where Mr. \nEstrada testified. Because we spent so much time trying to get answers \nout of Mr. Estrada, we had little time to question each of them. So I \nasked each of them to answer, in writing, the very same question I \nasked of Mr. Estrada. I asked them to identify three Supreme Court \ncases with which they disagree. And do you know what? Each of them \nanswered. Each was able to give me three cases with which they \ndisagreed.\n  Some of them picked obvious cases, such as Korematsu, the Supreme \nCourt case upholding the Government's power to put Japanese-American \ncitizens into interment camps, a case which has been thoroughly \ndiscredited; cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson which held that separate \nwas equal, a case that was later overruled by Brown v. Board of \nEducation. But many of these nominees picked cases that have not been \noverruled.\n  Judge Linda Reade, a judge who I voted for in committee and on the \nfloor--one of 96 judicial nominees by President Bush that I have \nsupported so far, and who we unanimously confirmed to a district court \njudgeship in Iowa--gave some particularly interesting answers.\n  Judge Reade was critical of two Supreme Court cases that expanded \npolice powers and diminished privacy rights under the fourth amendment.\n  One of the these cases, United States v. Rabinowitz, held that police \nhad the power to search someone's office when he was arrested with an \narrest warrant but without a search warrant.\n\n  The other case was Harris v. United States, where the court held, \nagain, that a search of an arrestee's entire four-bedroom apartment was \nconstitutional despite the fact that the police did not have a search \nwarrant.\n  Her concerns about these cases reflected a heightened sensitivity to \nprivacy rights protected by the fourth amendment. I do not want judges \nwho read the fourth amendment so expansively that the police are \nhandcuffed and unable to do their jobs. I want judges who will balance \nprivacy rights with law enforcement interests.\n  Her answers suggested to me that Judge Reade would be attuned to the \nprivacy side of the argument. I may not have fully agreed with her--I \ntend to be more conservative on these criminal justice issues--but I \nappreciated her candor and her forthrightness. I appreciated her \nstraightforwardness. She was not hiding a thing. She was telling us \nwhat she thinks. And I voted for her.\n  Obviously, there is not a single Senator in this body who thinks \nJudge Reade's answers disqualify her for a Federal judgeship. Not a \nsingle one of us objected to her nomination or voted against her. And \nthe same is true of the four other nominees we asked questions of the \nday of Mr. Estrada's hearing. They answered the questions forthrightly. \nThey didn't hide the ball. They appeared to be within the mainstream. \nWe confirmed them all quickly.\n  Just last week we held a confirmation hearing for Jeffrey Sutton, a \nvery controversial nominee to the Sixth Circuit.\n  He is one of the leaders in the States rights movement. He has argued \nmany of the seminal cases, and clearly he evokes much controversy. As \nmy good friend from Utah will recall, the disabled community was so \nupset that they came out in large numbers, and we had to move the \nhearing room to a larger room, to which my friend from Utah graciously \nacceded.\n  I haven't decided how I will vote on Mr. Sutton's nomination, and \nthere are still questions I have asked him to answer. But I will say \nthis about him: He started on the right foot with me by at least \ntelling us what he thinks of some cases. Twice Jeffrey Sutton told us \non his own, without being asked, that he was critical of Supreme Court \ncases Buck v. Bell and Kiryas Joel.\n  When I asked him about other cases he was critical of, he said he had \nproblems with Korematsu and Plessy v. Ferguson. I will grant these are \nnot hard cases to be critical of, and I will repeat that there is still \nground to cover with Mr. Sutton, but at least Mr. Sutton said that much \nand was committed to discussing other cases in writing.\n  Mr. Estrada told us nothing, not a single thing. This is reminiscent \nof what I thought was one of the least fine moments of the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is reminiscent of Clarence Thomas telling America that he \nhad never discussed Roe v. Wade and had no views on the case \nwhatsoever. How many of us believed him then? How many of us believe \nhim now? It is simply not credible. It is totally unbelievable that \nthis nominee, Mr. Estrada, had no critical views on any Supreme Court \ncase in history. Every lawyer in America, and most nonlawyers in \nAmerica, can point to one Supreme Court case he or she is critical of. \nOf course, we all know Mr. Estrada has thoughts on the subject. Every \nsingle person, ask every one of the 100 Senators to bet all their money \non whether Estrada has opinions on certain cases. We would all bet he \ndoes.\n  The bottom line is simple: If we confirm Miguel Estrada, we are \nratifying a ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for judicial nominees. Mr. \nEstrada sat there and said nothing, believing if he didn't say a word, \nwe would rubberstamp him. By remaining silent, Mr. Estrada only \nbuttressed the fear that he is a far-right stealth nominee, a sphinx-\nlike candidate who will drive the Nation's\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\nsecond most important court way out of the mainstream. I had hoped he \nwould choose candor over secrecy. He refused to do so. All he said is: \nI will follow the law.\n  In my book, that doesn't explain much.\n  There is a myth that the law is something automatic, that the facts \nof a case, the applicable statutes can be dumped into a computer, and \nthe right answer will just pop out, that a person's philosophy and \nideology have nothing to do with determining how they vote when they \nget to be a judge. We all know that is poppycock. Anyone who studied \nthe system knows that is not how the law works. If we did, we would \nhave IBM build a computer, put some black robes on the computer, and \nobviate the need for these confirmation hearings or any judges. But we \nall know there is more to judging than that. We all know judges bring \ntheir experiences, their values, their judgment and, yes, their \nideology to the bench with them.\n  If ideology didn't matter, both Republican and Democratic Presidents \nwould nominate judges from across the political spectrum. Instead, \nDemocrats tend to nominate Democrats; Republicans tend to nominate \nRepublicans. That is fine. I know that as long as President Bush is \nPresident, I will be voting on mainly Republican nominees. I still \nvoted for 96 out of 102, as did most of my colleagues. But that \ndoesn't mean we have to rubberstamp each one. And certainly it doesn't \nmean that ideology is in play. If ideology was not in play, if we were \njust relying on the legal quality of the mind, then Estrada's mind is \nof good legal quality, excellent legal quality. But then the appointees \nof Democratic Presidents to the Supreme Court and other courts and the \nappointees of Republican Presidents to the Supreme Court and the other \ncourts would be scattered all over the lot when it came to rendering \ndecisions.\n\n  We know that is not true. There are always exceptions. Earl Warren \nbecame a very liberal Chief Justice although he was nominated by \nPresident Eisenhower. But by and large, the ideology matters. And that \nis why Democratic nominees tend to support different opinions and \ndecisions than Republican nominees. That is our system, and that is \ngreat.\n  But to say ideology doesn't matter would mean President Bush would be \nnominating a whole lot of Democrats for judge and a whole lot of \nmoderate Republicans. He has hardly nominated any of either category. \nThe best you get is someone who is a conservative, not a hard right \nconservative.\n  Now let's go back to Mr. Estrada. There are some other ways to get at \nwhat Mr. Estrada actually believes and how he will act as a judge. By \nthe way, this is all we have. If he refuses to answer questions at a \nhearing, and he doesn't, he is not a judge and he is not a law \nprofessor who opines on these issues.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I inquire from the Senator, how much longer do \nyou think you will be?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would say to my colleague, I will probably be another \n15 minutes. I appreciate it. I rarely speak on the floor very long. I \nspeak often, but usually for 5 or 10-minute amounts. But as my good \nfriend from New Mexico knows, I feel very strongly about this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I had assumed your usual.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will try to finish as quickly as possible, in \ndeference to my good friend from New Mexico.\n  So we don't have much on the record about Mr. Estrada. That is why \nhis papers as Solicitor General mean so much. Because when Mr. Estrada \nworked in the Justice Department, he looked at cases and analyzed them \nand assessed the constitutionality of laws. That is, for all intents \nand purposes, what appellate judges do. Unlike a lawyer in a law firm \nwho is looking out for a client with a vested interest, Mr. Estrada was \nworking for the Government. His client was the Constitution. His memos \nwould help show how he interprets the Constitution. Similar memoranda \nhave been requested and produced when Congress was evaluating other \nnominees, both to the executive and judicial branches, creating ample \nprecedent for such a request.\n  I know there has been a series of letters that have gone back and \nforth. I know we have differing views about the propriety of sharing \nthese memoranda. But one thing is clear, there is precedent because \nothers, including Bradford Reynolds and Justice Rehnquist, submitted \nthose papers. It is clear there is no privilege. And it is clear these \nmemos are needed to lift the veil covering whatever it is Mr. Estrada \nwants to remain covered.\n  So, in other words, because we have so little information on how Mr. \nEstrada thinks, these memos are more important to understand his \nthinking than they would be for the typical judicial nominees.\n  Mr. Estrada did work that was quintessentially judge-like, but we are \nbeing denied the opportunity to examine it, evaluate it, and assess for \nourselves what kind of judge he would be. That doesn't seem right. A \nformer supervisor has charged that Mr. Estrada advocated extreme \npositions, more aligned with his own interests than the Government's \ninterest, when he was Solicitor General.\n  My friend from Utah said at a hearing that he had backed off those \npositions. He has not backed off those positions.\n  Many have said: Well, his evaluations were excellent.\n  We have talked to Mr. Bender, and he has said, first, when you look \nat those evaluations, they don't talk about his views and whether he \nwould have fidelity to the Constitution or try to impose his own views. \nThey talk about whether he was a hard worker. But what Mr. Bender said \nis: Everyone gets checked off excellent on those--we will have to check \nthe record there--because it helps them get merit advancements.\n  So here you have the supervisor saying he was extreme, saying he \nwould take his own views and not follow the law. Guess what the best \nway is to disprove that supervisor. Make the memos public. If the memos \nprove the supervisor wrong, Mr. Estrada has nothing to fear from their \ndisclosure. If the memos prove the supervisor is right, this is someone \nno one in the Senate should want on the DC Circuit.\n  Mr. President, I have always used three criteria in evaluating \njudicial nominees. I call them excellence, moderation, and diversity.\n  Excellence is legal excellence, the quality of the mind. We don't \nwant political hacks on these important courts. No one disputes that \nMr. Estrada passes this point with flying colors. He comes highly \nrecommended in this regard. When the ABA recommends him, that is all \nthey are evaluating.\n  My second criteria is diversity. Clearly, he passes on this point. I \nhave fought for as long as I have been in public service to promote \ndiversity. A principal goal of mine in New York is to put more people \nof color on the Federal bench--and I have, as my record shows. We are \ngoing to talk a lot about the push for diversity, and we are going to \nsee Mr. Estrada is the only Hispanic nominee of President Bush. \nDiversity seems to be limited at this point to Mr. Estrada when it \ncomes to the court of appeals; whereas, those of us on this side, in \nthe Hispanic caucus and others who oppose the nomination, have done far \nmore for diversity than those who claim they are moving its cause \nforward today. In any case, I am for diversity. I will not talk more \nabout that today. I will give that part of the speech next week.\n  The third factor forces me to take the floor today, and that is \nmoderation. I don't like judges too far to the right, and I don't like \nthem too far to the left. To be honest with you, when my judicial \ncommittee sends me recommendations, those are their instructions. I \nthink judges too far left, as well as those too far right, want to make \nthe law, not interpret it. I think they don't belong on the bench, with \ncertain exceptions--rare, but certain.\n  So is Mr. Estrada moderate? Is he even a moderate conservative? Well, \nhe gives every appearance of being extreme. People who know him say \nthat, people who have talked to him about his views. That is one of the \nreasons, again, many of us feel he doesn't want to speak out, because \nif we knew his real views, he might well be rejected. Why has the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, and the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund opposed Mr. \nEstrada? These groups have acted courageously in opposing\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\nhim because they share my commitment to promoting Latinos on the \nFederal judiciary. I have worked with them for years to diversify the \nbench. But the concerns about his views are overwhelming.\n  Let me tell you what Mr. Paul Bender had to say. He oversaw Mr. \nEstrada's work in the Solicitor General's office. He said he was too \nmuch of an ideologue to serve as a Federal judge. Mr. Bender said Mr. \nEstrada would bring his own personal agenda--an extreme agenda--to the \ncourts if we confirm him.\n  My friend from Utah suggested Professor Bender has backed off. I \nassure my colleagues that is not the case. He stands by them 100 \npercent.\n  Again, my friends on the other side have suggested Bender is not \ncredible because he gave Mr. Estrada high marks on his work \nevaluations. Every one of those evaluations went to legal excellence. I \nam not disputing that. Those evaluations did not deal with Mr. \nEstrada's potential extreme ideological nature. But don't take \nProfessor Bender's word for it. Here is what Ann Coulter, the \nconservative pundit and Mr. Estrada's close friend, said about him this \nweek:\n\n       The second [Mr. Estrada] gets in there, he'll overrule \n     everything you love.\n\n  This is a close friend of Mr. Estrada's, a conservative columnist. \nWhat was Ms. Coulter talking about? She was talking to Paul Begala. Was \nshe saying Mr. Estrada will approve the Bush administration's rollback \nof environmental protections? Was she saying he would side with big \nbusiness and special interests against the rights of labor and workers \nevery time?\n  When Ms. Coulter says Miguel Estrada will overrule everything Mr. \nBegala cares about, it is not hard to worry that he will be another in \na long line of rightwing judicial activists who prioritize States' \nrights over people's rights.\n  This is a lifetime appointment. Once it is done, it cannot be undone. \nIf we approve Mr. Estrada, he is there for life and his decisions will \naffect all of us for generations to come. This Senate deserves a full \nand open debate. This Senate deserves answers to questions that may \nsound esoteric but will affect the lives of every single American. The \npeople of this country, the American people, deserve these answers. \nThey are so important to the future of this country.\n  When you have judges who try to make law, they make this Senate, the \nHouse, and the President--the elected branches of Government--less \nsignificant and less important. I say to my colleagues, many of us on \nthis side of the aisle feel very strongly about this issue. We urge Mr. \nEstrada and the administration to reconsider. We urge them to give a \nfulsome view of how Mr. Estrada feels on the important issues of the \nday, and not simply to say he has a good legal mind, not simply to talk \nabout the fact he has a nice history--which he does, and I give him \ncredit for it--but to talk about the main thing that will influence \nwhat he does when he becomes a judge--his views.\n  We will continue this debate over the next few weeks and it could be \none of the Senate's finest moments. I hope--no, I pray--we will rise to \nthe occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, anyone who doubted whether or not \nthere were certain Democrats who intend to filibuster this nomination \njust heard a leading Senator who is going to espouse that. Two weeks of \ndebate, he said; he hopes we will still be discussing this nomination \nthen. It is the desire of at least one Senator, the Senator from New \nYork, that this nominee not be approved, and that we will not have the \nopportunity to vote because they will not give us time.\n  Madam President, I come from a State, New Mexico, where 42 percent of \nthe people are from what we generally call Hispanic descent--42 \npercent. Some people wonder why the Senator from New Mexico has \ndifferent views than some of you around here. Well, we have 8 to 10 \npercent Native American Indians. If my arithmetic is right, when you \nadd the two, there is about 51 percent either Hispanics or Native \nAmerican Indians in my State.\n  I say right up front, I am not afraid of the views of a Hispanic \nwhether he is a Democrat or a Republican. I don't niche Hispanics \nbecause they are Democrats and say they must be liberals who I would \nnot approve for anything. Neither do I niche Republican Hispanics and \nsay because they are Republicans--there is an implication they should \nnot be, they should be Democrats--but if they are, they obviously \nshould not be on the bench because they are obviously too conservative, \nor they would not be Hispanic Republicans.\n  I believe we are perilously close to determining it is OK to \ndiscriminate against Hispanics if they are conservative. I don't even \nknow how conservative Mr. Estrada is, but the allegation is he is too \nconservative. He happens to also be Hispanic.\n  Just imagine, Madam President, if there was a Democrat nominee with \nthe name Espinoza--I just picked one that came to mind--and Republicans \nfound something wrong with him as a candidate--imagine what they might \nbe saying: Republicans oppose a Hispanic for the circuit court of the \nUnited States. They don't want people of color on the circuit court of \nappeals.\n  I have not said that of the Democrats yet, but I am getting \nperilously close to wondering why, if he does not know enough about \nthis nominee, he would call him unqualified for the bench in the \ncircuit court. Is it because of his color? Is it because of from where \nhe came? He epitomizes the American dream beyond what anyone in this \nSenate would probably epitomize. Coming here at 17 years of age and \nspeaking no English; in a short period of time he learned the English \nlanguage; graduated magna cum laude from law school, none other than \nHarvard--and we have people here wondering whether he is qualified.\n  In New Mexico, nobody would say of that man, Miguel Estrada: He is \nnot qualified because he probably is too conservative, because he \njoined the Republican Party or, at least, he is one of them. I believe \nthat would be wrong.\n  Again, I want to make sure everybody understands that I am doing my \nvery best to tell it like I see it, but I am also doing a bit of \nsurmising because my good friend from New York has not been here very \nlong, and we welcome him. But there is no doubt in my mind that if they \never get a nominee on their side of the aisle who is a Hispanic \nDemocrat for the circuit court of the United States and a Republican or \na group of them are against that nominee, they might say the \nRepublicans do not want to put a Hispanic on the bench.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I sat here for 30 minutes. I am very sorry.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. There were Hispanic nominees opposed by your side, and \nwe never raised the issue because they were Hispanic--Paez, Rangel, \nMoreno.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not interrupt his comments when there was \ntremendous opportunity to point out inconsistencies. I made only five \nnotes and I could have stopped and asked him if something he said is \nreally what he meant, but I chose not to. I am going to finish my few \nremarks. I will not be much longer.\n  I did not say that would happen, nor that they were discriminating \nagainst him, but the implication is clearly that it is kind of strange \nthat this bright Hispanic young man is a Republican. I believe that is \nin the marketplace of ideas on the Democratic side.\n  I suggest there are some things happening in our country. In my own \nState, a young Hispanic came up to me the other day from a very large \nfamily--young people, middle-age people, grandmas, grandpas. They all \nhave very beautiful Spanish names for all of those categories of \npeople. He put his arm around me and he said: We have all been \nDemocrats. There are probably 200 people in my family. We have all been \nDemocrats. But you know, I am wondering if I should not join with you \nand become a Republican. It seems like you think like we do, and \nwouldn't it be something if I did and my whole family decided that I \nwas right?\n  I said to him: I believe there are thousands like you who feel that \nway in New Mexico and in our country, and we welcome you.\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\n  If this young man, Miguel Estrada, when he became a citizen, became a \nRepublican--and I do not know that, but there is an implication he is \none of us or he is conservative--I welcome him. I am proud of him. I am \nglad he did it. I do not believe he ought to be eliminated from \nconsideration on the circuit court of appeals or even a higher court \nbecause of that issue. I honestly believe it takes people of diversity \nin our country to join both parties and speak through their ideology \nand their feelings about what they think of our country.\n\n  I am not at all sure the argument being made today by the \ndistinguished Senator from New York is anything other than ``we are \nafraid of this guy; we're not so sure he should be on the bench,'' but \nthey really do not know why.\n  I hope that many Republicans join with Democrats and decide that if \nthe distinguished Senator from New York wants to speak and wants to be \njoined for 2 weeks, that we will do him the favor and let him talk for \n2 weeks. I am not sure our leader will do that because maybe we should \nshut off debate, but maybe it would be doing a favor for America and \nHispanics across this country if we let him speak for 2 weeks. I do not \nthink their cause will get any better. I think it might get even worse \nwith the passage of time.\n  This young man went through all this effort thinking that he might \ncomplete the American dream. What must it have been like for this young \nman who learned English so quickly, went on to school and law school at \nHarvard? He must have thought the American dream for him might mean \nfulfillment as a judge.\n  He was appointed by the President of the United States more than 630 \ndays ago, and instead of a dream, he has had a nightmare. I think it \nshould end. The nightmare should be over. If they would like to make it \n2 weeks longer and want to talk that long in the Senate, I hope the \nSenate insists that those who want to talk long on the Senate floor can \ntalk long.\n  Certainly I am a very knowledgeable Senator about the institution. I \nlove it, where some Senators do not even like to hear people say that. \nThey think we waste too much time; we do this, that, and the other. I \nreally love it. I did not at first, but I do now. I do not believe the \nother side will spend 2 weeks talking about this man unless they \nclearly do not want him to be on the bench, perhaps because of what I \nhave said here; that maybe he does not belong as a Hispanic because, \nafter all, he is conservative. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am one who really cares for the \ndistinguished Senator from New York. I understand him. I know him very \nwell, and I care a great deal for him. He is just totally wrong.\n  For instance, Senator Schumer, the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, submitted no written questions to Mr. Estrada. We waited 631 days \nto have a hearing. They conducted the hearing. The distinguished \nSenator from New York conducted the hearing. He could have asked any \nquestions he wanted. He is saying he did not get good answers. I think \nsome are interpreting that to mean he--or other Democrats as well--did \nnot get the answers he wanted and he could not get anything on this \nman.\n  Following Mr. Estrada's hearing, the distinguished Senator from New \nYork did not submit any questions. That is his right. I think sometimes \nwe do submit too many written questions, and I respect him for not \ndoing that. In fact, only two of my Democratic colleagues submitted any \nwritten questions at all to Mr. Estrada, which, of course, he answered \nimmediately.\n  I find it amusing that the Senator from New York now claims he has \nquestions for Mr. Estrada. If he did, why not write some questions? He \ncertainly had a right to do that. With regard to the hearing testimony, \nMr. Estrada repeatedly answered the questions put to him.\n  Let me give some examples. Mr. Estrada testified he is committed to \nfollowing the precedents of higher courts faithfully and giving them \nfull force and effect, even if he disagrees and even if he believes the \nprecedents are erroneous. He will follow them. That is mainstream. That \nis not out of the mainstream. That is mainstream. I would not support \nanyone who would not answer the question that way.\n  When asked how he would decide cases presenting an issue with no \ncontrolling authority, Mr. Estrada testified: When facing a problem to \nwhich there is not a decisive answer from a higher court, my cardinal \nrule would be to seize it from any place I could get it. He testified \nthis would include related case law and other areas, legislative \nhistory and views of academics.\n  How do you answer better than that? I guess you can using semantics \nthat might be better than that, but I don't think you can do so.\n  When asked if he sees the legal process as a political game, Mr. \nEstrada testified: The first duty of a judge is to self-consciously put \nthat aside and look at each case by withholding judgment with an open \nmind and listening to the parties. So I think that the job of a judge \nis to put all that aside and, to the best of his human capacity, give a \njudgment based solely on the arguments on the law.\n  Mr. Estrada also said: I will follow binding case law in every case. \nI don't even know that I can say whether I concur in the case or not \nwithout actually having gone through the work of doing it from scratch. \nI may have a personal, moral, philosophical view on the subject matter, \nbut I undertake to you I would put all that aside and decide cases in \naccordance with binding case law and even in accordance with the case \nlaw that is not binding but seems instructive on the area without any \ninfluence whatever from any personal view I may have about the subject \nmatter.\n  That is a pretty good answer. I could go on and on.\n  What is clear from his testimony is that Mr. Estrada will be a judge \nwho will set aside his personal convictions, whatever they may be, and \nwill follow the law. This is precisely the type of person we want to be \na Federal judge.\n  I have heard the comments about the Federalist Society for years. The \nFederalist Society does not take positions in the law, but they put on \nthe best seminars and conferences in the country today. And in every \nconference they have put on that I know of since I am a member of the \nboard of advisers, along with a lot of other very distinguished people, \nfar more important than I am, who have been mainstream thinkers through \nall the years, they put on these conferences with both sides being \nfully represented--plenty of Democrats representing the liberal side, \nto be brutally honest about it.\n  Now, let me just put one other thing to bed. I am so doggone tired of \nhearing about this Professor Bender. I ask unanimous consent I be \npermitted to talk about Professor Bender for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. As far as I can tell, Mr. Estrada's primary critic is Paul \nBender, who supervised Mr. Estrada at the Clinton Solicitor General's \noffice. I caution my Democratic colleagues that, before they rely too \nheavily on Mr. Bender to make their case against Mr. Estrada, there are \nmany reasons why Mr. Bender's allegations lack credibility.\n  According to published reports, Mr. Bender himself was the source of \nmuch conflict during his tenure at the Clinton Solicitor General's \noffice.\n  According to published reports, while Mr. Bender was serving as the \nprincipal deputy from 1993 to 1996, about 1/3 of the assistants, \nincluding one 16-year career veteran, left the office.\n  Mr. Bender is an extremist by even the most liberal standards, as his \n30-year history of hostility to Federal efforts to regulate pornography \nillustrates.\n  Mr. Bender has stated publicly that sexually explicit material should \nnot be banned ``any more than material about war, crime, housing, \npoetry and music.''\n  In 1993, Mr. Bender pressed his agenda on pornography while serving \nas principal deputy Solicitor General, forcing President Clinton and \nthe United States Congress--including 9 of my 10 Democratic colleagues \non the Committee--to publicly reject his views.\n  In a case which became a political embarrassment for the Clinton \nAdministration and the Reno Justice Department, Mr. Bender approved a \nbrief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court in September 1993 which sought \nto overturn\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\nthe conviction of a repeat child pornographer and known pedophile.\n  The facts of the Knox case are straightforward. Stephen Knox was \nconvicted of receiving and possessing child pornography under the Child \nProtection Act after the U.S. Customs Service found in Knox's apartment \nseveral videotapes of partially-clad girls--some as young as age ten--\nwearing bathing suits, leotards, or underwear in sexually seductive \nposes.\n  The brief that Mr. Bender approved sought to reverse the previous \nBush Administration's policy of liberally interpreting the Child \nProtection Act to define as child pornography any materials which \nshowed clothed but suggestively posed young children.\n  In response, on November 3, 1993, the United States Senate voted 100-\n0 for a resolution to reject Mr. Bender's position in the case.\n  Upon learning of the Justice Department's position in the case, and \nafter the Senate's unanimous vote denouncing it, President Clinton \nwrote to Attorney General Reno in November 1993 to argue that the \nDepartment's new interpretation of the Child Protection Act left the \nchild pornography law too narrow and emphasized that he wanted ``the \nbroadest possible protections against child pornography and \nexploitation.''\n  In 1994, the House voted 425-3 to condemn the Department's position, \nfinding that Mr. Bender's argument would ``bring back commercial child \npornography and lead to a substantial increase of sexual exploitation \nof children.''\n  Each of my Democratic colleague on the Committee who were Members of \nCongress at the time voted for either the Senate or House resolutions.\n  Bowing to congressional pressure and the rebuke by President Clinton, \nAttorney General Reno reversed Mr. Bender's position and filed her own \nbrief, which restored the first Bush Administration's interpretation of \nthe Child Protection Act.\n  My democratic colleagues who once condemned Mr. Bender now appear to \nrely on his views of Mr. Estrada's qualifications for the federal bench \nand continue to repeat his description of Mr. Estrada as ``an \nideologue.'' I find this illogical, given that their determination in \nthe past that Mr. Bender's views were out of the mainstream.\n  The Knox case is only one example of Mr. Bender's extremism.\n  In 1977, he testified before the Committee against tough anti-child \npornography laws in a hearing entitled ``Protection of Children Against \nSexual Children Against Sexual Exploitation.''\n  According to Mr. Bender's testimony, he rejected the notion that \nCongress could prohibit child pornography in order to protect children \nfrom harm because ``the conclusion that child pornography causes child \nabuse involves too much speculation in view of the social situation as \nwe know it, and the fact that it seems that most kids who act in these \nfilms probably are doing these acts aside from the films anyway. . . \n.''\n\n  This is the hero they are quoting?\n  Mr. Bender testified that in order to prohibit child pornography and \nnot run afoul of the First Amendment, ``you would have to have a \nfinding, based on evidence, that in fact, the distribution of this type \nof film substantially increases the incidence of child abuse before you \ncould possibly support the constitutionality'' of new laws prohibiting \nchild pornography.\n  He noted that, in his experience, ``the estimates of the size of the \npornography problem are usually much, much too large.''\n  Tell that to the millions of people who see child pornography all \nover the internet.\n  Mr. Bender concluded that he ``could not find any discernible harm to \nchildren from being exposed to explicit sexual materials as children . \n. . the harms that we found to children who were exposed to these \nthings were harms that flowed, not from the materials, but from the \nsocial settings in which they saw them.''\n  Mr. Bender's testimony before this Committee exposes his ultra-\nliberal, pro-pornography views that are difficult to characterize as \nanything but out of the mainstream.\n  From 1968 to 1979, Mr. Bender served as the controversial Chief \nCounsel to the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. \nOnce again, his views were roundly rejected by the Senate.\n  Mr. Bender was the architect of the commission's report recommending \nthe abolishment of all federal, state, and local laws interfering with \nthe rights of adults to obtain and view any type of pornography, \nincluding hard-core pornography.\n  Dissenting members of the commission described the Bender Report as a \n``Magna Carta for the pornographer.''\n  In 1970, the Senate vote 60-5 for a resolution rejecting the \nCommission's report and recommendations, with nine additional Senators \nannouncing that if they had been present they would have supported the \nresolution.\n  No current member of the Senate supported Mr. Bender's views.\n  One Democratic Senator noted during the debate on the resolution \nthat:\n       The Congress might just as well have asked the \n     pornographers to write the report, although I doubt that even \n     they would have had the temerity and effrontery to make the \n     ludicrous recommendations that were made by the Commission.\n\n  Mr. Bender's extreme views aren't limited to pornography. In 1998, he \nargued that convicted murderer James Hamm should be admitted to the \nArizona bar. Hamm was convicted in 1974 and sentenced to 25 years to \nlife after pleading guilty to killing a Tucson, AZ man during a drug \ndeal. Mr. Bender, who taught Hamm constitutional law at Arizona State \nLaw School, called him ``a poster boy for rehabilitation in prison'' \nand argued that he should be admitted to the bar because ``he's not \ngoing to steal from clients or file frivolous suits.''\n  Mr. Bender's views are certainly out of the mainstream of society in \ngeneral. What's more, he appears to be out of the mainstream even among \nformer members of the Clinton administration--hardly a conservative \nbunch--when it comes to Mr. Estrada.\n  Ron Klain, former chief of staff to Vice President Gore, praised Mr. \nEstrada, saying that he would be able to ``faithfully follow the law.'' \nRon Klain was a former member of the Judiciary Committee. He is a \nwonderful Democrat and, no question, he's a wonderful attorney. We all \nknow him and appreciate him and respect him.\n  Former Solicitor General Drew Days opined of Mr. Estrada, ``I think \nhe's a superb lawyer.''\n  Another Clinton era Solicitor General, Seth Waxman, called Mr. \nEstrada an ``exceptionally well-qualified appellate advocate.'' Seth \nWaxman was a great Solicitor General. We all respect him. I know him \npersonally. He's a very fine lawyer and a wonderful Democrat. I'm not \ncalling him a wonderful Democrat because he's on our side with Estrada. \nI am calling him that because that's the way he is. He's a great \nattorney. I strongly supported him at that time.\n  Randolph Moss, former Chief of the Justice Department's Office of \nLegal Counsel, wrote the Committee:\n\n       to express my strong support for the nomination of Miguel \n     Estrada . . . . Although I am Democrat and Miguel and I do \n     not see eye-to-eye on every issue, I hold Miguel in the \n     highest regard, and I urge the Committee to give favorable \n     consideration to his nomination.\n\n  These are people who know him forward and backwards, who know what a \ngreat lawyer he is. These are mainstream Democrats calling him a \nmainstream person, we ought to listen to them.\n  And Robert Litt, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Clinton \nJustice Department, said:\n\n       Miguel has an absolutely brilliant mind. He is a superb \n     analytical lawyer and he's an outstanding oral advocate.\n\n  With all of this glowing support from former high-ranking, well \nrespected Clinton administration lawyers, you have to wonder why my \nDemocratic colleagues choose to listen instead to the unsubstantiated \ncriticisms of Mr. Bender, a liberal extremist whose out-of-the-\nmainstream views have been twice condemned by the U.S. Senate.\n  There are many reasons to discredit Paul Bender's criticisms of Mr. \nEstrada. That is why I am taking this time to do it and I will try to \nfinish so the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts can have the \nfloor.\n  There are many reasons to discredit Paul Bender's criticisms of Mr. \nEstrada, not the least of which is the fact that he is the lone voice \nof criticism amid a sea of admiration and praise for Mr. Estrada.\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\n  One of Mr. Estrada's most ardent supporters from the Clinton \nadministration is Seth Waxman, who specifically disputed Mr. Bender's \ncriticisms of Mr. Estrada, yet they are being brought up on the floor \nagain. There is a time to quit bringing these types of people to try to \nhurt Mr. Estrada. Let me read you what Mr. Waxman said in a letter to \nthe Committee dated September 17, 2001.\n\n       I understand from published reports that . . . Paul \n     Bender[] has criticized Mr. Estrada's professional conduct \n     while in the Solicitor General's Office. I do not share those \n     criticisms at all. During the time Mr. Estrada and I worked \n     together, he was a model of professionalism and competence. \n     In no way did I ever discern that the recommendations Mr. \n     Estrada made or the analyses he propounded were colored in \n     any way by his personal views--or indeed that they reflected \n     any consideration other than the long-term interests of the \n     United States. I greatly enjoyed working with Miguel, \n     profited from our interaction, and was genuinely sorry when \n     he decided to leave the office in favor of private practice.\n       Much has been said about Mr. Estrada's views regarding \n     policy and social issues. I have never had a conversation \n     with Mr. Estrada about either. To my mind--and I believe Mr. \n     Estrada's as well--those views were entirely irrelevant to \n     the work we had before us in the Solicitor General's office. \n     I have great respect both for Mr. Estrada's intellect and for \n     his integrity.\n\n  Now, this is not some right-wing fanatic who is praising Mr. \nEstrada's intellect and integrity. This is former Clinton Solicitor \nGeneral Seth Waxman. Can there be any genuine doubt about his \nsincerity? The answer is no.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2001.\n     Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Re: Miguel Estrada\n\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch: During much of the \n     year in which I served as Principal Deputy Solicitor General \n     (1996-1997), Miguel Estrada and I were colleagues. I \n     understand from published reports that my predecessor, Paul \n     Bender, has criticized Mr. Estrada's professional conduct \n     while in the Solicitor General's Office. I do not share those \n     criticisms at all. During the time Mr. Estrada and I worked \n     together, he was a model of professionalism and competence. \n     In no way did I ever discern that the recommendations Mr. \n     Estrada made or the analyses he propounded were colored in \n     any way by his personal views--or indeed that they reflected \n     any consideration other than the long-term interests of the \n     United States. I greatly enjoyed working with Miguel, \n     profited from our interactions, and was genuinely sorry when \n     he decided to leave the office in favor of private practice.\n       Much has been said about Mr. Estrada's views regarding \n     policy and social issues. I have never had a conversion with \n     Mr. Estrada about either. To my mind--and I believe Mr. \n     Estrada's as well--those views were entirely irrelevant to \n     the work before us in the Solicitor General's office. I have \n     great respect both for Mr. Estrada's intellect and for his \n     integrity.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                   Seth P. Waxman.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I will put Seth Waxman up against Paul Bender any day, any \ntime, anywhere. This is not some right-wing fanatic.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to permit my friend and colleague \nto complete his thought, but we are trying to get some idea--\n  Mr. HATCH. I think I will only be a few more minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe there was an order before the Senate that I be \nrecognized at 5:40, as I understood it?\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, you were not here at the time and I \nhad to make these points.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe I was in the Chamber at 5:40. I heard the \nSenator speak at that time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will try to finish as soon as I can. As I understand it, \nI have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah does have the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will certainly try--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just as an parliamentary inquiry, what was the \nunderstanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order was to recognize the Senator from \nMassachusetts at 5:40. But the Senator was not present at that time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And what is the time now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is 5:56.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I wasn't here at 5:40. I think I was at the \nentrance to the Chamber when the Senator asked consent to be able to \nproceed. If he wants to take advantage of that, so be it. But I think \nthat it is unfortunate and unfair.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I might remark, I have been a friend of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for a long time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just stated that--\n  Mr. HATCH. Who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. You have the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been his friend for a long time, and I am going to \nfinish this very quickly in deference to him. But he wasn't here. I did \nnot see him at the door. And I had to make these comments because of \nsome of the comments that were made that I thought were improper, \nagainst Mr. Estrada. And I am going to defend Mr. Estrada on the floor \nwhen these kinds of comments are made. I think it is the right thing to \ndo. I am certainly not trying to take advantage of the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts, but I exercise my rights as a coequal \nSenator. Let me just finish this, and I will do it as quickly as I can.\n  Mr. President, at the request of the Committee, Mr. Estrada provided \ncopies of his annual performance evaluations during this tenure at the \nSolicitor General's office. These documents cast serious doubt on Mr. \nBender's allegations about Mr. Estrada.\n  The evaluations show that during each year that Mr. Estrada worked at \nthe SG's Office, he received the highest possible rating of \n``outstanding'' in every job performance category.\n  The rating official who prepared and signed the performance reviews \nfor 1994 to 1996 was none other than Paul Bender.\n  Let me read a few excerpts from the evaluations that Mr. Bender \nsigned. They say that Mr. Estrada:\n\n       States the operative facts and applicable law completely \n     and persuasively, with record citations, and in conformance \n     with court and office rules, and with concern for fairness, \n     clarity, simplicity, and conciseness. . .\n       Is extremely knowledgeable of resource materials and uses \n     them expertly; acting independently, goes directly to point \n     of the matter and gives reliable, accurate, responsive \n     information in communicating positions to others. . .\n       All dealings, oral, and written, with the courts, clients, \n     and others are conducted in a diplomatic, cooperative, and \n     candid manner.\n\n  I might add this doesn't sound like some radical rightwing fanatic \nsome would portray Mr. Estrada as.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       All briefs, motions or memoranda reviewed consistently \n     reflect no policies at variance with Departmental or \n     Governmental policies, or fails to discuss and analyze \n     relevant authorities. . .\n       Is constantly sought for advice and counsel. Inspires co-\n     workers by example.\n\n  These comments represent Mr. Bender's contemporaneous evaluation of \nMr. Estrada's legal ability, judgment, temperament, and reputation for \nfairness and integrity.\n  In short, these comments unmask Mr. Bender's more recent statements, \nmade after Mr. Estrada's nomination, for what they are: A politically \nmotivated effort to smear Mr. Estrada and hurt his chances for \nconfirmation.\n  The performance evaluations confirm what other Clinton Administration \nlawyers, and virtually every other lawyer who knows Mr. Estrada, have \nsaid about him: That is he a brilliant attorney who will make a fine \nfederal judge.\n  Having said all that, I apologize to my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor having to make these comments after the comments made by the \ndistinguished Senator from New York. But I think I would have been \nremiss had I not made those comments to correct the Record to show this \nman Bender may be a law professor at an institution in the West, but he \ncertainly has not been very fair to Mr. Estrada. And his own reputation \nwould lead one to believe he is not worth listening to with regard to \nhis opinion, which I believe and I think any fair person would believe \nwas nothing but a politically motivated smear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, as I stated at the hearing, \nthe personal attacks on Paul Bender are really beneath this body. Paul \nBender has a long and esteemed history in public and private practice. \nHe clerked for Felix Frankfurter on the Supreme Court. He argued dozens \nof cases before the Supreme Court. He taught constitutional law at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania and the University of Arizona. To criticize \nPaul Bender because you disagree with his statements is also chilling \nto anyone who wishes to express their personal opinions about a \nnominee. I really hope we can talk about the issues without resorting \nto personal attacks.\n  Others as well have echoed the Bender criticism.\n  Among the great debates at the Constitutional Convention two \ncenturies ago was the issue of judicial appointments. Initially, there \nwas broad agreement among the delegates that either the Senate alone or \nthe legislature as a whole should appoint federal judges, and in June \nof 1787, the delegates tentatively adopted a proposal to give the \nappointment power to the Senate. But opposition soon arose. The \ndelegates re-opened the issue and considered alternatives such as \ngiving the power of appointment to both the Senate and the House, or to \nthe President with the advice and consent of Congress, or to the \nPresident alone.\n  After months of debate, the issue was finally resolved in September. \nIt was decided the President was to nominate, and the Senate would be \nasked to concur before the appointment could be made. The Framers \nbelieved that one person should have the responsibility for nominating \njudges, but they clearly wanted to avoid vesting too much power on this \nissue in the President. The Senate would have the power to prevent the \nPresident from shaping a judiciary in his own image. As Alexander \nHamilton said in Federalist No. 77, ``If by influencing the President \nmeant restraining him, this is precisely what must have been \nintended.''\n  By requiring the President and the Senate to share the responsibility \nof appointing federal judges, the Framers created one of the most \nimportant checks and balances in the Constitution and laid a solid \nfoundation for the independence of the judiciary that has served the \nNation so well.\n  In keeping with this shared responsibility, the Senate must fulfill \nits constitutional duty to review the nominations sent to us by \nPresident Bush--including the nomination of Miguel Estrada. We must \nassure ourselves that every nominee has the qualifications, \ntemperament, and commitment to enforcing the constitutional and federal \nstatutory protections that are central to our American democracy.\n  This is not a role we take lightly. At stake are lifetime \nappointments to courts that have the power to make far-reaching \ndecisions affecting the lives of our people and the life of our Nation. \nThe D.C. Circuit is one of the most important courts in the country--\nsecond only to the Supreme Court. It is particularly important to \nworkers, immigrants, and those seeking to enforce their civil rights. \nIt has a unique and prominent role among the Federal courts of appeals, \nparticularly in the area of administrative law, and has exclusive \njurisdiction over many workplace, environmental, civil rights, and \nconsumer protection statutes.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Estrada would make decisions about the rights of \nworkers. He would decide cases involving the right to form a union \nwithout intimidation by an employer and cases that affect health and \nsafety rules and regulations--regulations affecting workers exposed to \ntuberculosis, and dangerous, even toxic, chemicals. These problems \naren't going away--they are increasing. The administration continues to \nissue anti-worker Executive Orders and undermine the labor rights of \nairline workers. It refuses to put a plan in place to address the \nserious problem of ergonomic injuries in the workplace. We need judges \nwho will interpret the law fairly--not judges tied to special interests \nthat drive the administration's agenda.\n  In recent years, the D.C. Circuit has become a safe haven for \nemployers eager to defy the orders of the National Labor Relations \nBoard. In 1980, 83 percent of all NLRB decisions were enforced in full \nby the D.C. Circuit. Deference was given to the Board by the court. In \n2000, however, only 57 percent of NLRB decisions were enforced in full. \nTime after time, the closely-divided D.C. Circuit has refused to defer \nto the NLRB's expertise.\n  Jose Castro knows that one judge's vote can make a difference. A few \nyears ago, the Hoffman Plastics Company fired workers in retaliation \nfor their attempts to organize a union. In response, the National Labor \nRelations Board ordered reinstatement and backpay for the workers \naffected. The board later denied reinstatement and granted only limited \nbackpay to Mr. Castro, an undocumented worker. When Hoffman Plastics \nchallenged the board's decision, the D.C. Circuit--in a 5 to 4 \ndecision--rejected the employer's argument and enforced the board's \norder. The court determined that the board had appropriately crafted \nits order to take into account the policies underlying both the \nNational Labor Relations Act and the Immigration Reform and Control \nAct.\n  Last year, however, the Supreme Court reversed the board and the D.C. \nCircuit and held--in a 5 to 4 decision--that many immigrant workers are \nnot entitled to backpay remedies under the National Labor Relations \nAct. The Supreme Court's decision affects as many as 6 million \nimmigrant workers across the United States, and employers have used it \nto claim that those workers have no labor protections.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Estrada would make decisions about our \nenvironmental laws--such as challenges to clean water regulations, \nSuperfund clean-up of toxic sites, and Clean Air Act regulations. He \nwill decide cases such as American Trucking Associations v. EPA, which \ndenied EPA the authority to establish health standards for smog and \nsoot. The issue in that case directly affects the thousands of children \nwho suffer and die from asthma every year.\n  Mr. Estrada will be making these decisions as the Bush administration \ntakes dramatic steps to curtail enforcement of our environmental laws. \nThe administration has proposed rules to remove 20 million acres of \nwetlands from Federal protection, new regulations to weaken national \nforest protections enacted by the Reagan administration, approved \nnatural gas drilling in Texas along the Nation's longest stretch of \nundeveloped beach, and proposed to scale back environmental reviews and \njudicial oversight over national forests and public lands.\n  Mr. Estrada will also make decisions about the enforcement of our \nnation's civil rights laws when he reviews race, gender, and disability \ndiscrimination cases like Kolstad v. American Dental Association. \nCarole Kolstad sued her employer for gender discrimination, and a one-\nvote majority of the D.C. Circuit upheld a very high standard for the \ncollection of punitive damages. The Supreme Court later vacated the \nD.C. Circuit's decision, but once again it is clear that one vote can \nmake a difference on the D.C. Circuit.\n  The question before the Senate is what role Mr. Estrada will play on \nthis important court and in the lives of the American people. Will he \nbe a fair and impartial advocate for the law and the Constitution, or \nwill he be at the forefront of efforts to deny basic rights and \nprotections for those who need them?\n  Mr. Estrada's record and his testimony before the Judiciary Committee \nprovides little information and even less assurance that he is the \nright person for this important position. It is difficults--if not \nimpossible--for us to exercise our constitutional duty of advice and \nconsent, and to satisfy ourselves that Mr. Estrada is fit for a \nlifetime appointment without full information. Yet, Mr. Estrada remains \na mystery. He refused to provide candid answers to questions during his \nhearing or in writing to the committee. And the Justice Department \nrefuses to provide memoranda produced by Mr. Estrada when he served in \nthe Solicitor General's office.\n  These Solicitor General memoranda would be helpful in understanding \nMr. Estrada's fitness for a judgeship. They would aid us in determining \nhow he would approach the complex task of judging, and whether he would \nbe able to separate his own personal views from an objective analysis \nof the law. This administration and previous administrations have \nprovided us with this kind of information in the past, and it is \nincumbent upon the administration to provide the Senate with the\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\ninformation necessary to evaluate nominees to our Nation's Federal \ncourts.\n  The little we do know of Mr. Estrada's record raises grave concerns. \nIn fact, his direct supervisor in the Office of the Solicitor General \nhas raised questions about whether Mr. Estrada has the temperament and \nrequisite moderation to sit on the D.C. Circuit. The supervisor, Mr. \nBender, has expressed his belief that Mr. Estrada would have difficulty \nseparating himself from his personal ideological views.\n  It has been reported, for instance, that some of Mr. Estrada's \ncolleagues have said that he is not openminded and that he ``does not \nlisten to other people.'' After an in-depth meeting with Mr. Estrada, a \nmember of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus stated that Mr. Estrada \nappeared to have a ``very short fuse'' and that he did not ``have the \njudicial temperament that is necessary to be a judge.'' According to \nthe Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, with whom Mr. Estrada met, he was \nnot ``even-tempered\"--he became angry during their meetings with him, \nand he even threatened the group with legal action because they had \nraised concerns about his record.\n  These reports are very troubling. What we seek in our judges is a \nquality that makes them more than just talented lawyers or advocates. \nWe want to know that a judge is openminded and fair. I am not persuaded \nthat Mr. Estrada possesses the key qualities of moderation, openness \nand fairness required of our judges.\n  The cases that Mr. Estrada has made the primary focus of his pro bono \nactivity also raise concerns about whether he will be fair in the wide \nrange of cases that come before him. In two cases, Mr. Estrada tried to \nlimit the first amendment rights of minorities to congregate and \nassociate on public streets. He also sits on the board of the Center \nfor Community Interest, which advocates the kind of police tactics that \nhave often led to harassment and racial profiling in minority \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Estrada's single-minded focus on justifying such ordinances is \ncause for great concern. Even after the clear rebuke from the Supreme \nCourt about the Chicago ordinance, he devoted many hours to defending \nthe City of Annapolis against challenges to the constitutionality of \nits own antiloitering ordinance. When the NAACP challenged the \nordinance, Mr. Estrada ``offered to take the city's case all the way to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary, free of charge.'' Mr. Estrada \nlost that case, too, however, when a Federal district court struck down \nthe law as unconstitutional.\n  We know that decades of important civil rights precedents may well be \nat stake in coming years. These issues raise very serious concerns \nabout Mr. Estrada's nomination. He is an intelligent and talented \nlawyer. But that is not enough. To serve as a Federal judge--\nparticularly on the second most important court in the land requires a \ncommitment to the core constitutional values of our democracy. It \nrequires the special qualities that enable judges to meet their own \nimportant responsibilities--fairness, impartiality, and openmindedness.\n  There is nothing anti-Latino about our objections to Mr. Estrada. \nPresident Bush has nominated five Latinos to the Federal courts, four \nof whom were confirmed last year, when the Democrats controlled the \nSenate. It is the Democrats who have taken the lead in appointing \nLatinos to the Federal courts. During the Clinton administration, 23 \nLatino nominees were confirmed to the Federal courts--more than in any \nprevious administration, Republican or Democrat. More Latinos would \nhave been confirmed had it not been for the unfair tactics of Senate \nRepublicans.\n  In fact, five Latino nominees sent to the Senate by President Clinton \nwere not confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Two of them, \nnominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals from Texas, were not \neven given hearings. One waited more than a year in the Senate before \nhis nomination was returned to the President because of inaction by the \nJudiciary Committee. The other waited more than a year, and was then \nrenominated by President Clinton in January of 2001, but President Bush \nwithdrew it.\n  All five Latino nominees blocked by Senate Republicans had the full \nsupport of the Latino community--but the same cannot be said of Mr. \nEstrada. The major Latino organizations have raised strong concerns \nabout Mr. Estrada. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has opposed his \nnomination. The Latino organizations opposing or raising concerns about \nMr. Estrada include: the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, the \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, the National Association of Latino \nElected and Appointed Officials, the National Council of La Raza, the \nCalifornia La Raza Lawyers, the Southwest Voter Registration Project, \nand the Illinois Puerto Rican Bar Association.\n  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has told the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that Mr. Estrada does not meet their criteria for endorsement \nof a nominee. As the letter they sent to the committee states:\n\n       The appointment of a Latino to reflect diversity is \n     rendered meaningless unless the nominee can demonstrate an \n     understanding of the historical role courts have played in \n     the lives of minorities in extending equal protections and \n     rights; has some involvement in the Latino community that \n     provides insight into the values and mores of the Latino \n     culture in order to understand the unique legal challenges \n     facing Latinos; and recognizes both the role model \n     responsibilities he or she assumes as well as having an \n     appreciation for protecting and promoting the legal rights of \n     minorities who historically have been the victims of \n     discrimination.\n       Based on the totality of the nominee's available record and \n     our meeting with him, Mr. Estrada fails to meet the CHC's \n     criteria for endorsing a nominee.\n\n  The Mexican American Legal Defense Fund opposes Mr. Estrada as well. \nAccording to their statement:\n\n       The most difficult situation for any Latino organization is \n     when a President nominates a Latino who does not reflect, \n     resonate or associate with the Latino community, and who \n     comes with a predisposition to view claims of racial \n     discrimination and unfair treatment with suspicion and doubt \n     instead of with an open mind. Unfortunately, the only Latino \n     whom President Bush has nominated in two years to any Federal \n     circuit court in the country is such a person. President Bush \n     nominated Mr. Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       After a thorough examination of his record, his \n     confirmation hearing testimony, and his written answers to \n     the U.S. Senate, we announce today our formal opposition to \n     his nomination. We cannot in good conscience stand on the \n     sideline and be neutral on his nomination or others like his. \n     We oppose his nomination and that of others that will prevent \n     the courts from serving as the check and balance so \n     desperately needed by our community to the actions being \n     taken by the executive and legislative branches.\n\n  Recently, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund also issued a statement \nreaffirming its opposition to Mr. Estrada's nomination.\n  Many of us have deep concerns about Mr. Estrada's record and his \nunwillingness to supplement the record with answers to important \nquestions or production of the memoranda from his days in the Solicitor \nGeneral's office.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this nomination. A lifetime appointment \nto a court so important in deciding so many basic issues should not be \ngiven to a nominee about whom we know so little.\n  The basic values of our society--whether we will continue to be \ncommitted to equality, opportunity, freedom of expression, the right to \nprivacy, and many other fundamental rights--are at stake in all of \nthese nominations. On the role of the Senate in the appointment \nprocess, the genius of the Constitution is the clear system of checks \nand balances that it provides. The Constitution says ``advice and \nconsent''--not ``rubber stamp.'' When this or any other administration \nnominates judges who would weaken the core values of our country and \nroll back the basic rights that make our country a genuine democracy, \nthe Senate should reject them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I rise in support of Miguel \nEstrada, the nominee for the 12th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  It is an honor to serve my State of Georgia in this great \ninstitution, and I am pleased that the work we are undertaking today \npertains to such an important issue for our country--filling the \nvacancies in our courts with good and honorable judges.\n  One of the most important burdens that has been placed on the \nshoulders\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\nof the Senate is the sanction of Federal judges. I relish this task \nbecause it grants us an opportunity to have a hand in the future of the \nlaws that govern this great land. And there is no better way to help \ncraft the America of the next generation, the America to be served by \nour children and our grandchildren.\n  Before I came to Congress, I practiced law for 26 years and I can say \nthat it is rare to meet someone as qualified for the bench as Miguel \nEstrada. The American Bar Association unanimously rated Mr. Estrada as \n``well qualified.'' I understand that some of my colleagues in the past \nhave referred to this rating as the ``gold standard'' for judicial \nnominees. It seems then that a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating \nshould speak volumes about Mr. Estrada's merit.\n  Some critics have said that Mr. Estrada should not be confirmed \nbecause he lacks judicial experience. I would simply highlight the \nexamples of Justice White and Chief Justice Rehnquist. Both men had no \nprior judicial experience when they were appointed to the Supreme \nCourt. Also on the same court that Mr. Estrada would join, five of the \neight sitting judges had no prior judicial experienced, two of which \nwere nominated by President Clinton.\n  Mr. Estrada, however, has had exceptional experience both in the \ngovernment and in private practice. From 1992 to 1997, he served in the \nClinton administration as Assistant to the Solicitor General in the \nDepartment of Justice. He has argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court \nand is widely regarded as one of America's leading appellate advocates. \nHe is currently a partner for a leading law firm with their appellate \nand constitutional law practice group. I believe that this represents \nsufficient experience for his nomination.\n  Another argument made by some is that Mr. Estrada has refused to \nproduce confidential memoranda that he wrote when he was with the \nSolicitor General's office. I would argue that this request, if met, \nwould have a debilitating effect on the ability of the Department of \nJustice to represent the United States before the Supreme Court and I \nhave a letter signed by every living former Solicitor General--Democrat \nand Republican alike--saying the same. I would ask unanimous consent to \nprint this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    June 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our concern about \n     your recent request that the Department of Justice turn over \n     ``appeal recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and \n     amicus recommendations'' that Miguel Estrada worked on while \n     in the Office of the Solicitor General.\n       As former heads of the Office of the Solicitor General--\n     under Presidents of both parties--we can attest to the vital \n     importance of candor and confidentiality in the Solicitor \n     General's decisionmaking process. The Solicitor General is \n     charged with the weighty responsibility of deciding whether \n     to appeal adverse decisions in cases where the United States \n     is a party, whether to seek Supreme Court review of adverse \n     appellate decisions, and whether to participate as amicus \n     curiae in other high-profile cases that implicate an \n     important federal interest. The Solicitor General has the \n     responsibility of representing the interests not just of the \n     Justice Department, nor just of the Executive Branch, but of \n     the entire federal government, including Congress.\n       It goes without saying that, when we made these and other \n     critical decisions, we relied on frank, honest, and thorough \n     advice from our staff attorneys, like Mr. Estrada. Our \n     decisionmaking process required the unbridled, open exchange \n     of ideas--an exchange that simply cannot take place if \n     attorneys have reason to fear that their private \n     recommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to \n     public disclosure. Attorneys inevitably will hesitate before \n     giving their honest, independent analysis if their opinions \n     are not safeguarded from future disclosure. High-level \n     decisionmaking requires candor, and candor in turn requires \n     confidentiality.\n       Any attempt to intrude into the Office's highly privileged \n     deliberations would come at the cost of the Solicitor \n     General's ability to defend vigorously the United States' \n     litigation interests--a cost that also would be borne by \n     Congress itself.\n       Although we profoundly respect the Senate's duty to \n     evaluate Mr. Estrada's fitness for the federal judiciary, we \n     do not think that the confidentiality and integrity of \n     internal deliberations should be sacrificed in the process.\n           Sincerely,\n       On behalf of: Seth P. Waxman, Walter Dellinger, Drew S. \n     Days, III, Kenneth W. Starr, Charles Fried, Robert H. Bork, \n     Archibald Cox.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Also, as we have heard, Mr. Estrada has a great story; \nhe is accomplished, competent, and experienced. This man came to \nAmerica to seek the American Dream and he is now living that dream. He \ncame to the United States from Honduras when he was seventeen years old \nand has spent his life gaining credibility as a Hispanic man of \ndistinction. If confirmed, Mr. Estrada would break a glass ceiling by \nbeing the first Latino judge to serve on the DC Court of Appeals. \nHowever, if he is not confirmed, it would not just be terrible for the \nDistrict of Columbia, but it would send the wrong message to Hispanic \ncommunities in my home state of Georgia and across the nation. But I \nwould say to my colleagues that you should not vote for Miguel Estrada \nbecause he is Hispanic, you should vote to confirm him because he is a \nworld-class laywer and he will make a world-class judge.\n  Mr. Estrada is a great lawyer and will make a superb judge. He has \nthe qualifications, the capacity, the integrity, and the temperament to \nserve on the federal bench. I was happy to support his nomination last \nweek in the Judiciary Committee and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the President's nominee for this important position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, just a few remarks. The distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts is very concerned about this court and how \njudges function on it, as am I. It is a very important court. In fact, \nnext to the Supreme Court, it is the next most important court in the \ncountry--no question about it--because the decisions they make affect \nalmost every American in many instances.\n  In terms of straightforward application of the law, the DC Circuit is \none of the best functioning courts in the country. Recent years have \nseen DC circuit judges agreeing in the overwhelming majority of cases, \nincluding ones of great political significance, even when Republicans \noutnumbered Democrats six to four.\n  I might also add that the DC Circuit is in the midst of a vacancy \ncrisis unseen in recent memory. Only eight of the court's 12 authorized \njudgeships currently are filled. In the past 2 years, two of the \ncourt's judges have taken senior status.\n  The DC Circuit has not been down to eight active judges since 1980. \nIt is a crisis situation because it is extremely important. The vacancy \ncrisis is substantially interfering with the DC Circuit's ability to \ndecide cases in a timely fashion. As a result, litigants find \nthemselves waiting longer and longer for the court to resolve their \ndisputes. Because so many DC Circuit Court cases involve constitutional \nand administrative law, this means that the validity of challenged \ngovernment policies is likely to remain in legal limbo.\n  In the 2001-2002 term, the court had to cancel several scheduled days \nof oral argument. As a result, cases that would have been heard in \n2001-2002 will not be heard until September of 2002 at the earliest. \nFor the 2002-2003 term, the court will be able to hear cases on just 96 \ndays and will be able to schedule just 336 cases. Because of the \nlimited number of sitting days, the court's oral argument calendar is \nalready nearly full through March of 2003.\n  The vacancy crisis is also interfering with the operation of the \ncourt's emergency panel which hears emergency cases and various \nmotions. Because only seven judges are now available for emergency \npanels, each one has to serve 6 weeks of overtime emergency duty on top \nof the 16 weeks he or she ordinarily serves throughout the year.\n  The court often has been forced to constitute emergency panels with \nfewer than the usual complement of three judges.\n  The chief judge of the DC Circuit, at a recent circuit conference \nsaid:\n\n       If the court does not have additional judges soon, our \n     ability to manage our workload in a timely fashion will be \n     seriously compromised.\n\n  He further explained that:\n\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\n\n       . . . it is clear that the Senate's inaction is coming to \n     jeopardize the administration of justice in this Circuit.\n\n  That is important stuff. It is really important that we put Miguel \nEstrada on the court.\n  We have had some comments about a few Latino groups that are known \nfor liberal politics and have been opposed to Miguel Estrada. Let me \nlist a few groups that support him. The following groups are just some \nthat have announced support for him: League of United Latin American \nCitizens, LULAC, the Nation's oldest and largest Hispanic civil rights \norganization; U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation; Hispanic Association of Corporate Responsibility; \nAssociation for the Advancement of Mexican Americans; MANA, a national \nLatina organization; Cuban American National Council; U.S.-Mexico \nChamber of Commerce; Hispanic Business Roundtable; The Latino \nCoalition; National Association of Small Disadvantaged Businesses; \nMexican American Grocers Association; Phoenix Construction Services; \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas City; HEBC, Hispanic \nEngineers Business Corporation; Hispano Chamber of Commerce de Las \nCruces; Casa Del Sinaloense; Republican National Hispanic Assembly; \nHispanic Engineers Business Corporation; Hispanic Contractors of \nAmerica; Charo, Community Development Corporation; Cuban American \nNational Foundation.\n  The League of United Latin American Citizens is the oldest Hispanic \ncivil rights organization. Established in 1927, it has more than 700 \ncouncils and more than 120,000 individual members.\n  The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce was established in 1979, with a \nnetwork of more than 200 local chambers across the country, and it \nadvocates on behalf of the 1.8 million Hispanic-owned businesses in the \ncountry.\n  The Hispanics National Bar Association was established in 1972 and \nhas more than 25,000 members, consisting of lawyers and judges.\n  MANA, a national Latino organization, was established in 1974 to give \na voice to the more than 20 million Hispanic women of all backgrounds \nand professions across the U.S.\n  The AAMA, Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans, with \nover 30 years of service to the community, has been ranked the ninth \nlargest Hispanic nonprofit in the country, providing education, \nemployment and training, health care, and related services to more than \n30,000 people annually.\n  The Cuban American National Council has served the Cuban American \ncommunity of Florida for the past 23 years, through education, housing, \nhealth and human services, and employment and training.\n  I just thought the record needed to show that Miguel Estrada has \ntremendous support among Hispanic people. Now, things we've heard in \nthe debate against Miguel have been some of the saddest things I have \never witnessed. It is akin to the lioness eating her cubs--Democratic \nLatino community leaders turning on one of their own because he doesn't \nfit their definition of ``Latino.''\n  Among their concerns is he is a recent immigrant, he hasn't lived in \nthis country long enough to understand the plight of Hispanic \nAmericans, he wasn't poor enough, his family was middle class and he \nattended private schools, he speaks English too well, he speaks Spanish \ntoo well--these are comments made by some of the liberal Latino groups. \nHe is not from Mexico or Puerto Rico, he is from Honduras; he didn't do \nthe right kind of pro bono work; he sought to protect victims of crime, \nnot criminals. Jeepers.\n  His critics would have you believe that to be Hispanic you have to be \npoor, attend only inner city schools, work for the public defenders \noffice, and never aspire to work for the Department of Justice, or to \nclerk for the U.S. Supreme Court. I don't think the vast majority of \nHispanic people think that way. I think they are proud of Miguel \nEstrada, and they ought to be because he is a man who has really made \nsomething of his life, and he is still a very young man.\n\n  Miguel Estrada is the American dream incarnate. I think this should \nbe celebrated by all Americans, but certainly by Hispanic Americans, \nand especially Hispanic mothers and fathers who dream of a bright \nfuture for their children. Tell those mothers and fathers that in order \nto be considered Hispanic, your children have to remain poor, forgo a \nquality education, and give up their dreams of succeeding in the legal \nprofession. That is pure bunk and everybody knows it. But these are \nsome of the arguments that have been made against Miguel Estrada.\n  Lest anybody think I am just saying these things because I am \nsupporting Miguel Estrada, I have spent most of my Senate career \nworking very closely with the Hispanic community in the United States, \ngetting to know the issues and addressing the community's concerns \nthrough legislation. In fact, in 1986, I started the U.S. Senate \nRepublican Conference Task Force on Hispanic Affairs to ensure that the \nHispanic community had a strong voice in the Senate. Over my lifetime, \nI have grown to love the Hispanic culture, their people, and their \nhistory. I believe their values and culture have infused and \ninvigorated the American dream. The Latinos I have come to know over \nthe past 26-plus years tell me it is all about heart. It is the \n``corazon.'' Frankly, I have come to feel like I personally have a \nLatino heart beating in my breast. That is how important this community \nis to me. That is how close I feel to my Hispanic brothers and sisters. \nI have the credentials to make that case. I happen to know Miguel \nEstrada. He, too, has ``corazon.''\n  The Hispanic community leaders I respect and admire have dedicated \nthemselves to ensuring that people such as Miguel have the very \nopportunity Miguel has used to his advantage. They want Hispanics to \nsucceed. They are not trying to force all Latinos into cookie cutter \nshapes. They want Hispanics to be as free to find their own way as \nAmerican citizens. Organizations such as the League of United Latin \nAmerican Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the \ncountry, and the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce have \nexisted for decades. Their mission has been to ensure that the \ndowntrodden, the poor, the recent immigrant, and his heirs have an \nopportunity to succeed absent discrimination.\n  Hector Flores, president of LULAC, and George Herrera, the Hispanic \nChamber's President, work hard to get more Hispanic kids into Columbia \nand Harvard, more Latino youth to clerk in at the U.S. Supreme Court, \nto work at the Department of Justice, and to become partners of a \nprestigious law firm. Miguel Estrada deserves credit, rather than this \nconstant worry that he might be too conservative, or he might be too \nconservative than some of these liberal groups would like.\n  I have a lot more to say, but I will yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I didn't want the night to go by without \ncommenting on some remarks made by two Senators on the other side, the \nmajority, who have suggested that those who oppose Miguel Estrada are \ndoing it on the basis of his ethnicity. In fact, one Senator said it \nwas anti-Hispanic. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which is in \nexistence here in Congress and consists of Hispanic members of Congress \nwho have been elected by people from congressional districts all around \nthe country, was formed many years ago. The Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus has taken a position against the nomination of Miguel Estrada. I \nhope nobody would suggest that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is not \nHispanic.\n  In fact, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus was so concerned about the \nfact there are not enough Hispanics in the judiciary that they formed \nin the last Congress the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Hispanic \nJudiciary Initiative to assure fair treatment of judicial nominees and \nto promote diversity.\n  While the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has endorsed other Bush \njudicial nominees who are Hispanic, such as Jose Linares, Mr. Estrada \nfailed most of the factors in their evaluation. Therefore, they oppose \nhis nomination.\n  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus sent a letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee late last year. It was signed by Congressmen Silvestre Reyes \nand Charles Gonzalez on behalf of the entire Hispanic caucus. The \nletter was based on the review of his qualifications and their \ninterview with him.\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\n  I am certainly not a member of the Judiciary Committee, and I am not \nhere to debate the issue with the learned chairman of the committee, \nbut I want everyone within the sound of my voice to understand that \nsomeone can opposes this nomination and not do it based on anti-\nHispanic grounds. There is no better logic than to look at the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus which opposes this nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to make a few points. Some of my \ncolleagues are suggesting that we are playing what amounts to the race \ncard on this nominee. That is ludicrous. Personally, I resent it.\n  Let me make one point clear: No one is suggesting that anyone in the \nSenate has a bigoted bone in his or her body. No one is suggesting that \nfor a minute. No one is suggesting Mr. Estrada is being opposed because \nhe is a Hispanic. That is just a red herring. It is a shame on anyone \nwho is arguing that carbuncle.\n  What I have suggested is exactly what Herman Badillo, a former \nDemocratic Congressman, has written publicly. Some liberal, and, yes, \nDemocrats, show increasing intolerance to Hispanics and African \nAmericans who do not subscribe to their left of mainstream ideology. \nTheir intolerance is not because they are Hispanic or African American \nbut because they are Hispanic or African American and not liberals. \nThat is where the intolerance is.\n  Some people will simply not accept a Hispanic, African American, or \neven women who do not toe the line of the radical left of special \ninterest groups. We are finding that all over this instance.\n  Herman Badillo, a former Democratic Congressman, for whom I have \nalways had respect, has written:\n       Liberals and their special interest groups want to force \n     these minorities into one monolithic intellectual ghetto \n     demanding that they be of one mind.\n  I would think that every minority, whether liberal or conservative, \nwould find such patronizing thought, control, and elitism demeaning and \ninsulting. It amounts to an intellectual glass ceiling for minorities, \nand that is, to a degree, what is happening here.\n  In the hearing we held last September and in the follow-up questions, \nI have not heard one argument against Miguel Estrada--not one, not one \nvalid argument. I have not heard one person make a case that the \nAmerican Bar Association was wrong when they gave Miguel Estrada a \nunanimously well-qualified rating, the highest rating that the American \nBar Association can give.\n  I have not heard one person indicate that this man is not of the \nhighest intellect, the highest moral purpose, the highest \nqualifications, except for Paul Bender, who I think we more than \nexplained away a few minutes ago, and it had to be done because for \nsome reason they keep bringing up this man who has been very unfair and \nfor partisan, cheap political reasons apparently, after having given \nthe highest, most glowing recommendations for Mr. Estrada when he \nworked for him at the Justice Department.\n  They try to explain it away: Well, he was not talking about his \nideology. Of course, he was. If there had been one indication of bad \nideology or too much extreme ideology, I can guarantee you Paul Bender \nwould never have given those glowing performance evaluations.\n  It is offensive. This man is a law professor in this country and, \nunfortunately, I hate to say it, but the law professors in this \ncountry, as a whole, are extremely to the left, and that is not too far \ndifferent from many of the political science professors in this \ncountry.\n  I remember I went to one of the major universities a few years ago, \nand of the 41 members of the faculty, only one claimed to maybe be a \nmoderate. All the rest admitted they were left wing, and yet these are \nthe people teaching our children. That is not bad. They have a right to \nhear left-wing ideology and more liberal teachers, but I think they \nalso have a right to hear people who are on the other side of the \nequation who may be right in many ways, not just right ideologically.\n\n  To be honest, I get a little tired of this business that we Democrats \nare the ones who have really done more appointments for Hispanics. \nRepublican Presidents altogether in recent years have appointed 25 \nHispanic judges. Sonia Sotomayor of New York was appointed by the first \nPresident Bush and was subsequently nominated to the Second Circuit by \nPresident Clinton and was confirmed.\n  The second President Bush has already nominated nine Hispanics, with \nthree more coming up, according to press reports, for a total of 12. \nHis chief counsel in the White House is Hispanic. There is no question \nhe is reaching out and doing a good job. It is one of the things I love \nabout him.\n  At the current rate of second President Bush, we can expect in 8 \nyears President Bush I think will probably appoint at least 36 to 40 \nHispanic judges on his own, more than all the past Republican \nPresidents put together and more than any single Democratic President.\n  To try to make the case only Democrats care for Hispanics is just \nludicrous. I will say this, my colleagues on the other side are good \npeople. I believe they are sincere in working for minorities as they \nhave done, and I appreciate them personally, but to try to imply we are \nnot I think is hitting below the belt in ways that should not happen on \nthe Senate floor.\n  In all honesty--and I have heard arguments today that would cause \nanybody--I mean the bad arguments--the arguments against Miguel Estrada \nwould cause people to vote for him. Miguel Estrada is a fine man. \nMiguel Estrada has made it to the top of his profession even with a \ndisability. There are not many people who have argued 15 cases before \nthe Supreme Court or who have the unanimously well-qualified American \nBar Association rating or who have been the editor in chief of the \nHarvard Law Review, who have served various Federal judges.\n  I am a little surprised about some of my colleagues' confusion as to \nwhy Mr. Estrada, they claimed, did not address policy questions put to \nhim. It is quite understandable. Would we policymakers want another \npublic official, in this case a judicial nominee, to answer policy \nquestions? A judicial nominee is not applying for a job as a \npolicymaker. He or she is going to be a judge. Judges are not in the \nbusiness of answering policy questions. It is just that simple.\n  When one asks the question, What is your view of the first amendment, \nmy gosh, how does one answer that question? It is easy to say: I \nbelieve in it. I guess that is what Miguel Estrada could have said. Or \nif one asks, Are you going to overturn all of the environmental laws of \nour country, or words to that effect I heard on the floor today, first, \nit is offensive to ask that kind of question and, second, nobody in his \nor her right mind as a judicial nominee would want to give an opinion \non a broad issue that might foreclose them from sitting on important \ncases that would come before the court later.\n  Yes, nominees are told on both sides, whether it is a Clinton judge \nor George W. Bush judge, that you should not be giving opinions that \nmight involve what you might later have to judge when you get on the \nbench.\n  So it is a fine line and it is not an easy thing for witnesses, and \nfrankly especially those who have not served on the Judiciary Committee \nand have not been through it for a long time. And even if they have, it \nis not easy.\n  The important realization in regard to Miguel Estrada is they had \nevery opportunity to ask him any questions they wanted. They were in \nthe majority. They held the committee hearings. I have heard Democrats \non the committee say those hearings were conducted fairly and \nresponsibly. Afterwards they had a right to submit any written \nquestions they wanted to submit, and only two Senators submitted them \nand they were answered. So some of these arguments I have heard today \nare not arguments at all.\n  I think it was Walter Mondale who said: Where is the beef? What is it \nthat makes Miguel Estrada unqualified to be on the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\nthe District of Columbia? I do not think there has been even the \nslightest case made against him.\n  Then what is it? What is against him? What is against this fine \nHispanic man who has made it on his own? I do not see any reason. Maybe \nwe will get some in the next few days, but I do not see any reason. And \nI sure as heck would not rely on Paul Bender, not after what we all \nknow he has done. He gave glowing performance evaluations when he \nreally had the power--as an honest liberal, which we believed him to be \nat the time--he gave glowing performance evaluations and then later \nwhen this fine person, Miguel Estrada, is offered up as a judicial \nnominee by the President of the United States, he comes out and says he \nis an ideologue.\n  Who are you going to believe? I do not think I would believe Paul \nBender on that issue, and I do not think anybody else should, either.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there have been too many protests on the \nother side. The majority has said time and time again that they, the \nRepublicans, treat the Hispanics well. I do not know why they have to \nkeep saying that. The record speaks for itself. This side need not do \nso because our record does speak for itself. And that is the reason, as \nI said earlier, when people come--one Senator did come and talk about \nwords to the effect I am not anti-Hispanic and then proceeded to lay \nout everything that was. That is why I thought I would come forward and \ntalk about the fact that the Hispanic Caucus, which certainly could \nnever be judged to be anti-Hispanic, has come out against this \nnomination, as have numerous other organizations: the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, and Hispanic \norganizations such as the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \nFund, Juan Figuera, President and General Counsel, the Mexican American \nLegal Defense and Education Fund, National Association of Latino \nElected and Appointed Officials, National Council of La Raza, NCLR, \nNational Puerto Rican Coalition, California La Raza Lawyers, Puerto \nRican Bar Association of Illinois, Southwest Voter Registration \nEducation Project, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, Linda \nChavez Thompson, AFL-CIO, 52 different Latino labor leaders, including \npeople from all over the country from California to New York and places \nin between.\n\n  There are civil rights and other organizations that oppose this \nnomination: the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \nOrganizations, AFL-CIO, Sierra Club, Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights and Alliance for Justice, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, National \nOrganization for Women, National Black Women's Health Project, Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Lawyers' Committee for Civil \nRights Under Law, National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, Alliance for Justice, People for the American Way, National \nCouncil of Jewish Women, National Family Planning and Reproductive \nHealth Association, Feminist Majority, National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, People for the American Way, Planned \nParenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice, National Family \nPlanning and Reproductive Health Association, and scores of other \norganizations.\n  I think the debate at this stage is being framed improperly. There \nare people on this side who have not made up their mind what they are \ngoing to do, but the way the debate is going forward, it does give me \nsome concern. I hope the debate in during the next whatever period of \ntime it goes forward, we can talk about the man's judicial \nqualifications and not berate people who say for one reason or another \nhe is not qualified, such as Mr. Bender. I have never met Mr. Bender, \nbut I think he has taken enough lashes today that we should drop the \nsubject. He has a right, in my opinion, to oppose someone. These \norganizations have a right to oppose him. The organizations who support \nhim have every right to come forward and support him. It should be on \nthe basis of this man's qualifications, whatever they might be, and not \non ethnicity and on whether or not groups support people because they \nare for the poor.\n  I made some notes here that someone suggested Latinos only support \nthose lawyers who work for the poor or for the public defender's \noffice. I really do believe this debate would be much more structured, \ncivil, and productive if we dealt with Miguel Estrada's qualifications \nand not berate people who are for or against him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me say about Mr. Bender, I was criticized by the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts for pointing out the biases of \nMr. Bender. I was accused of finding fault with him. Well, what about \nMr. Bender dishonestly finding fault with Miguel Estrada? I think I \nmore than made a case that this man has done it for partisan political \npurposes, and I am going to make that case over and over. If they want \nto keep bringing up Paul Bender, then I am going to make the case that \nPaul Bender has done a very bigoted, rotten thing, after having given \nthe greatest performance reviews one could get in the Solicitor \nGeneral's office.\n  So who would you believe? I think it is important to point that out \nand not let anybody get away with that.\n  I will mention one group because it has been mentioned by my friend--\nand he is my friend--the distinguished Senator from Nevada. A review of \nthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus' statement in opposition is most \ndisappointing to me. It was issued in advance of Miguel's hearing. They \ndid not even listen to him, and they issued it. My colleagues in the \nHouse, who have argued persuasively for a fair process, decided Miguel \nwas not so entitled. They did not even wait until he testified to \ncondemn him. They pronounced judgment beforehand. But that should not \nsurprise us because the Democrat Congressional Hispanic Caucus is \nexactly that. It is a Democrat machine. The Republican members of the \ncaucus who were members at one time were forced out because they did \nnot think and act like their Democrat counterparts. There are no \nRepublican members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, not one. They \nwere forced out. The Democrat Congressional Hispanic Caucus may oppose \nMiguel Estrada, but the Republican Congressional Hispanic members, \nLincoln Diaz-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Henry Bonilla, Mario Diaz-\nBalart, all support his confirmation.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues on the other side, where is the beef? \nAll this speculation about what they think that Miguel Estrada will be \non the court, where is the proof? There is not any. In fact, there is \nproof to the contrary.\n  So that is one reason why I have been a little bit upset today, and I \nthink I am going to continue to be upset if these types of approaches \nare taken against this really fine man. We are going to defend him. We \nare going to defend him as the good person he is.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now return to legislative \nsession and that it proceed to a period for morning business.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will respond very briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I was involved in a long conference with the Hispanic \ncaucus yesterday. This organization met long and hard with Miguel \nEstrada. They met for 3 hours on one occasion, and based upon that and \nother issues they raised in their letter, they thought they could not \nsupport him.\n  As I stated earlier today, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has \nsupported, and will continue to support, other Bush judicial nominees \nwho are Hispanic, and they have already done so.\n  I mentioned a number of names earlier. They can speak for themselves.\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\nThey are Members of the other body and do not have authority to speak \nhere, but if they could speak, they would speak loudly, with a lot of \narticulation, about the fact that this man is not qualified, in their \nopinion. They are entitled to that opinion.\n  This is a body that is not known for its radicalism; it is a body \nknown for its stability, having a long line of very prominent chairmen.\n  Maybe with Mr. Bender I should have said he needs to be beaten up \nsome more and he would not have been, but I think the record is replete \nthat those on the other side think Mr. Bender's evaluation of Miguel \nEstrada is wrong. He has a right to do that. He was his supervisor. He \nhas made and continues to make known his opinion that he is not \ntemperamentally qualified for this job as a circuit court judge. That \nis what he said.\n  This debate should focus on the qualifications of this man. That is \nwhat this letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee consists of, from \nthe Hispanic caucus, to Senator Leahy. They say that the man is not \nqualified. He is not qualified based upon his past experience. They are \nentitled to that opinion.\n  As the debate proceeds, a decision will have to be made in this body \nas to whether people agree with the Hispanic caucus about the \nqualifications of persons before this body. Debate that has taken place \nand will take place in the future will be productive in that regard. \nThat is why we have a Senate. That is why we are not limited, as in the \nHouse of Representatives, with, on many occasions, 1 minute and \nsometimes no minutes. We can talk here as long as we want about the \nqualifications of this man. I hope we do not have to talk a long time \nabout this man's qualifications. We should talk long enough that full \ndebate on his qualifications takes place.\n  I am happy now to have my friend reoffer his unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. HATCH. I add one thing. I believe they are entitled to their \nopinion but they are not entitled to their own facts. They have to live \nwith the facts that exist.\n  I don't see a fairness in this process. It has not been fair. It has \nbeen quite partisan, especially on Mr. Bender's part.\n  I have been told by those who know, by my Hispanic friends, that the \nCongressional Democratic Hispanic Caucus was pretty split. But the \nmajority prevailed. There was a real split over whether they should do \nthis to Miguel Estrada. I personally believe that all these liberal \ngroups persuaded them.\n  I point out, where are the arguments? To say he is not qualified, \nwhen their own gold standard, the American Bar Association, says he is \nunanimously well qualified flies in the face of any facts. That is just \nmy point. Where are the facts?\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Henry Bonilla, Lincoln \nDiaz-Balart, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2002.\n       Dear Senators Daschle, Lott, Leahy, and Hatch: We are \n     Hispanic Members of the United States House of \n     Representatives who write to strongly support Miguel Estrada, \n     President Bush's nominee to be a judge on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. If \n     confirmed, Miguel would be the first Hispanic judge on what \n     is widely recognized as the nation's second highest federal \n     court. President Bush made an historic decision by nominating \n     Miguel Estrada, and we urge the Senate to promptly confirm \n     this outstanding Hispanic-American.\n       Miguel Estrada is an American success story. He immigrated \n     to the United States as a teenager from Honduras speaking \n     little English. He attended Columbia College and Harvard Law \n     School, graduating magna cum laude from both. He clerked for \n     Judge Amalya Kearse on the Second Circuit and Justice Anthony \n     Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Miguel is one of the few \n     Hispanics ever to serve as a law clerk on the Supreme Court \n     of the United States. Miguel worked as an Assistant United \n     States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, and \n     both tried cases in federal district court and argued appeals \n     before the Second Circuit on behalf of the United States. He \n     has worked twice in private practice at leading law firms, in \n     New York at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and in Washington \n     at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.\n       Miguel also served for five years in the Office of \n     Solicitor General at the United States Department of Justice. \n     In that capacity, Miguel argued 14 cases before the Supreme \n     Court and wrote numerous briefs on behalf of the United \n     States. He is widely recognized as a brilliant lawyer and \n     oral advocate, and his official performance reviews noted \n     that he ``inspired co-workers by example.''\n       As demonstrated during his service as Assistant to the \n     Solicitor General, Assistant United States Attorney, and law \n     clerk on the Supreme Court, Miguel Estrada believes in the \n     integrity of the courts and the law. He appreciates the \n     difference between law and policy, between the judicial task \n     and the legislative task.\n       Based on his qualifications, intellect, judgment, and \n     temperament, it is no surprise that Miguel Estrada received a \n     unanimous ``well qualified'' rating--the highest possible \n     rating--from the American Bar Association Standing Committee \n     on Federal Judiciary. As Hispanic Members of Congress, we are \n     very proud that the American Bar Association gave this \n     outstanding Hispanic-American its highest possible rating.\n       Miguel has performed significant public service beyond his \n     work in government. Most notably, while in private practice, \n     he represented pro bono a capital defendant before the \n     Supreme Court. Capital cases are very difficult legally and \n     emotionally for the lawyers representing the capital \n     defendants. Miguel's decision to involve himself in a \n     difficult capital case speaks volumes about his integrity and \n     devotion to the legal system, and his willingness to perform \n     difficult public service. He also assisted the former United \n     States Attorney in New York, who was appointed by President \n     Clinton, in discussing how to ensure that more federal \n     prosecutors are Hispanic.\n       Miguel is widely supported by Hispanic organizations, such \n     as the Hispanic National Bar Association, the League of \n     United Latin American Citizens, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber \n     of Commerce. He also is supported by prominent Democrat \n     lawyers, such as Ronald Klain, who served as Counsel to Vice \n     President Gore, Robert Litt, who served as Assistant Attorney \n     General for the Criminal Division under President Clinton, \n     and Randy Moss, who served as Assistant Attorney General for \n     the Office of Legal Counsel under President Clinton. \n     Furthermore, Seth Waxman, who served as Solicitor General \n     under President Clinton, has written to the Judiciary \n     Committee that he has ``great respect both for Mr. Estrada's \n     intellect and for his integrity'' and that Miguel was ``a \n     model of professionalism and competence.''\n       Miguel Estrada would be the first Hispanic judge on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit. You and your colleagues have spoken often about the \n     need for balance on the courts. It is past time that an \n     Hispanic judge serve on this important court. Confirmation of \n     Miguel Estrada would provide balance. We urge you to treat \n     Miguel Estrada with fairness and to confirm him promptly.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henry Bonilla,\n     Lincoln Diaz-Balart,\n     Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,\n       Members of Congress.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Pat Leahy from the \nHispanic caucus signed by Silvestre Reyes and Charles Gonzalez be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus (CHC), we wish to inform you that the CHC has decided \n     to oppose Miguel Estrada's nomination to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After \n     reviewing Mr. Estrada's record and meeting with him in \n     person, we have concluded that he fails to meet the CHC's \n     evaluation criteria for endorsing judicial nominees.\n       As you know, the judicial nomination process is important \n     to the CHC because we believe that our Nation's courts should \n     reflect the diversity of thought and action that enrich \n     America. Earlier this year, we launched the Hispanic \n     Judiciary Initiative to further formalize our involvement in \n     this issue by establishing a set of evaluation criteria and \n     an internal process for endorsing nominees. We hope that this \n     initiative will allow us to continue our work to ensure fair \n     treatment of Latino judicial nominees and tackle the lack of \n     diversity in the federal judiciary.\n       In evaluating Mr. Estrada, we considered not only his \n     honesty, integrity, character, temperament, and intellect, \n     but also his commitment to equal justice and advancement \n     opportunities for Latinos working in the field of law. \n     Because of the nature of the CHC's mission and the important \n     role that the courts play in achieving that mission, in order \n     to support a judicial nominee the CHC requires that he or she \n     has a demonstrated commitment to protecting the rights of \n     Latinos through his or her professional work, pro bono work, \n     and volunteer activities; to preserving and expanding the \n     progress that has been made on civil rights and individual \n     liberties; and to expanding advancement opportunities for \n     Latinos in the\n\n[[Page S1958]]\n\n     law profession. On this measure, Mr. Estrada fails to \n     convince us that he would contribute under-represented \n     perspectives to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit.\n       As stated by Mr. Estrada during his meeting with us, he has \n     never provided any pro bono legal expertise to the Latino \n     community or organizations. Nor has he ever joined, \n     supported, volunteered for or participated in events of any \n     organization dedicated to serving and advancing the Latino \n     community. As an attorney working in government and the \n     private sector, he has never made efforts to open doors of \n     opportunity to Latino law students or junior lawyers through \n     internships, mentoring or other means. While he has not been \n     in the position to create internships or recruit new staff, \n     he never appealed to his superiors about the importance of \n     making such efforts on behalf of Latinos. Furthermore, Mr. \n     Estrada declined to commit that he would be engaged in \n     Hispanic community activities once appointed to the bench or \n     that he would pro-actively seek to promote increased access \n     to positions where Latinos have been traditionally under-\n     represented, such as clerkships.\n       Mr. Estrada shared with us that he believes being Hispanic \n     would be irrelevant in his day-to-day duties on the court, \n     which leads us to conclude that he does not see himself as \n     being capable of bringing new perspectives to the bench. This \n     is deeply troubling since the CHC's primary objective in \n     increasing ethnic diversity of the courts is to increase the \n     presence of under-represented perspectives.\n       Mr. Estrada's limited record makes it difficult to \n     determine whether he would be a forceful voice on the bench \n     for advancing civil rights and other protections for \n     minorities. He has never served as a judge and has not \n     written any substantive articles or publications. However, we \n     did note that in responding to inquiries about case law, Mr. \n     Estrada did not demonstrate a sense of inherent \n     ``unfairness'' or ``justice'' in cases that have had a great \n     impact on the Hispanic community.\n       The appointment of a Latino to reflect diversity is \n     rendered meaningless unless the nominee can demonstrate an \n     understanding of the historical role courts have played in \n     the lives of minorities in extending equal protections and \n     rights; has some involvement in the Latino community that \n     provides insight into the values and mores of the Latino \n     culture in order to understand the unique legal challenges \n     facing Latinos; and recognizes both the role model \n     responsibilities he or she assumes as well as having an \n     appreciation for protecting and promoting the legal rights of \n     minorities who historically have been the victims of \n     discrimination.\n       Based on the totality of the nominee's available record and \n     our meeting with him, Miguel Estrada fails to meet the CHC's \n     criteria for endorsing a judicial nominee. In our opinion, \n     his lack of judicial experience coupled with a failure to \n     recognize or display an interest in the needs of the Hispanic \n     community do not support an appointment to the federal \n     judiciary. We respectfully urge you to take this into account \n     as you consider his nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n           Sincerely,\n     Silvestre Reyes,\n       Chair, Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n     Charles A. Gonzalez,\n       Chair, CHC Civil Rights Task Force.\n\n  Mr. REID. And I say that the final two sentences of this letter be \nread:\n\n       In our opinion, his lack of judicial experience coupled \n     with a failure to recognize or display an interest in the \n     needs of the Hispanic community do not support an appointment \n     to the federal judiciary.\n\n  The Hispanic caucus unanimously opposed the nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. I cannot let that go. If they are saying because he lacks \njudicial experience he should not be on the court--which is what it \nappears to me they are saying--they are just condemning almost every \nnonjudge Hispanic to never have a chance to be a Federal district or \ncircuit court of appeals judge. That is ridiculous. Every Democrat \nPresident I have served with--President Carter and President Clinton--\nhave appointed a wide variety of people who never served on the bench \nbut who are highly qualified and are doing a good job as judges now.\n  It may be helpful to have some judicial experience, but not having \njudicial experience does not mean you cannot serve. If that were the \ncase, some of the greatest judges in the history of the world would \nnever have had a chance.\n  But if you interpret what they say, that means that any Hispanic who \nhas not had judicial experience really should not be supported. That is \nridiculous. That is caving in to the liberal special interest groups in \nthis town with which they continually spend time, and is to the \ndetriment of the Hispanic community. I say that as a chairman of the \nRepublican senatorial Hispanic task force who has worked for the last \n13 years to try to solve these problems.\n  I don't take second seat to anyone with regard to my love for the \nHispanic community or my work on their behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1958-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

It makes sense that--in his off hours--he \nis a basketball official.\n  For 35 years, he has walked the halls of power, but he never let it \ndistort his perspective, or his sense of what is truly important.

Mr. President, I want to speak for just a few minutes \non the Senate floor about the proposal made last Friday by the Bush \nadministration regarding Medicaid. The proposal was a disturbing one, \nin my view. It was to reform the Medicaid program by shifting to a \nblock grant to the States. That is a recycled proposal, one we have \nseen before. It was touted, when described last Friday, as giving the \nStates flexibility. It would give them flexibility.\n  It would give them flexibility to drop benefits to low-income \nchildren, to drop benefits to pregnant women, to people with \ndisabilities, and to the elderly. And it would give them flexibility to \ndramatically increase the cost sharing for those vulnerable \npopulations. With over 41 million Americans who are currently \nuninsured, in my view, we should be trying to find ways to expand \nhealth coverage rather than finding new ways to reduce it.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal allows States to continue Medicaid as it \nis or to convert the program into a block grant. This was tried in 1981 \nand again in 1996. The administration would encourage States to take \nthe latter option; that is, to move to receipt of a block grant by \nencouragement of being temporarily offered increased dollars. That \nwould be coupled with this offer of added flexibility to be able to \nreduce the benefits for their Medicaid beneficiaries and increase the \ncosts being charged to those low-income and vulnerable populations. \nSecretary Thompson notes the proposal would clearly save the States \nmoney. This would only happen if the States decided to do what would \nalmost certainly occur; that is, to cut benefits and increase cost \nsharing.\n  Also, this proposal takes the Federal Government off the hook for \nhelping States address their uninsured problems because under the \nproposal there would be no additional Federal money available to States \nif they attempted to expand coverage in the future. In order to expand \ncoverage, the only option States would have would be to essentially rob \nPeter to pay Paul. In\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\nshort, they could cut benefits or increase cost sharing for certain \npopulations if they wanted to expand coverage to any others.\n  The proposal is ostensibly based on the success of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, the S-CHIP Program. Secretary \nThompson said in his press conference that the proposal works by \n``taking the principles of S-CHIP and applying them to Medicaid.''\n  It is ironic that the proposal actually eliminates CHIP by wrapping \nit into this block grant with Medicaid and with the Disproportionate \nShare Hospital Program, the DSH Program. It is surprising and \ndisappointing to me that the administration is proposing to radically \ntransform the identity and the nature of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program while also praising that program. It is a program \nthat just about everyone lauds as having been quite successful at \nreducing the number of uninsured children in our country.\n  So this new proposal by the administration has strong elements of the \nold bait-and-switch ploy that all of us see from time to time. It \nadvertises that there will be more money available to States--the exact \namount is $12.7 billion during the first 7 years--but then, after that \nfirst 7 years, it yanks away all that money, starting in the year 2011.\n  Secretary Thompson noted at the press conference that he is not \nplanning to be around at the time the $12.7 billion in reductions \noccurs 8 years from now. And the plan, I would say, clearly also counts \non the fact that most of our current group of Governors who would be \nasked to make these changes will not be around either. However, that is \nexactly the time, 2011, when our Nation's baby boomers hit retirement \nage in much larger numbers. The long-term care costs within Medicaid \nwill increase significantly during that period. Therefore, the Federal \nGovernment, under this proposal, would be dramatically stepping away \nfrom its commitment to help States and to help with the Nation's health \nsafety net at a time when the demand for those services will obviously \nbe increasing.\n  The proposal is counting on the fact that the Governors will jump at \nthe $12.7 billion that is being offered during these initial years and \nwill let future Governors deal with the problem later on. It is my hope \nand my belief that the Nation's Governors will see this nonoffer for \nwhat it is; and that is, a very shortsighted effort to limit the \nFederal Government's role in Medicaid that will lead to cuts in access \nto care for those most in need of that care.\n  In fact, under the proposal, States are left with nothing less than a \nHobson's choice of alternatives. Both of the choices they would have \nwould substantially weaken health insurance for low-income Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. Under the first option that States would have, they \nwould be allowed to continue to operate Medicaid without any financial \nrelief from the Federal Government to help them get through the current \nfiscal crisis. States would have no option but to make deep cuts in \ntheir Medicaid Program during the next few years, if they choose that \noption.\n  Under the second option, the States would get a fixed amount of \nFederal money for the millions of people who States have voluntarily \ndecided to cover under Medicaid, and, as a result, Federal funding \nwould be limited and not responsive to those items that it is now \nresponsive to, such as economic recessions, epidemics, terrorist \nattacks, population growth, changes in the State's health care \nenvironment, or the growth in our Nation's elderly that we expect in \nthe next decade. Nor would it be available to States wishing to expand \ncoverage, as I indicated before, States wishing to reduce the uninsured \nrate.\n  Although the administration's proposal advertises improved health, \njust as one would expect with a bait-and-switch proposal, it fails the \ntest when you look at the details. I ask, How does the health of \nMedicaid beneficiaries improve by eliminating their entitlement to \ncoverage and by allowing States the dramatic ability to reduce benefits \nand increase the costs that are shifted to those vulnerable \npopulations? I am talking here about 85-year-old widows with incomes of \njust $800 a month. I am talking about pregnant women with incomes of \n$15,000 per year, or an 8-year-old boy from a family of three with an \nincome of $19,000 per year or less.\n\n  According to Karen Davis, Cathy Schoen, Michelle Doty, and Katie \nTenney--all from the Commonwealth Fund--the two main purposes of health \ninsurance are, first, ``assuring access to needed health care services \nand,'' secondly, ``preventing financial burdens from medical bills.'' \nWhen you propose, as this proposal last Friday does, to reduce benefits \nand increase cost sharing on low-income beneficiaries, clearly you fail \nin trying to accomplish either of these two main purposes.\n  Just over a week ago, it was discovered that the Bush administration \nwas allowing States to limit the number of emergency room visits to \nMedicaid beneficiaries regardless of whether the care sought was an \nemergency. That proposal allowed States to establish arbitrary limits, \nsuch as three visits per year. There was a huge hue and cry and the \nadministration reversed this policy shift, but it is back in full force \nunder this proposal related to Medicaid, as benefits would decrease and \ncost sharing would dramatically increase for Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  This is not to state that our Governors are malevolent in their \nintent. Their goal is to do the best they can for their citizens. It is \nonly to say that many States are facing unprecedented fiscal crises \nthat force them into impossible choices, choices between health care \ncoverage and other needed services. In fact, the States already have \nsubstantial flexibility in the Medicaid Program. About 65 percent of \nspending in that program is for either optional populations or for \noptional benefits that they have chosen to pay for.\n  Instead, for some Governors, it may not be the flexibility they are \nseeking to exploit but the proposal's other aspects that eliminate the \nlimitations on how States spend their Medicaid dollars. On several \noccasions in recent years, certain States worked to ``game'' the \nFederal dollars through a variety of mechanisms, such as provider taxes \nand donations, excessive payments to certain health providers that \nwould be returned to the State via intergovernmental transfers or other \nmechanisms. These mechanisms to which I am referring largely benefited \nthe budgets of the individual States and did not benefit anyone's \nhealth.\n  Both the first Bush administration and the Clinton administration and \nthe current Bush administration should be applauded for working hard to \ndeal with those problems in the Medicaid system. However, it was \nrevealed at the press conference that those mechanisms would once again \nbe allowed if this newly presented proposal is adopted.\n  Via these mechanisms, the Medicaid Program can be rapidly turned into \nnothing more than a giant revenuesharing program. Again, it is hard to \nsee how such so-called innovation would improve health coverage for \nlow-income Americans.\n  Instead, there is a better approach to the problem, on which I have \nbeen working with Congressman John Dingell; we are preparing \nlegislation to introduce in the next few weeks. Our Medicaid reform \nproposal will be based on the knowledge that States are facing both \nshort-term and long-term problems with their Medicaid programs, and \nthose problems need to be addressed. As such, our initiative would have \nthe Federal Government step up rather than shirk its commitment to the \nStates.\n  In exchange, it will ask the States not to reduce their commitment to \nthe Nation's poorest and neediest citizens. It does several things. Let \nme briefly outline them.\n  First, it will provide States with much needed short-term and long-\nterm fiscal relief.\n  Secondly, it will increase Federal responsibility for Federal \ninitiatives and for populations that are paid for by the Medicaid \nProgram.\n  Third, it will protect States against economic downturns and \nepidemics and health care inflation and demographic changes.\n  Fourth, it will provide States with expanded coverage options, with \nreal Federal fiscal support as opposed to this block grant proposal we \nhave seen now from the administration.\n  And, fifth, it will increase State flexibility in ways to improve the\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\nhealth of Medicaid beneficiaries rather than options to weaken their \nhealth as under the administration's proposal.\n  The administration's proposal will fail in each of these regards. Let \nme describe them in a little more detail.\n  First, we will propose a package that will give States both short- \nand long-term fiscal relief. This is in sharp contrast to the \nadministration's block grant proposal that would leave States with no \nadditional Federal commitment or help during economic downturns. Block \ngrants do not adjust to problems such as downturns and epidemics and \nnatural disasters and demographic changes, and they do not adjust for \nthe very substantial health care inflation that we have been \nexperiencing.\n  Second, our proposal takes significant steps to properly assume \nFederal responsibility for Federal initiatives and for populations that \nare paid for under the Medicaid Program. This includes assumption of \n100 percent of the cost for the premiums and cost sharing that the \nMedicaid Program provides for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. \nMedicare is a Federal responsibility, and these costs should be the \nFederal Government's responsibility.\n  The same is true for a variety of other payments within Medicaid, \nincluding payments to urban Indian health organizations, to \noutstationed workers, to the breast and cervical cancer program, and \npayments to federally qualified health centers.\n  Third, the administration claims its proposal gives States the \nability to expand coverage to more people, including the mentally ill, \nchronically ill, those with HIV/AIDS, and those with substance abuse \nproblems. The difficulty is the administration's proposal gives States \nthe ability to do that but gives them no dollars with which to do it. \nStates are given the ability to do this by robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  In sharp contrast, our proposal will give States new options to \nexpand coverage and benefits in Medicare and CHIP, and States choosing \nto do so will have the Federal Government's commitment to participate \nwith a financial commitment for more than half of those costs, as \nopposed to no commitment to participate under the administration's \nproposal.\n  A fourth aspect of what we are going to propose is that we will grant \nStates the flexibility they have been seeking to provide more efficient \nand improved health services for these low-income Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. This includes allowing States to simplify eligibility, \nto emphasize home and community-based care rather than institutional \ncare, and a number of other options. Our proposal specifically chooses \nnot to take the course that the administration is pursuing in several \nareas.\n  Unlike the administration, we do not grant States additional \nflexibility to cut benefits and eliminate quality protections and \nincrease cost sharing on our Nation's most vulnerable populations. We \ndo not propose to eliminate fiscal integrity standards such as those \nintended to ensure that Medicaid dollars are spent on health care and \nnot on other purposes.\n  And we do not, as the administration's proposal does, allow for the \nelimination of the CHIP program, the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, or the Disproportionate Share Hospital Program, the DSHP \nprogram.\n  Finally, unlike the administration's efforts, our plan does not lock \nin interstate inequities and disparities on a permanent basis. In fact, \nthe administration's proposal, as I understand it, as it was presented \nFriday, is particularly devastating to a State such as New Mexico. Our \nState currently has the highest rate of uninsured in the Nation. It is \none of the fastest growing States in the country as well. It has per \ncapita Medicaid expenditures that are well below the national average. \nThe administration's proposal would therefore be a lose/lose/lose \nproposition for our State.\n  First, it would prevent us from seeking additional Federal assistance \nfor proposed expansions of coverage including the recently approved \nFederal waiver by the Federal Government to New Mexico that is so \nhighly touted by the administration.\n  Second, the block grant often fails to take into account differences \nin population growth, and we have a rapidly growing population.\n  Finally, we would be forever locked in at an expenditure level way \nbelow the national average under this block grant proposal.\n  During his State of the Union address this last week, the President \nsaid, ``Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society.'' That \nis a noble concept. But I would suggest that just as Medicare is the \nbinding commitment of a caring society, Medicaid is as well. For this \nreason, the Federal Government should not step away from it or abandon \nits commitment to States or to the 43 million vulnerable citizens \ncurrently served by the Medicaid Program.\n  Particularly, the Federal Government should not do this at a time of \ngrowing numbers of uninsured and just before the Nation's baby boomers \nbegin to retire in large numbers.\n  In the name of increasing personal responsibility of our Nation's \nneediest and sickest citizens, the administration is proposing that we \nat the Federal level shirk our responsibility. Rather than abandoning \nthe poor at this critical time, we should be reconsidering the proposed \ntax breaks that we have been sent intending to help our wealthiest \ncitizens.\n  We need to be sure our priorities are in line with the priorities of \nthe American people. The proposal we have received from the \nadministration to block grant Medicaid clearly does not reflect the \npriorities the American people have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1960-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1960-S1964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Meetings for the transaction of \n     Committee or Subcommittee business shall be conducted in open \n     session, except that a meeting or series of meetings on the \n     same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee members when it is determined that the matters \n     to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting \n     or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.) \n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his own initiative and without any point of order \n     being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee; \n     provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary \n     to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, \n     and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session \n     for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E.

It shall not be \n     in order for the committee, or a Subcommittee thereof, to \n     consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any \n     measure under consideration by the Committee or Subcommittee \n     unless a written copy of such amendment has been delivered to \n     each member of the Committee or Subcommittee, as the case may \n     be, and to the office of the Committee or Subcommittee, at \n     least 24 hours before the meeting of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee at which the amendment is to be proposed. The \n     written copy of amendments in the first degree required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. This \n     subsection may be waived by a majority of the members \n     present.

The Committee or Subcommittee shall \n     prepare and keep a complete transcript or electronic \n     recording adequate to fully record the proceeding of each \n     meeting whether or not such meeting or any part thereof is \n     closed to the public, unless a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee members vote to forgo such a record. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 5(e), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n                            RULE 2. QUORUMS\n\n       A. Reporting measures and matters.

One-third of the \n     membership of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the \n     transaction of routine business, provided that one member of \n     the minority is present.

Proxies prohibited in establishment of quorum. Proxies \n     shall not be considered for the establishment of a quorum.\n\n\n                             RULE 3. VOTING\n\n       A. Quorum required. Subject to the provisions of subsection \n     (E), no vote may be taken by the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, on any measure or matter unless a \n     quorum, as prescribed in the preceding section, is actually \n     present.\n       B. Reporting measures and matters. No measure, matter or \n     recommendation shall be reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee members are actually present, and \n     the vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those members who \n     are actually present at the time the vote is taken. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1) and (3), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Proxy voting. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all \n     measures and matters before the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, except that, when the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, is voting to report a measure or \n     matter, proxy votes shall be allowed solely for the purposes \n     of recording a member's position on the pending question. \n     Proxy voting shall be allowed only if the absent Committee or \n     Subcommittee member has been informed of the matter on which \n     he is being recorded and his affirmatively requested that he \n     be so recorded. All proxies shall be filed with the chief \n     clerk of the Committee or Subcommittee thereof, as the case \n     may be. All proxies shall be in writing and shall contain \n     sufficient reference to the pending matter as is necessary to \n     identify it and to inform the Committee or Subcommittee as to \n     how the member establishes his vote to be recorded thereon. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(3) and 7(c)(1), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       D. Announcement of vote.\n       (1) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote reports any \n     measure or matter, the report of the Committee upon such a \n     measure or matter shall include a tabulation of the votes \n     cast in favor of and the votes cast in opposition to such \n     measure or matter by each member of the Committee. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 7(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       (2) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote acts upon any \n     measure or amendment thereto, other than reporting a measure \n     or matter, the results thereof shall be announced in the \n     Committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the Committee, and such announcement shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to each such measure and amendment thereto by \n     each member of the Committee who was present at the meeting. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       (3) In any case in which a roll call vote is announced, the \n     tabulation of votes shall state separately the proxy vote \n     recorded in favor of and in opposition to that measure, \n     amendment thereto, or matter. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b) and (c), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E. Polling.\n       (1) The Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, may poll \n     (a) internal Committee or Subcommittee matters including the \n     Committee's or Subcommittee's staff, records and budget; (b) \n     steps in an investigation, including issuance of subpoenas, \n     applications for immunity orders, and requests for documents \n     from agencies; and (c) other Committee or Subcommittee \n     business other than a vote on reporting to the Senate any \n     measures, matters or recommendations or a vote on closing a \n     meeting or hearing to the public.\n       (2) Only the chairman, or a Committee member or staff \n     officer designated by him, may undertake any poll of the \n     members of the Committee. If any member requests, any matter \n     to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being \n     polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record \n     of polls; if a majority of the members of the Committee \n     determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas \n     enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the \n     poll shall be confidential. Any Committee member may move at \n     the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the \n     provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.\n\n\n             rule 4. chairmanship of meetings and hearings\n\n       The chairman shall preside at all Committee meetings and \n     hearings except that he shall designate a temporary chairman \n     to act in his place if he is unable to be present at a \n     scheduled meeting or hearing. If the chairman (or his \n     designee) is absent 10 minutes after the scheduled time set \n     for a meeting or hearing, the ranking majority member present \n     shall preside until the chairman's arrival. If there is no \n     member of the majority present, the ranking minority member \n     present, with the prior approval of the chairman, may open \n     and conduct the meeting or hearing until such time as a \n     member of the majority arrives.\n\n\n                rule 5. hearings and hearings procedures\n\n       A. Announcement of hearings. The Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, time, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted \n     on any measure or matter at least 1 week in advance of such \n     hearing, unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines \n     that there is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier \n     date. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be \n     closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into \n     closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated \n     in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the hearing to \n     be closed, followed immediately by a record vote in open \n     session by a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     members when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing or \n     hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.) \n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his own initiative and without any point of order \n     being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee; \n     provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary \n     to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, \n     and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session \n     for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The chairman, with the \n     approval of the ranking minority member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials at a hearing or deposition, provided that the \n     chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     approval of the ranking minority member where the chairman or \n     staff officer designated by him has not received notification \n     from the ranking minority member or a staff officer \n     designated by him of disapproval of the subpoena within 72 \n     hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of \n     the subpoena. If a subpoena is dis- approved by the ranking \n     minority member as provided in this subsection, the subpoena \n     may be authorized by vote of the members of the Committee. \n     When the Committee or chairman authorizes subpoenas, \n     subpoenas may be issued upon the signature of the chairman or \n     any other member of the Committee designated by the chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness \n     while he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights, \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is \n     an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the Committee chairman may \n     rule that representation by counsel from the government, \n     corporation, or association or by counsel representing, \n     other witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that \n     the witness may only be represented during interrogation \n     by staff or during testimony before the Committee by \n     personal counsel not from the government, corporation, or \n     association or by personal counsel not representing other \n     witnesses. This subsection shall not be construed to \n     excuse a witness from testifying in the event his counsel \n     is ejected for conducting himself in such manner so as to \n     prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct or interfere with the \n     orderly administration of the hearings; nor shall this \n     subsection be construed as authorizing counsel to coach \n     the witness or answer for the witness. The failure of any \n     witness to secure counsel shall not excuse such witness \n     from complying with a subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning which there have been public reports, tends to \n     impugn his or her character or adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may:\n       (a) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (b) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide 100 copies of a written statement and an executive \n     summary or synopsis of his proposed testimony at least 48 \n     hours prior to his appearance. This requirement may be waived \n     by the chairman and the ranking minority member following \n     their determination that there is good cause for failure of \n     compliance. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the minority members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the chairman by a majority of the minority \n     members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     1 day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       J. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the chairman, with the approval of \n     the ranking minority member of the Committee, provided that \n     the chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of \n     the ranking minority member where the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him has not received notification from \n     the ranking minority member or a staff officer designated by \n     him of disapproval of the deposition within 72 hours, \n     excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the \n     deposition notice. If a deposition notice is disapproved by \n     the ranking minority members as provided in this subsection, \n     the deposition notice may be authorized by a vote of the \n     members of the Committee. Committee deposition notices shall \n     specify a time and place for examination, and the name of the \n     Committee member or members or staff officer or officers who \n     will take the deposition. Unless otherwise--specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness' failure to appear or produce \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee \n     subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by Committee member or \n     members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and \n     refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the \n     record and the Committee member or members or staff may \n     proceed with the remainder of the deposition.\n       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is \n     transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include \n     audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed, \n     the transcript shall be made available for inspection by \n     the witness or his or her counsel under Committee \n     supervision. The witness shall sign a copy of the \n     transcript and may request changes to it, which shall be \n     handled in accordance with the procedure set forth in \n     subsection (E). If the witness fails to sign a copy, the \n     staff shall note that fact on the transcript. The \n     individual administering the oath shall certify on the \n     transcript that the witness was duly sworn in his \n     presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record of the testimony, and the \n     transcript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee. The chairman or a staff officer designated by \n     him may stipulate with the witness to changes in the \n     procedure, deviations from this procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall \n     not relieve the witness from his or her obligation to \n     testify truthfully.\n\n\n                 rule 6. committee reporting procedures\n\n       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure \n     or matter reported following final action the report thereon \n     shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest practicable \n     time. (Rule XXVI Sec. 20(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Supplemental, minority, and additional views. A member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his intention to file \n     supplemental minority or additional views at the time of \n     final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\n     than 3 calendar days in which to file such views, in writing, \n     with the chief clerk of the Committee. Such views shall then \n     be included in the Committee report and printed in the same \n     volume, as a part thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted \n     on the cover of the report. In the absence of timely notice, \n     the Committee report may be filed and printed immediately \n     without such views, (Rule XXVI, Sec. 10(c), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       C. Notice by Subcommittee chairmen. The chairman of each \n     Subcommittee shall notify the chairman in writing whenever \n     any measure has been ordered reported by such Subcommittee \n     and is ready for consideration by the full Committee.\n       D. Draft reports of Subcommittees. All draft reports \n     prepared by Subcommittees of this Committee on any measure or \n     matter referred to it by the chairman, shall be in the form, \n     style, and arrangement required to conform to the applicable \n     provisions of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and shall be \n     in accordance with the established practices followed by the \n     Committee. Upon completion of such draft reports, copies \n     thereof shall be filed with the chief clerk of the Committee \n     at the earliest practicable time.\n       E. Impact statements in reports.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my friend Chad \nDebnam and the need for hate crimes legislation. In the last Congress \nSenator Kennedy and I introduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement \nAct, a bill that would expand current hate crimes law, sending a signal \nthat violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Each day since the introduction of the Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act, I have detailed for the Record a hate crime that has \naffected our fellow citizens. Today, I would like to describe a \nterrible crime that occurred very recently, on January 19, 2003, in my \nhome State of Oregon. Four young men went on a shooting spree through \nNortheast Portland because, according to police, they thought the \nneighborhood was predominantly African American. The four fired shots \ninto cars and homes as they drove down the street. Although no one was \nphysically injured, the incident opened painful wounds in a community \nthat, like so\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\nmany others, has seen hate crimes before.\n  For Chad Debnam, the shooting was particularly difficult. 23 years \nearlier, his brother, Clarence Debnam, an African American college \nstudent, was shot through the back by a white sailor. The shooting \n``affected us so deeply, our family was never the same,'' Chad, now 52, \nsaid. ``And then it comes to visit me again.''\n  As Chad and his neighbors understand all too well, hate crimes cause \nharm above and beyond the effects produced by random acts of violence, \nbecause when such a wrong is perpetrated, the intended victim is not \njust a single person, but an entire community. And it creates within \nthat community a sense of alienation, and the very real fear that other \nmembers may be future targets of similar violence.\n  This weekend, Chad Debnam and others will be marching down the \nstreets of Northeast Portland in a united front against hate. The \nFederal Government should be there with them. Passing the Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act will demonstrate to our fellow citizens \nthat, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., ``Injustice anywhere \nis a threat to justice everywhere.'' The victims of hate, in Portland \nand elsewhere, need to know that their Federal Government stands with \nthem, and will help them create a nationwide community of hope and \nhealing, where intolerance has no place. I believe that by passing the \nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act we will not only change the law, \nbut hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1966-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FMLA\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Marylanders \nand all Americans in celebrating the anniversary of the Family and \nMedical Leave Act of 1993, FMLA. The FMLA was passed 10 years ago today \non February 5, 1993. It addressed one of the most pressing issues of \nthe time: how to help parents and other family members balance the \ndemands of work and family. Balancing these demands has always been \ndifficult, but the last few decades have seen an increase in working \nmothers, single parents and working families who are caring for elderly \nrelatives. Trying to cope with the dual burdens of work and family left \nmany families and individuals unable to meet all the demands placed on \nthem.\n  The FMLA was designed to help ease the burden on many of these \nfamilies. The FMLA requires private employers with at least 50 \nemployees, and public employers, to give unpaid leave to employees who \nmeet the eligibility requirements for such leave. To be eligible, the \nFMLA requires that employees have worked for the employer for at least \n12 months, and have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours. The employee, if \neligible, is entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave \nper 12-month period. FMLA leave can be taken to care for the ``serious \nhealth condition'' of the employee, a child of the employee or a parent \nof the employee, or for an employee to care for a newborn, newly \nadopted child or newly placed foster child. Employees are not required \nto take the leave in one block, and are entitled to receive health \nbenefits during their FMLA leave.\n  In 2001 the Department of Labor commissioned a report to study the \nimpact of the FMLA. The report found that almost 62 percent of public \nand private employees are covered by the FMLA. The benefits of the FMLA \nhave thus been applied to the majority of American workers, a \nsignificant accomplishment. In addition, the FMLA seems to be working. \nA significant majority of employers report that the FMLA has no effect \non their company's performance: 76.5 percent of employers say that the \nFMLA has no effect on productivity, 87.6 percent say that the FMLA has \nno effect on profitability, and 87.7 percent report that the FMLA has \nno effect on their company's growth. A majority of employers also \nreport that the FMLA has little to no effect on the individual \nemployee's performance. And most of the 23.8 million employees who used \nFMLA leave in 1999-2000 reported that their experience was positive.\n  Beyond these raw numbers, the FMLA has had a profound effect on the \nlives of many American workers. Working mothers and fathers are able to \ntake time to care for their sick children, sons and daughters are able \nto care for aging parents, and new mothers and fathers are able to \nspend precious time bonding with their newborns or newly adopted babies \nduring the first weeks of life. The FMLA does not force workers to \nchoose between family and work. No amount of statistics can quantify \nthe value of the days and hours family members get to spend helping one \nanother during these crucial times.\n  But we should look at ways to make this very successful program \navailable to more American workers and bring the benefits of this \nimportant legislation to more who need it. To this end, I am a \ncosponsor of a bill that would provide wage replacement for eligible \nindividuals who have taken FMLA leave for the birth or adoption of a \nson or daughter or other family care giving needs. The bill would also \namend the FMLA to extend coverage to employees at worksites of at least \n25 employees, a decrease from the current 50-employee requirement. And \nthe bill would entitle employees who must address the effects of \ndomestic violence to take FMLA leave. I urge my colleagues to work with \nme to ensure the passage and enactment of this important legislation.\n  On the 10th anniversary of the FMLA legislation, let us remember the \nsuccess of this program, and let us also focus on ways in which we can \nmake improvements to the program so that it can benefit all American \nworkers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1966-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1966-S1967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        U.N. WEAPONS INSPECTORS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I commend Senator Byrd for introducing a \nvery sensible resolution, S. Res. 28, expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the United Nations weapons inspectors should be given \nsufficient time for a thorough assessment of the level of compliance by \nthe Government of Iraq with United Nations Security Council Resolution \n1441 of 2002 and that the United States should seek a United Nations \nSecurity Council resolution specifically authorizing the use of force \nbefore initiating any offensive military operations against Iraq. I am \npleased to join several colleagues in cosponsoring it.\n  I want to be clear about one point on which I may disagree with \nSenator Byrd. S. Res. 28 states that U.N. weapons inspectors have \nfailed to obtain evidence that would prove that Iraq is in breach of \nthe terms of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441. While \nthere is little public information suggesting that weapons inspectors \nhave turned up much in the way of evidence of any kind, they have made \nsome important disclosures in their recent report, and it is clear that \nIraq has failed to meet Resolution 1441's requirement that Iraq make a \ncomplete declaration of all aspects of its chemical, biological, and \nnuclear weapons programs, as well as information about its ballistic \nmissiles and other delivery systems. The report that was submitted by \nthe Government of Iraq omitted a great deal of information, and the \n``unknowns'' left for the international community to consider are very \nserious matters. Iraq is not in compliance with Resolution 1441.\n  But this issue does not dissuade me from supporting Senator Byrd's \nadmirable resolution. Fundamentally, this resolution recognizes that \nthe threshold for starting a war through unilateral military action \nshould be very high. It should require the presence of an imminent \nthreat, or a solid connection to al-Qaida, in which case unambiguous \nU.S. action is already, and rightly, authorized. Based on the \ninformation available to me, I have determined that we have not reached \nthat point.\n  I wholeheartedly agree with the resolution's assertion that the U.S. \nand others should work to exhaust all peaceful and diplomatic means of \ndisarming Iraq. I also agree that the U.S. should seek authorization \nfrom the Security Council before pursuing the last resort of military \naction in Iraq. Should we reach a point at which the use of force \nappears to be the only option, we should try to increase the legitimacy \nof any action and decrease the potential costs pursuing this \nmultilateral approach.\n  While calling for exhaustive diplomatic efforts, ongoing inspections \nwork, and a multilateral approach, S. Res 28 also asserts that the \nUnited States should continue to actively seek to bring peace to the \nIsraeli and Palestinian peoples, and notes that the\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\nUnited States should redouble its efforts to reduce our vulnerability \nto terrorist attack. These are important issues to keep at the \nforefront of U.S. policy in the weeks and months ahead.\n  Overall, the resolution presents a reasonable approach to a difficult \nissue, and I believe that it reflects many of the concerns that I am \nhearing from my constituents in Wisconsin. Their voices and their \nquestions belong at the center of our discussion about Iraq. I believe \nthat this resolution helps to move my constituents' very serious \nconcerns closer to that central role.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1967-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my Maryland \nconstituents and millions of Americans in celebrating African-American \nHistory Month this February.\n  Dr. Carter Godwin Woodson founded the Association for the Study of \nNegro Life and History in 1915. Shortly after its creation, the \nAssociation began a campaign to establish Negro History Week to \nhighlight the many accomplishments of African Americans. Dr. Woodson \nachieved this goal in 1926, and the second week of February was chosen \nto recognize the contributions of African Americans to American \nsociety. In 1976, this week of observance was expanded to a month and \nbecame African-American History Month. This month of observance is a \ntime to recognize a crucial part of our diversity: the vast history and \nlegacy that African Americans have contributed to the founding and \nbuilding of our Nation. While we have much to celebrate in the \nachievements of many African Americans and the great strides this \ncountry has made towards true equality, there is also much work to be \ndone.\n  Each year, the Association for the Study of African American Life and \nHistory, ASALH, designates a theme for the Black History Month \nobservance, and this year it is ``The Souls of Black Folk: Centennial \nReflections.'' This year's theme focuses on the past contributions of \nAfrican Americans and the many significant ways in which African \nAmericans have made our Nation better.\n  At the beginning of the last century, our Nation was a vastly \ndifferent place than it is today. The country was divided along racial \nlines and racism was accepted and institutionalized. African Americans \nwere not allowed to vote, and the opportunities available to African \nAmericans were few. Today, thanks to the visions of a few and the \nsacrifices of many, that situation has changed.\n  Much of the last century was filled with hardship for African \nAmericans. Despite this, African Americans made great strides in many \nareas and participated in every sector of our society. Throughout the \npast 100 years, African Americans have made remarkable contributions to \nour society as mathematicians, scientists, novelists, poets, \npoliticians, and members of the armed services.\n  Regrettably, just this year we lost two Marylanders who contributed \nmuch to African-American and American history in the last century, Du \nBurns and Bea Gaddy. Du Burns was the first African-American mayor of \nBaltimore. He brought the city together and although he ultimately \nbecame mayor, he never forgot his humble beginnings, including a job as \na locker room attendant at Dunbar High School. Bea Gaddy was an \nadvocate for the homeless and a Baltimore City Council member who \ndevoted her life to feeding hungry Baltimoreans and making Baltimore a \nbetter place to live. We will forever remember the sacrifices and \nachievements of these two remarkable people.\n  No discussion of the last century in the lives of African Americans \ncould be complete without a tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr., whose \nbirthday we recently celebrated. His teachings and the example of his \nlife offer much for us to be hopeful about in the coming century. We \nmust look to his words and deeds to remind ourselves of his great \nvision and must never forget the profound change he helped bring about \nin this country. His teachings transcend race, and we have much to \nlearn from him about humanity as we confront the challenges of the new \ncentury. And the challenges are many. We must continue to work to \neliminate racism and inequality, and we must work to combat \nintolerance, not just in our own country, but throughout the world.\n  Last year, the theme of African-American History Month posed the \nquestion, Is Racism Dead? Unfortunately, the answer is still no. There \nis much that we in Congress can do to continue to meet the challenges \nof inequality in our country. We can help the parents of working \nfamilies by raising the minimum wage. We have already passed the Leave \nNo Child Behind education reform bill that will provide new standards \nfor schools and teachers and will help make quality education available \nto all Americans. We have passed an election reform bill to ensure that \nall voters are properly registered and every vote is counted. We must \nnow fully fund these initiatives that have successfully passed \nCongress. And we need to make health care available and affordable for \nAfrican Americans and all Americans.\n  Through the lessons and struggles of the last century and the trying \nfirst few years of this century, Americans have shown the world how \npeople of all races, colors, religions and nationalities create the \nfabric of our Nation, a fabric that is richer because of our \ndifferences. This month, we honor the special contribution African \nAmericans have made to that fabric. Through African-American History \nMonth, we celebrate how far this country has come and remind ourselves \nof how far we have to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1967-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE PRESIDENT'S HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I commend our President for the historic \ncommitment to fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic that he articulated in the \nState of the Union address.\n  As a 10-year member of the Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs--\nand over half of those years have been as either the ranking minority \nmember or the chairman--I have seen the terrible unfolding of the \npandemic. I have read and repeated the numbing statistics that grow \nmore horrifying every year. I have met with orphans, the sick, the \ndying, the mourning. I have met with doctors and nurses overwhelmed by \nthe task before them, public health officials impassioned in their \npleas for more assistance, volunteers aching for the plight of the \nchildren they care for each day.\n  I believe that I understand the magnitude of this crisis as well as \nanyone can comprehend something so big and so devastating.\n  And I also understand that what the President promised to do is a \nvast leap forward, a truly visionary step toward doing what is right. \nIt is in our interest, and in the interest of global stability. But it \nis also simply the right thing to do, to refuse to turn away from human \nsuffering on a grand scale, to take action, to set meaningful goals and \nprovide the resources and the will to achieve them. This is a noble \nundertaking. It is a constructive and humane act at a time when, too \noften, we feel surrounded by the forces of destruction. The President \ndeserves our praise. I hope that his words will be transformed into \naction soon.\n  Congress certainly will be interested in understanding how the \nAdministration plans to phase in additional spending, because the need \nis urgent and we cannot keep pushing our responsibility off into the \nfuture. It is critically important that pressing humanitarian and \ndevelopment priorities will not be robbed to finance this important \ninitiative. And I hope that we take greater advantage of the Global \nFund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria than we have in the past so that we \ncan leverage our dollars for maximum impact.\n  But the bottom line is that this is a truly historic step, which is \nthe only appropriate response to a historic crisis. We should celebrate \nthis initiative. And then we should roll up our sleeves get to work on \nmaking it as effective as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1967-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1967-S1968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          BURN AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the importance of National Burn\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\nAwareness Week, February 2 to 8. This week provides an opportunity to \neducate children and families about the risks that lead to unfortunate \nand tragic accidents.\n  Unfortunately our most vulnerable, infants and young children, face \ngreater risks from burn injuries than adults or older children. They \nrely on the adults around them to ensure their environment is safe and \nfree from potential burn-causing hazards. That is why in addition to \ntreating over 20 percent of all pediatric burns in the Nation at their \nfour national burn centers in Boston, Galveston, Cincinnati, and \nSacramento, Shriners Hospitals focus on education and prevention of \nburn injuries.\n  The Shriners Hospitals for Children is a unique charitable \norganization that has never sought nor received Federal, State, local, \nor third-party funding of any kind. Additionally, Shriners Hospitals \nare distinctive in that they offer full physical, psychological, and \nemotional care to all the children they treat.\n  The annual budget for the 22 orthopedic and burn hospitals totals \nover half a billion dollars and has an active patient roster of over \n156,000 children. It is obvious how important the Shriners Hospitals \nare to the health of our children. The Shriners Hospitals are \ncompletely free to victims, despite the fact that they will spend $1.5 \nmillion on children every day this year.\n  In recognition of Burn Awareness Week, I ask my colleagues to commend \nsuch charitable organizations as the Shriners Hospitals that contribute \nto the care, education, and research necessary to treat and work to \nprevent children's burn accidents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1968-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CARROLL COLLEGE WINS NATIONAL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat bunch of college athletes from one of the best colleges in the \nNorthwest. On December 21, the Carroll College Fighting Saints from \nHelena, MT, defeated the Georgetown Tigers of Georgetown, KY, to win \nCarroll's first NAIA national football championship.\n  The Fighting Saints scored 21 points in the first half, leading the \nTigers 21 to 7. These 21 points were the most the Tiger defense had \ngiven up all season. Additionally, this was the first time they had \ntrailed at halftime all season. During the second half, the Saints \nscored their fourth touchdown. This touchdown went unanswered by the \nTigers, and the Fighting Saints won their first NAIA title by a score \nof 28 to 7.\n  The 2002 Carroll team is truly one of the best to play in the \nFrontier Conference, and I can personally attest to that since I had \nthe pleasure of watching this fine team play last year. However, this \nis not by any means the first time this school has had an outstanding \nfootball team. Carroll College has a long tradition of outstanding \ncoaches and student athletes. One noteworthy team was the 1931 Mount \nSaint Charles College football squad. It wasn't until the next year \nthat Mount Saint Charles became Carroll College. This 1931 team went 6 \nand 0, beating Montana State University twice. Incidentally, these \nfootball players were unscored upon during that year. This team was the \nCarroll College team of the 20th century, and the 2002 Fighting Saints \nare truly the team of the 21st century.\n  The 2002 national championship team had four players named to the \nNAIA All American football team, a great honor for any program. While \nthese are outstanding athletes, they are not alone. Every member of \nthis team played an important role in winning this national \nchampionship. That is why, at this time, I would like to submit a full \nFighting Saints roster to be printed in the Record of the Senate \nfollowing my statement. I would also like to commend Coach Mike Van \nDiest and his coaching staff for putting together and leading such a \nfine team.\n  Carroll College has long been known for quality athletic programs, \nbut its academic reputation is one that receives national attention \nyear after year. In the fall of 2002, U.S. News and World Report ranked \nCarroll as the fourth best comprehensive college in the West. This is \nCarroll's ninth year in the top 10 in this category. The pre-med class \nof 2002 had a 100-percent acceptance rate at prestigious medical \nschools all across the country. Carroll's accounting students achieve a \nfirst-time CPA exam passage rate three times the national average.

JOSETTE LINDAHL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nDr. Josette Lindahl of Vermillion, SD, for being named one of six \nNational Institute of Mental Health Outstanding Psychiatry Residents \nand South Dakota's first recipient of a National Institute of Health \ngrant.\n  A third-year psychiatry resident at the University of South Dakota \nSchool of Medicine, Josette will use the 3-year National Institute of \nHealth grant, which is awarded to physicians who have the desire to \nperform research, to study glutamate receptor subunit function and \nschizophrenia. Josette hopes her research will lead to a better \nunderstanding of schizophrenia and more effective treatments. She has \nalso received a grant from Avera McKennan Hospital to study brain \nreceptors and their role in the etiology of schizophrenia.\n  In 1982, Josette received her bachelor's degree from the University \nof South Dakota where she was a Presidential Alumni Scholar. Three \nyears after graduating, she opened her own business in Vermillion and \nperformed veterinary diagnostic tests. Josette's company became the \nfirst joint venture between a State agency and a private high-tech \ncorporation. In 1996, she received a Ph.D., from the University of \nSouth Dakota, and in 2000 earned her medical degree. Today, Josette \nsees patients 2 days a week at Lewis and Clark Mental Health Center in \nYankton, as well as being on call at hospitals in Sioux Falls.\n  Josette's medical and research talents have enhanced the lives of \ncountless South Dakotans and will lead to important developments in the \nfuture care of mental health patients. Her hard work and determination \nserves as a model for other talented health care professionals to \nemulate. I am pleased to be able to share her accomplishments with my \ncolleagues and to be able to publicly commend her work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S1968-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1968-S1969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH THE MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE \n        ACCOUNT AND THE MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION--PM 12\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit a legislative proposal to establish the \nMillennium\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\nChallenge Account and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Also \ntransmitted is a section-by-section analysis.\n  The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) represents a new approach to \nproviding and delivering development assistance. This new compact for \ndevelopment breaks with the past by tying increased assistance to \nperformance and creating new accountability for all nations. This \nproposal implements my commitment to increase current levels of core \ndevelopment assistance by 50 percent over the next 3 years, thus \nproviding an annual increase of $5 billion by fiscal year 2006. To be \neligible for this new assistance, countries must demonstrate commitment \nto three standards--ruling justly, investing in their people, and \nencouraging economic freedom. Given this commitment, and the link \nbetween financial accountability and development success, special \nattention will be given to fighting corruption.\n  The goal of the Millennium Challenge Account initiative is to reduce \npoverty by significantly increasing economic growth in recipient \ncountries through a variety of targeted investments. The MCA will be \nadministered by a new, small Government corporation, called the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation, designed to support innovative \nstrategies and to ensure accountability for measurable results. The \nCorporation will be supervised by a Board of Directors chaired by the \nSecretary of State and composed of other Cabinet-level officials. The \nCorporation will be led by a Chief Executive Officer appointed by the \nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. This \nproposal provides the Corporation with flexible authorities to optimize \nprogram implementation, contracting, and personnel selection while \npursuing innovative strategies.\n  The Millennium Challenge Account initiative recognizes the need for \ncountry ownership, financial oversight, and accountability for results \nto ensure effective assistance. We cannot accept permanent poverty in a \nworld of progress. The MCA will provide people in developing nations \nthe tools they need to seize the opportunities of the global economy. I \nurge the prompt and favorable consideration of this legislation.\n                                                      George W.

Such bilateral agreements provide \nfor limited coordination between the United States and foreign social \nsecurity systems to eliminate dual social security coverage and \ntaxation, and to help prevent the lost benefit protection that can \noccur when workers divide their careers between two countries. The \nrevised United States-Norwegian Agreement contains all provisions \nmandated by section 233 and other provisions, which I deem appropriate \nto carry out the purposes of section 233, pursuant to section \n233(c)(4).\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report prepared \nby the Social Security Administration explaining the key points of the \nAgreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph explanation of the \nprovisions of the principal agreement and the administrative agreement. \nAnnexed to this report is the report required by section 233(e)(1) of \nthe Social Security Act, a report on the effect of the Agreement on \nincome and expenditures of the United States Social Security program \nand the number of individuals affected by the Agreement.

However, the legislation will be \n     effective only if the President requests money to cover its \n     costs in his next budget; and\n       Whereas, These disabled military retirees fought in World \n     War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and a dozen brush \n     fire wars in unremembered countries, risking everything for \n     our country.

and\n       Whereas, California is a state whose scientific \n     achievements and research regarding recombinant DNA outstrip \n     the rest of the country; and\n       Whereas, California's success with respect to biotechnology \n     is largely attributable to the freedom of researchers to \n     perform pioneering work at the frontiers of scientific \n     discovery; and\n       Whereas, The biotechnology industry contributes to the \n     growth of the state and national economy, and produces a \n     significant amount of jobs and revenue; and\n       Whereas, Therapeutic cloning promises to be the next field \n     of rapid progress in the realm of biotechnology; and\n       Whereas, Scientists confirm that embryonic stems cells hold \n     far more potential than adult stem cells as to the \n     development of treatments and cures for disease; and\n       Whereas, A prohibition on stem cell research would stifle \n     scientific innovation, diminish the ability of biomedical \n     companies to maintain the nation's role as the reigning world \n     leader in biotechnology and biomedicine, drive talented \n     scientists outside the country, and set the United States \n     decades behind other nations in the development of medical \n     therapies; and\n       Whereas, An estimated 128 million Americans suffer the \n     debilitating physiological, economic, and emotional burdens \n     of chronic and degenerative diseases, including diabetes, \n     heart disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, \n     cancer, and Alzheimer's disease; and\n       Whereas, The cost of treatment for these diseases and of \n     lost productivity totals hundreds of billions of dollars \n     every year; and\n       Whereas, Stem cell research provides a critical means to \n     unlock fundamental questions of cellular biology that are key \n     to curing cancer; and\n       Whereas, Stem cell research has immense potential to \n     provide medical therapies to cure and treat many other \n     debilitating diseases; and\n       Whereas, A prohibition on stem cell research and \n     therapeutic cloning will deny over one-third of Americans \n     their foremost opportunity for a cure or effective treatment \n     for disease, by denying scientists the chance to develop \n     efficient medications and therapies; and\n       Whereas, The United States has historically been a haven \n     for scientific inquiry and technological innovation, and this \n     environment of scientific openness, coupled with a commitment \n     of public and private resources, has made this country the \n     reigning leader in the fields of biomedicine and \n     biotechnology; and\n       Whereas, California's biomedical industry constitutes a \n     significant portion of the state's economy, employing over \n     225,000 Californians in over 2,500 companies, investing more \n     than $2.1 billion in research, and creating $12.8 billion in \n     wages and salaries worldwide as well as revenues of nearly \n     $7.8 billion; and\n       Whereas, The biomedical industry would be considerably \n     harmed by a prohibition of stem cell research and therapeutic \n     cloning; and\n       Whereas, Proposed federal legislation that imposes barriers \n     to this research prioritizes the religious values of a \n     national minority ahead of the public health interests of \n     Californians and all Americans, criminalizes the legitimate \n     pursuit of effective medical therapy, and prevents physicians \n     from fulfilling their moral and professional obligation to \n     offer patients the best treatment available: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the President and Congress of the \n     United States to reject legislation that inappropriately \n     impedes the progress of medical science by impeding stem cell \n     and therapeutic cloning research, and denies Americans legal \n     access to effective medical therapies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the President \n     and Congress of the United States to enact legislation that \n     would do all of the following:\n       (1) Impose a ban on reproductive cloning.\n       (2) Permit research involving therapeutic cloning, \n     including the derivation of or use of stem cells from any \n     source.\n       (3) Establish a process to facilitate the donation of \n     material containing stem cells to researchers and ensure this \n     material is donated by informed participants who provide \n     written consent.\n       (4) Establish guidelines to oversee stem cell research \n     conducted in the United States to ensure that this research \n     is safe and is conducted within appropriate medical, ethical, \n     and moral parameters;

and\n       Whereas, Investment agreements affect state and local \n     powers, including, but not limited to, zoning, protection of \n     groundwater and other natural resources, corporate ownership \n     of land and casinos, law enforcement by courts, public \n     services, and sovereign immunity; and\n       Whereas, Investment rules under these agreements deviate \n     from United states legal precedents on takings law and \n     deference to legislative determinations on protecting the \n     public interest; and\n       Whereas, Investment rules do not safeguard any category of \n     law from investor complaints, including, but not limited to, \n     laws, passed in the interest of protecting human or animal \n     health, environmental resources, humans rights, and labor \n     rights; and\n       Whereas, Foreign investors have used the provisions of \n     NAFTA's investment chapter to challenge core powers of state \n     and local government, including, but not limited to, \n     regulatory power to protect groundwater in California; the \n     power of civil juries to use punitive damages to deter \n     corporate fraud in Mississippi; the ability of states to \n     invoke sovereign immunity in Massachusetts; and a decision by \n     local government to deny a zoning permit for construction of \n     a hazardous waste dump in Guadalcazar, Mexico; and\n       Whereas, Serious concerns about international investment \n     agreements have been expressed by national government \n     associations, including the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures, which urged federal trade negotiators not to \n     commit the United States to further investor-to-state dispute \n     provisions such as those pending under NAFTA; the National \n     League of Cities, which has expressed concern that expansion \n     of investment rules could undermine the successful effort by \n     state and local governments to defeat legislation to expand \n     compensation for takings in the 104th Congress;

Dennis \n     Hastert, to House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-45. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of California relative to human exposure to \n     environmental chemicals; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 49\n\n       Whereas, In 1999, the federal Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention (CDC) issued its first National Report on \n     Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, a new publication \n     that provides an ongoing assessment of the United States \n     population's exposure to environmental chemicals using \n     biomonitoring; and\n       Whereas, ``Environmental chemical'' means a chemical \n     compound or chemical element present in air, water, soil, \n     dust, food, or other environmental media, and \n     ``biomonitoring'' is the assessment of human exposure to \n     chemicals by measuring the chemicals or their metabolites in \n     human specimens, such as blood or urine collected in the \n     representative survey known as the National Health and \n     Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); and\n       Whereas, It is important to know which chemicals are stored \n     in the body because they act as a ``reservoir'' for continued \n     exposure, with potentially serious health consequences, since \n     a chemical that accumulates in the body over time can \n     increase the potential for disease to occur; and\n       Whereas, The first edition of the National Report on Human \n     Exposure to Environmental Chemicals presents levels of 27 \n     environmental chemicals measured in the United States \n     population, including metals such as lead, mercury, uranium, \n     cotinine, a marker of tobacco smoke exposure, and \n     organophosphate pesticide metabolites, as well as phthalates; \n     and\n       Whereas, The National Report on Human Exposure to \n     Environmental Chemicals determines the toxic substances to \n     which Americans are exposed, as well as populations at risk, \n     volumes of toxic substances used, and exposure trends; and\n       Whereas, The National Report on Human Exposure to \n     Environmental Chemicals determines whether interventions to \n     reduce exposure have been effective; and\n       Whereas, In collaboration with other federal agencies, the \n     National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals \n     provides additional information on interpreting lab \n     measurements, including potential sources of exposure and \n     human toxicity; and\n       Whereas, The next National Report on Human Exposure to \n     Environmental Chemicals is due to be issued by December 2002 \n     and will analyze 75 chemicals; and\n       Whereas, The National Report on Human Exposure to \n     Environmental Chemicals' findings, organized by state and \n     demographics, were to be made available in January of 2002; \n     and\n       Whereas, California is a world leader in clean air and \n     water standards, often improving upon federal standards; and\n       Whereas, The California survey within the National Report \n     on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals constitutes a \n     valid sample in its own right; and\n       Whereas, The National Report on Human Exposure to \n     Environmental Chemicals' specific findings for the State of \n     California will help the State Department of Health Services, \n     the Legislature, and the Governor's office to address \n     California's environmental health needs; and\n       Whereas, The State Department of Health Services is \n     responsible for developing a plan to establish an \n     environmental health tracking system by 2003, a project that \n     requires collation of all available data sets; and\n       Whereas, The National Report on Human Exposure to \n     Environmental Chemicals will inform the planning process as \n     California builds capacity at state biomonitoring facilities; \n     and\n       Whereas, The State Department of Health Services needs to \n     make a budgetary commitment to addition biomonitoring to \n     augment CDC findings; and\n       Whereas, The California public has the right to information \n     regarding regional exposures to particular chemicals; and\n       Whereas, California findings on particular chemicals will \n     serve as an information base for populations concerned about \n     decreasing chemical risks in their communities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the President of the \n     United States, the United States Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, the Director of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, and the California Congressional \n     delegation to seek the immediate release to the State \n     Department of Health Services, and thereby to the California \n     public, of the California-specific findings from the 1999 CDC \n     National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     respectfully memorializes the Director of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention to release to the State \n     Department of Health Services all California-specific \n     findings from the National Report on Human Exposure to \n     Environmental Chemicals that is due to be issued by December \n     2002, at the time that report is issued;

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat reimbursements for costs of using passenger automobiles for \ncharitable and other organizations are excluded from gross income, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation \ntoday that would increase the mileage reimbursement rate for \nvolunteers.\n  Under current law, when volunteers use their cars for charitable \npurposes, the volunteers may be reimbursed up to 14 cents per mile for \ntheir donated services without triggering a tax consequence for either \nthe organization or the volunteers. If the charitable organization \nreimburses any more than that, they are required to file an information \nreturn indicating the amount, and the volunteers must include the \namount over 14 cents per mile in their taxable income. By contrast, the \nmileage reimbursement level currently permitted for businesses is 36 \ncents per mile.\n  At the time when government is asking volunteers and volunteer \norganizations to bear a greater burden of delivering essential \nservices, the 14 cents per mile limit is posing a very real hardship on \ncharitable organizations and other nonprofit groups. I have heard from \na number of people in Wisconsin on the need to increase this \nreimbursement limit.\n  At a listening session I held last summer, one organization, the \nPortage County Department on Aging, explained just how important \nvolunteer drivers are to their ability to provide services to seniors \nin that county. The Department on Aging reported that in 2001, 54 \nvolunteer drivers delivered meals to homes and transported people to \nmedical appointments, meal sites, and other essential services. The \nDepartment noted that their volunteer drivers provided 4,676 rides, and \ndrove nearly 126,000 miles. They also delivered 9,385 home-delivered \nmeals, and nearly two-thirds of the drivers logged more than 100 miles \nper month in providing these needed services. Together, volunteers \ndonated over 5,200 hours last year, and as the Department notes, at the \nrate of minimum wage, that amounts to over $27,000, not including other \nbenefits.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the senior meals program is one of the \nmost vital services provided under the Older Americans Act, and \nensuring that meals can be delivered to seniors or that seniors can be \ntaken to meal sites is an essential part of that program. \nUnfortunately, Federal support for the senior nutrition programs has \nstagnated in recent years. This has increased pressure on local \nprograms to leverage more volunteer services to make up for lagging \nfederal support. The 14 cents per mile reimbursement limit, though, \nincreasingly poses a barrier to obtaining those contributions. Portage \nCounty reports that many of their volunteers cannot afford to offer \ntheir services under such a restriction. And if volunteers cannot be \nfound, their services will have to be replaced by contracting with a \nprovider, greatly increasing costs to the Department, costs that come \ndirectly out of the pot of funds available to pay for meals and other \nservices.\n  By contrast, businesses do not face this restrictive mileage \nreimbursement limit. The comparable mileage rate for someone who works \nfor a business is currently 36 cents per mile. This disparity means \nthat a business hired to deliver the same meals delivered by volunteers \nfor Portage County may reimburse their employees over double the amount \npermitted the volunteer without a tax consequence.\n  This doesn't make sense. The 14 cents per mile volunteer \nreimbursement limit is badly outdated. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, Congress first set a reimbursement rate of 12 cents \nper mile as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, and did not \nincrease it until 1997, when the level was raised slightly, to 14 cents \nper mile, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  The bill I am introducing today is identical to a measure I \nintroduced in the 107th Congress. It raises the limit on volunteer \nmileage reimbursement to the level permitted to businesses. It is \nessentially the same provision passed by the Senate as part of a tax \nbill passed in 1999 that was vetoed by President Clinton. At the time \nof the 1999 measure, the Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, estimated \nthat the mileage reimbursement provision would result in the loss of $1 \nmillion over the five-year fiscal period from 1999 to 2004. The revenue \nloss was so small that the JCT did not make the estimate on a year by \nyear basis.\n  Though the revenue loss is small, it is vital that we do everything \nwe can to move toward a balanced budget, and to that end I have \nincluded a provision to fully offset the cost of the measure and make \nit deficit neutral. The offset provision would impose a civil penalty \nof up to $5,000 on failure to report interest in foreign financial \ntransactions. During the 107th Congress, that provision was included in \nthe CARE Act legislation by the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It will help ensure \ncharitable organizations can continue to attract the volunteers that \nplay such a critical role in helping to deliver services and\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\nit will simplify the tax code both for nonprofit groups and the \nvolunteers themselves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise the boundaries of the Golden Gate National \nRecreation Area in the State of California, to restore and extend the \nterm of the advisory commission for the recreation area, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this \nlegislation today with Senator Boxer to allow the National Park Service \nto extend the boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, \nGGNRA, by acquiring critical natural landscapes and scenic vistas. Last \nyear, this bill was successfully passed out of the Senate, but was not \npassed by the House before the 107th Congress adjourned.\n  This bill meets two distinct needs in California by adding 4,700 \nacres of pristine natural land to the boundary of the Golden Golden \nGate Recreation Area, GGNRA, and by extending the Golden Gate National \nRecreational Area, GGNRA, Advisory Commission for ten more years.\n  A key component of this legislation is that about half of the total \ncost of purchasing these lands will be donated by the local community. \nThis legislation specifically provides that all land transactions \ninvolve a willing seller and willing buyer.\n  Furthermore, this bill has the strong support of the local \nenvironmental and preservation groups, the Point Reyes National \nSeashore Advisory Commission, and the National Park Service. I know of \nno opposition to this bill.\n  The three Marin County properties lie in the Marin headlands. \nPreservation of these lands will protect habitat, ridge-top trails and \nscenic views of San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.\n  The city of San Francisco would like to donate to the Federal \nGovernment the San Francisco land along the Pacific coastline, and has \nauthorized $100,000 for the restoration of the site.\n  The addition of the Rancho Corral de Tierra property will protect \nsweeping views of the San Mateo Coast and ensure the protection of rich \nfarmland, several miles of public trails, and an incredible array of \nwildlife and vegetation. All or part of four watersheds, and several \nendangered species such as the peregrine falcon, San Bruno elfin \nbutterfly, San Francisco garter snake and the red-legged grog. \nMoreover, due to the coastal marine influence and dramatic altitude \nchanges, plants grow on the property that are found nowhere else in the \nworld.\n  The second component of this bill extends the advisory commission of \nthe Golden Gate National Recreation Area for ten more years.\n  This commission has an active committee that represents a wide range \nof user groups from bicyclists to bird watchers to outdoor enthusiasts. \nIt provides a vital communications link between the Park Service and \nthe surrounding communities that enjoy the attractions that this \nnational site has to offer. Without this commission, the Park Service \nwould be hard pressed to provide the same level of service and \nattention to the broad interests and diverse communities that it \nserves.\n  I continue to be a strong advocate for public involvement in Park \nService decisions. I believe that this commission has been essential in \nensuring that the Park Service upholds its commitment to allow \ncommunity participation in its decision making process, particularly \nwhen it comes to contentious issues.\n  California's national parks are truly invaluable and the park that \nthis bill supports offers an opportunity for visitors and residents to \nenjoy unique national habitats and open spaces. This legislation \ncontinues the legacy that enables the Park Service and the community to \nwork together, not only to protect the environment, but also the \ninterests of the nearby communities.\n  This bill enjoys strong support from local and State officials and I \nhope that it will have as much strong bipartisan support this Congress, \nas it did last Congress. Congressman Tom Lantos plans to introduce \ncompanion legislation for this bill in the House and I applaud his \nleadership on this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 302\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nexpand the scope of the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, Senator Corzine, \nSenator Murray, and Senator Mikulski, to introduce the Family and \nMedical Leave Expansion Act. Today marks the 10th anniversary of the \nenactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act. This landmark \nlegislation was nearly a decade in the making, but today, a decade \nafter enactment, more than 35 million Americans have taken leave under \nFMLA.\n  Despite the many Americans the Family and Medical Leave Act has \nhelped, too many continue to be left behind. Too many continue to have \nto choose between job and family. The facts are clear: millions of \nAmericans remain uncovered by the Family and Medical Leave Act. And, \ntoo many who are eligible for the Family and Medical Leave Act cannot \nafford to take unpaid leave from work. The ``Family and Medical Leave \nExpansion Act'', which we are introducing today addresses both these \nproblems.\n  The ``Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act'' would expand the scope \nand coverage of FMLA. It would fund pilot programs at the State level \nto offer partial or full wage replacement programs to ensure that \nemployees do not have to choose between job and family.\n  Times have changed over the years. More and more mothers are working. \nWhile only 27 percent of mothers with infants were in the labor force \nin 1960, by 1999 that percentage rose to nearly 60 percent. Even as \nemployment rates within this group rises, family responsibilities \nremain constant, a reality that lies at the core of the FMLA. According \nto an employee survey by the Department of Labor, about one fifth of US \nworkers have a need for some form of leave covered under the FMLA, and \nabout 40 percent of all employees think they will need FMLA-covered \nleave within the next five years.\n  According to a Department of Labor study in 2000, leave to care for \none's own health or for the health of a seriously ill child, spouse or \nparent, together account for almost 80 percent of all FMLA leave. \nApproximately 52 percent of the leave taken is due to employees' own \nserious health problems, while 26 percent of the leave is taken by \nyoung parents caring for their children at birth or adoption.\n  The FMLA requires that all public sector employers and private \nemployers of 50 or more employees provide up to twelve weeks of unpaid \nleave for medical and family care reasons for eligible employees. About \n77 percent of employees, in the private and public sector, currently \nwork in FMLA-covered sites, although only 62 percent of employees are \nactually eligible for leave.\n  However, only 11 percent of private sector work sites are covered \nunder FMLA. Individuals working for small private employers deserve the \nsame work protections afforded to other employees. As a step toward \nexpanding protection to all hard-working Americans, this bill would \nextend FMLA coverage to all private sector worksites with 25 or more \nemployees within a 75-mile radius. This would mean that an additional \n13 million Americans would be eligible for leave under the Act, roughly \n240,000 in my own State of Connecticut.\n  Mothers and fathers, sons and daughters have the same family \nresponsibilities and personal health problems, regardless of whether \nthey work for the government, a large private enterprise, or a small \nprivate business. Expanding the FMLA to businesses with 25 or more \nemployees is a crucial acknowledgment of this reality.\n  The bill recognizes the enormous physical and emotional toll domestic \nviolence takes on victims. The bill expands the scope of FMLA to \ninclude leave for individuals to care for themselves or to care for a \ndaughter, son, or parent suffering from domestic violence.\n  Expanding the scope and coverage of FMLA is a positive step for many \nAmericans. But, alone, it is not enough. According to a Department of \nLabor study, 3.5 million covered Americans needed leave but, without \nwage replacement, could not afford to take leave. Over four-fifths of \nthose who needed leave but did not take it said they could not afford \nunpaid leave. Others cut their leave short, with the average duration \nof FMLA leave being 10 days. Of those individuals taking leave under \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, nearly three-quarters had incomes \nabove $30,000.\n  While the financial sacrifice is often enormous, the need for leave \ncan be even more so. Every year, many Americans bite the bullet and \naccept unpaid leave. As a result, nine percent of leave takers go on \npublic assistance to cover their lost wages. Almost twelve percent of \nfemale leave takers use public assistance for this reason. These \nindividuals are far from being unwilling to work. Instead, they are \ntrying to balance work with family, often during a crisis, too often \nwith inadequate means to get by.\n  Other major industrialized nations have implemented policies far more \nfamily-friendly to promote early childhood development and family \ncaregiving. At least 128 countries provide paid and job-protected \nmaternity leave, with sixteen weeks the average basic paid leave. In \n1992, before we enacted the Family and Medical Leave Act, the European \nUnion mandated a paid fourteen week maternity leave as a health and \nsafety measure. Among the 29 Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, OECD, countries, the average childbirth-related leave is \n44 weeks, while the average duration of paid leave is 36 weeks.\n  Compared to these other developed nations, the United States is far \nbehind in efforts to promote worker welfare and productivity. The \n``Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act'' builds on current law to \nprovide pilot programs for States and the Federal Government to provide \nfor partial or full wage replacement for 6 weeks. At a minimum, this \nwill ensure that parents can continue to make ends meet while taking \nfamily and medical leave.\n  When we talk about a more compassionate America, no where is that \nmore evident than in our caregiving leave policies. No one should have \nto choose between work and family. Women and men deserve to take leave \nwhen family or health conditions require it without fear of losing \ntheir job or livelihood. We must not simply pay lip service to family \nintegrity and the promotion of a healthy workplace. Instead, we must \nactively work to reduce workplace barriers.\n\n[[Page S1981]]\n\n  We talk often of our need to strengthen family values. We cite \nstudies about the importance of the first few months of a newborn's \nlife. This is our chance to offer more parents the opportunity to spend \nmore time with their families, to help fulfill the call to provide a \nmore compassionate America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the ``Family and Medical Leave \nExpansion Act'' to promote our family values and ensure the welfare and \nhealth of hard-working Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the summary of the Family and \nMedical Leave Expansion Act be printed in the Record.\n\n               The Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act\n\n\n                             Brief Summary\n\n       Background: Since enactment in 1993, more than 35 million \n     employees have taken leave under the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act. Under current law, an employee is eligible for 12 weeks \n     of unpaid leave if she or he has worked for an employer for \n     at least 12 months; has worked for 1,250 hours over the 12 \n     months before leave is needed; and works at a location with \n     50 or more employees within 75 miles. About 11 percent of \n     private sector businesses are covered under FMLA; 77 percent \n     of employees work in these covered businesses (although about \n     62 percent of employees are eligible for FMLA).\n       According to the most recent data, 52 percent of leave-\n     takers have taken time off to care for their own serious \n     illness; 26 percent of leave-takers have taken time off to \n     care for a new child or for maternity disability reasons; 13 \n     percent have taken time off to care for a seriously ill \n     parent; 12 percent have taken time off to care for a \n     seriously ill child; and 6 percent have taken time off to \n     care for a seriously ill spouse. About 42 percent of leave \n     takers are men; about 58 percent of leave-takers are women. \n     The median length of leave is 10 days; 80% of leaves are for \n     40 days or fewer. About 73 percent of leave-takers earn \n     $30,000 or more.\n       The Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act would expand the \n     scope and coverage of FMLA to ensure that even more American \n     workers do not have to choose between job and family. Too \n     many eligible individuals simply cannot afford unpaid leave. \n     Many forgo leave or take the shortest amount of time possible \n     because the current FMLA law requires only unpaid leave. The \n     Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act would:\n       Establish a pilot program to allocate grants to states to \n     provide paid leave for 6 weeks to eligible employees \n     responding to caregiving needs resulting from the birth or \n     adoption of a child or family illness. States may provide for \n     wage replacement directly or through an insurance program, \n     such as a state temporary disability program or a state \n     unemployment compensation program, or other mechanism. Such \n     paid leave shall count toward an eligible employee's 12 weeks \n     of leave under FMLA.\n       Expand the number of individuals eligible for FMLA by \n     covering employers with 25 or more employees (to enable 13 \n     million more Americans to take FMLA).\n       Expand the reasons for leave to include eligible employees \n     addressing domestic violence and its effects, which make the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the position of \n     such employee or, to care for the son, daughter, or parent of \n     the employee, if such individual is addressing domestic \n     violence and its effects.\n       Establish a pilot program within the federal government for \n     the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to administer a \n     partial or full wage replacement for 6 weeks to eligible \n     employees responding to caregiving needs resulting from the \n     birth or adoption of a child or other family caregiving \n     needs. Such paid leave shall count toward an eligible \n     employee's 12 weeks of leave under FMLA.\n       Allows employees to use a total of 24 hours during any 12 \n     month period to participate in a school activity of a son or \n     daughter, such as parent-teacher conference, or to \n     participate in literacy training under a family literacy \n     program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Ensign, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Cantwell, \n        and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 306. A bill to amend part C of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to consolidate and restate the Federal laws relating to the social \nhealth maintenance organization projects, to make such projects \npermanent, to require the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to \nconduct a study on ways to expand such projects, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nmake Medicare's Social Health Maintenance Organization, SHMO, \ndemonstration a permanent part of the Medicare+Choice program. In this \neffort, I am joined by my colleagues from Oregon, New York, Arizona, \nCalifornia, and Washington.\n  The Social HMO demonstration was authorized 18 years ago to test \nmodels for improving health care for frail seniors, expanding access to \nsocial and supportive services, and integrating these expanded benefits \nwith medical services better. My colleagues and I feel that an \neighteen-year test is long enough, it is time for this successful \nprogram to become a permanent choice for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Close to 80 percent of national health care expenditures are for \npeople with chronic conditions. Medicare beneficiaries are \ndisproportionately affected by chronic illness. About 85 percent of \npeople who are 65 and older have one chronic condition, and two thirds \nhave two or more. Fully a third of Medicare beneficiaries have four or \nmore chronic conditions. This group accounts for more than three \nquarters of all Medicare spending. Yet, despite the predominance of \nchronic illness among seniors, Medicare continues to operate as an \nacute care model. So many of the services that are central to the \nhealth care needs of seniors are not covered by Medicare, including a \nnumber of preventive services, care coordination and disease management \nservices, and home and community-based support services.\n  Social HMOs provide the care coordination and disease management \nservices so critically important to frail and at-risk seniors with \nmultiple chronic conditions and complex care needs. Social HMOs are \nrequired to provide expanded care benefits such as prescription drugs, \nancillary services such as eyeglasses and hearing aids, and community-\nbased services such as personal care, homemaker services, adult day \ncare, meals, and transportation. These services meet the chronic health \ncare needs of seniors, helping them remain independent, while reducing \nMedicaid expenditures by avoiding or delaying nursing home placement.\n  Several recent studies have shown that Social HMO members are 40 \npercent to 50 percent less likely to have long-term nursing home \nplacements than similar seniors. Further, in a recent survey of Social \nHMO beneficiaries, over three-quarters of respondents indicated that \nthe special services offered by their Social HMO were critical in \nallowing them to continue living at home. Enhanced Social HMO services, \nsuch as early detection of illness, development of coordinated care \nplans to address problems identified during routine assessments, \nscreening, and ongoing monitoring of care, has paid off in improved \nhealth outcomes for beneficiaries. One study submitted to CMS by the \nUniversity of California at San Francisco and the University of \nMinnesota showed that the Social HMO chronic care interventions \ndecreased inpatient hospital and emergency room use up to 57 percent \nand 47 percent, respectively, while improving beneficiaries' functional \ncapacity.\n  Last year, Medicaid spending increased by over 13 percent. More than \nhalf of this growth was in programs serving the elderly and disabled. \nAt a time when the Federal deficit is increasing and States are facing \nunprecedented budget shortfalls, it is incumbent upon us to take \nmeasures to reduce, not increase, the Medicaid burden, which \nconstitutes a major component of State expenditures.\n  My legislation provides a critical opportunity to address the States' \nlarge and growing fiscal crises. In the short-term we can prevent an \nexacerbation of States' budget woes by making the Social HMOs \npermanent. Preliminary estimates of first year costs for terminating \nthe Social HMO program range from about $100 to $300 million for \nincreased nursing home and home care expenditures under Medicaid. \nRemember that these estimates relate to only four existing plans \nserving about 110,000 beneficiaries and do not even include \nprescription drugs and other ancillary services provided by the plans. \nLong-term cost savings associated with reduced health care expenditures \nand keeping enrollees from spending down to Medicaid would be even more \nsignificant--especially if the MedPAC study required by our bill \nvalidates that these programs are cost-effective and recommends to \nCongress that we expand this option. For states facing huge shortfalls, \nthe cost to absorb these SHMO beneficiaries if the program were to \nterminate would be substantial.\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\n  I am fortunate that one of the four original Social HMOs is in \nOregon. Senior Advantage II, offered by Kaiser Permanente's Northwest \nDivision, currently serves about 4,300 Medicare beneficiaries from \nSalem, OR to Longview, Washington, with its primary service area in \nPortland, OR. Since Kaiser opened its Social HMO program, it has served \nclose to 15,000 beneficiaries with its enhanced benefits and special \ngeriatric programs, which have led to fewer overall nursing home care \ndays and a more consumer-oriented approach to care for frail or ill \nseniors.\n  The legislation I am introducing with my distinguished colleagues \ntoday would make permanent the existing Social HMO plans, like Kaiser, \nand would lay the ground work for evaluating whether to expand and \nreplicate this model. Our bill requires the Secretary to conduct a \ncomparative study of beneficiary and family member satisfaction to see \nhow Social HMOs compare to Medicare + Choice and fee-for-service \nMedicare. It also requires MedPAC to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of \nSocial HMOs with respect to reduced nursing home admissions, reduced \nincidence of Medicaid spend-down, and other aspects of the model that \nrepresent potential cost-savings. If MedPAC finds that Social HMOs are \ncost-effective, it must make recommendations to Congress on expanding \nand replicating this model.\n  To ensure that beneficiaries continue to receive the value added they \nhave come to enjoy under this program, the Social HMOs must continue to \nprovide the expanded benefit package currently offered under this \nlegislation. Further, this benefit could not be changed by the \nSecretary without notification of Congress. Finally, to ensure that \nSocial HMOs can continue to finance a high level of benefits, any \nchanges in plans' existing payments would need to go through a formal \nrulemaking process.\n  The Social HMO demonstration project has been re-validated by six \nacts of Congress since its creation. It is time to make this program \npermanent and lend a measure of stability to the plans and \nbeneficiaries served by this innovative model. This program represents \na fiscally sound approach to helping manage the chronic health care \nneeds of our nation's seniors, and I urge all of my colleagues to join \nwith me and the rest of this bill's cosponsors in support of this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 307. A bill to designate the Federal building and United States \ncourthouse located at 200 West 2nd Street in Dayton, Ohio, as the \n``Tony Hall Federal Building and United States Courthouse''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend and \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator George Voinovich, to introduce a bill to \nname the Federal building and United States courthouse in Dayton, Ohio, \nafter Congressman Tony Hall.\n  This bill is a fitting tribute to Tony Hall, a tireless and dedicated \npublic servant, who we greatly miss since his retirement from the \nUnited States Congress. He is continuing his commitment to public \nservice as our U.S. Ambassador to the UN's food and agriculture \nagencies.\n  The people of Ohio and the American people can be proud of and \nthankful for the many years Tony Hall has served in the United States \nCongress. I've had the privilege of working closely with him since my \nearly days in the House nearly 20 years ago. He has been a valuable \nlegislator and a real statesman. Over the years, he has worked \ntirelessly on behalf of the people of Montgomery County and throughout \nOhio.\n  Tony Hall comes from a family rich in devotion to public service and \ndedication to Ohio. His father, in fact, once served as Dayton's \nRepublican Mayor. A graduate of Fairmont High School in Kettering and \nDenison University in Granville, where he was an all-star tailback on \nthe football team, Tony served in the Ohio House from 1969-1972, in the \nOhio Senate from 1973-1978, and as Dayton's Congressman since January \n1979.\n  A devoted husband to his wife, Janet, and a dedicated father to Jyl \nand Matt, the entire Hall family struggled valiantly alongside Matt as \nhe fought an unsuccessful battle against leukemia that ended in 1996.\n  My wife, Fran, and I are proud to have worked over two decades with \nTony and Janet on humanitarian efforts and other causes that bridge \nacross the political aisle. Tony, who served in the Peace Corps in 1966 \nand 1967, has been an unmatched advocate for the needy, the poor, the \nhungry, and the oppressed across Ohio, our Nation, and the world.\n  Tony has been singularly responsible for much of the world's \ncontinued, focused attention on the serious hunger issues worldwide. \nHis involvement in a 22-day hunger strike in 1989, forced the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the World Bank to call conferences on \nhunger, which ultimately resulted in the creation of the Congressional \nHunger Center. I'm proud to have worked with Tony on several \nhumanitarian initiatives through the years from Africa Seeds of Hope to \nthe Global Food for Education Act to the Microenterprise for Self-\nReliance Act to the Clean Diamond Act of 2001.\n  We also share a commitment to the yet unborn. A staunch pro-life \nDemocrat, Congressman Hall was responsible for language in the \nDemocratic National Committee platform respecting the beliefs of those \nwithin his party who wished to protect the sanctity of life.\n  I also have had the pleasure of working with Tony Hall on several \nprojects important to the Miami Valley area of Ohio. We share a passion \nfor the aviation heritage of the Wright Brothers in Dayton and have \nworked together to protect and preserve the monuments to the Wright \nBrothers legacy. And, we've also worked together on issues to help \nbuild the unique resources of Wright Patterson Air Force base.\n  Today, it is a pleasure to take this opportunity to join Senator \nVoinovich to honor Tony Hall's many legislative efforts and \nachievements and to thank him for his commitment to the people of Ohio \nand this Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to honor our \ngood friend and statesman, Tony Hall.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 308. A bill to impose greater accountability on the Tennessee \nValley Authority with respect to capital investment decisions and \nfinancing operations by increasing Congressional and Executive Branch \noversight; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Tennessee Valley Authority has long \nserved as an engine for economic development in my part of the country \nand has enjoyed widespread support for its efforts to provide power \nthat is needed to fuel the economy and enhance the quality of life of \nthose it serves. It is my desire to assist the TVA in continuing its \nlegacy and carrying out its mission. To provide that assistance, the \nCongress, the Administration, and the TVA itself must determine whether \nTVA's policies, practices, and long-term strategies are consistent with \nthe realities of today's marketplace.\n  The TVA is at a crossroads in its illustrious history. The United \nStates taxpayer and the power consumers in the TVA service area have \nprovided the capital necessary to develop, finance, and operate one of \nthe largest, if not the largest, public power systems in history. The \nTVA is now facing a number of challenges with respect to its existing \ngenerating system in the form of environmental compliance, aging and \nobsolete plants, and the urgent need to provide additional generating \ncapacity to meet the demands of the future. It is my belief that the \nUnited States taxpayer is unwilling and unable to continue to bear the \nfinancial burden and risks associated with addressing these challenges.\n  The reality of the marketplace for energy and the political \nimperatives with which we are confronted mandate that any new financing \nstrategies and supplemental sources of capital be considered and \nutilized by the TVA. Likewise, we need to review and analyze the short-\nterm and long-term financing and risk management strategies employed by \nthe TVA with respect to its almost $26 billion of debt.\n  Last year, we witnessed the results of risky and sometimes corrupt \ncorporate financing and management practices. Although I have no reason \nto believe that TVA has been involved in any\n\n[[Page S1983]]\n\nsuch practices, I believe we have a responsibility to the taxpayers to \nexamine the financing and disclosure practices of the TVA to ensure \nthat their investment is being protected. I note that TVA has utilized \nshort-term financing facilities and derivative securities as hedging \nand interest rate management techniques. We need to better understand \nthe risks and rewards associated with these strategies.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would require that the \nTVA provide the Congress and the Administration with a 10-year business \noutlook and strategic plan with respect to its development and \nfinancing needs, as well as an analysis of its ongoing financing and \nrisk management strategies. During the period in which the TVA is \nresponding to this Congressional mandate, the TVA would be required to \ncease and desist from incurring new obligations or entering into any \narrangements for the development or financing of new, additional, or \nreplacement plant, equipment, or capacity. Likewise, during this period \nthe TVA would be required to gain the concurrence of the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget and the appropriate Senate and \nHouse Committee leaders before undertaking any additional financing or \nrefinancing activities. The legislation specifically provides for the \nnecessary flexibility for the TVA to continue normal operations and \nfund necessary maintenance activities while complying with this \nCongressional mandate.\n  I strongly support the TVA and I recognize its importance to the \neconomic health of several States in the southeastern United States, \nincluding my own. Indeed, the TVA is a critical component of the \ninfrastructure that supports the economy of the entire United States. \nIt is my desire in introducing this legislation that the TVA be \npositioned to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. Introduction of \nthis legislation is the first step to help the TVA achieve that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 308\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Authority.--The term ``Authority'' means the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority.\n       (2) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Board of Directors \n     of the Authority.\n       (3) Committee leader.--The term ``Committee leader'' means \n     the chairman and ranking member of each of the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on the Environment and \n     Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure of the House of Representatives.\n       (4) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (5) Plan.--The term ``Plan'' means the Ten-Year Business \n     Outlook and Strategic Plan submitted under subsection (b).\n       (b) Plan.--Not later than 90 days after the effective date \n     of this section, the Authority shall submit to the Director \n     and each of the Committee leaders, for their concurrence, a \n     Ten-Year Business Outlook and Strategic Plan for the \n     Authority that includes, at a minimum--\n       (1) estimates of--\n       (A) the power demand in the service area of the Authority \n     during the 10-year period following the date of the plan;\n       (B) the assets that the Authority anticipates will be \n     available to meet that demand; and\n       (C) capital expenditures that will be required to meet that \n     demand;\n       (2) a strategy and criteria for the development and \n     financing of new nuclear and nonnuclear power supply sources, \n     including a strategy for competitive sourcing and partnering \n     with the private sector for the development and financing of \n     new nuclear and nonnuclear power facilities; and\n       (3) a strategy for managing the financing, refinancing, and \n     repayment of the existing indebtedness of the Authority, \n     including a specific debt repayment schedule to which the \n     Board is specifically committed.\n       (c) Financing Strategies.--The provisions of the Plan \n     relating to financing strategies under subsection (b)(3) \n     shall include a recitation of the policies of the Board with \n     respect to--\n       (1) the use of short-term and long-term debt;\n       (2) the use of derivative or other financing instruments; \n     and\n       (3) risk management strategies.\n       (d) Limitations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Authority shall not, until the date, \n     if any, on which the Director and each of the Committee \n     leaders issue a written concurrence to the Plan--\n       (A) expend any internally generated capital or otherwise \n     undertake any investment in, or enter into any arrangement \n     that would result in the development or financing of, new, \n     additional, or replacement plant, equipment, or capacity; or\n       (B) without the written concurrence of the Director and \n     each of the Committee leaders, undertake any financing of \n     additional indebtedness or refinancing of debt of the \n     Authority in any public or private market.\n       (2) Effect.--This subsection does not preclude the \n     Authority from expending available funds, in the exercise of \n     the independent judgment of the Authority, for the repair, \n     maintenance, or necessary renovation to preserve the \n     operating capacity and efficiency of existing units and \n     related facilities.\n       (e) Effective Date.--This section takes effect on January \n     31, 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 309. A bill to enable the United States to maintain its leadership \nin aeronautics and aviation by instituting an initiative to develop \ntechnologies that will significantly lower noise, emissions, and fuel \nconsumption, to reinvigorate basic and applied research in aeronautics \nand aviation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am most pleased to be joined by our \nesteemed colleague, Senator Dodd of Connecticut, to introduce the \nAeronautics Research and Development Revitalization Act. This \nlegislation is the foundation for ensuring that the United States \nremains the preeminent Nation in the design, engineering and production \nof military and civilian aircraft.\n  The last 5 years have seen the NASA budget for aeronautics research \nand development literally cut in half from $1 billion to its current \nlevel of $500 million. In making these cuts, the United States has been \nrendered more vulnerable to foreign competition in the field of \naeronautics. The nations of Europe have moved in the exact opposite \ndirection--dramatically increasing such funding in an effort to control \nthe world's aviation market. A recent article in the Wall Street \nJournal documents the rise of Airbus as the largest producer of \ncivilian aircraft in the world. If forecasts for this year hold true, \nAirbus will deliver more aircraft than Boeing for the first time. In \nlight of these disturbing developments it is obvious that the U.S. is \nin grave danger of losing its position as the world leader in \naeronautics and aviation.\n  It is important to note that throughout the history of aeronautics \nand aviation that this country has been at the forefront of discovery \nand innovation. It began with the First Flight of the Wright Brothers \non December 17, 1903 in Kitty Hawk, NC, followed by the historic flight \nof Charles Lindbergh from New York to Paris in May of 1927. U.S. \ncompanies have led the aviation and aeronautics industry from the \npropeller era into the jet engine era. The research and innovation of \nthe U.S. has been the primary reason the world enjoys the convenience \nand safety of air travel today.\n  Our military has seen the benefits from the progress made in \naeronautics research. The significant improvements made from World War \nI to World War II directly impacted the Allies ability to establish air \nsuperiority. The numerous advances made in U.S. aircraft design greatly \nincreased the top speed and altitude of bombers and fighters during \ncrucial years of the war. Since then, our country's aeronautics \nresearch has made it the dominant air power in the world, with \ntechnologies years in advance of its closest pursuers. As a result of \nthese advancements, U.S. troops are placed in far less harm and more \nprecise strikes against enemy targets can be made while avoiding non-\ntargeted civilians.\n  Fortunately NASA has recognized the emergence of international \ncompetition and the need for the U.S. to re-assert itself as the lead \nnation in aeronautics research technology and innovation. The recently \npublished ``The NASA Aeronautics Blueprint--Toward a Bold Era of \nAviation'' is an excellent report on the problems facing American \naviation and aeronautics. It also provides an exciting vision of what \ncan be achieved by investing in aeronautics research and development. \nHowever NASA has not provided a program or plan for how to achieve this \nvision nor funding levels that would be required\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\nto attain the goals laid out in the Blueprint. Thus without a plan or \nfunding, it is unlikely this report would ever be acted upon.\n  In an effort to tackle the major initiatives of the NASA Blueprint \nhead-on, we are introducing the Aeronautics Research and Development \nRevitalization Act. The legislation will provide aggressive funding \nauthorizations to provide the NASA aeronautics program with the \nresources it needs to keep the United States on the cutting edge of all \naspects of aeronautics and aviation. Our complacency must change now to \nprevent further damage to our competitiveness in aviation. The U.S. \naviation industry is the largest contributor to the U.S. balance of \ntrade and directly accounts for $343 billion to the U.S. economy and \n4.2 million positions to our job market.\n  First, consider the impact of aviation on our communities. As air \ntravel becomes more commonplace, increased aircraft noise will place a \nstrain on both the citizens and businesses living and operating in the \nareas surrounding our nation's airports. The effect on property values \nand quality of life can be enormous, so it will be important to pursue \ntechnologies that reduce the level of noise emitted from aircraft. We \nalso must acknowledge the rising emissions levels that are the result \nof increased air travel as well as the fuel consumption required to \nmeet the growing number of planes in the air. The instability of oil \nprices and the growing effect of fuel emission on our atmosphere make \nit necessary to find improvement in fuel efficiency. These \nenvironmental factors must be addressed, or the American people will \ncertainly face fewer choices and higher prices. To meet these needs, \nour legislation provides significant funding to be used for research, \nmuch of which will be designated for universities, industrial research \nfacilities and not-for-profit research entities. The impacts of \naviation are beginning to negatively impact the lives of many \nAmericans; this initiative will make aircraft more environmentally \nfriendly.\n  Additionally, strides also need to be made in rotorcraft technology. \nThis legislation authorizes funding for, and tasks NASA with, improving \nthe noise and vibration levels of helicopters, as well as improving the \npredicted accident rate to make it equivalent to that of fixed-wing \naircraft. Helicopters are indispensable for our military and provide \ngreat convenience for the civilians. Making them safer and quieter is a \nworthwhile effort that should be pursued.\n  The promise of civil supersonic travel has been on the horizon for \nsome time. However it has been difficult to perfect the technology for \na civilian supersonic aircraft and the costs associated with such a \nprogram are high. The legislation we have introduced would required \nNASA to develop a road map for achieving the flight of a supersonic \ncivil transport aircraft that can reach a speed of Mach 1.6, travel at \nleast 4,000 nautical miles, and carry one hundred fifty passengers. If \nthese goals can be met over the next twenty years, the U.S. aviation \nindustry will be revolutionized. Achieving such speeds would change \nbusiness and personal travel as it is known today. To bring this \ninitiative forward, this legislation would authorize $110 million for \nthe next five years. This should provide a good start in the effort to \nbring civilian air travel into the twenty-first century.\n  At the core of U.S. aeronautics and aviation superiority are men and \nwomen performing the research and development necessary for \ntechnological breakthroughs. The U.S. has seen a disturbing decline in \nthe number of aeronautical engineers graduating from its universities. \nIt is important to encourage American students to consider these \nfields. We need to make sure the best and the brightest are properly \ntrained so they can make their creative ideas and theories a reality. \nThis current trend is a leading reason the U.S. is losing ground in \naeronautics research. To combat the dearth of aeronautics engineers, \nthis legislation would authorize NASA to establish a generous \nscholarship program for those students seeking a Masters Degree in the \nfield of aeronautics.\n  As air travel becomes more prevalent, it becomes more important that \nair traffic management and control are operating in the most effective \nand safe manner. This bill includes a measure that requires the \nAdministrator of NASA to work with the Federal Aviation Association \nAdministrator to develop a national initiative with the objective of \ndefining and developing an air traffic management system designed to \nmeet the national long-term aviation security needs, along with safety, \nsecurity and capacity needs. These provisions will hopefully result in \na new, more streamlined method for directing air traffic around our \nbusiest airports and cities.\n  The measures and funding authorizations in this legislation are \naggressive. However when considering the state of both the aeronautics \nand aviation industries. I believe it is time to take decisive action \nto ensure the long-term competitive supremacy of both our military and \ncivilization aviation programs.\n  The majority of military aircraft technology was developed to some \ndegree by NASA's aeronautics program. To make sure those risking their \nlives in the service of the country are afforded the best possible \nequipment in performing their duties, the U.S. government has the \nresponsibility to make the necessary investments in research and \ndevelopment. In recent years we have seen a drastic cuts in the \nprograms designed for this purpose. Technology and innovation are \nalways moving forward, the government needs to expend the resources to \nkeep the U.S. at the forefront of those efforts.\n  The civilian airline and aeronautics industry has largely been \ndominated by the United States since its beginning. Recent news reports \nhave shown however that this phenomenon is changing. Countries around \nthe world are making great progress in building larger, more efficient \ncommuter airlines at a cheaper price. This new competition has \njeopardized the jobs of thousands of highly trained engineers and works \nin this country. Keeping pace with the competition and working to \nmaintain the lead over other aircraft providers is essential if we want \nto keep this important segment of the work force employed. Losing \nglobal contracts means job cuts. To turn this trend around we must \ncommit to the research and development that leads to innovation in \ncommercial aviation. Only then will we secure the existing jobs in this \ncountry and build the need for more jobs.\n  To make this legislation law we will have to make some difficult \nchoices and priorities. Current economic conditions dictate that we \ncannot fund every desirable program. However, even in the face of the \ncircumstances, I feel strongly that we can no longer complacently wait \nto make the changes outlined in this legislation. Making the United \nStates the unquestioned leader in aeronautics research and development \nis in the best interest of our military, our civilian airline industry, \nquality jobs and balance of trade. The aviation industry affects the \nlives of almost all Americans. For these reasons, we ask our colleagues \nto carefully review the current condition of U.S. aeronautics and the \nimplications of its continued decline. I am confident they will concur \nthat this legislation is needed now without delay. Our security, \ncompetitive position, jobs and future are sitting on the runway needing \nour fuel for the aeronautics industry to take off into the future.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 309\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Aeronautics Research and \n     Development Revitalization Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the national interest to maintain leadership \n     in aeronautics and aviation.\n       (2) The United States is in danger of losing its leadership \n     in aeronautics and aviation to international competitors.\n       (3) Past Federal investments in aeronautics research and \n     development have benefited the economy and national security \n     of the United States and the quality of life of its citizens.\n       (4) Future growth in aviation increasingly will be \n     constrained by concerns related to aircraft noise, emissions, \n     fuel consumption, and air transportation system congestion.\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\n       (5) Current and projected levels of Federal investment in \n     aeronautics research and development are not sufficient to \n     address concerns related to the growth of aviation.\n       (6) International competitors have recognized the \n     importance of noise, emissions, fuel consumption, and air \n     transportation system congestion in limiting the future \n     growth of aviation and have established aggressive agendas \n     for addressing each of these concerns.\n       (7) An aggressive initiative by the Federal Government to \n     develop technologies that would significantly reduce aircraft \n     noise, harmful emissions, and fuel consumption would benefit \n     the United States by--\n       (A) improving the competitiveness of the United States \n     aviation industry through the development of new markets for \n     aviation services and the development of superior aircraft \n     for existing markets;\n       (B) improving the quality of life for our citizens by \n     drastically reducing the level of noise due to aircraft \n     operations;\n       (C) reducing the congestion of the air transportation \n     system by allowing departures and arrivals at currently under \n     utilized airports through the use of environmentally \n     compatible aircraft;\n       (D) reducing the rate at which fossil fuels are consumed;\n       (E) reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases and other \n     harmful gases and particulates are added to the atmosphere by \n     aircraft; and\n       (F) reinvigorating the human capital needed to maintain \n     international leadership in aeronautics and aviation by \n     providing a set of extremely challenging and socially \n     beneficial goals to the next generation of engineers and \n     scientists.\n       (8) Long-term progress in aeronautics and aviation will \n     require continued Federal investment in fundamental \n     aeronautical research.\n       (9) The European competitors of United States aircraft \n     companies have invested heavily in new wind tunnels. These \n     new tunnels are better than their older United States \n     counterparts and give European aircraft manufacturers an \n     advantage over United States aircraft manufacturers in the \n     highly competitive civil aircraft sales business. As a \n     result, United States aircraft companies are forced to \n     perform tests in Europe's superior wind tunnels. The security \n     of United States data obtained in these and other foreign \n     test facilities can easily be compromised. New and upgraded \n     United States aeronautical test facilities are needed to \n     support a revitalized aeronautics research and development \n     program, and should be a high national priority.\n       (10) Continued research is needed into the flight crew and \n     controller training needed to accommodate new aircraft and \n     air transportation system technologies and procedures.\n       (11) It is in the interest of the United States to maintain \n     a vigorous capability in basic and applied research and \n     development of technologies related to rotorcraft.\n       (12) Maintenance of United States leadership in aeronautics \n     and aviation will require the productive collaboration of \n     NASA, the Department of Defense, the FAA, the aviation \n     industry, and the Nation's universities.\n       (13) Improvements to our understanding of convective \n     weather phenomena and of aircraft wake turbulence would \n     significantly improve the performance of the Nation's air \n     transportation system.\n       (14) The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, have \n     imposed new requirements for research on aviation security. \n     NASA's aviation safety research must be expanded to include \n     methods that provide for an air transportation system that is \n     both safe and secure from terrorist attacks.\n       (15) It is important for NASA to continue at a healthy \n     level its cooperative research efforts with the Department of \n     Defense regarding military aviation technologies. These \n     efforts have been all but eliminated in recent years and must \n     be restored. The Nation must take advantage of the synergy \n     between civil and military aviation research.\n       (16) The report entitled ``The NASA Aeronautics Blueprint--\n     Toward a Bold New Era of Aviation'' provides an excellent \n     statement of the problems facing aviation today, and presents \n     an exciting vision of what can be achieved by investments in \n     aeronautics research and technology. It does not, however, \n     provide a program plan to actually achieve the vision, nor \n     does it address the huge mismatch between current NASA \n     aeronautics funding and what is required to realize the \n     vision.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the coverage of marriage and family therapist services and \nmental health counselor services under part B of the Medicare program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe ``Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2003'' with my \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln. Specifically, the \n``Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2003'' permits mental \nhealth counselors and marriage and family therapists to bill Medicare \nfor services provided to seniors. This will result in an increased \nchoice of mental health providers for seniors and enhance their ability \nto access mental health services in their communities.\n  This legislation is especially crucial to rural seniors who are often \nforced to travel long distances to utilize the services of mental \nhealth providers currently recognized by the Medicare program. Rural \ncommunities have difficulty recruiting and retaining providers, \nespecially mental health providers. In many small towns, a mental \nhealth counselor or a marriage and family therapist is the only mental \nhealth care provider in the area. Medicare law--as it exists today-\ncompounds the situation because only psychiatrists, clinical \npsychologists, clinical social workers and clinical nurse specialists \nare able to bill Medicare for their services.\n  It is time the Medicare program recognized the qualifications of \nmental health counselors and marriage and family therapists as well as \nthe critical role they play in the mental health care infrastructure. \nThese providers go through rigorous training, similar to the curriculum \nof masters level social workers, and yet are excluded from the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Particularly troubling to me is the fact that seniors have \ndisproportionately higher rates of depression and suicide than other \npopulations. Additionally, 75 percent of the 518 nationally designated \nMental Health Professional Shortage Areas are located in rural areas \nand one-fifth of all rural counties have ``no'' mental health services \nof any kind. Frontier counties have even more drastic numbers as 95 \npercent do not have a psychiatrist, 68 percent do not have a \npsychologist and 78 percent do not have a social worker. It is quite \nobvious we have an enormous task ahead of us to reduce these staggering \nstatistics. providing mental health counselors and marriage and family \ntherapists the ability to bill Medicare for their services is a key \npart of the solution.\n  Virtually all of Wyoming is designated a mental health professional \nshortage area and will greatly benefit from this legislation. Wyoming \nhas 174 psychologists, 37 psychiatrists and 263\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nclinical social workers for a total of 474 Medicare eligible mental \nhealth providers. Enactment of the ``Seniors Mental Health Access \nImprovement Act of 2001'' will more than double the number of mental \nhealth providers available to seniors in my State with the addition of \n528 mental health counselors and 61 marriage and family therapists \ncurrently licensed in the state.\n  I believe this legislation is critically important to the health and \nwell-being of our Nation's seniors and I strongly urge all my \ncolleagues to become a cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 310\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Craig Thomas today in introducing the ``Seniors Mental Health \nAccess Improvement Act of 2003.''\n  This bill would expand Medicare coverage to Licensed Professional \nCounselors and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists. One result of \nthis expanded coverage will be to increase seniors' access to mental \nhealth services, especially in rural and underserved areas.\n  Licensed Professional Counselors and Marriage and Family Therapist \nare currently excluded from Medicare coverage even though they meet the \nsame education, training, and examination requirements that clinical \nsocial workers do. The only difference is that clinical social workers \nhave been covered under Medicare for over a decade.\n  Why do we need this legislation? The mental health needs of older \nAmericans are not being met. Although the rate of suicide among older \nAmericans is higher than for any other age group, less than three \npercent of older Americans report seeing mental health professionals \nfor treatment. And going to their primary care physician is simply not \nenough. Research shows that most primary care providers receive \ninadequate mental health training, particularly in geriatrics.\n  Lack of access to mental health providers is one of the primary \nreasons why older Americans don't get the mental health treatment they \nneed. Not surprisingly, this problem is exacerbated in rural and \nunderserved areas.\n  Licensed Professional Counselors are often the only mental health \nspecialists available in rural and underserved communities. This is \ntrue in my home state of Arkansas, where 91 percent of Arkansans reside \nin a mental health professional shortage area.\n  Since there are more Licensed Professional Counselors practicing in \nmy state than any other mental health professional, this legislation \nwill significantly increase the number of Medicare-eligible mental \nhealth providers in Arkansas. Licensed Professional Counselors are \nalready serving patients who have private insurance or Medicaid. It is \ntime for Medicare patients to also have access to these professionals.\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\n  The bill we are introducing today is an important first step in \nexpanding access to good mental health. By including Licensed \nProfessional Counselors and licensed Marriage and Family Therapists \namong the list of providers who deliver mental health services to \nMedicare beneficiaries, we will help ensure that all seniors, no matter \nwhere they live, have the opportunity to receive mental health \ntreatment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 311. A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue \nregulations requiring turbojet aircraft of air carriers to be equipped \nwith missile defense systems, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that could \nhave a significant impact on reducing the threat of terrorism towards \nour commercial airlines.\n  Last November, two shoulder-fired SA-7 missiles were launched at an \nIsraeli airliner as it took off from a Kenyan airport. While these \nmissiles missed their target, they are a clear example of an ever-\ngrowing threat to all air travel. A similar incident occurred last May \nwhen a U.S. military aircraft in Saudi Arabia was believed to be fired \nupon, also with an SA-7 missile. Saudi authorities later found an empty \nlaunch tube near an airbase used by American aircraft. In both cases, \nal Qaeda remains the primary suspect.\n  This is a very real and recognized threat. It is estimated that \nthousands of shoulder-fired missiles are in the hands of non-state \nactors, rebel groups, terrorists, and other armed non-military \nfactions. Last May, the FBI warned that given al Qaeda's targeting of \nthe U.S. airline industry and its access to these weapons, airlines and \nlaw enforcement agencies should remain alert to the potential use of \nshoulder-fired missiles against commercial aircraft in the United \nStates.\n  We all know that terrorists will continue to try to attack us at our \nweakest points. As we continue to increase the screening and security \nprocesses for those boarding our airplanes, it is becoming clear that \nterrorists will need to find another avenue to attack us. These \nshoulder-fired missiles may be that next avenue.\n  The bill I am introducing today would equip all turbojet aircraft \nused by American aircarriers with missile defense systems. These \ndevices involve a series of sensors that identify an incoming missile \nand a laser or lamp to fool the missile's guidance system. The work \nautomatically without any action by the pilot.\n  The U.S. government would pay for the devices for the current \nturbojet fleet, approximately 6,800 aircraft, at an estimated cost of \n$1 million per plane.\n  In the meantime, the bill directs the President to use the National \nGuard and Coast Guard to patrol areas surrounding airports in order to \nprevent attacks by shoulder-fired missiles. Because these are heat-\nseeking missiles, aircraft are most vulnerable at lower levels and when \ntheir engines are hottest.\n  Aircraft missile defense systems work. Countermeasures are already in \nplace on many U.S. military aircraft, where they have proven effective.\n  Shoulder-fired missiles are a serious threat to our airlines, our \neconomy, and the personal safety of every American airline passenger. \nWith a relatively small investment in proven technology to counter that \nthreat, we can provide further protection to air travellers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nextend the availability of allotments for fiscal years 1998 through \n2001 under the State Children's Health Insurance Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould promote the health and well- being of America's children by \nrestoring funds to the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as \nCHIP. CHIP has been an unqualified success, helping millions of \nchildren. The program has the potential to help millions more. However, \nit is only as effective as we make it.\n  In 1997, I was joined by Senator Chafee in introducing the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program as part of the Balanced Budget Act. At that \ntime, 10 million children were uninsured. Today, 4.6 million have \ncoverage; this includes over 21,000 children in the State of West \nVirginia. I believe the families touched by this program would agree it \nserves its purpose well.\n  Unfortunately, this purpose may be seriously undermined. On September \n30, 2002, $1.2 billion in unspent CHIP funds reverted back to the \nnational treasury because of a budget compromise. On September 30, \n2003, an additional $1.5 billion will be returned to\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\nthe treasury. This combined $2.7 billion loss will serve a huge blow to \nthe program. As a result of it, States may be forced to stop accepting \nnew children and may have to cut current participants from their rolls. \nIn the meanwhile, money intended for the care of children will be spent \non other initiatives. Healthy kids will go without preventative care, \nand sick kids will go without treatment or medicine.\n  However, such a tragedy is preventable. Today, I am joined by \nSenators Chafee, Kennedy, Snowe, and others in introducing a bill that \nwould restore full CHIP funding over 2 years and allow the program to \ncontinue its enormously important work without cutting the benefits of \na single child.\n  I am pleased to tell you that our legislation enjoys bicameral, \nbipartisan support and is endorsed by the National Governors \nAssociation, NGA. Though it is not a permanent solution to the problems \nfaced by CHIP, this proposal would go far in addressing them. Most \nnotably, it would provide real relief to States struggling to cover \nbeneficiaries under Medicaid and would allow them to offer the care \nthat every child needs and deserves.\n  In order to achieve this, we must provide States with the resources \nthey need. Today, we have introduced a bill which will do just that. \nHowever, this body must make its enactment a priority. The children we \nserve deserve nothing less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 312\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Rockefeller \nand others today in introducing a bipartisan compromise proposal to \nextend expiring State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, \nfunds. I am pleased that we recently secured the commitment of Budget \nChairman Nickles to include funding in the fiscal year 2004 budget \nresolution for this important proposal, as well as the commitment of \nFinance Chairman Grassley to address this issue quickly in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  This legislation will allow States to continue using $1.2 billion in \nfunds through fiscal year 2004 that were originally allocated for \nfiscal years 1998 and 1999, and that reverted to the Federal Treasury \non September 30, 2002. This provision extends for one additional year \nthe availability of $1.5 billion in SCHIP funds that are scheduled to \nexpire by the end of fiscal year 2003. This legislation also applies a \nredistribution formula to the unspent fiscal year 2000 and 2001 \nallotments, allowing 50 percent of each year's unspent money to be \nretained by states that have not used their entire allotment, with the \nremaining 50 percent of unspent money being redistributed to states \nthat have spent all of the respective year's allotment.\n  This compromise will prevent States from losing their unexpended \nSCHIP allotments and will allow other States, such as Rhode Island, to \nreceive redistributed funds they need to continue providing health \ninsurance to children. Without this compromise, the result could be a \nreduction of up to $2.7 billion for children's health programs \nthroughout the United States. This would undermine the overwhelming \nsuccess of state SCHIP programs in providing quality health coverage to \nmillions of uninsured children. Starting this year, States would have \nno choice but to begin imposing severe enrollment cutbacks; eligible \nchildren who are not yet enrolled in the program would continue to go \nwithout health insurance.\n  Preserving the expiring funds is essential to guaranteeing that \nnearly one million children will not lose their health insurance. The \nOffice of Management and Budget recently projected that the number of \nchildren insured through SCHIP will fall by 900,000 between Fiscal \nYears 2003 and 2006 unless appropriate congressional action is taken to \nrestore the expiring funds.\n  At a time when our Nation's uninsured rate continues to climb above \n40 million, it makes little sense to take away Federal funding from \nStates that are desperately trying to find and enroll needy children. \nThis legislation is crucial to many States, including my state of Rhode \nIsland. Without this remedy, Rhode Island is set to run out of SCHIP \nfunds by fiscal year 2004. At 4.5 percent, Rhode Island currently has \nthe lowest uninsured rate of any State in the Nation for children. This \nbill will enable Rhode Island to continue offering health coverage to \nthis vulnerable population.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Rockefeller and me in supporting \nthis important legislation. It is a crucial step toward ensuring that \nour Nation's children will have long-term access to quality health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing a bipartisan bill to extend the availability of the \nunused funds in the Children's Health Insurance Program, so that \nhundreds of thousands of children can retain their health coverage, and \nso that the CHIP program can continue to grow.\n  We recently celebrated the fifth anniversary of the CHIP program. \nOver its relatively short life, the program has served children across \nAmerica, providing health coverage for those who would be otherwise \nuninsured. Last year, over 4.5 million children received health \ninsurance through CHIP or through Medicaid expansions under CHIP, \nincluding 105,000 children in Massachusetts. Health insurance provides \nchildren with a healthy start in life, and CHIP is important in \nproviding that healthy start for millions of children in moderate-\nincome working families.\n  Unfortunately, because of a technical provision in the law, $1.2 \nbillion in unspent CHIP funds reverted to the Treasury last October. \nAnother $1.5 billion will revert to the Treasury this October if \nCongress fails to act. We know that 20 States are projected to run out \nof CHIP funds soon, including 5 States--Alaska, Arizona, Maryland, New \nJersey, and Rhode Island--that are projected to run out of money as \nearly as next year.\n  It makes no sense to allow funds to revert to the Treasury when there \nis so much unmet need. Some States have not been able to use all their \nCHIP\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\nfunds within the allotted period in current law. Yet some of these same \nStates will run short of funds in the very near future, forcing them to \ndrop children from their programs. One of our Nation's most fundamental \nprinciples should be to give every child the opportunity to succeed in \nlife. But that principle rings hollow if children must fact a lifetime \nof disability and illness because they did not have needed health care \nin their early years.\n  That is why this bill we introduce today is so important. It enables \nStates to maintain and expand their CHIP programs. It lets States keep \na portion of their unspent funds that would otherwise expire. It \nreallocates the rest of the funds to States that have already used \ntheir original allocation to enroll children in their program and are \nready, willing, and able to enroll even more children. This \nreallocation is vital to enrolling the highest possible number of \nchildren in CHIP. The retention and reallocation of these funds will \nprevent an unacceptable loss of coverage for the Nation's children.\n  Our legislation moves us one step closer to fulfilling the promise \nthat all children should have adequate health insurance coverage. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, so that we \ncan give the Nation's children the healthy start they deserve.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \ntoday in introducing our legislation restoring funding for the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. I would like to thank my \ncolleagues for their willingness to work with me to secure the deal \nthat has led to the introduction of this legislation and ultimately its \nsignature into law. SCHIP is essential to ensuring continued health \ncare coverage for America's children.\n  During debate over the Omnibus appropriations bill, I worked with my \ncolleagues to secure an agreement that will restore $2.7 billion in \nexpired, or soon to expire, SCHIP funding. This compromise has the \nsupport of our Nation's governors and will ensure that this funding \nremains in the program and continues to provide children with access to \nthe care that is vital to their healthy development.\n  I especially appreciate the willingness of Majority Leader Frist, \nFinance Committee Chairman Grassley and Budget Committee Chairman \nNickles to work with us during the omnibus debate to develop the \nagreement. Because of their commitment to finding a solution, we are \nable to move forward with this important policy, the first step being \nintroduction of this bill.\n  I believe the agreement that I was able to craft with my colleagues \nis the most appropriate way to restore the SCHIP funding. Because the \nbudget resolution adopted by the House of Representatives does not \ninclude adequate budget authority to restore this funding, the floor \namendment that I planned to offer to the omnibus appropriations bill \nwould have been subject to a budget point of order in the House. Given \nthat this point of order would have laid against the provision, the \nlikelihood that the House would have stripped the provision during \nconference was great. In light of those circumstances, I believe that \nthe agreement I negotiated is the most appropriate way to ensure that \nthis funding is restored.\n  The agreement that was struck would, in exchange for withdrawing the \namendment that filed to the omnibus appropriations bill to restore \nSCHIP funding, provide the support of the Majority Leader and Chairmen \nGrassley and Nickels to make necessary changes to remove the budget \nhurdles that have prevented this legislation from being enacted.\n  Specifically, Senator Nickles has provided his commitment to \nreallocate through the Fiscal Year 04 budget process additional budget \nauthority for SCHIP in Fiscal Year 03 and Fiscal Year 04. I am \nconfident that under Senator Nickles' leadership, the budget process \nwill move smoothly and expeditiously and that we will be able to speed \nthe adoption of this proposal in both the Senate and House and \nRepresentatives.\n  Further, Chairman Grassley has agreed that as soon as the necessary \nbudget adjustments are made he will move this bill through his \ncommittee. Again, under his strong leadership I am confident that we \nwill get this done.\n  Finally, Majority Leader Frist has agreed to place the legislation on \nthe Senate calendar as soon as it is reported from the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I might add that while I am aware that this agreement was forged in \nthe Senate, the underlying policy contained in this bill was developed \nthrough a bipartisan, bicameral process led by Senators Grassley and \nBaucus last fall. I hope that the House of Representatives will work \nwith us to make the necessary changes to the Fiscal Year 03 and Fiscal \nYear 04 budget allocations and to see this legislation enacted into law \nin a timely manner.\n  How it works is this, once passed, our legislation will restore $2.7 \nbillion in SCHIP funding that has either reverted to the treasury or is \nscheduled to revert to HHS for redistribution. On October 1, 2002, $1.2 \nbillion reverted to the treasury in unspent SCHIP funding from 1998 and \n1999. If we do not recapture this funding, it will be lost to the \nprogram. Our agreement allows the states to reclaim this unspent money \nand provides until the end of Fiscal Year 04 to spend it on health \ninsurance provided by SCHIP.\n  The policy contained in this legislation also strikes a compromise \nbetween States that have spent all of their 2000 and 2001 allotments, \nand those that have not, by dividing the funding evenly between them. \nThose States that have not spent all of their allocations will be able \nto retain half of their funding, while the remaining States will \nreceive additional allotments from the redistributed funding.\n  It also rewards those States that used Medicaid to expand access to \nhealth care for low income children prior to the creation of SCHIP, by \nallowing them to access 20 percent of their SCHIP funding to serve this \npopulation. this compromise has the endorsement of the National \nGovernors Association and children's health advocates from across the \ncountry.\n  In my home State of Maine, where we are using SCHIP to insure over \n14,500 children, this proposal will allow the State to keep $13.24 \nmillion in SCHIP funding and will provide until the end of Fiscal Year \n04 to spend it. In Maine, $13.24 million will help provide health care \nassistance to a lot of children, children who otherwise would not have \naccess to immunizations, well-baby visits and yearly check-ups.\n  While I agreed to forgo the appropriations process to enact this \npolicy change, I certainly have not abandoned my effort to restore the \nfunding. If in fact, the introduction of this legislation should \ndemonstrate that I am more committed than ever to seeing the SCHIP \nfunding restored. What's more, the Majority Leader and Chairs of the \nFinance and Budget Committees have provided their support to see this \nimportant legislation enacted into law. Adding their endorsement to \nthis effort, which already has garnered strong bipartisan support, \ncertainly will speed its passage.\n  Again, I appreciate the support of my colleagues and look forward to \nworking together to advance this critical policy.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, we need to address the impending \ncrisis that may leave thousands of children in New York and around the \ncountry without health insurance or access to health care.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, has been \nremarkably successful in providing for the health of needy children \nwhose parents would otherwise be unable to afford health insurance. New \nYork has been on the frontlines of this effort, implementing its Child \nHealth Plus program even before the Federal Government recognized the \npromise of CHIP and began committing Federal funds. Thanks to those \nFederal funds, New York has been able to expand its program. I'm proud \nto say that as of November 2002, we have been able to enroll 475,000 \nchildren and thereby make a significant dent in the number of uninsured \nchildren in my State.\n  Those accomplishments aside, we still have much work to do. Estimates \nof the number of SCHIP or Medicaid eligible children in New York who \nare not currently enrolled range from 200,000 to 400,000. As the \neconomy continues to slip, and more hardworking Americans lose their \njobs or their benefits, I fear that these numbers will only increase. \nNow more than ever, children across our Nation depend on SCHIP to\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\nhelp them obtain the health care they need.\n  I had hoped that the recent Senate passed omnibus appropriations bill \nwould act to preserve SCHIP. Incredibly, just when the uninsured are \nincreasing, SCHIP funding is being cut. Just when State budgets are \ndisintegrating, $2.7 billion of previously allocated SCHIP money is \nflowing out of states and back to the Federal treasury. Indeed, the \nOffice of Management and Budget projected earlier this year that the \nnumber of children insured through SCHIP will fall by 900,000 between \nFiscal Years 2003 and 2006 unless appropriate congressional action is \ntaken to restore the expiring funds.\n  This is why I support the bill introduced by my colleagues, Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Chafee. Their legislation would sustain SCHIP \nprograms throughout the country, and save New York from losing $526 \nmillion in unspent 1998/1999 funds. This bill extends the deadline for \nStates set to return funds to the Federal treasury another two years. I \nalso support the measure to redistribute the portion of unspent funds \nto States. This year, New York's annual allotment will not cover one-\nhalf of the Federal share of its program expenditures. New York is \ncounting on those redistributed funds to make up the shortfall.\n  In the last Congress, I had supported measures to fix SCHIP so that \nStates could continue to take care of their children. I was proud to \nco-sponor Senate bill 2860, also introduced by Senator Rockefeller. And \nin the waning days of the last session, we were very close to a \nsolution. We had a good proposal supported by members of both parties, \nin both houses of Congress, to help States in their efforts to insure \ntheir children. Unfortunately, because of the objections of a few, we \nwere unable to accomplish our goal before the session ended. Without \nchanges in the SCHIP program, I fear that many children in New York and \naround the country will be left without adequate health care.\n  Our support of SCHIP will make a critical difference in the health of \nour children, and that support must come now. Already, nearly $1.2 \nbillion in Federal funds have expired and reverted to the treasury on \nSeptember 30. What's more, CMS is delaying redistribution of unspent \n2000 funds because it is unsure of what formula we in Congress will \nultimately set. State governments are being forced to draft their \nbudgets without knowing what Federal funds will be available. The time \nhas come to fix this problem, and I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  Additionally, in the long term, we must make a commitment to \nstrengthen SCHIP which has already proven so effective in insuring so \nmany of our Nation's children. The initial formula that set each \nState's annual allotment has left many States with money that they will \nnever spend, while short-changing States that have a higher burden of \nuninsured children. While the redistribution of funds has helped \nmitigate this inequity somewhat, we need to improve the primary \nallocation formula to more accurately account for each State's \nuninsured populations.\n  Looking further ahead, as SCHIP enrollment increases, more States \nwill exhaust their yearly allotments, as New York does now. This will \nmean smaller amounts of unspent funds to be distributed to a larger \npool of States. Without significant changes, the long-term health of \nthe program is in jeopardy. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the future to address these fundamental issues, but until \nthen, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Rockefeller, \nChafee and a bipartisan group of my colleagues in introducing a bill to \nrestore funding which was previously allocated to the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, SCHIP.\n  Established in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act, SCHIP was \ndeveloped as a means for states to provide basic health coverage for \nuninsured children of low income families, who are not eligible for \ncoverage under Medicaid. Through the Fedeal-State matching program, \nSCHIP has provided coverage for millions of uninsured children. In \nfiscal year 2001, 4.4 million children were enrolled in SCHIP. Today \nevery State in the country, five territories, and the District of \nColumbia are using SCHIP to develop innovative programs to expand \nhealth coverage to even more children.\n  In my home State of Arizona, our SCHIP program, KidsCare, was \ndeveloped to provide low income children with medical, dental, and \nvision coverage. KidsCare has successfully enrolled almost 50,000 \nuninsured children and is anticipating reaching 60,000 by fiscal year \n2004. When Arizona found that children are more likely to received \nhealth care if their parents also have access, and the flexibility of \nSCHIP enabled Arizona to expand its program. Last October Arizona began \ncovering not just children, but also their parents. Arizona now \nprovides health coverage to almost 8,000 uninsured parents. Although a \nsubstantial number of eligible children and parents still need \ncoverage, I believe this relatively young program is nothing short of a \nsuccess.\n  Due to Congressional inaction, approximately $2.7 billion of unspent \nSCHIP funding reverted to the Treasury at the end of last year. The \nbill we are introducing today would return that money to SCHIP, \nensuring that funds are allocated to States that need more funding to \ncontinue existing programs, while allowing other States to develop new \nand innovative programs to help our Nation's children get access to \nhealth care.\n  The number of uninsured Americans reached 41 million in 2001 and \ncontinues to rise. However SCHIP is successfully reducing those numbers \nfor one of the most vulnerable populations in our Nation, our children. \nI hope the Senate will act expeditiously on this important legislation \nto return the funds that belong in SCHIP and to ensure that we are \nexpanding, not reducing, the number of children covered through this \ninnovative program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Frist, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 314. A bill to make improvements in the Foundation for the \nNational Institutes of Health; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Gregg, \nSenator Frist, and Senator Bingaman in introducing legislation to \nimprove the role of the Foundation for the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Improvement Act \nthat we introduce today makes several improvements in the 1990 law that \nestablished the Foundation. Most significantly, the bill assures that \nthe Foundation will receive $500,000 from the NIH to support its \nadministrative and operating expenses. These funds will enable the \nFoundation to use its resources for the actual support of projects to \nstrengthen NIH programs, rather than raise money for its own expenses. \nIn addition, the bill makes clear that the NIH Director and the \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs are ex officio members of the \nFoundation's board of directors.\n  Congress established the Foundation to raise private funds to support \nthe research of the NIH. Since its incorporation as a private, \nnonprofit organization in Maryland 7 years ago, for every $1 that the \nFoundation has received in support from the NIH, it has raised $13 in \nprivate funds to support the work of NIH.\n  By last fall, the Foundation was managing 20 programs with multi-year \nrevenue and funding goals of over $45 million. For example, the Edmond \nJ. Safra Family Lodge on the NIH campus will be completed in the summer \nof 2004 using private funds donated through the Foundation, with \nservices and land donated by the NIH. Families of patients receiving \nin-patient cancer treatment at the NIH Clinical Center will have the \nLodge as a place to stay, at no cost to them.\n  In addition, the Foundation has formed partnerships with the NIH to \ndevelop new cancer treatments, to identify biomarkers for \nosteoarthritis, and to build on the promise of genomics. Through a \npublic-private partnership, the Foundation helped accelerate the \nsequencing of the mouse genome. The Foundation is also collecting \nprivate funds to study drugs in children. On January 26, 2003, Bill \nGates announced a gift to the NIH through the Foundation of $200 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\nover the next 10 years to support research on global health priorities. \nClearly, the Foundation's role with the NIH will grow productively in \nthe coming years.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this legislation, so \nthat the Foundation can continue its effective support of the work and \nmission of the NIH.

A bill to support first responders to protect homeland \nsecurity and prevent and respond to acts of terrorism; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the First \nResponders Partnership Grant Act of 2003. I thank the Democratic \nLeader, Senator Daschle, and Assistant Democratic Leader, Senator Reid, \nfor joining me as original cosponsors of this legislation that will \nsupply our nation's first responders with the support they so \ndesperately need to protect homeland security and prevent and respond \nto acts of terrorism.\n  I want to begin by thanking each of our Nation's brave firefighters, \nemergency rescuers, law enforcement officers, and other first responder \npersonnel for the jobs they do for the American public day in and day \nout. Our public safety officers are often the first to respond to any \ncrime or emergency situation. On September 11, the Nation saw that the \nfirst on the scene at the World Trade Center were the heroic \nfirefighters, police officers and emergency personnel of New York City. \nThese real-life heroes, many of whom gave the ultimate sacrifice, \nremind us of how important it is to support our State and local public \nsafety partners.\n  But while we ask our Nation's first responders to defend us as never \nbefore on the front lines against the dark menace of domestic \nterrorism, we have failed to supply them with the Federal support they \nneed and deserve to protect us, as we expect and need them to protect \nus.\n  Since March 12, 2002, the Federal Homeland Security Advisory System \nhas kept State and local first responders on Yellow Alert, an \n``elevated'' threat level declared when there is a significant risk of \nterrorist attacks, requiring increased surveillance of critical \nlocations. On top of this, from September 10 to September 24 last year, \nAttorney General Ashcroft declared our country at Orange Threat level, \na ``high'' condition indicating a high probability of a terrorist \nattack and when additional precautions by first responders are \nnecessary at public events. Only hours ago, in fact, counterterrorism \nofficials warned that the threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil is \nat a higher level than in previous months due to the possibility of \nimpending military action against Iraq. Debate has already begun at the \nnew Department of Homeland Defense on whether to put out an alert \nwarning or to actually raise the national threat level to Orange again.\n  Counties, cities and towns in my home state of Vermont and across the \nU.S. find themselves overwhelmed by increasing homeland security costs \nrequired by the Federal government. Indeed, the National Governors \nAssociation estimates that states incurred around $7 billion in \nsecurity costs over the past year alone. As a result, the national \nthreat alerts and other Federal homeland security requirements have \nbecome unfunded Federal mandates on our State and local governments. \nRutland County Sheriff R.J. Elrick, President of the Vermont Sheriffs' \nAssociation, recently wrote to me, ``We are in dire need of financial \nsupport to keep our personnel trained and equipped to meet the \nchallenges here at home as we continue our vigilant commitment to fight \nterrorism.''\n  I will ask unanimous consent to place after my remarks in the Record \nthe letter from the Vermont Sheriffs' Association, as well as letters \nfrom the Professional Firefighters of Vermont, the Vermont Ambulance \nAssociation, and the Vermont Association of Police Chiefs, and Chief \nDoug Hoyt of Montpelier, Chief Anthony Bossi of Rutland City, Chief \nDavid Demag of Essex, and Chief Jeffery Whitesell of Winhall.\n  When terrorists strike, first responders are and will always be the \nfirst people we turn to for help. We place our lives and the lives of \nour families and friends in the hands of these officers, trusting that \nwhen called upon they will protect and save us.\n  Just how, without supplying them with the necessary resources, do we \nexpect our Nation's first responders to realistically carry out their \nduties?\n  Our State and local law enforcement officers, firefighters and \nemergency personnel are full partners in preventing, investigating and \nresponding to terrorist acts. They need and deserve the full \ncollaboration of the Federal government to meet these new national \nresponsibilities.\n  Washington is buzzing about the literally hundreds of billions of \nadditional dollars the President plans to ask Congress to provide for \nour military services to fight the war on terrorism abroad. The same \ncannot be said for helping security here at home, which is shamefully \noverlooked. For a year and a half I have been working hard to remedy \nthat, with allies like our distinguished Democratic Leader and \nAssistant Democratic Leader, and New York Senators Schumer and Clinton. \nAs former chair and now ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I \nhave made it a high priority to evaluate and meet the needs of our \nfirst responders.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to introduce the First Responders \nPartnership Grant Act to give our nation's law enforcement officers, \nfirefighters and emergency personnel the resources they need to do \ntheir jobs. Our legislation will establish a grant program at the \nDepartment of Justice to provide $4 billion nationwide in annual \nFederal funds to support State and local public safety officers in \ntheir efforts to protect homeland security and prevent and respond to \nacts of terrorism.\n  Similar to the highly successful Department of Justice Community \nOriented Policing Services and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nPrograms, the First Responder Grants will be made directly to State and \nlocal government units for overtime, equipment, training and facility \nexpenses to support our law enforcement officers, firefighters and \nemergency personnel.\n  The First Responder Grants may be used to pay up to 90 percent of the \ncost of the overtime, equipment, training or facility. In cases of \nfiscal hardship, the Justice Department can waive the local match \nrequirement of 10 percent to provide federal funds for communities that \ncannot afford the local match.\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\n  In a world shaped by the violent events of September 11, day after \nday we call upon our public safety officers to remain vigilant. We not \nonly ask them to put their lives at risk in the line of duty, but also, \nif need be, give their lives to protect us.\n  If we take time to listen to our Nation's State and local public \nsafety partners, they will tell us that they welcome the challenge to \njoin in our national mission to protect our homeland security. But we \ncannot ask our firefighters, emergency personnel, and law enforcement \nofficers to assume these new national responsibilities without also \nproviding new federal support.\n  The First Responders Partnership Grant Program will provide the \nnecessary federal support for our state and public safety officers to \nserve as full partners in the fight to protect our homeland security. \nWe need our first responders for the security and the life-saving help \nthey bring to our communities. All they ask is for the tools they need \nto do their jobs for us. And for the sake of our own security, that is \nnot too much to ask.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I referred to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Rutland County\n\n\n                                         Sheriff's Department,\n\n                                    Rutland, VT, January 31, 2003.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Leahy: I am responding on behalf of the Vermont \n     Sheriffs' Association, having reviewed your current proposed \n     bill entitled, ``First Responders Partnership Grant \n     Program''.\n       The Vermont Sheriffs have unanimously voted to endorse your \n     proposed bill as written. As you know all too well, we are \n     being asked to perform on the front lines at a level never \n     before seen, and with fewer resources at the local level. We \n     are in dire need of financial support to keep our personnel \n     trained and equipped to meet the challenges here at home as \n     we continue our vigilant commitment to fight terrorism.\n       Your continued commitment to the men and women in the \n     trenches is applauded and appreciated. We remain supportive \n     of your efforts and look forward to hearing more as the bill \n     progresses in Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  R.J. Elrick,\n\n                                                          Sheriff,\n     President--Vermont Sheriffs' Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Professional Firefighters\n\n\n                                                   of Vermont,\n\n                           White River Jct., VT, January 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Federal Building,\n     Montpelier, VT.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express my support for \n     the proposed First Responder Partnership Grant Act of 2003.\n       As you are well aware it is the local public safety \n     officers who are our Nations first line of defense whenever \n     tragedy strikes. Since we are this vital link in protecting \n     homeland security it is extremely important that we have the \n     resources needed to safely complete this task. The First \n     Responders Grant Act provides the financial assistance that \n     local public safety officers need so greatly.\n       In closing I wish to thank you for your efforts, and once \n     again express my support and gratitude for the First \n     Responders Grant Act of 2003. If I can be of any further \n     assistance please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Steven Locke,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Vermont Ambulance Association,\n\n                                    Rutland, VT, January 29, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Vermont Ambulance Association and \n     it's membership strongly support The First Responders \n     Partnership Grant Act to be introduced in the United States \n     Senate.\n       This legislation will bring much needed dollars into local \n     emergency response systems to be better prepared to respond \n     to acts of terrorism and serve our communities in homeland \n     security. We very much appreciate your support of Emergency \n     Services. Particularly important in this bill is the fact \n     that it recognizes there are multiple types of public and \n     private departments and services that protect and serve \n     communities and they all will be eligible for funding.\n       Again, we support and thank you for your commitment to \n     Vermont's Emergency Services and to the safety and security \n     of the citizens we serve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James A. Finger,\n     President V.A.A.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Vermont Association of\n\n\n                                             Chiefs of Police,\n\n                                                 January 31, 2003.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy:  Having been informed of ``The Leahy \n     First Responders Partnership Grant Act'', I would like you to \n     know that Vermont Chief's of Police Association \n     wholeheartedly supports the concept. Public safety officials \n     throughout the nation have been required to address a whole \n     new set of issues since September 11, 2001. These issues have \n     required the need for new training, changes in priorities and \n     thoughts towards security and safety of first responders, \n     often without the addition of any new resources. A grant \n     program of this nature will greatly enhance the ability of \n     law enforcement, and other first responders, to continue to \n     pursue their individual missions and to preserve the \n     individual freedom and security that everyone deserves.\n       I must add that I feel that it would be beneficial to \n     afford local entities the opportunity to apply directly to \n     the government for these grants due to the fact each entity \n     would have the best knowledge of what their individual needs \n     are.\n       If the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police can be of \n     any assistance in this endeavor, please feel free to contact \n     me at anytime.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Brett R. Van Noordt,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Montpelier Police Department,\n\n                                 Montpelier, VT, January 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your staff's notification \n     of the First Responder Partnership Grant Program For Public \n     Safety Officers. Jessica has been very helpful in providing \n     details of your introduction of this legislation.\n       I know that you are keenly aware of the need for local \n     government to be able to access funding in the area of \n     homeland security. Montpelier as well as select larger \n     communities based on location and function have greater \n     responsibilities in this new age of defense. At the same time \n     the State of Vermont is no different from many other states \n     in the country that are experiencing critical financial \n     decisions to meet the ``normal'' demands of government. \n     Shouldering the burden for national defense only adds to the \n     critical needs.\n       The current administration cannot realistically believe \n     that a DOJ funding program that goes to the State of Vermont \n     which result in a trickle of $3,000 to the Montpelier Police \n     Department for a radio actually meets the response needs for \n     government in the Capital City of Vermont.\n       In support of this legislative initiative I would encourage \n     your office to advocate strongly for the local units of \n     government to have a larger role and voice in the \n     distribution of these funds. In Vermont, as you well know, \n     the State Government generally controls what occurs on the \n     local level and the temptation with such a large amount of \n     money is too great to have local communities excluded.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts and those of your staff \n     on behalf of law enforcement and the City of Montpelier. It \n     is always a pleasure when I call your office. I hope to be in \n     the Washington area between March 29 and April 1 and hope \n     that I will be able to stop and visit and perhaps we can talk \n     about this and other matters important to Montpelier and the \n     State of Vermont.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Douglas S.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: As the Chief of Policy of The City of \n     Rutland, Vermont and the immediate past president of the \n     Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police I am writing this \n     letter to support your efforts to introduce and pass the \n     ``First Responders Partnership Grant Act of 2003.''\n       This grant program will help us at a local level to be able \n     to have the resources we need to do our jobs in protecting \n     the citizens of Rutland and Vermont.\n       Thank you for your strong support of Law Enforcement and \n     everything you have done for Rutland Police Department. As \n     always please feel free to contact me if there is anything \n     more I can do to help you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Anthony L.

The legislation as \n     proposed will greatly assist local and state agencies combat \n     terrorism and educate our citizens. I am in support of this \n     legislative initiative. Local first responders are a very \n     valuable entity in this war on terrorism. Thank you for not \n     forgetting us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Jeffery L. Whitesell,\n                                         Chief of Police & Rescue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 316. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto include efforts to address barriers to employment as a work activity \nunder the temporary assistance to needy families program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am honored and pleased to introduce \nlegislation today that Senator Kennedy and I introduced with Senator \nWellstone in the 107th Congress. Today, Senator Kennedy and I \nreintroduce the Chance to Succeed Act, legislation that will give TANF \nrecipients with barriers to employment the tools they need to address \nthese issues and move into employment.\n  Studies show that between 44 and 64 percent of TANF recipients have \nmultiple barriers to employment. These barriers range from mental \nhealth issues and substance abuse problems to learning disabilities, \nlimited English proficiency and homelessness. We must assist TANF \nfamilies in meeting their work and parenting obligations, while at the \nsame time addressing the multiple barriers undermining their economic \nsecurity.\n  The Chance to Succeed Act encourages states to better serve the needs \nof TANF recipients with barriers to employment by giving States broad \nflexibility to place TANF recipients in barrier-removal activities and \ncount recipients participating in such activities toward Federal work \nparticipation rates for at least six months. In addition to providing \nfamilies the time they need to seek services, the legislation would \nassist States in developing a screening, assessment and service \ndelivery system. This includes providing funding for State-level \nadvisory panels to improve state policies and procedures for assisting \nfamilies with barriers to work.\n  Additionally, under the Chance to Succeed Act, States would create \npersonal responsibility plans, a proposal endorsed by the Senate \nFinance Committee in the 107th Congress, that outline an employment \ngoal for moving an individual into stable employment, the obligations \nof the individual to work toward becoming and remaining employed in the \nprivate sector, the individual's long-term career goals and the \nspecific work experience, education, or training needed to reach them, \nand the services the State will offer based on screening and \nassessment.\n  Finally, the Chance to Succeed Act would bar States from \ninappropriately sanctioning families with barriers to work. As many as \none-half of parents who were sanctioned off of welfare for failure to \ncomply with state welfare rules, were unable to comply because of their \ndisability, health condition or illness. Under this legislation, states \nwould be prohibited from imposing sanctions on individuals for whom the \nappropriate screening, assessment, or services are unavailable.\n  Some States, including New Jersey, have already taken many of these \nsteps, however, they have done so at their own expense. Last November, \nNew Jersey granted an extension of benefits to 900 TANF recipients \nwhose benefits were about to expire. Most of these families are too \nsick or disabled to work. Rather than forcing them off assistance, the \nstate has recognized that these recipients need help. The Chance to \nSucceed Act will help states like New Jersey to identify these \nrecipients and provide them supportive services to give them the tools \nthey need to live independently. Ultimately, this will help states move \nthis hard-to-serve group one step closer to self-sufficiency.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Corzine \nin introducing the Chance to Succeed Act, which will benefit the most \nvulnerable families across the Nation. I'm concerned that the \nAdministration's proposal on welfare reform fails to give States the \nflexibility needed to assist families who face serious barriers to \nemployment. The Chance to Succeed Act provides this essential \nflexibility.\n  Many of the individuals still remaining on welfare face significant \nand real barriers to finding and keeping jobs. These barriers include \nphysical or mental disabilities, substance abuse, domestic or sexual \nviolence, learning disabilities, problems with literacy or English \nproficiency, or the need to care for a sick or disabled child. These \nrecipients are less likely to find jobs or earn adequate wages, and \nthey are more likely to lose public assistance due to sanctions for \nnoncompliance.\n  It makes sense to assist these families on the road to self-\nsufficiency by enabling states to do what is necessary to provide them \nwith adequate work supports and needed services. This approach works, \nI've seen it in Massachusetts, which has been highly successful in \nserving its neediest families. In fact, even before the 1996 welfare \nreform, the state had developed a welfare program in which all \nrecipients are screened for barriers to employment. We've successfully \nhelped families without major barriers to obtain employment, and we've \nreduced our caseload by over 64 percent in five years. We've also been \nable, consistently and effectively, to serve families facing barriers \nand provide educational, rehabilitative, and other services appropriate \nfor their situations. We have a socially and fiscally responsible \nwelfare policy.\n  The Chance to Succeed Act will encourage all states to take such \nsteps. It will facilitate the development of screening, assessment, and \nservice delivery procedures that enable states to identify these \nindividuals and provide appropriate support and services. It will \nprovide funding and technical assistance for state advisory panels, \nmodel practices, and more effective standards and procedures to help \nindividuals find employment.\n  This bill also helps the many persons who are unable to comply with \ncurrent work requirements because of previously unidentified barriers \nto employment. It will enable each family to develop its own plan that \nincludes career goals and private sector employment. It provides \nflexibility to states to design plans that meet families' unique needs. \nActivities essential to reducing and eliminating barriers can be \ncounted as work. It will enable states to establish conciliation and \nfollow-up procedures to remove barriers and improve compliance, so that \nfewer families are needlessly penalized and left vulnerable.\n  Individuals with barriers to employment are an important part of \ngenuine welfare reform, and it is long past time for Congress to \ninclude them. The Chance to Succeed Act is a first step in\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\nhelping the many families who face barriers to become more self-\nsufficient.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 317. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide to private sector employees the same opportunities for time-\nand-a-half compensatory time off, biweekly work programs, and flexible \ncredit hour programs as Federal employees currently enjoy to help \nbalance the demands and needs for work and family, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that, \nif enacted, could have a monumental impact on the lives of thousands of \nworking men, women and families in America. Today, along with Senators \nEnzi, and Sessions, I am pleased to reintroduce the Family Time and \nWorkplace Flexibility Act. The primary purpose of this legislation is \nto give families and employers greater flexibility in meeting and \nbalancing the demands of work and family.\n  The demand for family time is evident. Let me give you some of the \nlatest statistics. Seventy percent of employees don't think there is a \nhealthy balance between work and personal life. Seventy percent of \nemployees today say that family is their most important priority. This \ncompares to 54 percent in 2000. Forty six percent of employees either \nfeel overworked, overwhelmed by the quantity of their work, or lack the \ntime to step back and reflect on their work. Sixty one percent of \nadults say they would give up some of their pay for more time with \ntheir family. Employees say that finding time for family is a more \npressing concern than layoffs, 32 percent vs 22 percent. This compares \nto 25 percent in 1999.\n  In light of the cry of America's workers for more family time, and in \nhonor of today's 10-year anniversary of the Family Medical Leave Act, I \nam introducing the Family Time and Workplace Flexibility Act, which \nwill build upon the spirit of the FMLA, by updating federal law to \nallow a more flexible workplace. This legislation is not a total \nsolution: there are many other provisions under the 64-year-old Fair \nLabor Standards Act that need our attention. But the legislation I am \nintroducing today is an important part of the solution. It gives \nworking families a choice.\n  The Family Time and Workplace Flexibility Act in a nutshell consists \nof three main provisions. The first allows employees the option of \ntaking time off in lieu of overtime pay. The second gives employees the \noption of ``flexing'' their schedules over a two week period. In other \nwords, employees would have 10 ``flexible'' hours that they could work \nin one week in order to take 10 hours off in the next week. The third \nprovision gives employees the option of a ``flexible credit hour \nprogram,'' under which the employer and employee can agree to allow the \nemployee to work excess hours in his schedule in order to accrue hours \nto be taken off at a later time. The flexible credit hour option is for \nemployees who do not get the opportunity to work overtime, but still \nwant a way to build up hours to take off later.\n  Flexible work arrangements have been available in the Federal \nGovernment since 1978. For over three decades, federal workers have had \nthis special privilege. The federal program was so successful in fact, \nthat in 1994 President Clinton issued an Executive Order extending it \nto parts of the Federal government that had not yet had the benefits of \nthe program. The President stated that: ``Broad use of flexible \narrangements to enable Federal employees to better balance their work \nand family responsibilities can increase employee effectiveness and job \nsatisfaction while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism.'' I \ncouldn't agree more.\n  While Federal employees enjoy the benefits of flexible workplace \narrangements, members of the private sector do not have such options. \nThe Family Time and Workplace Flexibility Act corrects this and extends \nthis option to all businesses covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  So, who are these workers who are currently covered by the FLSA but \ndo not have the ability to exercise workplace flexibility? They are \nsome of the hardest working Americans. Sixty percent of these workers \nhave only a high school education. Eighty percent of them make less \nthan $28,000. A great percentage of them are single mothers with \nchildren. They are working hard to meet their family's economic needs \nas well as their emotional needs. And while government can't mandate \nlove and nurture, it can get out of the way and eliminate barriers to \nopportunities for love and nurture. That is what the Family Time and \nWorkplace Flexibility Act does.\n  In the subsequent weeks and months we will undoubtedly hear from some \nthat what working families really need is more money. They need their \novertime pay. That may well be true for some families, and this bill \ndoes not affect them in any way. But for other families, for families \nwho want to choose to take time off with pay to attend a child's school \nplay or PTA meeting, the issue is time, not money. The point is this \nthe family should have the right to choose. Washington should not \ndecide for them which priority is important for their family.\n  I am one who believes in the working men and women of America and in \ntheir ability to know what is best for their families. It is time for \nCongress to give families what they want, and not what Congress thinks \nthey need. It's time to give working families what Federal employees \nhave already--workplace flexibility.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation, a bill \nsummary, and an article from the Washington Post be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 317\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

An employer may, upon 30 days written notice to the \n     employee, cash-out all hours banked in excess of 80. \n     Employees who terminate their employment either voluntarily \n     or involuntarily must be paid for any unused comp time.\n       An employee may withdraw an agreement at any time by \n     submitting a written notice of withdrawal to the employer and \n     an employer must, within 30 days after receiving the written \n     request, provide the employee the monetary compensation due.\n       An employer may discontinue offering comp time after \n     providing 30 days' notice.\n       Comp time may be used upon request by a worker within a \n     reasonable period after making the request if it does not \n     unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.\n\n      Section 3, Bi-Weekly Work and Flexible Credit Hour Programs\n\n       Gives employers and employees the option of a 2-week 80 \n     hour work period during which, without incurring an overtime \n     penalty, up to 10 hours could be ``flexed'' between the two \n     week period. Employees could, if agreed upon by their \n     employers, choose to work 2 weeks of 40 hours each, 50 hours \n     in one week and 30 in another, etc. Employers would not be \n     required to pay overtime rates (time-and-a-half) until 80 \n     hours had been worked in 2 calendar weeks. For hours worked \n     in excess of 80 in a 2 week period, a worker would have to be \n     compensated either in cash or in paid comp time (if the \n     employer has agreed to a comp time option)--each at not less \n     than a time-and-a-half-basis.\n       Gives employers and employees the option of a ``flexible \n     credit hour program,'' under which the employer and employee \n     can agree to allow the employee to work excess hours in his \n     schedule in order to accrue hours to be taken off at a later \n     time. The employee would receive one hour of time off for \n     every excess hour worked.\n       The flexible credit hour option is for employees who do not \n     get the opportunity to work overtime, but still want a way to \n     build up hours to take off later.\n       Employees may accrue up to 50 flexible credit hours.\n       Like comp time, these programs are completely voluntary and \n     may not affect collective bargaining agreements that are in \n     force.\n       Discontinuance rules for these programs are similar to \n     rules for comp time.\n\n             Section 4, Protections in Cases of Bankruptcy\n\n       Amends the Federal bankruptcy code to grant third priority \n     (allowed unsecured claims for wages, salaries, or \n     commissions) in bankruptcy proceedings to claims relating to \n     compensatory time off.\n\n                   Section 5, Congressional Coverage\n\n       Congressional employees would have access to comp time, \n     biweekly work programs, and flexible credit hours.\n\n                         Section 6, Termination\n\n       The provisions sunset after 5 years.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 4, 2003]\n\n                             The Regulators\n\n                          (By Cindy Skrzycki)\n\n\n                  Businesses Sore About Medical Leave\n\n       It was the Labor Department's 1996 ruling that counted the \n     common cold, flu, earaches, headaches and other routine \n     ailments as ``serious health conditions'' that put many \n     employers in a swivet over benefits offered under the Family \n     and Medical Leave Act.\n       The business community, fearing employees would be absent \n     from work for minor ailments, geared up almost immediately to \n     press Congress and the Labor Department for ``technical \n     corrections'' to the rules.\n       The law, passed a decade ago, provides workers at companies \n     with more than 50 employees up to 12 weeks or unpaid leave \n     and job protection for the birth or adoption of a child, to \n     care for an immediate family member, or to tend to a serious \n     health condition. Businesses felt so strongly about the need \n     to ``fix'' some of the rules that they created the FMLA \n     Technical Corrections Coalition in 1997, and about 300 \n     companies and trade associations joined. They testified, \n     lobbied and complained about problems with the rules, \n     especially the guidance on what constitutes a serious health \n     condition. The Clinton administration, which viewed the law \n     as a signature piece of legislation, was not disposed to \n     change the rules. In surveys done for the Labor Department, \n     Clinton regulators insisted that companies were not finding \n     it onerous to comply. A Labor survey in 2000, for example, \n     said millions of workers have taken the leave, using it \n     ``infrequently and for relatively short periods of time.''\n       The Bush administration has been more receptive to industry \n     complaints and is talking to business groups, AARP, unions \n     and women's advocacy groups about what works and doesn't work \n     with the regulations.\n       ``The employer community has come in with very specific, \n     very targeted issues in very specific areas of the \n     regulations,'' said Victoria A. Lipnic, assistant secretary \n     for the Employment Standards Administration. ``These are \n     listening sessions on our part. The biggest thing we hear is \n     the chronic use of unforeseen, intermittent leave.''\n       Lipnic said the department hopes to reorganize the rules \n     and eliminate some of the\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\n     complexity to make them more efficient for employers and \n     employees alike. She added that the department has to change \n     some of the notification requirements that employers have to \n     abide by because a recent Supreme Court decision found \n     employers did not have to offer 12 weeks of family leave on \n     top of other, more generous leave policies.\n       ``No one debates the 12-week leave or the family-leave part \n     of the legislation,'' said Randel Johnson, vice president of \n     labor, immigration and employee benefits at the U.S. Chamber \n     of Commerce. ``It's the medical leave part that causes the \n     problem.''\n       Johnson, who was the staff aide who wrote the minority \n     views when the original legislation passed the House, \n     predicted at the time that administration would be unworkable \n     and lead to extensive litigation. For some companies, those \n     problems have come to pass and so has the litigation. There \n     have been some 1,300 federal cases dealing with various \n     aspects of the law, according to the Labor Department.\n       Though Congress made it clear that the leave was to be \n     applied to ``serious medical conditions,'' such as cancer, \n     surgeries and pregnancy-related issues, the rules were \n     interpreted otherwise.\n       The 1996 opinion letter that triggered business outrage \n     said an employee is eligible for leave if he is out for more \n     than three days and is receiving treatment, such as \n     antibiotics for the flu. That interpretation followed an \n     opinion from the department the year before that said exactly \n     the opposite.\n       ``Whenever we have seminar or a breakout session [on the \n     law] at a conference, it's packed to capacity,'' said Deron \n     Zeppelin, director of governmental affairs for the Society \n     for Human Resource Management, a group of business benefits \n     managers. ``When you're dealing with the realities of the \n     workplace, the law becomes more difficult. No one thought \n     when it was passed that people would get [medical] \n     certification to take off time whenever they want.''\n       One large corporation, which asked not to be named, said 90 \n     percent of the leave its workers take falls into the \n     ``serious medical condition'' category, not the care of \n     family members. Company officials said the leave has been \n     taken for pinkeye, poison ivy, stress and tooth extraction. \n     ``People use this as a way to get additional sick leave \n     without any repercussions,'' said a company official.\n       Business lobbyists want to tighten the definition of what \n     constitutes a serious health condition. The also want to \n     restrict employees to taking the leave in half-day chunks--\n     now, it can be taken in the smallest increments their payroll \n     systems can track, and that can be minutes. They also want \n     employees to be responsible for requesting leave under the \n     act, instead of requiring that companies tell them about it.\n       Labor unions and women's groups who fought for passage of \n     the law have been watching warily, especially since the Bush \n     administration recently threw out a Clinton-era rule that \n     allowed states to pay for family leave through their \n     unemployment funds. They would like to see the law expanded \n     to cover other absences, such as teacher conferences or to \n     allow employees to take a sick parent to a doctor's \n     appointment. They also would like the leave to be paid, which \n     would require new legislation, and cover more employees.\n       Christine Owens, director of public policy for the AFL-CIO, \n     said business is overstating the seriousness of the problems \n     and they probably could be fixed with ``modest tinkering.'' \n     Judith L. Lichtman, president of the National Partnership for \n     Women & Families, said the problems employers are complaining \n     about are of ``questionable merit.''\n       ``If the Bush administration wants to think of itself as \n     family-friendly, it should put its policies where its \n     rhetoric is--expand on existing FMLA rights,'' Lichtman said. \n     ``It's an incredibly popular program that has made a \n     difference in the lives of working people.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Edwards, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Hollings, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Warner, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Harkin, \n        and Mr Reid):\n  S. 318. A bill to provide emergency assistance to nonfarm-related \nsmall business concerns that have suffered substantial economic harm \nfrom drought; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, drought continues to be a serious problem \nfor many States in this country, and I rise to re-introduce legislation \nto help small businesses that need disaster assistance but can't get it \nthrough the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program.\n  You see, the SBA doesn't treat all drought victims the same. The \nAgency only helps those small businesses whose income is tied to \nfarming and agriculture. However, farmers and ranchers are not the only \nsmall businesses owners whose livelihoods are at risk when drought hits \ntheir communities. The impact can be just as devastating to the owners \nof rafting businesses, marinas, and bait and tackle shops. Sadly, these \nsmall businesses cannot get help through the SBA's disaster loan \nprogram because of something taxpayers hate about government, \nbureaucracy.\n  The SBA denies these businesses access to disaster loans because its \nlawyers say drought is not a sudden event and therefore it is not a \ndisaster by definition. However, contrary to the Agency's position that \ndrought is not a disaster, as of July 16, 2002, the day this \nlegislation was introduced last year, the SBA had in effect drought \ndisaster declarations in 36 States. And adding insult to injury, in \nthose States where the Agency declared drought disasters, it limited \nassistance to only farm-related small businesses.\n  My friends, the SBA has the authority to help all small businesses \nhurt by drought in declared disaster areas, but the Agency won't do it. \nFor years the Agency has been applying the law unfairly, helping some \nand not others, and it is out of compliance with the law. The Small \nBusiness Drought Relief Act of 2003 would force SBA to comply with \nexisting law, restoring fairness to an unfair system, and get help to \nsmall business drought victims that need it.\n  This bill deserves quick consideration. Time is of the essence for \ndrought victims. This legislation has been through a thorough review, \nand there is no reason to duplicate our efforts. The Committee \nconsidered virtually identical legislation last year and voted \nunanimously to pass it. In addition to approval by the committee of \njurisdiction, OMB approved identical legislation last year. The bill I \nam introducing today includes those changes we worked out with the \nAdministration, and I see no reason to delay passage.\n  Senator Bond has been a real champion on this issue, and I thank him. \nI look forward to having a similar partnership with Senator Snowe. I \nthank all my colleagues who are cosponsors, Senators Bond, Landrieu, \nEdwards, Johnson, Bingaman, Levin, Baucus, Daschle, Hollings, \nLieberman, Warner, Crapo, Harkin, and Reid.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, and letters of \nsupport from governors who advocated prompt passage of this legislation \nlast year, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 318\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS DAMAGED BY \n                   DROUGHT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Small \n     Business Drought Relief Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) as of July 2002, more than 36 States (including \n     Massachusetts, South Carolina, and Louisiana) have suffered \n     from continuing drought conditions;\n       (2) droughts have a negative effect on State and regional \n     economies;\n       (3) many small businesses in the United States sell, \n     distribute, market, or otherwise engage in commerce related \n     to water and water sources, such as lakes, rivers, and \n     streams;\n       (4) many small businesses in the United States suffer \n     economic injury from drought conditions, leading to revenue \n     losses, job layoffs, and bankruptcies;\n       (5) these small businesses need access to low-interest \n     loans for business-related purposes, including paying their \n     bills and making payroll until business returns to normal;\n       (6) absent a legislative change, the practice of the Small \n     Business Administration of permitting only agriculture and \n     agriculture-related businesses to be eligible for Federal \n     disaster loan assistance as a result of drought conditions \n     would likely continue;\n       (7) during the past several years small businesses that \n     rely on the Great Lakes have suffered economic injury as a \n     result of lower than average water levels, resulting from low \n     precipitation and increased evaporation, and there are \n     concerns that small businesses in other regions could suffer \n     similar hardships beyond their control and that they should \n     also be eligible for assistance; and\n       (8) it is necessary to amend the Small Business Act to \n     clarify that nonfarm-related small businesses that have \n     suffered economic injury from drought are eligible to receive \n     financial assistance through Small Business Administration \n     Economic Injury Disaster Loans.\n       (c) Drought Disaster Authority.--\n       (1) Definition of disaster.--Section 3(k) of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(k)) is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(k)''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) For purposes of section 7(b)(2), the term `disaster' \n     includes--\n       ``(A) drought; and\n       ``(B) below average water levels in the Great Lakes, or on \n     any body of water in the\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\n     United States that supports commerce by small business \n     concerns.''.\n       (2) Drought disaster relief authority.--Section 7(b)(2) of \n     the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``including drought, with respect to both \n     farm-related and nonfarm-related small business concerns \n     affected by drought,'' before ``if the Administration''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``the Consolidated \n     Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961 (7 U.S.C. 1961)'' and \n     inserting the following: ``section 321 of the Consolidated \n     Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961), in which \n     case, assistance under this paragraph may be provided to \n     farm-related and nonfarm-related small business concerns, \n     subject to the other applicable requirements of this \n     paragraph''.\n       (d) Prompt Response to Disaster Requests.--Section \n     7(b)(2)(D) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b)(2)(D)) \n     is amended by striking ``Upon receipt of such certification, \n     the Administration may'' and inserting ``Not later than 30 \n     days after the date of receipt of such certification by a \n     Governor of a State, the Administration shall respond in \n     writing to that Governor on its determination and the reasons \n     therefore, and may''.\n       (e) Limitation on Loans.--From funds otherwise appropriated \n     for loans under section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 636(b)), not more than $9,000,000 may be used during \n     fiscal year 2003 to provide drought disaster loans to non-\n     farm related small business concerns.\n       (f) Rulemaking.--Not later than 45 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Small \n     Business Administration shall promulgate final rules to carry \n     out this Act and the amendments made by this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Southern Governors' Association,\n\n                                                  August 19, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: We are deeply concerned that small \n     businesses in states experiencing drought are being \n     devastated by drought conditions that are expected to \n     continue through the end of the summer. We urge you to \n     support legislation that would allow small businesses to \n     protect themselves against the detrimental effects of \n     drought.\n       Much like other natural disasters, the effects of drought \n     on local economies can be crippling. Farmers and farm-related \n     businesses can turn in times of drought to the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture. However, non-farm small businesses \n     have nowhere to go, not even the Small Business \n     Administration (SBA), because their disaster loans are not \n     made available for damage due to drought.\n       To remedy this omission, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) \n     introduced the Small Business Drought Relief Act (S. 2734) on \n     July 16, 2002, to make SBA disaster loans available to those \n     small businesses debilitated by prolonged drought conditions. \n     This bill was passed by the Senate Small Business Committee \n     just eight days later. Also, the companion legislation (H.R. \n     5197) was introduced by Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) on July 24, \n     2002. Both bills are gaining bipartisan support, and we hope \n     you will cosponsor this important legislation and push for \n     its rapid enactment in the 107th Congress.\n       As 11 southern states are presently experiencing moderate \n     to exceptional drought conditions this summer, we cannot \n     afford to wait to act. We urge you to cosponsor the Small \n     Business Drought Relief Act and push for its consideration as \n     soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama; Gov. Mike Huckabee of \n           Arkansas; Gov. Roy E. Barnes of Georgia; Gov. M.J. \n           ``Mike'' Foster, Jr. of Louisiana; Gov. Ronnie Musgrove \n           of Mississippi; Gov. Michael F. Easley of North \n           Carolina; Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina; Gov. Rick \n           Perry of Texas; Gov. Bob Wise of West Virginia; Gov. \n           Paul E. Patton of Kentucky; Gov. Parris N. Glendening \n           of Maryland; Gov. Bob Holden of Missouri; Gov. Frank \n           Keating of Oklahoma; Gov. Don Sundquist of Tennessee; \n           and Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Ofice of the Governor,\n\n                                                    July 23, 2002.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kerry and Bond: Much of Nevada and the Nation \n     have been experiencing extreme drought over the past several \n     years. In Nevada we have seen the effects of this situation \n     through catastrophic range and forest fires, insect \n     infestations and loss of crops and livestock.\n       Prolonged drought causes a drastic reduction in stream and \n     river flow levels. This can cause the level of lakes to drop \n     so significantly that existing docks and boat ramps cannot \n     provide access to boats. In the case of range and forest \n     fires we have seen small innkeepers and hunting and fishing \n     related businesses that have their entire season wiped out in \n     a matter of a few hours.\n       Unfortunately for some small businesses, drought assistance \n     is available only for agriculture related small businesses, \n     such as feed and seed stores. For businesses that are based \n     on tourism around lakes and rivers, there is currently no \n     drought assistance available.\n       The Small Business Administration (SBA) is not currently \n     authorized to help these businesses because a drought is not \n     a sudden occurrence. Nonetheless, a drought is an ongoing \n     natural disaster that causes great damage to these small \n     businesses.\n       I would like to lend my support to S. 2734, The Small \n     Business Drought Relief Act. This bill would amend the \n     guidelines and authorize the SBA to offer assistance to small \n     businesses affected by prolonged drought. With passage of \n     this bill, Governors would be allowed to ask SBA for an \n     administrative declarations of economic injury because of \n     drought. The low interest loans SBA can offer these \n     businesses would allow many of them to weather the drought \n     and remain economically viable for future operation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kenny C. Guinn,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n              State of North Carolina, Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Raleigh, NC, July 18, 2002.\n     Hon. John Edwards,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards: I am writing to thank you for your \n     support for legislation introduced in the Senate to add \n     drought as a condition for which small businesses may apply \n     for Small Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster \n     Loans.\n       The Small Business Drought Relief Act (S. 2734) will \n     correct the current situation facing our small businesses in \n     North Carolina. SBA disaster assistance is not available \n     despite a historic drought that is impacting not just our \n     agriculture sector, but causing real business and revenue \n     losses, which threaten some firms with job layoffs or even \n     bankruptcy.\n       These businesses need help, and access to low-interest SBA \n     loans can offer a lifeline to allow paying bills and making \n     payrolls until business returns to normal.\n       I urge you to push for rapid action on this important \n     enhancement to SBA's ability to help our people through this \n     time of trouble.\n       With kindest regards, I remain\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Michael F. Easley,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Columbia, SC, July 9, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: The State of South Carolina is in its \n     fifth year of drought status, the worst in over fifty years. \n     Some parts of the state are in extreme drought status and the \n     rest if in severe drought status.\n       Ninety-nine percent of our streams are flowing at less than \n     10 percent of their average flow for this time of year. 60 \n     percent of those same streams are running at lowest flow on \n     record for this date. The levels of South Carolina's lakes \n     have dropped anywhere from five feet to twenty feet. Some \n     lakes have experienced a drop in water level so significant \n     that tourist and recreational use has diminished.\n       State and national climatologists are not hopeful that we \n     will receive any significant rainfall in the near future. To \n     end our current drought, we would need an extended period of \n     average to above average rainfall.\n       Droughts, particularly prolonged ones such as we are \n     experiencing now, have extensive economic effects. For \n     farmers who experience the economic effects of such a \n     drought, assistance is available through the USDA. For small \n     businesses, assistance is available only for agriculture \n     related small businesses, i.e., feed and seed stores. For \n     businesses that are based on tourism around Lakes and Rivers, \n     there is currently no assistance available.\n       We have reports of lake and river tourism dependent \n     businesses experiencing 17 percent to 80 percent declines in \n     revenue. The average decline in revenue is probably near 50 \n     percent across the board.\n       My staff has contacted Small Business Administration and \n     they are not authorized to offer assistance to these \n     businesses because a drought is not defined as a sudden \n     occurrence. Nonetheless, a drought is an ongoing natural \n     disaster that is causing great economic damage to these small \n     business owners.\n       I am requesting that you assist us in this situation by \n     proposing that the Small Business and Entrepreneurship \n     Committee take action to at least temporarily amend the SBA \n     authorizing language and allow them to offer assistance to \n     small businesses affected by prolonged drought. This would \n     allow Governors to ask SBA for an administrative declaration \n     of economic injury because of drought. The low interest loans \n     SBA can offer these businesses would allow many of them to \n     weather the drought and remain in business for the long run.\n       My staff has also been in contact with Senator Hollings' \n     legislative staff. I hope together, we can find an expedient \n     solution to the plight of these small business owners. Short \n     of finding a way to control the weather, this may be our only \n     option to help their dire situation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jim Hodges,\n                                                         Governor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Sarbanes):\n\n[[Page S2005]]\n\n  S. 319. A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, to \nincrease the Government contribution for Federal employee health \ninsurance; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Improvement Act of 2003 along with my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes. This bill would reduce the \nemployee portion of premiums costs under the Federal Employee Health \nBenefits Plan.\n  Our Federal employees work hard for the American people and they \ndeserve quality benefits.\n  Why is this legislation important?\n  Health insurance premiums for Federal employees and retirees rose an \naverage of 11.2 percent this year. In contrast, Federal worker's wages \nare expected to rise by 4.1 percent in the Washington-Baltimore area \nonce the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill is approved. This \nfollows a 13.3 percent increase last year, and an increase of 10.5 \npercent for 2001. As a result, premiums are nearly 50 percent greater \nthan they were just 5 years ago.\n  The Federal program provides health insurance coverage to about 9 \nmillion government workers, retirees and family members. More than \n800,000 of these workers live in the DC metro area.\n  Health insurance costs are skyrocketing, and Federal employees are \npaying a greater share of their take home pay for health care each \nyear. Currently, Federal employees pay anywhere between 28 percent to \n30 percent of premiums. In the private sector, other large employers \npay at least 80 percent of premiums and employees pay 20 percent, \naccording to recent data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nand the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n  How would this bill help solve this problem?\n  This bill would change the financing formula for Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program, FEHBP. Under this approach, the federal \nagencies would pay 80 percent of the weighted average for premiums. \nThis would help reduce the out-of-pocket health care costs for federal \nemployees and improve the affordability of FEHBP immensely.\n  What would this mean to Federal employees?\n  My bill would help improve the affordability of health care insurance \nfor all 9 million. Currently, about 250,000 federal employees do not \nhave health insurance. Many of them cannot afford health care insurance \nat the current rates. My proposal would improve the affordability of \nhealth care insurance so that many of these workers would be able to \nafford coverage.\n  For example, under Blue Cross Blue Shield's Standard Option Plan, an \nindividual would save almost $400, and a family would save about $925 \nthis year.\n  Providing quality benefits for federal employees is also an important \ntool in helping recruit and retain a high quality workforce and compete \nwith the private sector and other State and local governments.\n  This bill would have an enormous impact in my State, Maryland, but \nwould also benefit Federal workers nationally. Under this proposal, the \npercent that a Federal employee pays in health insurance premiums would \ndecline, putting more money into Federal employees pockets each pay \nperiod.\n  This bill improves benefits for our hardworking Federal Employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing support for this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG.\n  S. 320. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nclarify the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Family and Medical Leave Act was \nintended to be used by families for critical periods such as after the \nbirth or adoption of a child and leave to care for a child, spouse, or \none's own ``serious medical condition.''\n  Since its passage, the Family and Medical Leave Act has had a \nsignificant impact on employers' leave practices and policies. \nAccording to the Commission on Family and Medical Leave, two-thirds of \ncovered work sites have changed some aspect of their policies in order \nto comply with the Act.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Labor's implementation of certain \nprovisions of the Act has resulted in significant unintended \nadministrative burden and costs on employers; resentment by co-workers \nwhen the Act is misapplied; invasions of privacy by requiring employers \nto ask deeply personal questions about employees and family members \nwhen employees plan to take FMLA leave; disruptions to the workplace \ndue to increased unscheduled and unplanned absences; unnecessary record \nkeeping; unworkable notice requirements; and conflicts with existing \npolicies. These problems have been well documented in six separate \ncongressional hearings, including one I chaired and a House hearing \nwhere I testified.\n  Problems with the FMLA implementation have been documented in the \ncourts. The validity of 13 different Department of Labor regulations \nrelating to the Act has been challenged in 64 reported court decisions. \nIncluded in this, of course, is the Supreme Court's invalidation of one \nof the Department's regulations in the 2002 case of Ragsdale v. \nWolverine Worldwide Inc. And, yesterday's Washington Post reported that \nthere have been some 1,300 Federal cases dealing with various aspects \nof the law, according to the Department of Labor.\n  The Department of Labor's vague and confusing implementing \nregulations and interpretations have resulted in the FMLA being \nmisapplied, misunderstood and mistakenly ignored. Employers aren't sure \nif situations like pink eye, ingrown toenails and even the common cold \nwill be considered by the regulators and the courts to be serious \nhealth conditions. Because of these concerns and well-documented \nproblems with the Act, today I am introducing the Family and Medical \nLeave Clarification Act to make reasonable and much needed technical \ncorrections to the Family and Medical Leave Act and restore it to its \noriginal congressional intent.\n  The need for FMLA technical corrections has been confirmed and \nstrengthened by six congressional hearings and by the recent release of \nkey surveys. Conclusive evidence of the need for corrections has now \nbeen established. The Congressional hearings demonstrated that the \nFMLA's definition of serious health condition is vague and overly broad \ndue to the Department of Labor's interpretations. Additionally, the \nhearings documented that the intermittent leave provisions, \nnotification, and certification problems are causing many serious \nworkplace problems. In addition, some companies testified that Congress \nshould consider allowing employers to permit employees to take either a \npaid leave package under an existing collective bargaining agreement or \nthe 12 weeks of FMLA protected leave, whichever is greater.\n  I am concerned that a recent decrease in paid leave for employees has \nbeen attributed to the administration's problematic FMLA \ninterpretations. Some research shows a decline in voluntarily provided \npaid sick leave and vacation leave by the private sector. The 2000 \nSociety for Human Resource Management Benefits Survey found that paid \nvacation was provided by 87 percent of companies in the year 2000 while \nthe year before it was 94 percent. Paid sick leave was at 85 percent in \n1999, and decreased to 74 percent the following year.\n  A recent survey conducted by former President Clinton's Department of \nLabor confirmed FMLA implementation problems. The Labor Department \nreport found that the share of covered establishments reporting that it \nwas somewhat or very easy to comply with the FMLA has declined 21.5 \npercent from 1995 to 2000.\n\n  The recent release of the Society for Human Resource Management, \nSHRM, 2003 FMLA Survey strongly reinforces the need for FMLA technical \ncorrections. Respondents to the SHRM survey stated that, on average, \nmore than half, or 52 percent, of employees who take FMLA leave do not \nschedule the leave in advance. Consequently, managers often do not have \nthe ability to plan for work disruptions. Yesterday's Washington Post \narticle reported that the biggest thing the Department of Labor hears \nabout is the ``chronic use of unforseen, intermittent leave.'' \nRespondents to the SHRM survey also reported that, in most cases, the \nburden of the workload from the employee on leave falls to employees \nwho are not on\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\nleave. When asked whether they have had to grant FMLA requests they \nfelt were not legitimate, 50 percent said they had. Additionally, more \nthan one-third, or 34 percent, of respondents said they were aware of \nemployee complaints over the past year regarding a co-worker's \nquestionable use of FMLA leave.\n  The issue of intermittent leave also continues to be extremely \ndifficult. SHRM's 2000 FMLA survey showed that three-quarters, or 76 \npercent, of respondents said they would find compliance easier if the \nDepartment of Labor allowed FMLA leave to be offered and tracked in \nhalf-day increments rather than by minutes.\n  I am very concerned that both the SHRM and the Labor Department \nsurveys show that FMLA implementation is becoming more difficult, not \neasier, ten years after it has been in place. I am hopeful that the \nFamily and Medical Leave Clarification Act will advance in the 108th \nCongress on a bipartisan basis to address this problem.\n  The FMLA Clarification Act has the strong support of the Society for \nHuman Resource Management, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the American Society of Healthcare Human \nResources Professionals, and close to 300 other leading companies and \nassociations that make up the Family and Medical Leave Act Technical \nCorrections Coalition. This broad-based coalition shares my belief that \nboth employers and employees would benefit from making certain \ntechnical corrections to the FMLA, corrections that are needed to \nrestore congressional intent and to reduce administrative and \ncompliance problems experienced by employers who are making a good \nfaith effort to comply with the Act.\n  The bill I am introducing today does several important things:\n  First, it repeals the Department of Labor's current regulations for \n``serious health condition'' and includes language from the Democrats' \nown original Committee Report on what types of medical conditions, such \nas heart attacks, strokes, spinal injuries, etc., were intended to be \ncovered. In passing the FMLA, Congress stated that the term ``serious \nhealth condition'' is not intended to cover short-term conditions, for \nwhich treatment and recovery are very brief, recognizing that ``it is \nexpected that such condition will fall within the most modest sick \nleave policies.''\n  On the other hand, the Department of Labor's current regulations are \nextremely confusing and expansive, defining the term ``serious health \ncondition'' as including, among other things, any absence of more than \n3 days in which the employee sees any health care provider and receives \nany type of continuing treatment, including a second doctor's visit, or \na prescription, or a referral to a physical therapist. Such a broad \ndefinition potentially mandates FMLA leave where an employee sees a \nhealth care provider once, receives a prescription drug, and is \ninstructed to call the health care provider back if the symptoms do not \nimprove. The regulations also define as a ``serious health condition'' \nany absence for a chronic health problem, such as arthritis, asthma, \ndiabetes, etc., even if the employee does not see a doctor for that \nabsence and is absent for less than three days.\n  Second, the bill amends the act's provisions relating to intermittent \nleave to allow employers to require that intermittent leave be taken in \nminimum blocks of 4 hours. This would minimize the misuse of FMLA by \nemployees who use FMLA as an excuse for regular tardiness and routine \njustification for early departures.\n  Third, the bill shifts to the employee the responsibility to request \nthat leave be designated as FMLA leave, and requires the employee to \nprovide written application within 5 working days of providing notice \nto the employer for foreseeable leave.\n  With respect to unforeseeable leave, the bill requires the employee \nto provide, at a minimum, oral notification of the need for the leave \nnot later than the date the leave commences unless the employee is \nphysically or mentally incapable of providing notice or submitting the \napplication. Under that circumstance the employee is provided such \nadditional time as necessary to provide notice.\n  Shifting the burden to the employee to request that leave be \ndesignated as FMLA leave eliminates the need for the employer to \nquestion the employee and pry into the employee's and the employee's \nfamily's private matters, as required under current law, and helps \neliminate personal liability for employer supervisors who should not be \nexpected to be experts in the vague and complex regulations which even \nattorneys have a difficult time understanding.\n  Under current law, it is the employer's responsibility in all \ncircumstances to designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying. \nFailure to do so in a timely manner or to inform an employee that a \nspecific event does not qualify as FMLA leave may result in that \nunqualified leave becoming qualified leave under FMLA. In addition, the \ncourts have held that there is personal liability for employers under \nthe FMLA and that an individual manager may be sued and held \nindividually liable for acts taken based upon or relating to the FMLA. \nFor example, in the 1995 case of Freemon v. Foley, in the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois, the court stated, ``We believe the FMLA extends \nto all those who controlled `in whole or in part' [plaintiff's] ability \nto take leave of absence and return to her position.''\n  Fourth, with respect to leave because of the employee's own serious \nhealth condition, the bill permits an employer to require the employee \nto choose between taking unpaid leave provided by the FMLA or paid \nabsence under an employer's collective bargaining agreement or other \nsick leave, sick pay, or disability plan, program, or policy of the \nemployer. This change provides incentive for employers to continue \ntheir generous sick leave policies while providing a disincentive to \nemployers considering getting rid of such employee-friendly plans, \nincluding those negotiated by the employer and the employee's union \nrepresentative. Paid leave would be subject to the employer's normal \nwork rules and procedures for taking such leave, including work rules \nand procedures dealing with attendance requirements.\n  The FMLA Clarification Act is a reasonable response to the concerns \nthat have been raised about the Act. It leaves in place the fundamental \nprotections of the law while attempting to make changes necessary to \nrestore FMLA to its original intent and to respond to the very \nlegitimate concerns that have been raised. I urge my colleagues to \nrestore the FMLA to its original Congressional intent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Family and \n     Medical Leave Clarification Act''.\n       (b) References.--Except as otherwise expressly provided, \n     wherever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in \n     terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \n     provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a \n     section or other provision of the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (referred to \n     in this section as the ``Act'') is not working as Congress \n     intended when Congress passed the Act in 1993. Many \n     employers, including those employers that are nationally \n     recognized as having generous family-friendly benefit and \n     leave programs, are experiencing serious problems complying \n     with the Act.\n       (2) The Department of Labor's overly broad regulations and \n     interpretations have caused many of those problems by greatly \n     expanding the Act's coverage to apply to many nonserious \n     health conditions.\n       (3) Those problems are also documented in a review of \n     litigation under the Act. The validity of 13 different \n     Department of Labor regulations relating to the Act has been \n     challenged in 64 reported court decisions.\n       (4) From 1996 through 2002, 6 congressional hearings (2 in \n     the Senate and 4 in the House of Representatives) documented \n     numerous implementation problems with the Act due to the \n     Department of Labor's misapplication of the Act through some \n     of its regulations and interpretations.\n       (5) Documented problems generated by the Act include \n     significant new administrative and personnel costs, loss of \n     productivity,\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\n     scheduling difficulties, unnecessary paperwork and \n     recordkeeping, and other compliance problems.\n       (6) The Act often conflicts with employers' paid sick leave \n     policies, prevents employers from managing absences through \n     their absence control plans, and results in most leave under \n     the Act becoming paid leave.\n       (7) Administrative problems associated with the use of \n     intermittent leave under the Act are a well-documented issue. \n     Approximately \\3/4\\ (76 percent) of the respondents to a 2000 \n     survey by the Society for Human Resource Management said they \n     would find compliance easier if the Department of Labor \n     allowed covered leave to be offered and tracked in increments \n     of half days rather than minutes.\n       (8) The Commission on Leave, established in title III of \n     the Act (29 U.S.C. 2631 et seq.) which in 1996 reported few \n     difficulties with compliance with the Act, failed to identify \n     many of the problems with compliance because the survey on \n     which the report was based was conducted too soon after the \n     date of enactment of the Act and the most significant \n     problems with compliance arose only when employers later \n     sought to comply with the Act's final regulations and \n     interpretations.\n       (9) A more recent Department of Labor survey, released in \n     January 2001 as an update requested by Congress to the 1996 \n     Commission on Leave report, found that between 1995 and 2000, \n     there had been a 21.5 percent decline in the share of covered \n     establishments reporting that it was somewhat easy or very \n     easy to comply with the Act.\n       (10) According to the Society for Human Resource Management \n     2003 FMLA Survey, 50 percent of human resource professionals \n     indicated that they have had to grant leave requests under \n     the Act that they did not believe were legitimate because of \n     the Department of Labor's interpretations, and 34 percent of \n     human resource professionals were aware of employee \n     complaints in the past 12 months due to coworkers' \n     questionable use of leave under the Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION.\n\n       Section 101(11) (29 U.S.C. 2611(11)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n     (i) and (ii), respectively;\n       (2) by aligning the margins of those clauses with the \n     margins of clause (i) of paragraph (4)(A);\n       (3) by inserting before ``The'' the following:\n       ``(A) In general.--''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Exclusions.--The term does not include a short-term \n     illness, injury, impairment, or condition, for which \n     treatment and recovery are very brief.\n       ``(C) Examples.--The term includes an illness, injury, \n     impairment, or physical or mental condition such as a heart \n     attack, a heart condition requiring a heart bypass or valve \n     operation, a back condition requiring extensive therapy or a \n     surgical procedure, a stroke, a severe respiratory condition, \n     a spinal injury, appendicitis, pneumonia, emphysema, severe \n     arthritis, a severe nervous disorder, an injury caused by a \n     serious accident on or off the job, an ongoing pregnancy, a \n     miscarriage, a complication or illness related to pregnancy \n     (such as severe morning sickness), a need for prenatal care, \n     childbirth, and recovery from childbirth, that involves care \n     or treatment described in subparagraph (A).''.\n\n     SEC. 4. INTERMITTENT LEAVE.\n\n       Section 102(b)(1) (29 U.S.C. 2612(b)(1)) is amended by \n     striking the period at the end of the second sentence and \n     inserting the following: ``, as certified under section 103 \n     by the health care provider involved after each leave \n     occurrence. An employer may require an employee to take \n     intermittent leave under this Act in increments of up to (and \n     including) \\1/2\\ of a workday. An employer may require an \n     employee who travels as part of the normal day-to-day work or \n     duty assignment of the employee and who requests intermittent \n     leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule under this Act to \n     take leave for the duration of the work or assignment \n     involved, if the employer cannot reasonably accommodate the \n     employee's request.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. REQUEST FOR LEAVE.\n\n       Section 102(e) (29 U.S.C. 2612(e)) is amended by inserting \n     after paragraph (2) the following:\n       ``(3) Request for leave.--If an employer does not exercise, \n     under subsection (d)(2), the right to require an employee to \n     substitute other employer-provided leave for leave under this \n     title, the employer may require the employee who wants leave \n     under this title to request the leave in a timely manner. If \n     an employer requires a timely request under this paragraph, \n     an employee who fails to make a timely request may be denied \n     leave under this title.\n       ``(4) Timeliness of request for leave.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (3), a request for leave shall be considered to be \n     timely if--\n       ``(A) in the case of foreseeable leave, the employee--\n       ``(i) provides the applicable advance notice required by \n     paragraphs (1) and (2); and\n       ``(ii) submits any written application required by the \n     employer for the leave not later than 5 working days after \n     providing the notice to the employer; and\n       ``(B) in the case of unforeseeable leave, the employee--\n       ``(i) notifies the employer orally of the need for the \n     leave--\n\n       ``(I) not later than the date the leave commences; or\n       ``(II) during such additional period as may be necessary, \n     if the employer is physically or mentally incapable of \n     providing the notification; and\n\n       ``(ii) submits any written application required by the \n     employer for the leave--\n\n       ``(I) not later than 5 working days after providing the \n     notice to the employer; or\n       ``(II) during such additional period as may be necessary, \n     if the employee is physically or mentally incapable of \n     submitting the application.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE.\n\n       Section 102(d)(2) (29 U.S.C. 2612(d)(2)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) Paid absence.--Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and \n     (B), with respect to leave provided under subsection \n     (a)(1)(D), if an employer provides a paid absence under the \n     employer's collective bargaining agreement, an employee \n     welfare benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), or under any \n     other sick leave, sick pay, or disability plan, program, or \n     policy of the employer, the employer may require the employee \n     to choose between the paid absence and unpaid leave provided \n     under this title.''.\n\n     SEC. 7.

A bill to provide for the establishment of a scientific basis \nfor new firefighting technology standards, improve coordination among \nFederal, State, and local fire officials in training for and responding \nto terrorist attacks and other national emergencies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nHollings, Biden, DeWine, and Cantwell in introducing the Firefighting \nResearch and Coordination Act. This legislation would provide for the \nestablishment of a scientific basis for new firefighting technology \nstandards; improved coordination between Federal, State, and local fire \nofficials in training and response to a terrorist attack or a national \nemergency; and authorize the National Fire Academy to offer training to \nimprove the ability of firefighters to respond to events such as the \ntragedy of September 11, 2001. Representatives Camp, Deutsch, Israel, \nEtheridge, and Weldon are introducing companion legislation. Similar \nlegislation was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee last \nSeptember.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to act upon some of the lessons \nlearned from the tragic terrorist attacks, and also address other \nproblems faced by the fire services. On September 11, the New York City \nfirefighters and emergency service personnel acted with great heroism \nin selflessly rushing to the World Trade Center and saving the lives of \nmany Americans. Tragically, 343 firefighters and EMS technicians paid \nthe ultimate price in the service of their country.\n  While we strive to prevent any future attack in the United States, it \nis our duty to ensure that we are adequately prepared to respond to any \nfuture catastrophic act of terrorism. In addition,\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\nwe must recognize that many of the preparations we make to improve the \nresponse to national emergencies also will aid our firefighters for \ntheir everyday role in protecting our families and homes.\n  Today's firefighters use a variety of technologies including thermal \nimaging equipment, devices for locating firefighters and victims, and \nstate-of-the-art protective suits to fight fires, clean up chemical or \nhazardous waste spills, and contend with potential terrorist devices. \nThe Federal Government's Firefighter Investment and Response \nEnhancement, FIRE, program is authorized for $900 million for Fiscal \nYear 2004 to assist local fire departments in purchasing this high-tech \nequipment. It is important that the American taxpayers' money is used \nto buy equipment that will effectively protect our local communities \nand the responders.\n  Unfortunately, there are no uniform technical standards for new \nequipment used in combating fires. Without such standards, local fire \ncompanies may purchase equipment that does not satisfy their needs, or \neven purchase faulty equipment. A January 2003 Consumer Reports article \nstates that much of the emergency equipment sold today is not tested or \ncertified by the government or independent labs. The article states \nthat ``the confusion will get worse, emergency departments say, as new \nequipment floods the market in response to increased government \nfunding.'' The lives of professional and volunteer emergency personnel, \nand the citizens they protect, are at risk from untested equipment.\n  This bill seeks to address the need for new equipment standards by \nestablishing a scientific basis for voluntary consensus standards. It \nwould authorize the U.S. Fire Administrator to work with the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, the Inter-Agency Board for \nEquipment Standardization and Inter-Operability, other federal, state, \nand local agencies, national voluntary consensus standards development \norganizations, and other interested parties to establish measurement \ntechniques and testing methodologies for new firefighting equipment. \nThese new techniques and methodologies will act as a scientific basis \nfor the development of voluntary consensus standards. This bill would \nallow the federal government to work with the private sector in \ndeveloping the basic uniform performance criteria and technical \nstandards to ensure the effectiveness and compatibility of these new \ntechnologies. The bill would authorize $2.2 million in Fiscal Year 2004 \nfor these efforts.\n  As my colleagues know, many issues regarding coordination surfaced on \nSeptember 11. Titan Systems Corporation recently issued an after-action \nreport, on behalf of the fire department of Arlington County, VA, which \nhighlighted problems between the coordination of Washington D.C., and \nArlington County fire departments. The report cited the confusion \ncaused by a large influx of self-dispatched volunteers, and increased \nrisk faced by the ``bonafide responders.'' These conclusions are \nconsistent with an article by the current U.S. Fire Administrator, R. \nDavid Paulison, in the June 1993 issue of Fire Chief magazine, where he \ndescribed being overwhelmed by the number of uncoordinated volunteer \nefforts that poured into Florida after Hurricane Andrew. Additionally, \nmany fire officials and the General Accounting Office, GAO, have \nhighlighted the duplicative nature of many Federal programs and the \nneed for better coordination between Federal, State, and local \nofficials.\n  The bill seeks to address these problems by directing the U.S. Fire \nAdministrator to provide technical assistance and training for state \nand local fire service officials to establish nationwide and state \nmutual aid systems for responding to national emergencies. These mutual \naid plans would include collection of accurate asset and resource \ninformation to ensure that local fire services could work together to \ndeploy equipment and personnel effectively during an emergency. The \nbill also would direct the U.S. Fire Administrator to report on the \nneed for a strategy for deploying volunteers, including the use of a \nnational credentialing system. This legislation also would authorize \nthe Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to update the \nFederal Response Plan to incorporate plans for responding to terrorist \nattacks, especially events in urban areas. This update would include \nfire detection, suppression, and related emergency services.\n  The bill would improve the training of State and local firefighters. \nIt would authorize the National Fire Academy to offer courses in \nbuilding collapse rescue; the use of technology in response to fires \ncaused by terrorist attacks and other national emergencies; leadership \nand strategic skills including integrated management systems \noperations; deployment of new technology for fighting forest and wild \nfires; fighting fires at ports; and other courses related to tactics \nand strategies for responding to terrorist incidents and other fire \nservices' needs.\n  Finally, this bill would also direct the U.S. Fire Administrator to \ncoordinate the National Fire Academy's training programs with the \nAttorney General, Secretary of Health and Human Services and other \nfederal agencies to prevent and eliminate the duplication in training \nprograms that has been identified by the GAO.\n  In 2001, we were caught unprepared and paid a terrible price as a \nresult. While we will never be able to prevent firefighter deaths \nbecause of the risks involved, it is our obligation to help ensure that \nfuture firefighters are adequately equipped and trained, and are \nworking in coordination to respond to any future national emergencies.\n  I am pleased to announce that this legislation is supported by the \nNational Volunteer Fire Council; the Congressional Fire Services \nInstitute; the National Fire Protection Association; the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs; the International Association of Fire \nFighters; the International Association of Arson Investigators; \nInternational Society of Fire Service Instructors; North American Fire \nTraining Directors and the International Fire Service Training \nAssociation. I ask unanimous consent that the letter of endorsement be \nprinted in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 321\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Firefighting Research and \n     Coordination Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

This legislation \n     would provide for the establishment of a scientific basis for \n     new firefighting technology standards; improved coordination \n     between Federal, state, and local fire officials in training \n     and response to a terrorist attack or a national emergency; \n     and authorize the National Fire Academy to offer training to \n     improve the ability of firefighters to respond to events such \n     as the tragedy of September 11, 2001. Representatives Camp, \n     Deutsch, Israel, Etheridge and Weldon are introducing \n     companion legislation. Similar legislation was approved by \n     the Senate Commerce Committee last September.\n       The purpose of this legislation is to act upon some of the \n     lessons learned from the tragic terrorist attacks, and also \n     address other problems faced by the fire services. On \n     September 11, the New York City firefighters and emergency \n     service personnel acted with great heroism in selflessly \n     rushing to the World Trade Center and saving the lives of \n     many Americans. Tragically, 343 firefighters and EMS \n     technicians paid the ultimate price in the service of their \n     country.\n       While we strive to prevent any future attack in the United \n     States, it is our duty to ensure that we are adequately \n     prepared to respond to any future catastrophic act of \n     terrorism. In addition, we must recognize that many of the \n     preparations we make to improve the response to national \n     emergencies also will aid our firefighters for their everyday \n     role in protecting our families and homes.\n       Today's firefighters use a variety of technologies \n     including thermal imaging equipment, devices for locating \n     firefighters and victims, and state-of-the-art protective \n     suits to fight fires, clean up chemical or hazardous waste \n     spills, and contend with potential terrorist devices. The \n     federal government's Firefighter Investment and Response \n     Enhancement (FIRE) program is authorized for $900 million for \n     Fiscal Year 2004 to assist local fire departments in \n     purchasing this high-tech equipment. It is important that the \n     American taxpayers' money is used to buy equipment that will \n     effectively protect our local communities and the responders.\n       Unfortunately, there are no uniform technical standards for \n     new equipment used in combating fires. Without such \n     standards, local fire companies may purchase equipment that \n     does not satisfy their needs, or even purchase faulty \n     equipment. A January 2003 Consumer Reports article states \n     that much of the emergency equipment sold today is not tested \n     or certified by the government or independent labs. The \n     article states that ``the confusion will get worse, \n     emergency departments say, as new equipment floods the \n     market in response to increase government funding.'' The \n     lives of professional and volunteer emergency personnel--\n     and the citizens they protect--are at risk from untested \n     equipment.\n       This bill seeks to address the need for new equipment \n     standards by establishing a scientific basis for voluntary \n     consensus standards. It would authorize the U.S. Fire \n     Administrator to work with the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology, the Inter-Agency Board for \n     Equipment Standardization and Inter-Operability, other \n     federal, state, and local agencies, national voluntary \n     consensus standards development organizations, and other \n     interested parties to establish measurement techniques and \n     testing methodologies for new firefighting equipment. These \n     new techniques and methodologies will act as a scientific \n     basis for the development of voluntary consensus standards. \n     This bill would allow the federal government to work with the \n     private sector in developing the basic uniform performance \n     criteria and technical standards to ensure the effectiveness \n     and compatibility of these new technologies. The bill would \n     authorize $2.2 million in Fiscal Year 2004 for these efforts.\n       As my colleagues know, many issues regarding coordination \n     surfaced on September 11. Titan Systems Corporation recently \n     issued an after-action report, on behalf of the fire \n     department of Arlington County, Virginia, which highlighted \n     problems between the coordination of Washington D.C., and \n     Arlington County fire departments. The report cited the \n     confusion caused by a large influx of self-dispatched \n     volunteers, and increased risk faced by the ``bonafide \n     responders.'' These conclusions are consistent with an \n     article by the current U.S. Fire Administrator, R. David \n     Paulison, in the June 1993 issue of Fire Chief magazine, \n     where he described being overwhelmed by the number of \n     uncoordinated volunteer efforts that poured into Florida \n     after Hurricane Andrew. Additionally, many fire officials and \n     the General Accounting Office (GAO) have highlighted the \n     duplicative nature of many Federal programs and the need for \n     better coordination between federal, state, and local \n     officials.\n       The bill seeks to address these problems by directing the \n     U.S. Fire Administrator to provide technical assistance and \n     training for state and local fire service officials to \n     establish nationwide and state mutual aid systems for \n     responding to national emergencies. These mutual aid plans \n     would include collection of accurate asset and resource \n     information to ensure that local fire services could work \n     together to deploy equipment and personnel effectively during \n     an emergency. The bill also would direct the U.S. Fire \n     Administrator to report on the need for a strategy for \n     deploying volunteers, including the use of a national \n     credentialing system. This legislation also would authorize \n     the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to \n     update the Federal Response Plan to incorporate plans for \n     responding to terrorist\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\n     attacks, especially events in urban areas. This update would \n     include fire detection, suppression, and related emergency \n     services.\n       The bill would improve the training of state and local \n     firefighters. It would authorize the National Fire Academy to \n     offer courses in building collapse rescue; the use of \n     technology in response to fires caused by terrorist attacks \n     and other national emergencies; leadership and strategic \n     skills including integrated management systems operations; \n     deployment of new technology for fighting forest and wild \n     fires; fighting fires at ports; and other courses related to \n     tactics and strategies for responding to terrorist incidents \n     and other fire services' needs.\n       Finally, this bill would also direct the U.S. Fire \n     Administrator to coordinate the National Fire Academy's \n     training programs with the Attorney General, Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services and other federal agencies to \n     prevent and eliminate the duplication in training programs \n     that has been identified by the GAO.\n       In 2001, we were caught unprepared and paid a terrible \n     price as a result. While we will never be able to prevent \n     firefighter deaths because of the risks involved, it is our \n     obligation to help ensure that future firefighters are \n     adequately equipped and trained, and are working in \n     coordination to respond to any future national emergencies.\n       Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that this \n     legislation is supported by the National Volunteer Fire \n     Council; the Congressional Fire Services Institute; the \n     National Fire Protection Association; the International \n     Association of Fire Chiefs; the International Association of \n     Fire Fighters; the International Association of Arson \n     Investigators; International Society of Fire Service \n     Instructors; North American Fire Training Directors and the \n     International Fire Service Training Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 31, 2003.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The tragic events of September 11th \n     certainly underscored the important need for additional \n     training and advanced technologies for our nation's fire and \n     emergency services. They are equal components in our efforts \n     to prepare our nation for future large-scale emergencies that \n     require rapid deployment of local first responders.\n       In the area of technology, we have witnessed an emergence \n     of new technologies designed to improve our level of \n     readiness to future terrorist events and other large-scale \n     disasters. Many of these new technologies have the potential \n     to improve the capabilities of our first responders, however \n     we must ensure that these technologies serve their intended \n     purpose and protect our firefighters and emergency medical \n     personnel. What's most important is to ensure local response \n     agencies quick access to new technologies while guaranteeing \n     that they meet minimum safety standards.\n       We extend our appreciation for your interest in this matter \n     and for introducing the Firefighter Research and Coordination \n     Act. We support this legislation as a crucial step towards \n     developing and deploying advanced technologies our nation's \n     first responders need in this period of heightened risk and \n     security.\n       The legislation directs certain federal agencies and other \n     interested parties, including the National Fire Protection \n     Association, to develop a scientific basis for the private \n     sector development of standards for new fire fighting \n     technology. Your legislation will not undermine or duplicate \n     the standards-making process that has served the fire service \n     for over a hundred years, but rather strengthen it in areas \n     of new technologies necessitated by the events of September \n     11th.\n       We also support the other sections of your legislation \n     calling for coordination of response to national emergencies \n     and for increased training. These are critical to the \n     effective deployment and safety of first responders at major \n     incidents. By calling upon the United States Fire \n     Administration to provide technical assistance and training \n     to state and local jurisdictions in developing state, \n     regional and national mutual aide agreements, the legislation \n     addresses the appropriate role for USFA in this process. In \n     addition, we certainly support authorizing the National Fire \n     Academy more latitude in the types of terrorism training \n     programs it conducts for our nation's first responders. And \n     lastly, we express our full support for authorizing USFA to \n     address the issue of a national credentialing system. It is \n     imperative that we establish the most effective credentialing \n     process to improve the accountability of firefighter skill \n     levels at major events.\n       We look forward to working with you in advancing this \n     legislation through Congress. Again, we thank you for your \n     continued support.\n           Sincerely,\n         Congressional Fire Services Institute, International \n           Association of Arson Investigators, International \n           Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association \n           of Fire Fighters, International Fire Service Training \n           Association, International Society of Fire Service \n           Instructors, National Fire Protection Association, \n           National Volunteer Fire Council, North American Fire \n           Training Directors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 322. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \ncertain sightseeing flights from taxes on air transportation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt certain sightseeing \nflights from the air transportation excise tax. A clarifying amendment \nto the tax code is needed due to a problem that exists in the \napplication of the excise tax.\n  In 1986, the Internal Revenue Services, IRS, issued a Private Letter \nRuling in which it exempted one Hawaii-based air tour operator from \npaying the air passenger transportation excise tax, but has not applied \nequal treatment to other similarly situated aerial sightseeing tour \noperators. It is my belief that the IRS should be consistent in its \napplication of this excise tax.\n  Under current law, a variety of excise taxes on air transportation \nare imposed to finance the Airport and Airway Trust Funds program that \nis administered by the Federal Aviation Administration. For example, an \nair passenger transportation excise tax is imposed on users of our \nnation's airports and airways. The Congress intended that the tax be \nlevied on passengers traveling on scheduled commercial airlines. In \naddition, for the most part, the tax is imposed on each flight segment.\n  The Congress did not intend to have the tax applied to air tour \noperators, who utilize our system of airways differently. Our national \ntransportation system receives little or no benefit from aerial \nsightseeing operations. Air tour operations are not scheduled \ncommercial airlines. They are for entertainment purposes and are \ncircular, in that they begin and end at the same destination point.\n  Hawaii is among a small handful of States where our citizens can \nenjoy aerial tours of sights that are remote or difficult to reach by \nland. Aerial sightseeing tours are also enjoyed in Alaska, California, \nWashington, Arizona, and even New York City. The imposition of the air \ntransportation excise tax on aerial sightseeing flights will \nsignificantly raise the consumer price on air tours. Doing so will \ncause many small aerial sightseeing tour operators, especially in my \nhome state, to lose customers. Many of these small companies have \nstruggled to stay in business after incurring significant losses in the \nmonths following September 11, 2001, when our government imposed flight \nrestrictions across the nation. Those flight restrictions prevented \nmany flight operations in all segments of the general aviation industry \nfor many months into early 2002.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support my bill, which would \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt certain sightseeing \ntrips from the air transportation excise tax. Under my bill, air tour \noperations would still be subject to the aviation fuel excise tax.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 322\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN SIGHTSEEING FLIGHTS EXEMPT FROM TAXES ON \n                   AIR TRANSPORTATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 4281 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to small aircraft on nonestablished lines) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new sentence: \n     ``For purposes of this section, an aircraft shall not be \n     considered as operated on an established line if such \n     aircraft is operated on a flight the sole purpose of which is \n     sightseeing.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to transportation beginning on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, but shall not \n     apply to any amount paid before such date.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise, along with Senator Breaux \nto introduce a bill to establish the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area \nin Louisiana. This legislation has particularly special meaning to \nthose of us from Louisiana because of the importance of the cultural \nand natural resources of the Atchafalaya region to the Nation.\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\n  This legislation, reported by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and unanimously passed by the full Senate during the 107th \nCongress, would establish a framework to help protect, conserve, and \npromote these unique natural, cultural, historical, and recreational \nresources of the region.\n  Specifically, the legislation would establish a National Heritage \nArea in Louisiana that encompasses thirteen parishes in and around the \nAtchafalaya Basin swamp, America's largest river swamp. The heritage \narea in south-central Louisiana stretches from Concordia parish to the \nnorth, where the Mississippi River begins to partially flow into the \nAtchafalaya River, all the way to the Gulf of Mexico in the south. The \nthirteen parishes are: St. Mary, Iberia, St. Martin, St. Landry, \nAvoyelles, Pointe Coupee, Iberville, Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafayette, \nWest Baton Rouge, Concordia, and East Baton Rouge. This boundary is the \nsame area covered by the existing Atchafalaya Trace State Heritage \nArea.\n  This measure will appoint the existing Atchafalaya Trace Commission \nas the federally recognized ``local coordinating entity.'' The \ncommission is composed of thirteen members with one representative \nappointed by each parish in the heritage area. Both the Atchafalaya \nTrace Commission and the Atchafalaya Trace State Heritage Area were \ncreated by the Louisiana Legislature a number of years ago. The \nAtchafalaya Trace State Heritage Area program currently receives some \nState funding, and already has staff working at the Louisiana \nDepartment of Culture, Recreation & Tourism, DCRT, under Lieutenant \nGovernor Kathleen Blanco. State funds were used to create the \nmanagement plan for the heritage area, which followed ``feasibility \nanalysis'' guidelines as recommended by the National Park Service. \nTherefore, the recently-completed management plan need only be \nsubmitted to the Secretary of the Interior for approval as this \nlegislation would recognize an existing local coordinating entity that \nwill oversee the implementation of this plan. We are very proud that \nthis state heritage area has already completed the complicated planning \nprocess, with participation of local National Park Service \nrepresentatives, while using a standard of planning quality equal to \nthat of existing national heritage areas. All at no cost to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Please let me also emphasize that this legislation protects existing \nprivate property rights. It will not interfere with local land use \nordinances or regulations, as it is specifically prohibited from doing \nso. Nor does this legislation grant any powers of real property \nacquisition to the local coordinating entity or heritage area program. \nIn addition, the legislation does not impose any environmental rule or \nprocess or cause any change in Federal environmental quality standards \ndifferent from those already in effect.\n  Heritage areas are based on cooperation and collaboration at all \nlevels. This legislation remains true to the core concept behind \nheritage areas. The heritage area concept has been used successfully in \nvarious parts of our Nation to promote historic preservation, natural \nand cultural resource protection, heritage tourism and sustainable \neconomic revitalization for both urban and rural areas. Heritage areas \nprovide a flexible framework for government agencies, private \norganizations and businesses and landowners to work together on a \ncoordinated regional basis. The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area will \njoin the Cane River National Heritage Area to become the second \nNational Heritage Area in Louisiana, ultimately joining the 23 existing \nNational Heritage Areas around the Nation.\n  The initiative to develop the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area is \nan outgrowth of a grassroots effort to achieve multiple goals of this \nregion. Most important among these is providing opportunities for the \nfuture, while at the same time not losing anything that makes this \nplace so special. Residents from all over the region, local tourism \nagencies, State agencies such as the DCRT and the Department of Natural \nResources, the State legislature, Federal agencies including the \nNational Park Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, parish \ngovernments, conservation and preservation groups, local businesses and \nlocal landowners have all participated in this endeavor to make it the \nstrong initiative it is today. These groups have been very supportive \nof the heritage area effort, and as time moves on, the heritage area \nwill continue to involve more and more of the area's most important \nresource, its people.\n  I would also like to give you a brief overview of the resources that \nmake this place significant to the entire country. Not only is it \nimportant to our Nation's history, but it is also critical to \nunderstanding America's future. The name of the place itself, \nAtchafalaya, comes from the American Indians and means ``long river.'' \nThis name signifies the first settlers of the region, descendants of \nwhom still live there today.\n  Other words come to mind in describing the Atchafalaya: mysterious, \ndynamic, multi-cultural, enchanting, bountiful, threatened and \nundiscovered. This region is one of the most complex and least \nunderstood places in Louisiana and the Nation. Yet, the stories of the \nAtchafalaya Heritage Area are emblematic of the broader American \nexperience. Here there are opportunities to understand and witness the \ncomplicated, sometimes harmonious, sometimes adversarial interplay \nbetween nature and culture. The history of the United States has \nbeen shaped by the complex dance of its people working with, against, \nand for, nature. Within the Atchafalaya a penchant for adventure, \nadaptation, ingenuity, and exploitation has created a cultural legacy \nunlike anywhere else in the world.\n\n  The heart of the heritage area is the Atchafalaya Basin. It is the \nlargest river swamp in the United States, larger than the more widely \nknown Everglades or Okefenokee Swamp. The Atchafalaya is characterized \nby a maze of streams, and at one time was thickly forested with old-\ngrowth cypress and tupelo trees. The Basin provides outstanding habitat \nfor a remarkably diverse array of wildlife, including the endangered \nAmerican bald eagle and Louisiana black bear. The region's unique \necology teems with life. More than 85 species of fish; crustaceans, \nsuch as crawfish; wildlife, including alligators; an astonishing array \nof well over 200 species of birds, from waterfowl to songbirds; forest-\ndwelling mammals such as deer, squirrel, beaver and other commercially \nimportant furbearers all make their home here. Bottomland hardwood-\ndependent bird species breed here in some of the highest densities ever \nrecorded in annual North American Breeding Bird Surveys. The Basin also \nforms part of the Mississippi Valley Flyway for migratory waterfowl and \nis a major wintering ground for thousands of these geese and ducks. In \ngeneral, the Atchafalaya Basin has a significant proportion of North \nAmerica's breeding wading birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises, and \nspoonbills. Some of the largest flocks of Wood Storks in North America \nsummer here, and the southern part of the Basin has a healthy \npopulation of Bald Eagles nesting every winter.\n  The region's dynamic system of waterways, geology, and massive \nearthen guide levees reveals a landscape that is at once fragile and \nawesome. The geology and natural systems of the Atchafalaya Heritage \nArea have fueled the economy of the region for centuries. For decades \nthe harvest of cypress, cotton, sugar cane, crawfish, salt, oil, gas, \nand Spanish moss, have been important sources of income for the \nregion's residents. The crawfish industry has been particularly \nimportant to the lives of Atchafalaya residents and Louisiana has \nbecome the largest crawfish producer in the United States. Sport \nfishing and other forms of commercial fishing are important here, too, \nbut unfortunately, natural resource extraction and a changing \nenvironment have drastically depleted many of these resources and \nforced residents to find new ways to make a living.\n  Over the past century, the Atchafalaya Basin has become a study of \nman's monumental effort to control nature. After the catastrophic \nMississippi River flood of 1927 left thousands dead and millions \ndisplaced, the U.S. Congress decreed that the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers should develop an intricate system of levees to\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\nprotect human settlements, particularly New Orleans. Today, the \nMississippi River is caged within the walls of earthen and concrete \nlevees and manipulated with a complex system of locks, barrages and \nfloodgates. The Atchafalaya River runs parallel to the Mississippi and \nthrough the center of the Basin. In times of flooding the river basin \nserves as the key floodway in controlling floodwaters headed for the \nlarge population centers of Baton Rouge and New Orleans by diverting \nwater from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. This system was \nsorely tested in 1973 when floodwaters threatened to break through the \nfloodgates and permanently divert the Mississippi River into the \nAtchafalaya. However, after this massive flood event, new land started \nforming off the coast. These new land formations make up the \nAtchafalaya Delta, and is the only significant area of new land being \nbuilt in the United States. These vast amounts of Mississippi River \nsediment are also rapidly filling in the Basin itself, raising the \nlevel of land in certain areas of the basin and filling in lakes and \nwaterways. And to demonstrate just how complex this ecosystem is, one \nonly needs to realize that just to the East of the Delta, Terrebonne \nparish, also in the heritage area, is experiencing some of the most \nsignificant coastal land loss in the country.\n  Over the centuries, the ever-changing natural environment has shaped \nthe lives of the people living in the Basin. Residents have profited \nfrom and been imperiled by nature. The popular cultural identity of the \nregion is strongly associated with the Cajuns, descendants of the \nFrench-speaking Acadians who settled in south Louisiana after being \ndeported by the British from Nova Scotia, formerly known as Acadia. \nTwenty-five hundred to three thousand exiled Acadians repatriated in \nLouisiana where they proceeded to re-establish their former society. \nToday, in spite of complex social, cultural, and demographic \ntransformations, Cajuns maintain a sense of group identity and continue \nto display a distinctive set of cultural expressions nearly two-\nhundred-and-fifty years after their exile from Acadia. Cajun culture \nhas become increasingly popular outside of Louisiana. Culinary \nspecialties adapted from France and Acadia such as etouffee, boudin, \nandouille, crepes, beignets and sauces thickened with roux, delight \nfood lovers well beyond Louisiana's borders. Cajun music has also \n``gone mainstream'' with its blend of French folk songs and ballads and \ninstrumental dance music, and more recently popular country, rhythm-\nand-blues, and rock music influences. While the growing interest in \nCajun culture has raised appreciation for its unique traditions, many \nof the region's residents are concerned about the growing \ncommercialization and stereotyping that threatens to diminish the \nauthentic Cajun ways of life.\n  While the Atchafalaya Heritage Area may be well known for its Cajun \nculture, there is an astonishing array of other cultures within these \nparishes. Outside of New Orleans, the Atchafalaya Heritage Area is the \nmost racially and ethnically complex region of Louisiana, and has been \nso for many years. A long legacy of multiculturalism presents \ninteresting opportunities to examine how so many distinct cultures have \nsurvived in relative harmony. There may be interesting lessons to learn \nfrom here as our Nation becomes increasingly heterogeneous. The \ncultural complexity of this region has created a rich tapestry of \nhistory and traditions, evidenced by the architecture, music, language, \nfood and festivals unlike any place else. Ethnic groups of the \nAtchafalaya include: African-Americans, Black Creoles, Asians, Chinese, \nFilipinos, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Cajuns, Spanish Islenos, Italians, \nScotch-Irish, and American Indian tribes such as the Attakapa, \nChitimacha, Coushatta, Houma, Opelousa and Tunica-Biloxi.\n  This heritage area has a wealth of existing cultural, historic, \nnatural, scenic, recreational and visitor resources on which to build. \nScenic resources include numerous State Wildlife Management Areas and \nNational Wildlife Refuges, as well as ten designated state scenic \nbyways that fall partially or entirely within the heritage area. The \nOffice of State Parks operates three historic sites in the heritage \narea, and numerous historic districts and buildings can be found in the \nregion. There are also nine Main Street communities in the heritage \narea. Outdoor recreational resources include two State Parks and a \nmultitude of waterways and bayous. Hunting, fishing, boating, and \ncanoeing, and more recently birdwatching and cycling, are popular ways \nto experience the region. Various visitor attractions, interpretive \ncenters and visitor information centers exist to help residents and \ntourists alike better understand and navigate many of the resources in \nthe heritage area. Major roads link the heritage area's central visitor \nentrance points and large population centers, especially New Orleans. \nMuch of the hospitality industry servicing the Atchafalaya exists \naround the larger cities of Baton Rouge, Lafayette and Houma. However, \nmore and more bed and breakfasts and heritage accommodations, such as \nhouseboat rentals, are becoming more numerous in the smaller towns and \nrural areas.\n  These are just some of the examples of the richness and significance \nof this region. This legislation will assist communities throughout \nthis heritage area who are committed to the conservation and \nappropriate development of these assets. Furthermore, this legislation \nwill bring a level of prestige and national and international \nrecognition that this most special of places certainly deserves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 323.

Res. 46\n\n       Whereas the Civilian Conservation Corps, commonly known as \n     the CCC, was an independent Federal agency that deserves \n     recognition for its lasting contribution to natural resources \n     conservation and infrastructure improvements on public lands \n     in the United States and for its outstanding success in \n     providing employment and training to thousands of Americans;\n       Whereas March 31, 2003, is the 70th anniversary of the \n     signing by President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the law \n     historically known as the Emergency Conservation Work Act, a \n     precursor to the 1937 law that established the Civilian \n     Conservation Corps;\n       Whereas, between 1933 and 1942, the CCC provided employment \n     and vocational training in the conservation and development \n     of natural resources, the protection of forests, and the \n     construction and maintenance of military reservations to more \n     than 3,000,000 men, including unemployed youths, more than \n     250,000 veterans of the Spanish-American War and World War I, \n     and more than 80,000 Native Americans;\n       Whereas the CCC coordinated a mobilization of men, \n     material, and transportation on a scale never previously \n     known in time of peace;\n       Whereas the CCC managed more than 4,500 camps in each of \n     the then 48 States and Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the \n     Virgin Islands;\n       Whereas the CCC left a legacy of natural resources and \n     infrastructure improvements that included 3,000,000,000 new \n     trees, 46,854 bridges, 3,980 restored historical structures, \n     more than 800 state parks, 3,462 improved beaches, 405,037 \n     signs, markers, and monuments, 8,045 wells and pump houses, \n     and 63,256 other structures;\n       Whereas the benefits of many CCC projects are still enjoyed \n     by Americans today in national and state parks, forests, and \n     other lands, including the National Arboretum in the District \n     of Columbia, Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico, Great \n     Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and \n     Tennessee, Yosemite National Park in California, Acadia \n     National Park in Maine, Rocky Mountain National Park in \n     Colorado, and Vicksburg National Military Park in \n     Mississippi;\n       Whereas the CCC provided a foundation of self-confidence, \n     responsibility, discipline, cooperation, communication, and \n     leadership for its participants through education, training, \n     and hard work, and participants made many lasting friendships \n     in the CCC;\n       Whereas the CCC demonstrated the commitment of the United \n     States to the conservation of land, water, and natural \n     resources on a national level and to leadership in the world \n     on public conservation efforts; and\n       Whereas the conservation of the Nation's land, water, and \n     natural resources is still an important goal of the American \n     people: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate requests the President to issue a \n     proclamation--\n       (1) designating March 31, 2003, as ``National Civilian \n     Conservation Corps Day''; and\n       (2) calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution \ntoday with Senators Bond, Lugar, DeWine, Feinstein, and Kennedy, \ndesignating March 31, 2003 as ``National Civilian Conservation Corps \nDay''. This day will mark the 70th anniversary of the signing of the \nAct that created the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC.\n  In 1933, with our country in the grip of the Depression, President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt created the CCC to provide work and training for \nthe many young men who so needed it, and to achieve the goal of \nprotecting our Nation's precious natural resources. The program \ncontinued until 1942, when resources were shifted to support efforts in \nWorld War II and an estimated 75 percent of ex-CCCers joined the \nmilitary.\n  The accomplishments of the CCC between 1933 and 1942 are amazing by \nany standard. The program put over 3 million young men to work on \nnatural resources conservation and public lands infrastructure \nimprovements in camps in every State and the then-territories of Alaska \nand Hawaii, planting more than 3 billion trees, and developing more \nthan 800 State parks.\n  As importantly, the lives of these young men were often dramatically \nchanged for the better by their enrollment. Many traveled for the first \ntime, learned new trades, and developed self-confidence and discipline, \nwhile sending much-needed money home. Thousands of alumni remain active \nin 167 local chapters of the National Association of Civilian \nConservation Corps Alumni Association, including the Roadrunner Chapter \nin my home State. They still meet and share the bonds of friendship and \nhard work they forged during their time in the CCC.\n  This resolution would pay tribute to the lasting contribution of the \nCCC to natural resources conservation and infrastructure improvements, \nand to its outstanding success in providing employment and training to \nmillions of Americans. I was pleased that the Senate commemorated the \n69th anniversary of the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps \nlast year, and I hope the Senate will again honor the CCC on its 70th \nanniversary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 47--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                  AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 48\n\n       Whereas the percentage of income used for household debt \n     payments, including mortgages, credit cards, and student \n     loans, rose to the highest level in more than a decade in \n     2001 and remained at 14 percent in 2002;\n       Whereas consumer bankruptcies in 2001 increased 19 percent \n     over those in the previous year, exceeding the previous high \n     reached in 1998, and the rate of filings did not slacken \n     during the first 9 months of 2002;\n       Whereas personal savings as a percentage of Gross Domestic \n     Product decreased from 7.5 percent in the early 1980s to 2.4 \n     percent in 2002;\n       Whereas approximately 40,000,000 Americans, the \n     ``unbanked'', are not using mainstream, insured financial \n     institutions;\n       Whereas home foreclosures in 2002 reached the highest rate \n     in 30 years;\n       Whereas 55 percent of college students acquire their first \n     credit card during their first year in college, and 83 \n     percent of college students have at least 1 credit card;\n       Whereas 45 percent of college students are in credit card \n     debt, with the average debt being $3,066;\n       Whereas only 26 percent of 13- to 21-year-olds reported \n     that their parents actively taught them how to manage money;\n       Whereas a 2002 study by the Jump$tart Coalition for \n     Personal Financial Literacy found that high school seniors \n     know even less about credit cards, retirement funds, \n     insurance, and other personal finance basics than seniors did \n     5 years ago;\n       Whereas a 2002 survey by the National Council on Economic \n     Education found that a decreasing number of States include \n     personal finance in their education standards for students in \n     grades K-12;\n       Whereas a greater understanding and familiarity with \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth;\n       Whereas financial literacy empowers individuals to make \n     wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion of an \n     increasingly complex economy;\n       Whereas personal financial management skills and long-lived \n     habits develop during childhood;\n       Whereas personal financial education is essential to ensure \n     that our youth are prepared to manage money, credit, and \n     debt, and become responsible workers, heads of households, \n     investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and citizens; and\n       Whereas the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial \n     Literacy, its State affiliates, and its partner organizations \n     have designated each April as ``Financial Literacy for Youth \n     Month'', the goal of which is to educate the public about the \n     need for increased financial literacy for youth in America: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2003 as ``Financial Literacy for Youth \n     Month'' to raise public awareness about the need for \n     increased financial literacy in our schools and the serious \n     problems that may be associated with a lack of understanding \n     about personal finances; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, \n     and the people of the United States to observe the month with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Cochran, Corzine, Johnson, Sarbanes, Schumer, and \nStabenow, a resolution designating April of this year as Financial \nLiteracy for Youth Month. This resolution seeks to honor the many \nactivities that take place across the country every April, which \nrecognize the importance of increased financial and economic literacy \nfor all Americans, particularly our children.\n  As detailed in the resolution, more Americans are using a greater \nproportion of their income to pay down their debt. In 2002, home \nforeclosures were the highest rate in 30 years. Consumer bankruptcies \nin 2001 reached an all-time high in more than a decade, and filings did \nnot slacken in 2002. Personal savings as a percentage of GDP have \ndecreased from 7.5 percent in the early '80s to 2.4 percent last year. \nUnfortunately, the modern economy is extremely complex and many parents \nare often unable to teach their children about money management. \nAccording to the Jump$tart Coalition, only 26 percent of 13- to 21-\nyear-olds reported that their parents actively taught them how to \nmanage money.\n  As noted by the Treasury Department, nearly 40 million Americans are \n``unbanked,'' which means that they do not have a formal relationship \nwith a mainstream financial institution. The unbanked are unable to \ntake advantage of saving and borrowing opportunities offered by banks \nand credit unions. Unbanked individuals are susceptible to being taken \nadvantage of by check cashers, payday lenders, and refund anticipation \nloan providers. Personal financial education can empower the unbanked \nto participate in and benefit from services of mainstream financial \nservice providers.\n  While various financial institutions, non-profit organizations, and \nconsumer groups are trying to educate Americans about their finances, \nwe are still not doing enough. I was disturbed to see the results of a \n2002 study by the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy \nshowing that high school seniors knew even less about credit cards, \nretirement funds, insurance, and other personal finance fundamentals, \nthan did seniors five years ago. Perhaps this is why almost half of \ncollege students with credit cards have been assessed fees for late \npayment. In addition, the 2000 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study \nreported that nearly three-quarters of the college students owned a \ncredit card in their own name. Of these students, 45\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\npercent carried a credit card debt balance of $3,066. I was further \ntroubled to see a 2002 survey by the National Council on Economic \nEducation showing a decrease in the number of states that include \npersonal finance in their education standards for grades K- through-12. \nAt a time when we should be emphasizing the importance of financial \nliteracy, school-based efforts in this area are actually being de-\nemphasized.\n  This is why it is imperative for us to designate a month to serve as \nthe focus for increasing awareness about the need for financial \nliteracy. It is also important to encourage innovative, interactive, \nand quality events with long-lasting impact that will bring the point \nhome to our children about the importance of financial literacy. I \nwould like to commend those individuals, many of whom are members of \nthe Jump$tart Coalition, for the activities that they already sponsor \nto increase the level of financial literacy in our country.\n  For example, the American Bankers Association Education Foundation \nsponsors National Teach Children to Save Day, which involves thousands \nof bankers visiting classrooms nationwide to help students in K-\nthrough-12 with their ``financial ABC's.'' NASDAQ Stock Market \nEducational Foundation and the National Council on Economic Education \nrecognize 25 teachers for their innovative approaches to economic \neducation. Last year during Financial Literacy for Youth Month, Junior \nAchievement paired up with The Goldman Sachs Foundation to create \nInternet-driven instructional strategies and hands-on, interactive \ninstructional techniques to teach students and parents about everyday \npersonal financial decisions and investment strategies. Credit unions \nacross the nation have engaged in a variety of activities, including \nfinancial management classes and the distribution of literature, to \nincrease the financial literacy of youth and their parents. There are \nmany, many other activities that take place during this month, and I \ncongratulate organizations sponsoring them for keeping the needs of \nAmerica's youth close at heart. A strong show of support from this body \nand the Administration for Financial Literacy for Youth Month will go a \nlong way toward ensuring that our students will benefit from an \nincreased level of financial literacy through similar activities in \n2003.\n  Many parents fail to speak to their children about credit and debt \nmanagement or ways to live within limited resources, likely because \nthey did not receive education in these matters themselves. My \ncolleagues and I will work to address the myriad financial and economic \nliteracy needs of these individuals and families. However, we must \nemphasize the importance of helping those who are children now. Those \nwho are still going through their formative years of schooling. Those \nwho can learn and put into practice good personal financial management \nskills and lifelong habits that will stay with them, throughout their \nlives. Perhaps then, these students will grow into adults who will \navoid skyrocketing levels of debt, the pitfalls that could cause them \nto file bankruptcy, or being taken advantage of by unscrupulous or \nopportunistic lenders. Perhaps then, they will be able to pass along \nsimilar wisdom to their children at an even earlier age, and better \nequip their children with the tools necessary to become responsible \nworkers, heads of households, investors, entrepreneurs, business \nleaders, and citizens.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 49--DESIGNATING FEBRUARY 11, 2003, AS ``NATIONAL \n                            INVENTORS' DAY''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 49\n\n       Whereas the American people and the world have benefited \n     from the creations and discoveries of America's inventors; \n     and\n       Whereas the patents that protect those creations and \n     discoveries spur technological progress, improve the quality \n     of life, stimulate the economy, and create jobs for \n     Americans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the important role played by inventors in \n     promoting progress in the useful arts;\n       (2) recognizes the invaluable contribution of inventors to \n     the welfare of the people of the United States;\n       (3) designates February 11, 2003, as ``National Inventors' \n     Day''; and\n       (4) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     upon the people of the United States to celebrate such day \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today \nto submit a resolution to designate February 11, 2003, as ``National \nInventors' Day,'' together with my colleague, the Ranking Minority \nMember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy. The Ranking Minority \nMember and I have worked together on many issues related to \nintellectual property, and I am pleased to be joined by him in offering \nthis resolution designating the anniversary of perhaps America's \ngreatest inventor, Thomas Edison, as a day to honor all of America's \ninventors.\n  Doing so is particularly fitting this year. Exactly one hundred years \nago this year, on the shores of Kitty Hawk, NC, Orville and Wilbur \nWright achieved what mankind had dreamed of for centuries: the first \nheavier-than-air, machine-powered flight in the world. While that \nflight covered only 120 feet and lasted only 12 seconds, it launched a \nrevolution in air travel that continues to this day.\n  Throughout history, inventions have helped people discover new \nworlds, build communities, and cure sickness and disease. From the \nWright Brothers to Philo Farnsworth, from Thomas Edison to today's high \ntech entrepreneurs, America's inventors have immeasurably enriched our \nlives. America's technological prowess and high standard of living all \nstems from the creativity, determination, and entrepreneurial drive of \nmen and women who turned dreams into realities.\n  It is no coincidence that the United States is the most powerful \ntechnological force in history. Nor is it a coincidence that creative \npeople from all over the world flock to our shores to pursue their \ndreams.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood that an agrarian Nation would never \ngrow to be an economic and technological giant unless there was an \nincentive for inventors to create and for other inventors to study and \nimprove upon the creations. From this foresight, enshrined in Article 1 \nsection 8 of our Constitution, came the American system of intellectual \nproperty protection, which give inventors and authors the ability to \nenjoy, for a limited period of time, the exclusive economic benefits of \ntheir genius.\n  One of the most significant results of the Founders' foresight was \nthe creation of the U.S. patent system, which today has issued over six \nmillion patents--from the light bulb to life-saving pharmaceuticals. \nWhat the patent system really comes down to is what President Lincoln, \na patent holder himself, noted many years ago: it ``adds the fuel of \ninterest to the spark of genius.''\n  Today intellectual property-based enterprises, patents, trademarks, \nand copyrights, represent the largest single sector of the American \neconomy--almost 5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product--and employ \nover 4 million Americans. More than 50 percent of U.S. exports now \ndepend on some form of IP protection.\n  America is forever indebted to our inventors. So this year, on the \ncentennial of mankind's first flight, I hope my colleagues will join me \nin recognizing February 11 as ``National Inventors' Day.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than 200 years ago, on July 30, 1790, \nSamuel Hopkins, a resident of Vermont, was granted the first United \nStates patent. He had discovered a process for making potash, and was \nawarded his patent by President George Washington, Attorney General \nEdmund Randolph and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson.\n  Samuel Hopkins is just one of the many resourceful and creative \ninventors from Vermont. The town of Brandon can boast Thomas Davenport, \na self-educated blacksmith interested in electricity and magnetism. \nThrough hands-on experiments with electromagnets, he built the first \ntrue electric motor in 1834. Initially, his patent request was denied \nbecause there was no prior patent on electric machinery. But he \ngarnered the support of numerous professors and philosophers who \nexamined his invention\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\nand endorsed his right to a patent on his novel device. In 1837, his \ndeterminism paid off, and he secured a patent.\n  John Deere was born in Rutland, VT and spent most of his early life \nin Middlebury. After moving out West, John Deere realized the cast-iron \nplows he and other settlers brought with them were not going to work in \nthe Midwest soil. He studied the problem and developed the first \nsuccessful steel plow using steel from a broken saw blade. This new \nsteel plow became the key for successful farming in the West, and \n``John Deere'' is still synonymous with farming equipment today.\n  Vermont continues to be a leader in inventing and obtaining patents. \nMy State ranks fourth in the Nation for number of patents issued. IBM's \nEssex Junction Plant, which designs and makes computer technology for a \nwide range of products, received 411 patents from the U.S. Patent & \nTrademark Office in 2002. Vermont's plant also has 18 inventors who \ntogether have earned more than 600 patents. One of those inventors is \nSteve Voldman, the top patent winner. Over the past 10 years, he has \nreceived 110 patents. In 2002, he received 29. Many of his 2002 patents \nhad to do with silicon germanium, a new technology that has produced \nthe world's fastest chip.\n  Today's inventors are individuals in a shop, garage or home lab. They \nare teams of scientists working in our largest corporations or at our \ncolleges and universities. In the spirit of independent inventors, \nsmall businesses, venture capitalists and larger corporations in \nVermont and all over the United States, I would like to recognize \nFebruary 11, 2003, as National Inventors' Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/05/senate-section/article/S2017-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2017-S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. KYL.
