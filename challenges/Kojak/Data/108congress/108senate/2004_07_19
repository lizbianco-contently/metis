This is a very important piece of legislation that \nwe will need to address before we adjourn for the scheduled recess. In \naddition, there is a conference report regarding some expiring tax \nprovisions. We will consider that measure if and when it becomes \navailable.\n  This is the final legislative week prior to the August recess.

But \none of the good things that happens to me every day that I come is to \nhear the prayer. Today, for example, I wish I were good enough to live \nup to the expectations of the prayer offered by Admiral Black. Really, \nhe does a wonderful job, setting the tone for how we should work in the \nSenate. A lot of times I think we don't listen very closely to him. \nBut, even though he is not in the Chamber now, I want to have the \nRecord spread with my appreciation of the thoughtfulness he goes \nthrough every day in preparing his very meaningful prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8405-9", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8405-S8406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN MEASURES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if the majority leader could \ngive us an idea of whether we might get to the Morocco Free Trade \nAgreement this week, and also do we have any word on the childcare \nconference report? It is my understanding that the Appropriations \nCommittee is going to report out of the committee the military \nconstruction and legislative branch bills this week. I would ask about \nMoroccan free trade, the\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\nchildcare conference, and those two appropriations bills, military and \nlegislative branch, if we are going to be able to get to those this \nweek?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, all four issues are issues important to the \nSenate. Progress is being made on all of them. With regard to Morocco, \nwe will need to check with the chairman and the ranking member to see \nwhat their intentions are, which I will do and get back with the \nassistant Democratic leader.\n  The conference report on the child credit, again I very much would \nlike to see action on it over the course of the week. I know there was \ndiscussion over the last several days and over the weekend itself. I \nwill be able to update him once people return to town in the course of \nthe day.\n  On the appropriations bills, we will see what progress can be made \nbefore we leave. It would be nice to be able to make progress on those \nappropriations bills. We will need to aggressively consider all of \nthese appropriations bills, either now or in September, and finish \nbefore we complete the session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8406-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I yield such time as he needs to the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, and I will defer my remarks until \nafter he finishes because he has a hearing scheduled in just a number \nof minutes, so we will turn to him first.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for yielding me time at this moment. At 2 I have a special \nCommittee On Aging hearing to chair, so I do appreciate the \naccommodation.\n  Mr. President, today we are here to visit about, and I hope confirm, \na good friend of mine, William G. Myers III, whom the President \nnominated for a judgeship to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I \ncommend President Bush for nominating Bill Myers.\n  I would like to spend a few moments today talking about the reasons \nmy colleagues should vote for Bill Myers and set aside the larger \npolitical issues surrounding judicial nominations. Bill Myers was \nnominated by the President on May 15 of 2003 not May 15 of 2004 so it \nhas been well over a year since the President sent up the nomination of \nBill Myers.\n  Bill is an extraordinary person, and I believe his nomination \ndeserves our full and focused consideration.\n  He was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on April 1, 2004. Once \nconfirmed, Bill will fill the vacancy of Judge Thomas Nelson, who \nbecame the senior judge of the Ninth Circuit.\n  At this juncture, I would like to remind my colleagues that this is a \nvacant seat on the Ninth Circuit, a vacant Idaho seat we are proposing \nto be filled. The caseload of the Ninth Circuit judges at this moment \nis one of the largest in the country--as some would suggest, even \noverpowering and not allowing reasonable and appropriate justice to go \nforward simply because this seat and others are not filled and the \ncaseload is so substantial.\n  As my colleagues know, Federal law requires that every State within a \ncircuit be represented by at least one judge. I believe the Senate is \nin danger of failing to fulfill this requirement if it prevents an up-\nor-down vote on Bill Myers because he will be the Idaho judge of the \nNinth Circuit.\n  A few critics of this administration's natural resource policy would \nhave you believe Bill should not be confirmed. They have bandied about \nprevious wrongs, if you will, but all they have demonstrated is the \ncertainty of what?\n  First, these critics desire to capture the judiciary by opposing \nnominees who do not display activist tendencies that might work to \ntheir own political advantage. In other words, if you aren't our \npolitics and we can make an example of your politics, you are not fit \nto serve. We all know that judges shouldn't be involved in politics.\n  Second, these critics have done nothing more than confirm that \nSolicitor Myers is the chief legal officer at the Department of the \nInterior, which is controversial in every administration by the very \nnature of the mission and the responsibility of the Solicitor at the \nDepartment of Interior.\n  By enforcing political litmus tests against judicial nominees, some \nare suggesting that in order to be a nominee, you should have no \nexperience in the law. Let me repeat that. Some are suggesting, some of \nmy colleagues on the Judiciary Committee--and you will probably hear it \non the Senate floor--that it is the experience of the nominee that is \ngiving him the problem. So are we to assume, then, that nominees should \nhave no experience? How can they be a wise and thoughtful judge within \nthe law if they have not had that kind of experience both in the public \nand private sector?\n  Make no mistake, Bill Myers' opponents are for enforcing just this \ntest. The substance of their test is this: If you have represented \nfarmers, ranchers, miners, and, frankly, anyone else who advocates a \nbalanced multiple-use policy on public and private lands in the West, \nthe radical left environmental groups have decreed that you do not even \nmerit a vote in the U.S. Senate. And the Democrats at this moment are \nplaying that game: Sorry, Mr. Myers. You did your job down at Interior; \nyou don't deserve to get a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate in an \nup-or-down fashion. Senators should be ashamed to enforce such an edict \nfrom those liberal interest groups. The interest groups in this \ninstance have grabbed the power of those on the other side. That is a \ntragedy.\n  Among their many factual misstatements, critics of this nomination \nconfuse the appropriate roles of the lawyer or the judge by suggesting \nthat because Bill Myers has been a strong advocate for his clients, he \nwill continue to advocate for them from the bench. Of course, they \noffer nothing but bland or bald assertions in support of their logic.\n\n  Of course, we know that as men and women come to the bench, quite the \nopposite happens. They have a role in the private sector to represent \ntheir clients--that is their job--or in the public sector, in the case \nof Bill Myers, the Solicitor to represent his client, the Secretary of \nInterior. Is it to suggest that he will continue to do that as a judge? \nQuite the opposite. Let me tell you, that is the argument we will hear \ntoday on the floor of the Senate, and that is the argument being \nplaced.\n  If their theory is correct, no practitioner who has ever represented \ncommitted clients in adversarial proceedings or political policy \nbattles would be qualified to serve in the judiciary. Even so, any \nfears are allayed by a fair review of Bill's public service. His record \nas Solicitor shows balance and mainstream decisionmaking.\n  Let me give you a few examples: opposition to trespass by inholders \nin national parks of Alaska, impoundment of trespass livestock on \nFederal lands in Nevada, expansion of a national monument in New York, \nsupport for reinterment of Native-American remains, recognition of \ntribal boundary rights in New Mexico, record penalties for failure of a \ncompany to pay gas royalties, and support for settlement of tribal \nwater rights claims.\n  I remind my colleagues that as Solicitor, Bill Myers was not a \ndecisionmaker. He was the legal advisor to the Secretary of the \nInterior. In this role, as with all other roles in his life, Bill Myers \nhas been an advocate for his clients.\n  I see no reason to believe Bill Myers would not continue to do this \nas a\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\njudge. But in this situation, his client will be the law, and he will \nbe the advocate of truth and justice. That is the responsibility of a \njudge. The law becomes the client. Exactly what we all want in a judge \nis just what I have stated.\n  In addition, leaders in the field of law, including Democratic \nleaders in the West, have written to the committee supporting Bill's \nqualification to be a circuit judge. Letters of support have been \nwritten by the following, and all letters can be found in the \ncommittee's hearing record: Congressman Henry Hyde, Wyoming Supreme \nCourt Justice Marilyn Kite, Idaho Democrat Senator Chuck Cuddy, \nChairman Carol Dinkins for the ABA Committee on Federal Judiciary, \nformer Democrat Governor Mike Sullivan of Wyoming, and former Democrat \nGovernor Cecil Andrus of Idaho. In neither of these two Governors' \ncases can you suggest they were anti-environment. They stood for \nbalanced use, they stood for environment, and they stood for protecting \nour public lands and providing reasonable and responsible management. \nOf course, that is why we are supporting Bill Myers, because that is \nhow Bill Myers handled his position as Solicitor at the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  Democratic State attorney generals of Oklahoma and Colorado are also \nin support of this nominee.\n  Is this the message we want to send to hard-working families of \nfarmers and ranchers and miners in South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, \nNevada, Oregon, and other Western States? I hope not. I think just the \nopposite. I think any one Senator could review the Myers record and \ncould go to those who now oppose him and simply say this: I have \nreviewed William Myers' record. I find his integrity is beyond \nreproach. His intellect shows he is a man who has served a variety of \ncapacities and the law extremely well. He has a solid, well-balanced \ntemperament that would serve him well if we put him on the bench. That \nis what they ought to be saying.\n  No, today they are winking and nodding and saying to their \nenvironmental friends, we gave you one. We gave you a vote. Instead of \nsaying, we have reviewed the record of William Myers, he is the one who \ndeserves the vote, they are saying to the special interest votes, we \ngave you a vote.\n  I hope my colleagues hear that. I hope they weigh that in their \nconsideration of this nominee. That is not the way nominations ought to \nbe handled in our committees or in the Senate. Tragically enough, that \nis exactly what is happening.\n  Let it be said that the President of the United States has nominated \na quality person. That person is William Myers. He is before the Senate \nnow for a seat on the Ninth Circuit. He deserves our full consideration \nand a vote, not a political pass by. I wholeheartedly recommend we \nconsent to this nomination. The President has treated this post well \nwith the selection and the nomination of William Myers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Idaho has \nmade some very important points. That is, this is now eight judges who \nthe Democrats have indicated they would filibuster in the Senate, \nincluding this very excellent candidate for the Federal bench, William \nG. Myers III. We have never had filibusters of judicial nominees in the \nhistory of this country, not one time before. No one in the past has \nbeen willing to violate the rules in such a fashion until this \nPresident was elected.\n  It began with Miguel Estrada who, of course, removed his name from \nconsideration. After having sat there for better than 2 years, he \ndecided he better get back to his law practice. It includes another \nseven, including Mr. Myers, who the Democrats have indicated they will \nfilibuster--in other words, try to talk to death this nomination. Since \nthey have been able to keep control of almost everybody in their \ncaucus, needing only 41 votes against cloture--in other words, against \nending the debate so a vote can be taken--they have subverted the rules \nand have caused what is going to be called a crisis unless we can find \na way around it.\n  It is a crisis now because excellent nominees have been badly \nmistreated in the Senate by not even getting a vote up or down. Once a \nnominee is brought to the floor, that nominee deserves, under the \nadvice and consent clause of the Constitution, article II, section 2, a \nvote up or down.\n  If my colleagues on the other side do not like people, they can do \neverything they can within the committee to try and block the \nnomination there. But once that nominee is brought to the Senate, that \nnominee, under the advice and consent clause, deserves a vote up or \ndown. Mr. Myers is no exception. He deserves a vote up or down. He is \nan excellent nominee, one who would have that vote up or down if the \nSenate were acting responsibly.\n  I rise today in strong support for the confirmation of William G. \nMyers III who has been nominated to fulfill the Idaho vacancy on the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Let me emphasize, when current Circuit Judge Trott takes senior \nstatus at the end of this year, and if the Senate refuses to even vote \non Mr. Myers' nomination, there would be no Idaho representative on the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Federal Law 28 United States Code section 44(c) requires each State \nwithin a circuit must have at least one active judge serving on that \ncircuit. We have heard a lot of discussion over the past few months \nabout how circuit court seats should not be switched from one State to \nanother out of respect for home-State senators. I hope the Senators who \nhave raised those valid concerns afford Senators Craig and Crapo and \nthe rest of us in the West the same respect they believe they \nthemselves and their States deserve.\n  Again, this is not about Idaho having two or three or even one or two \nseats on the Ninth Circuit. It is about whether the Senate will refuse \nto even vote on filling Idaho's only active seat on the Ninth Circuit.\n  As I will discuss further, it is also about whether a qualified \nnominee can be blocked by a minority of Senators because he at one time \nor another represented ranchers, farmers, and miners in their efforts \nto make balanced use of public and private uses of public lands in the \nWestern United States of America. These are among the greatest pioneers \nand greatest leaders of the intermountain West, these farmers, \nranchers, and miners. These are good people. These are people who, like \neveryone else in our society, deserve representation. Many of them came \nto William G. Myers III for such representation. He represents them \nwell, as he should, as an advocate. The fact that some on the other \nside of aisle do not agree with his advocacy is no reason to stop him \nfrom being the sole active Idaho judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n\n  Bill Myers was nominated by President Bush in May of 2003, over a \nyear ago, and his nomination was carefully examined, debated, and \nfavorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee in early April. \nDemocrats who opposed him in committee voted against him. That is their \nright. But they should not now delay all Senators the right to vote on \nthis confirmation. Bill Myers deserves and is overdue for an up-or-down \nvote in the Senate.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Ninth Circuit is the most notoriously \nliberal Federal circuit in the United States. It is and has been for at \nleast a decade quintessentially out of the mainstream of American \njurisprudence. The infamous case in which this court held our Pledge of \nAllegiance is unconstitutional because it contains the word ``God'' is \nbut one of many examples of its all too frequent perversions of Federal \njurisprudence.\n  Fortunately, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Ninth Circuit \nin that case, one of 16 times in the 2003-2004 term alone the Court \nunanimously reversed or summarily vacated the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  This past Supreme Court term, the Ninth Circuit was reversed or \nvacated 81 percent of the time. Even my liberal friend from New York, \nSenator Schumer, once noted the Ninth Circuit is ``way out of the \nmainstream on the left.''\n  As Senator Feinstein noted in the 1996-1997 term, the Ninth Circuit \nwas reversed 20 of 21 cases. While some circuits had similar reversal \nrates, no other circuit came close to the number of cases considered \nand reversed. The same has been true since then. The\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\nNinth Circuit has been reversed 86.5 percent of the time since 1998. \nThat is a disgrace to the Federal bench. In 58 cases the Court didn't \neven need to hear argument, they simply vacated the Ninth Circuit \nsummarily. In the 2003-2004 term, Ninth Circuit appeals accounted for \nabout one-third of the Supreme Court's docket, suggesting that the \nCourt feels the need to focus disproportionately intense scrutiny on \ndecisions from that circuit.\n  As I noted, about two-thirds of the Ninth Circuit reversals this past \nterm, 64 percent, to be exact, were unanimous. This is a court that is \ndesperately in need of good, nonactivist judges who will be faithful to \nthe Constitution.\n  There is no doubt in my mind or in the mind of anybody who knows him \nthat Bill Myers would be such a judge. One would think the Senate would \nwelcome the confirmation of an expert on public lands and natural \nresources law to a court that has enormous influence over how disputes \nover the uses of these resources are resolved. Western Senators know \nall too well that the Ninth Circuit is the 900-pound gorilla of public \nlands, natural resources, and environmental law. Its decisions have \nsignificant and often adverse impacts well beyond the borders of its \njurisdiction.\n\n  Yet today, and tomorrow, I suppose, we will hear it is Bill Myers who \nis out of the mainstream and not fit to join the ranks of the Ninth \nCircuit judges who routinely ignore law and precedent to rule based on \ntheir own personal policy preferences, both on natural resources issues \nand in many other areas of the law, including, but not limited to, the \nconstitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance and the death penalty.\n  The prejudices against Bill Myers reflect today's poisoned \nconfirmation process: Nominees who somehow offend any well-funded \nliberal interest group are subject to distortions and baseless personal \nattacks, which the media echo chamber dutifully resound as proof \npositive of unfitness for the Federal bench. And with Bill Myers and \nhis record, the distortions continue, baseless as ever.\n  His record as the Interior Department's Solicitor, where he was doing \nhis duty to represent the policy positions of the United States of \nAmerica, has been attacked because the liberal environmentalists do not \nlike those policies. He has been vilified for daring to represent \nfarmers, ranchers, and miners while in private practice, as if \nranchers, farmers, miners, and those who make economic uses of Western \nlands are less entitled to representation than the elite, liberal \nenvironmental groups that attempt to dictate Western land policy from \nEastern cities, while they derisively refer to most of our Nation as a \nflyover country.\n  So what is at stake is this: Is a judicial nominee disqualified from \nservice on the Federal bench solely because he or she has advocated, \nsuccessfully and competently, for people or policies that liberal \ngroups of various stripes dislike? If the answer from my Democratic \ncolleagues is yes, then I do not want to hear one more word--not one--\nfrom any of them about how it is Republicans who are politicizing the \njudiciary.\n  There is no more blatant way for Senators to politicize and degrade \nthe confirmation process than to reflexively disqualify nominees who \nhave represented people and groups or advanced policies they do not \nlike. Ask yourselves, is this vote on Bill Myers really about Bill \nMyers? If it is, you know and I know there is no reason on the merits \nto deny him an up-or-down vote. Or will this vote be a reflection of \nliberal disdain for policies favored by farmers, ranchers, miners, the \nBush Interior Department, or anyone else who advocates balanced uses of \nWestern lands?\n  If the latter is true, let me emphasize again for those who still do \nnot get it, the Constitution did not and does not establish Federal \ncourts as the policymaking branch of the Government. Federal judges \nshould not make policy, though too often, especially on the Ninth \nCircuit, they do.\n  Policy debates ought to have no place in our consideration of a \nnominee's qualifications to serve as a Federal judge--unless we think \nhe or she does not understand the proper role of Federal judges under \nour constitutional system.\n  Absent absurd and unfair distortions of his record, there is zero \nevidence that Bill Myers does not understand that proper role.\n  I would also like to remind my colleagues of some facts about Bill \nMyers that the liberal interest groups and the media have willfully \nignored or deliberately misrepresented.\n  He has an exemplary record that includes service as a successful, \ncommitted advocate and public servant. As Solicitor for the Department \nof Interior, a position to which he was confirmed in 2001 without \nopposition, Mr. Myers supervised over 300 attorneys and 100 support \nstaff in 19 different offices throughout the United States, and managed \na $47 million annual budget. He has served as counsel here in the \nSenate to our former colleague Senator Al Simpson, and, as well, in the \nDepartment of Justice and the Department of Energy.\n\n  His confirmation is supported by Democrats, including former Wyoming \nGovernor Mike Sullivan and former Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus, who also \nserved President Carter as Secretary of the Interior, plus the \nDemocratic attorneys general in both Colorado and Oklahoma, and \nRepublicans alike. Five Western Governors, including the Governors of \nHawaii, Montana, and Nevada, have written to the committee expressing \ntheir support and emphasizing ``the need for quality judges who will \nprovide a balanced perspective to the Ninth Circuit's extraordinary \ncaseload.''\n  I also want to respond to a blatant misrepresentation about Mr. \nMyers' record that was made by one of my colleagues who suggested, \nfalsely, that Bill Myers ``thinks the Clean Air Act and the Endangered \nSpecies Act have harmed the environment.''\n  Well, as anyone who has bothered to read Mr. Myers' hearing testimony \nand written questions or even conducted a cursory review of his record \nwould know, he thinks no such thing. In fact, I do not think he has \never said anything about the Clean Air Act at all.\n  Now in his responses to Senator Feinstein's written questions, Mr. \nMyers affirmed that congressional intent in passing the Clean Water Act \nwas to ``restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological \nintegrity of our Nation's waters,'' and that ``the health of our \nNation's waters is often inextricably connected to the health of \nadjacent wetlands.'' This is an extreme conservative position? Only in \nthe sense that Bill Myers failed to endorse the full policy platform of \nGreenpeace.\n  Similarly, regarding the Endangered Species Act, we all know there \nhave been cases in which Government authorities have abused their power \nunder this law to confiscate private property without compensation. Let \nme give you one example, the 2001 Ninth Circuit decision in the Arizona \nCattle Growers case. Here, a unanimous appellate panel, composed of two \njudges appointed by President Clinton and one judge appointed by \nPresident Reagan, wrote the following:\n\n       [T]he Fish and Wildlife Service acted in an arbitrary and \n     capricious manner by issuing Incidental Take Statements \n     imposing terms and conditions on land use permits, where \n     there either was no evidence that the endangered species \n     existed on the land or no evidence that a take would occur if \n     the permit were issued. We also find that it was arbitrary \n     and capricious for the Fish and Wildlife Service to issue \n     terms and conditions so vague as to preclude compliance \n     therewith.\n\n  So Bill Myers has been an advocate for farmers and ranchers who have \nchallenged such abuses of this law, because their families' lives and \nfortunes depend on their ability to responsibly use land they own or \nlease. For such efforts, he is unfit for Federal judicial service? Give \nme a break.\n  Here is what Bill Myers has actually said about the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Contrast what he has said with what his opponents believe \nhe thinks. He has said Federal agencies should not use it as a zoning \ntool on public lands.\n  Now, is that unreasonable? He argued in a brief on behalf of the \nAmerican Farm Bureau and others that the Babbitt Interior Department \nregulations that defined the term ``harm'' in the Endangered Species \nAct in a way that essentially precluded any private landowners' use of \nproperty on which an endangered species might find habitat should be \ninvalidated.\n  That sounds like a reasonable position to me. And I think it would be \nto anybody under similar circumstances.\n\n[[Page S8409]]\n\nWhy, it might even be a reasonable position for some of my more liberal \nlegal colleagues on the other side, if they bother to think about it.\n  Importantly, the Government had no intention of compensating affected \nlandowners if these regulations rendered their land valueless, despite \nthe Fifth Amendment's takings clause, and despite provisions in the \nEndangered Species Act itself that authorize the Government to \ncompensate landowners in such situations.\n  So, again, are the positions taken by the American Farm Bureau and \nother farmers and ranchers extreme and unreasonable, disqualifying \ntheir lawyer from Federal judicial service? I think the obvious answer \nis no--unless every nominee to the Ninth Circuit must share the policy \npositions of the elitist and more radical environmental groups.\n  Let me make one related point. I will refer to a news report dated \nMarch 17, 2004, headlined: ``Grad Student Charged in SUV Arson.''\n  According to the article, a student with connections to the radical \nenvironmentalist group Earth Liberation Front firebombed and vandalized \n125 vehicles at Los Angeles area car dealerships and private homes in \nAugust 2002. The words ``ELF'' and ``Fat Lazy Americans'' were spray-\npainted onto some of the vehicles.\n  ELF also took responsibility for a 2002 fire in San Diego that \ndestroyed an apartment building and caused $50 million worth of damage. \nJust 2 weeks ago ELF is suspected of carrying out an attack in my home \nState of Utah at Brigham Young University.\n  When ELF extremists are arrested, they are represented by attorneys. \nWithout in any way suggesting that anything Bill Myers has ever done or \nadvocated approaches such actual extremism, are these attorneys \npresumptively disqualified from service on the Federal bench because of \nthe criminal actions of their clients? Can we assume that they \nsympathize with the criminals' actions? In light of some Senate \nDemocrats' apparently closed minds against a growing number of \nPresident Bush's nominees, perhaps we all need to think more carefully \nabout how we answer such questions.\n  Some Senators apparently believe that nominees who do not think like \nthey do, and will not advocate their pet causes while on the bench, \ndeserve nothing more than to be filibustered--denied an up-or-down vote \nbecause they--a minority--know that a Senate majority stands ready to \nconfirm these nominees.\n  Unlike those who are supporting such filibusters for purely \nideological reasons, I do not believe that a nominee must share all of \nmy favorite interest groups' policy views in order to deserve an up-or \n-down vote. And let me read what Bill Myers had to say on this at his \nhearing.\n\n       I would stand on my personal record that I cited a moment \n     ago that I have spent my free time in serving national parks, \n     such as picking cigarette butts out of fire pits. I have a \n     great love for the national parks. That is where we recreate \n     and that is where we go for sustenance, for spiritual \n     refreshment, and that is a personally-held view. The larger \n     view, though, and the one that is really important for this \n     Committee is whether I would carry into a judicial position, \n     if I were so lucky as to be confirmed, an ideology that would \n     result in a bias against or for any litigant.\n       And I think it should be noted that every nominee, I \n     suspect, that comes before you has both proponents and \n     opponents, and some of those people may hope that once that \n     person becomes a judge that they can either count on them to \n     do the right thing or cower in fear that they will do the \n     wrong thing.\n       I hope that both of those groups, the proponents and the \n     opponents, are disappointed; that when a person takes on \n     those robes, takes the oath of office, swears to uphold the \n     Constitution, that that means that they will follow the law \n     and the facts, wherever the law and the facts take them, \n     without regard to personal opinion, public opinion, friends, \n     or foes.\n\n  Ask yourselves, is this an ideological nominee? Out of the \nmainstream? As I said before, only in the eyes of the well-funded \nenvironmental extremist groups who cannot stand the idea of a Ninth \nCircuit judge who might not buy into all of their propaganda.\n  Finally, Bill Myers would fill an Idaho seat recently vacated by an \nIdaho judge. While no Federal judge should represent anyone or anything \nbut Federal law, to the extent the Ninth Circuit currently represents \nanything other than embarrassment and summary reversals, it represents \nPresident Clinton, who appointed 14 of its active 26 judges four during \nelection year 2000 alone. And let me note, for the benefit of those who \nnow say it is too late in an election year to confirm judges, that \nClinton nominee and current Ninth Circuit Judge Rawlinson was confirmed \nto his position on July 21, 2000, in the last year of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Bill Myers was a successful advocate for people and causes that \ndeserve representation just as much as any environmental activist \ngroup, or any liberal's pet causes. As the Interior Department's \nsolicitor, Mr. Myers defended balanced policy solutions to difficult \nquestions of how our public lands and natural resources in the west \nshould be managed. His confirmation will help balance a very out-of-\nbalance Ninth Circuit, as well as ensuring that Idaho maintains its \nonly seat on that court. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to \nconfirm this good man to the Ninth Circuit.\n  We have heard from the other side about the mythical ``Thurmond \nrule'' and all kinds of other suggestions that judges should not be \nconfirmed from here on, this late in a Presidential election year. I \nremember way back when, cases where we confirmed judges, Democratic \nnominees, Carter nominees, even after President Reagan had won the \nelection. In fact, one of them is sitting on the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I remember when my colleagues came to me back in the year 1980 and \nasked if I would be willing to support then-Harvard law professor \nStephen Breyer for the First Circuit Court of Appeals. I have to say \nthere were some Republicans who didn't want that to happen. But he had \nbeen a wonderful chief of staff for Senator Kennedy on the Judiciary \nCommittee. He was honest, decent, honorable, kind, worked well with \nboth sides. He had all of the qualifications. There was no question \nabout intelligence and ability. I led the fight to make sure he was \nconfirmed. That was later in that year. There have been other cases as \nwell.\n  It is wrong to set any arbitrary limits on when during the year the \nSenate can confirm judges. If a person is not qualified, that is one \nthing. But everybody we have brought to the floor has not only been \nqualified, they have been among the best nominees of my 28 years in the \nSenate. Mr. Myers is one of them. He is knowledgeable. He has held \nhigh-level positions in our Government. He has served with distinction. \nHe has served well. He is one of the brightest people. He would \nrepresent Idaho in the only active seat Idaho would have. He certainly \nunderstands all of the problems in the intermountain West, an area \nwhere the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals could use his knowledge. He is \none of the top public lands and natural resource lawyers in the \ncountry.\n  He is a person of inestimable ability, great charm, decency, \nhonorable ways, and capacity. He is a person who would have great \ntemperament on the court. In other words, he is a person we ought to \nconfirm. We should not get into these Mickey Mouse filibusters that fly \nin the face of the advise and consent clause itself, and which \nbasically have cost the dignity of the Senate to a large degree.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. What is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in executive session for \nCalendar No. 603.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reid are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the William Myers' \nnomination to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He is a man of skill, \na man with a proven record of public service, a man with a broad \nbackground in legal matters, a man perfectly suited to help improve the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has had an extraordinary number \nof problems in recent years.\n  William Myers has bipartisan support. He has had a distinguished \nlegal career. Ranging from his service as a solicitor for the \nDepartment of Interior, the chief legal officer at the Department of \nInterior, to his extensive private practice at Holland & Hart, one of \nIdaho's most prestigious law firms, where he specialized in Federal \nlitigation involving public lands and natural resource issues.\n  He served for close to 4 years on the staff of former Senator Alan \nSimpson as legislative counsel. Senator Simpson served for many years \nin the Senate. William Myers has also served as an assistant to the \nAttorney General in the U.S. Department of Justice and as Deputy \nGeneral Counsel for Programs in the United States Department of Energy.\n  These are broad experiences, the kinds of experiences that will be \nmost valuable to him as a Federal judge because many Federal cases \ninvolve relations and litigation affecting Federal agencies in matters \nof land, conservation, and energy. This is particularly true of the \nWest.\n  He is qualified to serve. The American Bar Association, certainly not \na conservative organization, has rated him qualified to serve, and he \nhas won many plaudits from across party lines.\n  Cecil Andrus, former Idaho Democratic Governor, had this to say about \nMr. Myers:\n\n       He possesses the necessary personal integrity, judicial \n     temperament, and legal experience, as well as the ability to \n     act fairly on matters of law that will come before him on the \n     court.\n\n  Mike Sullivan, former Democratic Governor of Wyoming and U.S. \nAmbassador under the Clinton administration, calls Mr. Myers a \nthoughtful, well-grounded attorney who has reflected by his career \nachievements a commitment to excellence. He would provide serious, \nresponsible, and intellectual consideration to each matter before him \nas an appellate judge and would not be prone to extreme or ideological \npositions unattached to the legal precedence or the merits of a given \nmatter.\n  That is a high compliment. I think it goes to the heart of what a \njudge is; that, yes, one can be active politically; yes, one can be a \nperson who has public policy views about what America should do to make \nthis a better country. But when the question is, when one comes on the \nbench, what is their philosophy about judging? How do they think about \njudging? What do they think the role of a judge should be? Do they \nthink the role of a judge is to try to use the power of the robe, the \npower of the bench, to implement their political views?\n  Frankly, if people come up for a judgeship and have never been active \nin any way in public policy issues, I wonder if they are qualified. \nSurely, they ought to have some views about issues that come before \nthis country and care about America and have spoken out on them. The \nquestion simply is, do they understand when they put on that robe they \nare not a politician. They are judicial officers required to interpret \nthe laws of this country as best they can, to give plain meaning to the \nwords of the statute and the Constitution and not to utilize that bench \nas a mechanism to impose their personal views on the people in their \ndistrict or their circuit? Because, of course, Federal judges have \nlifetime appointments.\n  Some would think our Founding Fathers, if they made an error, it was \nwhen they gave one group of people, the third branch of our Government, \nunreviewable power. So we need judges who show personal restraint, and \nthat is Judge Myers' judicial philosophy. Frankly, it could be utilized \non the Ninth Circuit to a great degree.\n  Some have questioned his commitment to environmental issues, even \ncalled him anti-environment. His record indicates otherwise. In fact, \nhe is most knowledgeable and skilled in these areas. He has been a \nleader in the American Bar Association's Section on Environmental \nEnergy and Resources and has served as vice chairman of the ABA's \nPublic Lands Committee.\n  Now, as my colleagues know, the ABA is certainly not a right-wing \norganization, but they have rated him qualified. They know him. He has \nbeen active in their issues in a professional and legal manner, not in \na partisan way but on the American Bar Association committees.\n  He has done a number of things such as settling a big case on behalf \nof the Government against the Shell Oil Company for flaring and venting \nnatural gas in the Gulf of Mexico. They had to pay $49 million as a \nresult of that settlement. An environmental group sought Mr. Myers' aid \nto protect Atlantic salmon and 10 other species of native fish in a \ndispute over removing two dams on the Penobscot River.\n  At the end of the day, the Myers' settlement allowed a dramatic \nincrease in raising the population of these fish and the environmental \ngroups called the agreement ``the biggest restoration project north of \nthe Everglades.''\n  He understands environmental issues. He understands legitimate \nconcerns about the American environment, the need for us to make sure \nthat the environment is protected and that the law is followed. I hope, \nhowever, he is not one who believes the environmental laws the Congress \nhas passed, some of them somewhat complex, can be twisted around and \nutilized as a weapon to further a personal political environmental \nagenda. I do not believe that is his idea.\n  From what we have seen from some of our Federal judges, too often in \nthe Ninth Circuit, that is how they have acted.\n  Some have expressed concern about this nominee being one who is from \nthe West. He understands the Government lands issue. He has served on \nABA committees and served in areas of the Government that have dealt \nwith those issues. He is knowledgeable on environmental issues and \nother issues that are important to that region of the country in which \nhe is called on to serve. Now, what is wrong with that?\n  I am sure we have Members of this body from Massachusetts out on \nMartha's Vineyard, and they would like to tell everyone that if someone \nis a member of the Cattleman's Association and a lawyer for them, that \nperson cannot be trusted, they do not understand what life is about, \nthey are not committed to the environment; you know, the cows eat \ngrass, and it is not helpful, that kind of thing.\n  Mr. Meyers is a nominee who has a record of adhering to the law. I \nhave no doubt he will be a fine judge, and he deserves to be confirmed.\n  I think it is important that we take a minute to say this: If we get \na judge who is committed to the rule of law, committed to showing \nrestraint, committed to the judicial philosophy that a judge ought to \nfollow the law and not make it, where better should they be sent than \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals?\n  I will share some thoughts about that circuit. Politically, let's \njust say that party affiliation should not affect a judge's ruling, but \nto those who say this man is conservative, he is a Republican, and he \nought not be confirmed, let me point this out about the Ninth Circuit: \nOf the 26 active judges, 17 were appointed by Democratic Presidents. \nOnly 9 are Republican appointees. A remarkable 14 of the 26 judges, 54 \npercent, over half were appointed by President Clinton alone. In the \nyear 2000, a Presidential year, President Clinton appointed four judges \nto this court. The last year in office, he appointed and we confirmed \nfour judges to this court.\n  Of course, it is the biggest circuit in America and having quite a \nbit of difficulty, frankly. It needs some help, and we need to see in \nwhat kind of bipartisan way we can work to improve this Ninth Circuit. \nWe need some rule of law balance on this court. I believe that Mr. \nMeyers will provide that.\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\n  I will go on. The Ninth Circuit has established a pattern of issuing \nthe most activist decisions in the country. On one day earlier this \nyear, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed three decisions from the Ninth \nCircuit. The Supreme Court ended its 2003-2004 term having reversed the \nNinth Circuit in 81 percent of the cases appealed from it.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows--and I see Senator Cornyn from Texas, \nwho is a former attorney general and a member of the Texas Supreme \nCourt, who would also know--the Supreme Court of the United States can \nonly hear a small fraction of the cases that come from the entire \nUnited States. They can hear only a small fraction of the cases that \nare appealed from the Ninth Circuit, and they reversed them 81 percent \nof the time. That means hundreds and perhaps thousands of other \nlitigants in California and the West did not have their cases heard by \nthe Supreme Court. Perhaps they, too, would have been reversed had they \nbeen heard, but they are stuck with the Ninth Circuit as the final \ncourt that ever heard their case.\n  The Ninth Circuit has established a pattern of issuing the most \nactivist decisions in the country. I will give some more examples.\n  During the last decade, in the last 10 years, the Ninth Circuit has \nreversed death sentences at an increasingly high rate.\n  The Supreme Court has affirmed the legality of the death penalty in \nAmerica, and Congress and States like California and other States in \nthe West have it, as does my home State. But they are being reversed at \nan increasingly high rate which moves it out of step with the other \ncircuits in America. While all the other circuits uphold approximately \n80 percent of death penalty convictions, the Ninth Circuit has gone the \nother way, reversing a majority of convictions in most years, and \napproximately 80 percent of the convictions over the last 3 years.\n  I served as a prosecutor for most of my professional career--almost \n17 years. An 80-percent reversal by the Federal court, which is simply \nto review the State court's decisions to see if fundamental Federal \nprinciples have been violated, is a stunning statistic. So I say, if \nMyers has a little different view of these things, we need him in a \nhurry on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Most recently, in September of 2003, an 11-judge en banc Ninth \nCircuit panel ruled 8 to 3 that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \nRing v. Arizona, which held that capital defendants have a \nconstitutional right to a jury determination of the facts supporting \ntheir death sentences, applies retroactively to over 100 death row \ninmates who were sentenced by judges. Of the 11 panel judges--I want to \npoint this out, how this circuit is made up--of the 11 judges on this \npanel, one was appointed by a Republican President.\n  Fortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's \ndecision, but such lack of balance on that court has produced the \nalmost tiresomely predictable set of results. The balance I speak of is \nrule of law balance, not conservative versus liberal balance.\n  In 2001, the Ninth Circuit acted to invalidate an application of \nCalifornia's three-strikes law as a violation of the eighth amendment's \nprotection against cruel and unusual punishment, a decision fortunately \noverturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  It would be funny, if it were not so serious.\n  There is no doubt that the rather significant decline in criminal \nactivity in America today is driven by tough sentences and things like \nCalifornia's ``three strikes and you are out'' laws which have sent \nrepeat offenders off to jail for longer periods of time. It has saved \nthe lives of hundreds, thousands of Californians who would have been \nmurdered by some of these people, much less raped, assaulted, had their \nhomes vandalized and burglarized, their automobiles stolen, and drugs \nsold in their neighborhoods. This law was struck down by the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  Fortunately, it was reversed by the Supreme Court. The Ninth Circuit \nopinion, of course, was authored by Clinton nominee Richard Paez, who \ncame through here and was confirmed in this Senate several years ago. I \nopposed his confirmation.\n  The Ninth Circuit, then, after the Supreme Court reversed the \ndecision, only implemented the reversal of through a divided panel. \nAfter the Supreme Court told them what to do, the panel still divided, \nwith Judge Reinhardt, the epitome of judicial activism in America, \nupholding the defendant's sentence only under the Supreme Court \n``compulsion,'' he said. And Judge Pregerson stated that ``in good \nconscience'' he could not follow the Supreme Court's decision.\n  This kind of contempt and disrespect for the U.S. Supreme Court is a \nmatter of concern, of real concern. What is not a matter of concern is \nthat Mr. Myers represented the Cattlemen's Association and understands \nland issues in the West. That is what we need on this court, some \nrespect for law.\n  The Ninth Circuit reinstated in another case a claim by a prisoner \nwho had been convicted of making terrorist threats and sentenced to 100 \nyears to life. They ruled he had a constitutional right to artificially \ninseminate his wife from prison via overnight mail. The en banc Ninth \nCircuit reversed the decision over the dissents of four Clinton \nappointees, including Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez, who I voted \nagainst, but I voted not to filibuster, to bring them out so they could \nget an up-or-down vote in this body. My suspicions about their activist \nnature have been confirmed in case after case, unfortunately.\n\n  In 2002, the Ninth Circuit struck down Alaska's Megan's Law, a sex \noffender notification law. Both plaintiffs in the case had been \nconvicted of sexual abuse of a minor. Judge Reinhardt's opinion was \njoined by Clinton nominee Sidney Thomas and Carter nominee Dorothy \nNelson. The Supreme Court reversed their decision 6 to 3. Many of those \ncases have been reversed by the Supreme Court 9 to nothing.\n  The Ninth Circuit infamously declared the Pledge of Allegiance \nunconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit panel, including Stephen Reinhardt, \nruled the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because it contained \nthe word ``God.'' The en banc court later refused to reconsider the \nruling and the case thankfully was reversed earlier this summer on \nsummary grounds by a unanimous Supreme Court.\n  The Ninth Circuit ruled that California State courts erred as a \nmatter of State law when they found that a defendant, convicted of \nselling cocaine, had failed to present sufficient evidence to warrant a \njury instruction on entrapment.\n  This is a Federal court sitting in review of an oversight of a State \ncourt ruling. They are State judges, by the way, who are sworn to \nuphold the Constitution and sworn to uphold the laws of the State of \nCalifornia. Judge Susan Graber, writing in dissent, faulted the \nmajority for failing to adhere to the proper standard of review of \nState court decisions. She noted that:\n\n       [t]he Supreme Court of the United States has just chastised \n     this court, in the strongest possible terms, for substituting \n     our judgment for that of a state court on matters of federal \n     law. . . . We have even less justification for substituting \n     our judgment for that of a state court on matters of its own \n     state law.\n\n  I am pleased that one justice spoke up there.\n  There are quite a number of other cases I could mention. I will not \ngo into them. Actually, there are quite a number of others.\n  I will say this. This judge has the ``qualified'' rating by the \nAmerican Bar Association. He has had broad public experience. He has \nhad private litigation experience with a good law firm in Idaho and in \nthe West and back here in Washington. He knows what he is doing. He has \nbipartisan support, Democrats and Republicans. He is a person who is \nqualified and should take this position. But we have a small group who \nthinks these people in the South, they put judges up who want to turn \nback the clock. They believe we have nominees, if they come from the \nWest and represent the Cattlemen's Association, that they do not \nbelieve in the Constitution, they don't believe in the environmental \nlaws. It is a conceit of the elites. It is not correct. This judge is \ncommitted to following the law. He would be a wonderful addition to a \ncircuit that is in serious trouble today and needs some reform and \nneeds some judges with good skills, a commitment to the law, common \nsense, personal integrity, and a willingness to follow the Supreme \nCourt rulings whether they agree with them.\n\n[[Page S8412]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cornyn are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of my \ngood friend, William G. Myers III. I recommend him highly, and I \nbelieve the United States Senate should approve his nomination to serve \nas a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He has earned that \nposition by his dedication and a remarkable record of service to the \ncountry and to our legal system.\n  I am concerned we won't hear about his impressive record, however, I \nam afraid we are going to hear a lot of needlessly harsh rhetoric about \nBill being a radical who has only represented extreme conservative \ninterests during the course of his outstanding legal career. That isn't \nthe truth, of course, but it does make for good soundbites and \nunfortunately, that is often what is promoted as the truth.\n  The truth is that Bill is not a radical extremist, nor does he have a \npolitical agenda that he is trying to pursue in agreeing to be \nnominated for the Ninth Circuit. A radical judge would be one who is \nintent on making extreme, sweeping changes in the political and social \nmake up of the west. A radical judge is someone who stands out as being \nsignificantly different from the community he represents, who pursues \nhis ideology regardless of its impact on those affected by his actions, \nand who doesn't care if his actions do not represent the interests of \nthe people he serves.\n  No, Bill is not a radical for he is none of those things. In fact, he \nis quite the opposite. He is someone who has lived and worked with the \npeople of the West. He knows them, respects them, and he understands \nthe demands they face every day as they try to make a living. He knows \ntheir dreams and he shares their values. He is looking to serve on the \nbench to make life better for them and for all those in the West who \nwill be affected by his decisions.\n  It is unfortunate that this is an election year. Any other year and \nwe would see Bill for who and what he is. We would see him, not as a \nradical, but a typical Westerner who has a well established and \noutstanding reputation for his work representing the West.\n  Who else shall we appoint to the Ninth Circuit to truly represent the \ntypical West? I believe it would be very safe to say that the Ninth \nCircuit Court is made up predominantly of judges who are sympathetic to \nradical agendas with very few if any of them representing the \nhardworking miners and ranchers who have for generations made up the \nbackbone of the Western economy.\n  Of the 26 active judges on the Ninth Circuit Court, 17 were appointed \nby Democrat presidents. Only 9 judges are Republican appointees. A \nremarkable 14 of the 26 judges--54 percent of the court--were appointed \nby President Clinton. In 2000 alone--a presidential election year--\nPresident Clinton appointed four judges to the court.\n  The Ninth Circuit has established a pattern of issuing the most \nactivist decisions in the country. In one day earlier this year, the \nU.S. Supreme Court reversed three decisions from the Ninth Circuit, and \nthe Supreme Court ended its 2003-2004 term having reversed the Ninth \nCircuit in 81 percent of the cases appealed from it. Needless to say, \nthat's not a good record. That means, in every five cases that were \nappealed, the Supreme Court ruled that these judges got it wrong 4 out \nof every 5 cases. Worse still, this was an improvement over their \nembarrassingly high reversal rate over the past several years--86.5 \npercent since 1998. This trend is likely to continue unless we help \ncorrect the situation by confirming good, honest judges who respect the \nConstitution and Federal law. Judges who will bring some balance to the \nNinth Circuit equation.\n  Why do they call Bill a radical? If you examine his record, you will \nsee that he represents and understands those under the jurisdiction of \nthe Ninth Circuit Court--the average person in the West who relies more \non common sense than complicated legal arguments to determine right \nfrom wrong. That ought to erase that label. But, for some reason, it \ndoesn't. Could the placing of this label on this good, fair, honest, \nand decent individual be another ploy at politicizing this nomination \nfor the sake of obstruction?\n  Most of the Judges on the Ninth Circuit Court come from the Circuit's \nmost populated States, such as California. The other States that make \nup the Ninth Circuit, such as the State of Idaho, are allowed only one \njudge. Right now Idaho's seat is vacant. Will Idaho only be allowed \nrepresentation on the court when it has a nominee from California?\n  We begin every session here in the Senate with the Pledge of \nAllegiance. We join together to say those special words. As we do, I \nknow that my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, say those words \nwith a firm heartfelt commitment to this country and that they mean \nevery word of pledging their allegiance to the flag and to this Nation. \nBut I have to wonder if they haven't forgotten the meaning of all the \nwords in the pledge when they take a hardline stance like this against \na fully qualified nominee.\n  The last six words of the Pledge of Allegiance, ``with liberty and \njustice for all,'' mean that we do not preserve justice or liberty for \na few people, or for most of the people, and leave a few, or even an \nindividual, behind. It means we have justice for all, for everyone, and \nthat we don't make exceptions because they come from a State that \ndoesn't have as many people as California, or may not be as liberal as \nCalifornia.\n  In fact, this is one of the situations that the courts were created \nto protect--the rights of each individual. I think it is a little \nironic that there are those here in the Senate that would be willing to \nwithhold justice and rights from some people, in this case the average, \nhardworking people who make up the population within the Ninth Circuit \njust because those individuals don't share their political philosophy.\n  I hope we will do the right thing by Bill Myers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a time when American families take \ntheir vacations. I can remember as a young man working in a service \nstation in Las Vegas and Henderson. This was a busy time of the year. \nIt was always interesting to see the cars loaded with kids going every \nplace. Even today, these many years later, families still drive. This \nsummer, although the price of gas is not quite as high as it was a few \nmonths ago, it is still near record levels in many parts of the \ncountry, including the State of Nevada. Every time a family stops for \ngasoline, it is a reminder that our country needs reliable sources of \nenergy that are not subject to wild price swings.\n  Every time we see a scene from the Middle East on TV news--and that \nis\n\n[[Page S8413]]\n\noften--it is a reminder that our Nation depends too heavily on oil from \nthat volatile region. Every time a parent tells a child with asthma \nthat he cannot play outside because the air is unsafe, we are reminded \nthat fossil fuels do tremendous harm to our environment and to \nourselves.\n  Our Nation desperately needs a new energy policy, one that protects \nconsumers, safeguards our environment, and makes us stronger by \nreducing our dependence on Mideastern oil. We cannot create an energy \npolicy for the future by simply repeating the past. We need new ideas. \nWe need some new approaches.\n  We use about 25 percent of the oil that is produced worldwide, but we \nonly have less than 3 percent of the proven oil reserves in the world, \nincluding ANWR. So it is a cinch we cannot drill our way out of the \nproblems we have dealing with the production of fossil fuel. We need to \nremember the words of Benjamin Franklin who said a penny saved is a \npenny earned. In the case of oil, a barrel saved is better than a \nbarrel drilled and consumed. Why? Because it does not pollute the air \nor contribute to global warming.\n  After the Arab oil embargo of 1973, our Nation got serious about \nconserving oil. By 1990, less than 20 years later, our vehicles were \nusing about 40 percent as much fuel as they did in 1973. We can do this \nagain.\n  America's talented engineers and scientists can still design vehicles \nthat save fuel without sacrificing safety if we make conserving oil a \nnational priority. We have to do a better job of conserving oil and we \nhave to develop new sources of energy that are clean and reliable.\n  Again, we in America are fortunate because this great land of ours is \nblessed with an abundance of clean, renewable energy sources. We can \nharness the warmth of the Sun, the power of the wind, and the heat \nwithin the Earth. All it takes is good old American ingenuity, and a \nlittle bit of incentive but we should be clear. For decades we have \nprovided subsidies and tax breaks for the big oil companies. Today we \nneed some incentives to help spur production of renewable energy.\n  I have been in Congress a long time, and I know how things work. It \ntakes time to get things done. I try to be very patient, but when we \nnot only fail to make progress on an important issue but actually move \nbackward instead of forward, then I think an alarm must be sounded, and \nthat is what has happened on renewable energy. Instead of making \nprogress, we seem to be taking steps backward.\n  Over the last 15 years, wind power has been the fastest growing \nsource of renewable energy, thanks to the section 45 production tax \ncredit. This incentive spurred billions of dollars of investment in new \ntechnology. As a result, wind energy has become increasingly cost \neffective and it provides jobs and electricity. In parts of the \nMidwest, some farmers make more money producing electricity from wind \nturbines than they do selling their crops.\n  I worked for years to expand this incentive to other forms of \nrenewable energy, especially solar and geothermal power. But instead of \nexpanding the tax credit that has been so successful in promoting wind \npower, we have allowed it to expire. It is hard to believe but it is \ntrue. This seems crazy. It is like allowing insurance on one's home to \nlapse for failing to properly maintain a vital piece of equipment, \nequipment that is used every day.\n  The tax incentive for wind energy expired 31 December 2003. We need \nto restore it as soon as possible, and we need to extend it to solar, \ngeothermal, and biomass energy.\n  I was encouraged that the FSC bill passed by the Senate last month \ncontains these section 45 production tax credits. That is great work by \nSenators Grassley and Baucus, and I have told them personally how much \nI think they have the right idea of what it is going to take to help \nthis country from an energy perspective.\n  Unfortunately, the companion House bill would only extend the \nproduction tax credit for wind. We are beginning to see again, as we \nalways do, the powerful interests of the oil companies who want all the \nsubsidies, but we now have another chance to get it right because this \nbill is going to conference. That was agreed last week. We must not \nsquander this opportunity. We must get back on the path to renewable \nenergy and energy independence.\n  America, our Nation, is blessed with abundant renewable energy \nresources, especially in the western part of the United States. Last \nmonth, the Governors of nine Western States, including Nevada, formally \nsigned a plan that commits the region to developing 30,000 megawatts of \nelectricity. That is about 15 percent of current demand from renewable \nsources by the year 2015, which is going to be soon.\n  I applaud their determination. I applaud their vision. They know that \ndeveloping renewable energy is not only good for consumers and the \nenvironment but also for creating jobs.\n  Because renewable energy is ``Made in the USA,'' it can reduce our \ndependence on oil from the Middle East. Many Western States have \nalready adopted renewable portfolio standards requiring a fixed \npercentage of energy sold in-State come from renewable energy \nresources. As we speak, 13 States have set these goals, and the number \nwill increase.\n  I am happy that Nevada has adopted one of the most aggressive \nrenewable portfolio standards of any place in the country. It commits \nthe State of Nevada to produce 15 percent of our electricity from \nrenewable sources by the year 2013. A goal had been set of 5 percent by \nthe end of 2003. We didn't do that. We could have. We didn't. There \nwere a number of reasons. One was there was uncertainty about whether \nthe tax incentive for wind power would be extended or expanded to solar \nand geothermal power. The other reason is utilities in Nevada and other \nWestern States are still reeling, they are in bad shape, from the \nwestern energy crisis of 2000-2001, when Enron and other traders \nmanipulated the energy market to jack up prices for no reason other \nthan to generate obscene profits. Because of the exorbitant contracts \nwith Enron, the State of Nevada's utilities are near bankruptcy. As a \nresult, companies that want to develop renewable energy and sell it to \nthese utilities have not been able to attract the investment they need. \nThe investment community evaluates renewable energy projects based on \nthe strength of long-term purchase agreements between the proposed \nfacilities and the local utility, but if the utility is in trouble, \ninvestors shy away.\n  To address this problem, Kenny Guinn, the Governor of Nevada, will \nask the legislature which meets next year to create a temporary \nrenewable energy development trust that will provide some protection to \nrenewable energy power plants if our utilities file for bankruptcy.\n  We need action at the Federal level also. The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, referred to as FERC, must provide relief to \nutilities and ratepayers in Nevada and other Western States. FERC needs \nto act, and now, to vacate the exorbitant contracts of the energy \ncrisis. We know that two of the FERC Commissioners were recommended by \nKenny Lay, the Enron CEO, who was a major contributor of the \nPresident's campaign, and the President referred to him as ``Kenny \nBoy.'' These Commissioners should either step down or clean up this \nmess. I am happy to report that Kenny Boy is now under indictment.\n  Our Nation must have energy markets that function properly. We must \nhave incentives to develop our clean, renewable energy resources, and \nwe must apply American ingenuity to do a better job conserving energy. \nThese are critical steps toward the kind of farsighted energy policy \nthis country needs. These steps will protect consumers, they will \nsafeguard the environment, and they will make our Nation stronger by \nmoving us closer to energy independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8413-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8413-S8415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SUPPORTING U.S. EFFORTS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on July 7, 2004, the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence issued an important report regarding flaws in \nour prewar intelligence on Iraq. Last week, Lord Butler issued a \nsimilar report on British intelligence. In a related vein, the 9/11 \nCommission will issue its report this Thursday.\n  Each of these reports either already has, or no doubt will, shed \nlight on how we can improve our ability to protect this country and our \nallies from future terrorist attacks.\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\n  Coming almost 3 years after 9/11, it is important to note that many \nreforms have already been implemented by Congress and the \nadministration without waiting on a committee or a commission report. \nStill, the recommendations of each of these reports ought to be \ncarefully considered and debated by Congress.\n  If this were not a Presidential election year, we might be able to \neven undertake this important work without playing the blame game in \norder to score political points. My hope is that we will, to the extent \nhumanly possible, strive to do so. If not, we risk politicizing the \nprocess to the detriment of long-term solutions to our intelligence \nproblems.\n  Some have used the occasion to criticize our Nation's policies in \nIraq and the broader war on terror. Some say, on the one hand, that our \nleaders did too little before 9/11 to stop the horrible events of that \nday. Some say, on the other hand, that our leaders did too much in \nremoving Saddam based in part on the remarkable clarity that comes with \n20/20 hindsight.\n  I did not say, and consciously so, President Bush's policies but, \nrather, our Nation's policies because our policies in Iraq and in the \nbroader war on terror have generally been a consensus policy authorized \nby the Congress and ultimately implemented by President Bush. In fact, \nthe policy of regime change in Iraq was shared by the Clinton and Bush \nadministrations and is now being criticized for political gain by some \nwho voted for those very policies.\n  It is important that we set the record straight. The Senate \nIntelligence Committee report in particular directly rebuts some of the \nmore outrageous claims that administration officials, including the \nPresident himself, intentionally misled the American people. Indeed, \ndue to systemic flaws in our intelligence apparatus, it appears that it \nwas the administration itself that was misled to some extent. But that \ndoes not mean we were wrong to remove Saddam Hussein from power. There \nwere many good reasons for the regime change in Iraq in addition to \nthose which have at least so far turned out to be mistaken.\n  There is no question that the world is better off with Saddam Hussein \nin a prison cell instead of remaining in his royal palaces. There is \nevery reason to believe he is precisely where he belongs.\n  When the Senate voted overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis in October \n2002 to authorize military force to defend the national security of the \nUnited States and enforce all relevant United Nations security council \nresolutions, the resolution this body passed noted that Iraq, in 1991, \nentered into a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire agreement pursuant \nto which Iraq unequivocally agreed among other things to eliminate its \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs and the means to \ndeliver and develop them and to end its support for international \nterrorism.\n  That resolution also noted that the efforts of international weapons \ninspectors, U.S. intelligence agencies, and Iraqi defectors led to the \ndiscovery in 1991 that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons \nand a large scale biological weapons program and that Iraq had an \nadvanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to \nproducing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously \nindicated.\n  That resolution also said that Iraq in direct and flagrant violation \nof the cease-fire attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons inspectors \nto identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and \ndevelopment capabilities which finally resulted in the withdrawal of \ninspectors from Iraq on October 31, 1998.\n  That resolution went on to note that the current Iraqi regime at that \ntime under Saddam Hussein has demonstrated its capability and \nwillingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations \nand against its own people.\n\n  Iraq continues to aid and harbor other international terrorist \norganizations, including organizations that threaten the lives and \nsafety of U.S. citizens.\n  It was on this last point that Acting Director of Central \nIntelligence John McLaughlin said just yesterday in an interview:\n\n       We could, through intelligence reporting, say with some \n     credibility that there had been meetings between senior Iraqi \n     officials and Al Qaida officials. We could also say that \n     there had been some training that had flown back and forth \n     between the two sides. And we could say that there was some \n     degree of safe haven that Al Qaida-related people had \n     obtained in Iraq for a variety of reasons. We could also say \n     with some assurance that operating from Iraq, someone like \n     Abu Musab Zarqawi had arranged the assassination of an \n     American diplomat in Jordan.\n\n  Saddam dared the United Nations Security Council and the free nations \nof the world to act and act we, the coalition, did. Congress expressly \nrecognized in the authorization it gave President Bush that ``the \nattacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, underscored the \ngravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of weapons of mass \ndestruction by international terrorist organizations.''\n  We knew that Saddam had them but we did not yet know what he did with \nthem. Why he kicked out United Nations weapons inspectors in 1998 and \nnever accounted for them, all the while defying resolution after \nresolution of the United Nations Security Council we may never know for \nsure.\n  I once thought that no one would question whether America was safer \nand that the Iraqi people are better off without Saddam but some, \nduring this political season, have come awfully close. Put another way: \nDoes any reasonable person truly believe that America and Iraq were \nbetter off with Saddam Hussein in power? Surely not. Surely not. But \nyou simply can't have it both ways. You must choose, and choose we did.\n  I believe the Senate made the right decision in supporting our \nefforts in Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Nothing we learned \nsince then has changed my mind. It has been our official consensus \npolicy since 1998 under both Presidents Clinton and Bush, under both \nDemocrat and Republican leadership in the Senate. For example, in the \nIraq Liberation Act of 1998, we said:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to support \n     efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from \n     power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic \n     government to replace that regime.\n\n  Everyone, Republican and Democrat, knew that the dictatorship of \nSaddam raised the prospect of a dangerous and irrational government in \nthe Middle East. Everyone knew that the Iraqi people were living under \na brutal and murderous tyrant. And at that time everyone knew that \nSaddam was armed with weapons of mass destruction.\n  It was in a speech to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon \nstaff generally that President Clinton eloquently described the \nconsequences of inaction. He said:\n\n       What if [he] fails to comply, and we fail to act, or we \n     take some ambiguous third route which gives him yet more \n     opportunities to develop this program of weapons of mass \n     destruction. . . . He will then conclude that he can go right \n     on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating \n     destruction. And some day, some way, I guarantee you, \n     he'll use the arsenal.\n\n  That was President Clinton in 1998.\n  Our intelligence community told us before the Iraq war that Saddam \nHussein had weapons of mass destruction programs--chemical, biological, \nand possibly nuclear. Now in the past, in 1991, our intelligence had \nsometimes underestimated Saddam's capabilities; so there was no \nquestion that there was reasonable cause for concern for an armed \nSaddam, ready to lash out, without warning, against Israel, Kuwait, or \nother countries in the region. We also feared that because of his \nhatred for America, Saddam might give the weapons he was developing to \nterrorists for whom he provided sanctuary. These concerns were nearly \nuniversally shared, as articulated in the quote I read from President \nClinton.\n  At the outset of our military operations against Iraq in December of \n1998, President Clinton described the risks of leaving Saddam in power. \nHe said:\n\n       The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power, \n     he threatens the well-being of his people, the peace of his \n     region, the security of the world. The best way to end that \n     threat once and for all is with the new Iraqi government, a \n     government ready to live in peace with its neighbors, a \n     government that respects the rights of its people.\n\n  Again, a statement by President Clinton in 1998.\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\n  We should all be glad Saddam Hussein is out of power. Iraq's \nfledgling government is taking the first steps toward freedom and \ndemocracy. Neither we nor they have to fear Saddam's regime cooperating \nat any level with al-Qaida or other terrorists who wish to do violence \nagainst the American people or our allies. But it is also true that the \nweapons programs we found in Iraq were not what our intelligence \ninformation predicted before hostilities broke out in 2003. Saddam \nHussein had the capability and the raw resources to do many things, but \nhe did not at that time have the fully operational weapons systems we \nbelieved he possessed.\n  So why, it is logical to ask, did we have this problem with our \nintelligence? We know, as the unanimous, bipartisan report of the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence said, that despite the insinuations of \nadministration critics, the intelligence we had was not rigged or \ninterfered with in any way. The same conclusion was echoed by Lord \nButler's report in Great Britain which found no evidence of deliberate \ndistortion of the intelligence material or of culpable negligence. It \nis clear that any such allegations to the contrary are baseless, \npartisan, and have no foundation in the truth.\n  The Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate found in \nconclusion 83:\n\n       The Committee did not find any evidence that Administration \n     officials attempted to coerce, influence or pressure analysts \n     to change their judgments related to Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction capabilities.''\n\n  In conclusion 84, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said:\n\n       The Committee found no evidence that the Vice President's \n     visits to the Central Intelligence Agency were attempts to \n     pressure analysts, were perceived as intended to pressure \n     analysts by those who participated . . . Or did pressure \n     analysts to change their assessments.\n\n  And in conclusion 102:\n\n       The Committee found that none of the analysts or other \n     people interviewed by the Committee said that they were \n     pressured to change their conclusions related to Iraq's links \n     to terrorism.\n\n  How did we get here? How did we know that Saddam had these weapons of \nmass destruction, defied resolution after resolution of the U.N. \nSecurity Council, defied every request that he open his country to U.N. \nweapons inspectors and reveal what he had or, we might say, what he no \nlonger had?\n  Consider in 1993 we saw the first successful terrorist strike by \nradical Islamists on U.S. soil--a car bomb that exploded in the \nbasement garage of the World Trade Center, killing 6 and wounding \n1,000. Then in 1996, there was another attack on the Khobar Towers \nbarracks in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 Americans and wounding 515 \nAmericans and Saudis. In 1998, the United States embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania were attacked by al-Qaida suicide bombers who killed 234 \npeople and wounded more than 5,000. And in 2000, al-Qaida attacked the \nUSS Cole, killing 17 American sailors and wounding 39.\n  It was during these same years that Congress made dramatic cuts in \nfunding for the Government agencies most involved in the fight against \nterror, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency. These cuts were \nsignificant, including letting go nearly 40 percent of those recruited \nto spy for America's interests. The number of officers in the \nclandestine service was downsized by roughly 25 percent and nearly one-\nthird of our overseas offices were shut down. All of these cuts \nseriously hampered the intelligence community's ability to monitor and \nanalyze the rising threat posed by terrorism. Again, Acting Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency, John McLaughlin, said yesterday, \nbecause of these cuts, we were almost in Chapter 11 in terms of our \nhuman intelligence collection. This much seems clear: Our early warning \nsystem was blinded by a self-inflicted wound.\n  There is simply no way that President Bush's administration could \nhave filled all the holes of an underfunded and demoralized \nintelligence community in a mere 8 months after it had been dismantled \nsystematically and deliberately during the preceding years. So when \nPresident Bush came to office, he inherited an intelligence community \nthat was ill prepared to meet the challenges of the war on terrorism.\n  We should not make this merely a game of election year ``gotcha.'' We \nmust debate the causes of our intelligence flaws in a way that commands \nthe confidence of the American people and in a way that makes them \nsafer and freer. We must also remain committed to our task in Iraq, to \nfinishing that task and not allow election-year politics to create a \nclimate that undermines the morale of our brave troops in the field.\n  Let us finish the task we have undertaken in good faith and with the \nnoblest of aspirations on behalf of free people around the world. Let \nus not let partisan politics lead us into the trap identified by \nWinston Churchill when he said:\n\n       Nothing is more dangerous in wartime than to live in the \n     temperamental atmosphere of the Gallup Poll, always feeling \n     one's pulse and taking one's temperature.\n\n  September 11 forced the civilized world to realize that the terrorist \nfoe we had been fighting for years sought a more deadly goal than we \never suspected. Once Congress and the administration came to grips with \nthe horrible truth of this new breed of terrorism, we knew what had to \nbe done. We knew we had to take action. Under President Bush's \nleadership, we resolved that our aim was to defeat terrorism as a \nthreat to our very freedom and our very lives.\n  Nor could we achieve our aim merely by maintaining a defensive \nposture. Fighting terrorism on American soil is not enough. That is \nmerely a holding pattern and a capitulation of our responsibility. When \nit comes to confrontation with terrorists, we must either change the \nway we live or we must change the way they live. We chose the latter, \nand I believe we chose wisely. It is a policy of action rather than \ninaction, and one clearly warranted by the new reality of our post-9/11 \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8415-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8415-S8416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                Army Private First Class Gavin Neighbor\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to honor and \nremember a young man from Somerset, OH. I rise to honor Gavin Neighbor, \na soldier who gave the last full measure of devotion to our Nation on \nJune 10, 2003. On that date, Gavin was killed by a rocket-propelled \ngrenade while serving in Iraq as part of Company C, 3rd Battalion, \n325th Infantry Regiment, of the 82nd Airborne Division. At the time of \nhis death, Gavin Neighbor was 20 years old.\n  When Gavin Neighbor was killed, Marisa Porto, who at the time was a \njournalist with the Zanesville Times Recorder, had a very difficult \ntime writing about Gavin. She struggled to write about his life and his \ndeath because she said she knew she had to balance the reporting of the \nnews with the personal connection she felt knowing that someone so \nyoung from her own community had just been killed. She managed, though, \nto find the right words and wrote the following:\n\n       My thoughts [are] simple. Gavin Neighbor's family won't get \n     the chance to see his wedding announcement in his newspaper. \n     They won't ever have the opportunity to see his son's birth \n     announced in this newspaper. These next few days may be the \n     last time his name is ever published in this newspaper. . . . \n     So, let's give him the homecoming he deserves.\n\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, since his death, I have learned \nthat Gavin Neighbor, in his all-too-brief 20 years on this Earth, did, \nin fact, live life fully. He was an outgoing, determined young man, who \nfelt great love and affection for his family, for his fiancee, his \nfriends, and his country.\n  Gavin was born in Newark, OH, on November 25, 1982. He graduated from \nNew Lexington High School in 2001, where high school friends described \nhim as dependable and fun loving. Gavin was a gifted artist. He had a \nsignature piece: a drawing of a dragon. His friends say he would draw \nthat dragon anywhere, anytime.\n  He loved to draw, and he was good at it. According to his high school \nart teacher, Jody Bowen:\n\n       Gavin would work on projects on the side, after his \n     classwork was done. I saw something more in him. . . . He \n     certainly impacted my life. I feel fortunate I met him and \n     got to know him.\n\n  Equal in his devotion to art, Gavin was committed to serving his \ncountry and making his family proud. Gavin had a strong sense of duty \nand a strong sense of family. He was always trying to take care of \nothers and protect others. That is part of what compelled him\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\nto join the military. He wanted to follow in the footsteps of several \nrelatives. Like them, he wanted to protect his family and his friends \nand his country. So after his high school graduation in 2001, Gavin \nenlisted in the U.S. Army.\n  According to Gavin's grandmother, Gladys Hykes:\n\n       He was wonderful. He loved the service. That was his goal.\n\n  Gavin planned to make a career for himself in the military, aspiring \nto join an elite Ranger battalion. He was well on his way toward \nachieving that dream. Gavin earned his paratrooper wings and was known \nfor performing, with ease, some of the most difficult airplane jumps. \nKnown as a ``Javelin Jumper,'' he would jump from planes while carrying \npart of an antitank missile system strapped to his leg. Upon receiving \nan award of recognition for this accomplishment, Gavin dedicated it to \nhis parents and had his thanks to them engraved on the plaque.\n  Gavin loved his family very much. He had an especially strong bond \nwith his mother Cathy. Oh, he loved her cooking. He loved to spend time \nwith her. He wrote and called home often, and when he did he had simple \nrequests. According to his mom, Cathy:\n\n       I kept sending him letters and boxes. He wanted Kool-Aid \n     and chips. And Copenhagen. He wanted Copenhagen. I didn't \n     want to send it, but I did.\n\n  Gavin called home on February 13, 2003, to say his unit was leaving \non Valentine's Day for Iraq. Soldiers only had an hour for family \nvisits. Cathy and her husband Willie drove more than nine hours to \nvisit one last time with Gavin. As Cathy said:\n\n       All I knew was that I had to get there. I had to be there \n     to hug him.\n\n  Many of his fellow comrades have said that Gavin Neighbor was the \nkind of soldier you wanted by your side--any time, any place. He was \ndependable. He was tough. He was a real leader.\n  Gavin was also known for his ability to make light of serious \nsituations--an admirable quality in the face of war. While training in \nCalifornia, to humor his comrades, he would walk around flapping his \narms like a chicken and then claim to be a dinosaur. During a punishing \nmountain hike, Gavin lightheartedly asked his leader, ``Are we there \nyet? Are we there yet?'' The other members of the platoon could not \nhelp but smile. As Sergeant Arthur Swartz said at Gavin's memorial \nservice:\n\n       When we were at our lowest, Gavin could turn the whole \n     platoon around just by making a joke or saying something \n     funny. . . . He was definitely the best, youngest soldier in \n     my platoon.\n\n  Gavin's unique sense of humor did not cloak the fact that he was also \na very hard worker and a very independent young man. Captain Todd \nHollins, a chaplain with the 82nd Airborne Division, said that when he \nthinks of Gavin:\n\n       I see a young man who chose to walk the road less \n     traveled--a man who gave 100 percent, all the way, all the \n     time. . . . I see a young man, one who cared about others \n     more than himself, a man with a zest for life, who was \n     willing to face his fears. . . . I see a volunteer, a bold \n     spirit. I see a young man who was genuine in all regards.\n\n  Gavin Neighbor's dependability, commitment, and fun-loving attitude \nwill never be forgotten. His life is an example for us all. Left to \ncherish his memory are his parents; his sisters, Roxanne Lewis and \nTracy Neighbor; brother Willie Neighbor, Jr.; and Gavin's special \nfriend--his fiance, his soulmate--Rachel Sanderson.\n  Gavin Neighbor was just a good kid, who died too young. I think that \nBrigadier General Abe Turner, assistant division commander of \noperations with the 82nd Airborne, said it best:\n\n       He quickly became a very important part of our band of \n     brothers. We asked him if he'd be willing to pay the ultimate \n     sacrifice, and he did. . . . He was our hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8416-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8416-S8418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about patient safety. \nThere is bipartisan legislation pending in the Senate that is \nabsolutely critical to reducing health care errors and increasing \nhealth care quality. It is S. 720, the Patient Safety and Quality \nImprovement Act.\n  The HELP Committee reported this bill to the Senate in November of \nlast year. It was approved in committee by a unanimous vote. It is past \ntime for the Senate to vote on and pass this important legislation.\n  This patient safety legislation is an important step toward building \na culture of safety and quality in health care. The Patient Safety and \nQuality Improvement Act would create a framework through which \nhospitals, doctors, and other health care providers can work to improve \nthe health care quality in a protected legal environment.\n  The bill grants privilege and confidentiality protections to health \ncare providers to allow them to report health care errors and near-\nmisses to patient safety organizations.\n  The bill also allows these patient safety organizations to collect \nand analyze the data confidentially. After analyzing the data, patient \nsafety organizations would report on trends in health care errors and \noffer guidance to providers on how to eliminate or minimize these \nerrors.\n  Some of this takes place today, but much more information could be \ncollected and analyzed if providers felt confident that reporting these \nerrors did not increase the likelihood that they or their colleagues \nwould be sued for honest mistakes.\n  This legislation would not permit anyone to hide information about a \nmedical mistake. Under the bill, the lawyers still can access medical \nrecords or other information that would normally be recoverable in \nlegal proceedings. However, the bill would ensure that the analysis of \nthat information by patient safety organizations would take place on a \nseparate track than in a protected legal environment.\n  Health care providers would be much more likely to share information \nabout honest mistakes and how to prevent them if they have some \nassurance the analysis of their information will not result in a tidy \npackage of information a personal injury lawyer could use against them \nin court.\n  Errors in medical treatment take place far too often today. \nUnfortunately, providers live in fear of our unpredictable and unfair \nmedical litigation system, and this legal fear inhibits efforts to \naddress the root causes of health care errors. Without appropriate \nprotections for the collection and analysis of patient safety data, \nproviders are unwilling to report mistakes and errors, which is one of \nthe reasons health care quality today is not what it could be.\n  Litigation does nothing to improve quality or safety. The constant \nthreat of litigation indeed stifles honest analysis of why health \nerrors happen. This is one more reason why we need wholesale reform of \nour medical litigation system. We need to foster alternatives that \nrestore trust between patients and providers and result in fair and \nreliable outcomes for both parties. We need to scrap the present \nsystem, not just cap it. Until we do so, we should take whatever steps \nwe can to create an environment that protects the collection and \nanalysis of patient safety data so providers can learn from their \nmistakes and the mistakes of others and prevent them from happening in \nthe future.\n  The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act is one of these steps. \nLast week, our committee chairman, Senator Gregg, asked for unanimous \nconsent that we move to consideration of this legislation in the \nSenate. This is the third time since November he has done so. Each time \nhe has been blocked by our colleagues in the minority, even though the \ncommittee of jurisdiction was unanimous--you cannot get more bipartisan \nthan that--in support for the bill.\n  My colleagues in the minority keep talking about problems with health \ncare quality, as they keep on talking about the loss of American jobs. \nHowever, talk is cheap when their actions don't match their words.\n  If they are really so concerned about improving health care in our \nNation, why would they object to a bill that would reduce errors and \nimprove patient safety, particularly a bipartisan bill with unanimous \ncommittee support? If they are really so concerned about American \nworkers and jobs, why won't they let a bill improving the Nation's job \ntraining system go to conference?\n  Another example of what is happening or not happening in the Senate: \nWe have a bill, a bipartisan bill, that\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\nwill help workers get back to work or find better jobs. This bill will \nequip our workforce with skills necessary for America to compete and \nsucceed in the global economy. It reauthorizes and improves the \nNation's job training that was created under the Workforce Investment \nAct. The Workforce Investment Act provides job training and employment \nservices to more than 900,000 unemployed workers each year. Just like \nthe patient safety legislation, this bipartisan bill passed out of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee unanimously. We passed \nit on the Senate floor by unanimous consent last November. Remember, \nthat is as bipartisan as you can get.\n  Where is the bill now? Well, it passed in the House, too. The House \nhas a somewhat different version. When there is a different version \nbetween the House and the Senate, you normally would have a conference \ncommittee, and the conference committee would work out the differences \nso that both Houses could pass it again as a unified bill that would \nthen go to the President to be signed. It has to be one bill that goes \nto the President, not two bills that go to the President. You have a \nconference committee to work those bills out.\n  Now, the House appointed a conference committee. It is a very simple \ntask. You just figure out how many Members are going to be in the \nconference committee, and Members are chosen from both sides of the \naisle in both Chambers to meet together to talk about the differences, \nto propose alternatives, to vote on those alternatives, and to come up \nwith a compromise bill. Sometimes the compromise is taking all of one \nChamber's bill and eliminating the other one. Usually it is somewhere \nin between.\n  The first excuse I heard on this Workforce Investment Act, which will \ntrain 900,000 people to do jobs they do not have now or definitely to \nhave better jobs than what they might have now, with a particular \nemphasis on moving women into higher paying jobs was how bad the \noutsourcing is in this country. Yes, because we do not have trained \nworkers to take those jobs at the present time. We hear about the wages \nin this country. Yes, because the people do not have the higher skills \nfor which you get paid higher wages.\n  This bill would provide training for jobs we are having to send \noverseas right now or better paying jobs for American workers. We \npassed it unanimously. The House passed it. The House appointed a \nconference committee. We are not even allowed to appoint a conference \ncommittee, to get together and talk about it with the House. That is \nnothing final. It would have to be voted on again before it could be \npassed. There is an opportunity for a filibuster at that final point. \nInstead what we are getting is a filibuster at this point, a very \nsubtle filibuster but nevertheless a filibuster.\n\n  If jobs are important, why aren't we doing this JOBS bill that was \nunanimously passed out of committee and unanimously passed on the floor \nof the Senate? A lot of opportunity, and it is passing by. I guess \nbecause there is a Presidential election, and it might help President \nBush if there were more jobs. Actually, the only ones it would help, if \nthere are more jobs, is the people getting those jobs. None of us ought \nto be stopping people from getting jobs or getting better jobs. We \nrecognize that. That is why we passed it unanimously.\n  So where is that bill now? We can't get a conference committee \nappointed to resolve the differences with the House. There was enough \ntrust in what I did in committee that it passed unanimously. There was \nenough trust when it came to the Senate floor that we passed the bill \nunanimously. The only thing I can see that has happened in the meantime \nis that we have gotten closer to an election. That should not happen in \nAmerica. We teach people bad things about elections when we hold up \nimportant things such as workforce investment for jobs. If we really \nwant to take care of jobs and workers in this country, we should \nappoint conferees for the Workforce Investment Act legislation.\n  I could run through a few more excuses that I have heard on this \nbill. One of the excuses was that we might put something in that would \nallow faith-based groups to participate in job training and, under that \nscenario, put in something that would allow them to not hire people who \nare averse to their religion.\n  Members may be surprised to find out that we already have statutes \nthat do provide that churches, when they are involved in government \nwork, can't discriminate, except they don't have to hire people who are \naverse to their religion. That would be a very small change if it made \nit in there at all, but we are not even allowed to get together and \ndiscuss whether that would make it in there for fear that maybe it \nwould. Again, that is just an excuse for not passing the bill, an \nexcuse to keep jobs from being created which would make the economy \nbetter and which would improve the President's chances of getting \nreelected. That is not how politics is supposed to work.\n  I have to say there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats \non most of the big issues facing our Nation. If my colleagues in the \nminority want to bottle up legislation with which they disagree, that \nis their prerogative. But that is not what I am talking about. I am not \ntalking about bottling up issues with which they disagree. We have \nmembers of the minority party holding up bipartisan bills that received \nunanimous approval in committee--that is where the patients safety bill \nis--and holding up conferences on a bill that received unanimous \nsupport on the Senate floor. That is where the workforce bill is.\n  The only logical conclusion I could draw to these roadblocks is based \non politics, not policy, and that is a shame.\n  Right now, the Senate floor reminds me of the airspace above a busy \nairport. We have a number of bipartisan bills lined up for final \napproach, but our colleagues in the minority are holding those bills up \nand won't allow them to land. The tactics of my colleagues in the \nminority give new meaning to the term ``holding pattern.'' That should \nnot happen. There is going to be a crash.\n  It is time for our Democratic colleagues to break this holding \npattern so we can pass bipartisan bills such as the Patient Safety Act \nand the reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act. These are not \nonly bipartisan bills, they received unanimous committee support. Let's \nset election politics aside for a moment. These are bipartisan bills, \nso no one party can claim credit for their passage.\n  The Patient Safety Act was introduced by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, who is the lone independent in the Senate. \nThis bill is more than bipartisan. My distinguished Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, suggested last week that we should approve the House-\npassed patient safety bill. He suggested we should take up the House \nbill rather than pass the Senate bill because Members of the House are \nthe true experts on such complex legislation.\n  I wonder if my colleague's opinion would be the same on medical \nliability reform. After all, the expert legislators in the House have \nsent us some excellent legislation to reform our medical litigation \nsystem. Perhaps we should stop working on this in the Senate and \napprove the House bill, as he is suggesting we should do with patient \nsafety.\n  I mentioned the Workforce Investment Act. The House passed that one. \nTheir version is considerably more difficult, perhaps more conservative \nthan the version I worked through with unanimous consent on this side, \nbut if we are going to consider them the experts on patient safety, why \ndon't we consider them the experts on workforce investment and take \ntheir version of the bill? We didn't do that on that bill.\n  No, the right way to do it is to pass the patient safety bill, \nhopefully, by unanimous consent over here because there is no \ndissension on it. The dissension is with what they are doing over on \nthe House side. So we would go ahead and pass it, and then we have a \nconference committee, a conference committee in the old-fashioned \nstyle. Not this ``let's preconference and give somebody on the minority \nside a veto right over anything that is done.'' That is a brandnew \ntwist around here. What we have always done is appointed the conference \ncommittee, recognizing that there are majorities and minorities even on \nthe conference committee,\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\nbut that the point is to get the agreement between the House and the \nSenate. We will get that agreement between the House and the Senate, \nand will have better patient safety.\n  I hope our colleagues in the minority will agree to take 2 hours of \ntheir time to debate and vote on the bipartisan safety act. Two hours \nis not a lot of time. It is the least we can do on such an important \npiece of legislation. We have spent hour upon hour working on this bill \nin committee and crafting a bill that received unanimous bipartisan \nsupport. Let's spend 2 more hours on the Patient Safety Act so that we \ncan improve the quality and safety of health care in America. I don't \nthink that is too much to ask.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8418-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DEPARTURE OF REPRESENTATIVE C.J. (CHIEN-JEN) CHEN\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, a good friend of the Senate Taiwan caucus, \nAmbassador C.J. (Chien-Jen) Chen, will soon be leaving Washington, \nD.C., after having served for nearly 4 years here as Taiwan's principle \nrepresentative. We are going to miss him very much. As chairman of the \nTaiwan caucus, I would like to bring special attention to his \naccomplishments for his country and his commitment to the advancement \nof freedom.\n  Ambassador Chen brought a wealth of experience to his job. He was \nfirst assigned to Washington, D.C. in 1971, and he spent most of his \ndistinguished 37-year career promoting good relations between Taiwan \nand the United States. Over the years, he won many friends for himself \nand for his country. An eloquent speaker and polished diplomat, \nAmbassador Chen also has a reputation for being a ``straight shooter.'' \nHe was always prepared to provide an informed, balanced, and fair \nopinion on the complex relationship between Taiwan and the United \nStates as well as the broad range of political, economic, cultural and \nother issues of common interest to our two countries.\n  Ambassador Chen's skill and determination as a representative of \nTaiwan have been made plain in many ways, but I want to mention one in \nparticular. He has persistently pushed for Taiwan to have a role in \ninternational organizations. That is a real challenge, because Beijing \nopposes it at every turn, but Mr. Chen has pressed on. Owing in large \npart to his efforts, much progress has been made on these issues. \nDuring his most recent assignment in Washington, with U.S. support, \nTaiwan has acceded to the World Trade Organization and become our \neighth largest trading partner. At the same time, Taiwan has also \ncontributed greatly to U.S.-led international humanitarian efforts in \nplaces such as Afghanistan and Iraq, and it has cooperated with the \nUnited States in fighting proliferation, terrorism, and money \nlaundering in Asia.\n\n  All these matters required intensive communication and coordination, \nand we were lucky to have someone like C.J. Chen in place to lead the \nway. He understands that the people of Taiwan are as entitled to the \nblessings of liberty such as shared knowledge and the free exchange of \ninformation. Fighting for this freedom, he has had a special \ndetermination to secure Taiwan's entrance into the World Health \nOrganization, an issue on which he and I have worked together. As the \nSARS virus swept Asia and frightened the entire globe, he seized the \nmoral initiative to say the Taiwanese people are also vulnerable to \nthis disease and that Taiwanese doctors also may heal. He clearly \nstated that they have a right to seek help and to give it, and that no \npetty, technical political agenda should stand in the way of that \nsimple affirmation of humanity. When the doors to the WHO are thrown \nopen for Taiwan, and they will be, people will remember with gratitude \nhow C.J. Chen moved us toward that day.\n  One of the most notable and likable things about C.J. is his \ninexhaustible optimism. While the United States-Taiwan relationship has \ncertainly experienced its fair share of twists and turns, ups and \ndowns--as Mr. Chen will surely attest--he has always remained \nconsistently upbeat. His confidence is contagious, and I agree \nwholeheartedly with his observation, that Taiwan and the United \nStates--united by shared values and common interests--will continue to \nwork closely together, not only for their mutual benefit but also for \nthe sake of lasting peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.\n  Now, after having served as his chief representative in the United \nStates, as his country's foreign minister, as member of Taiwan's \nLegislative Yuan, and as a university professor, this man of \nextraordinary talent and vision is leaving Washington, DC. While he \nwill be sorely missed, I am certain that he has established an \nadmirable legacy of friendship, trust, and cooperation that will long \nendure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8418-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8418-S8419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President. Today I would like to recognize women in \ntechnology. While gender equity is not found on the agenda when \ndiscussing homeland security, it certainly is a key strategy for \nmaintaining our Nation's preeminent status in science and technical \ninnovation. The last 30 years have seen women make great strides in \neducation and employment. Women are receiving more than 50 percent of \nthe bachelor degrees conferred and are close to reaching parity in the \nonce male-dominated fields, such as law. Unfortunately, these gains \nhave not been uniform in all fields. Women continue to be persistently \nunderrepresented in high-demand, high-wage science, technology, \nengineering and math, STEM, education and employment. While women make \nup 46 percent of the American labor force, they are less than 25 \npercent of the total science and engineering workforce, and have not \nbeen able to break through a 10 percent ceiling in engineering.\n  At a time when we face a shortage of skilled STEM workers who are \nU.S. citizens, women provide an untapped national resource to fill the \nworkforce pipeline. Recent studies from the National Science Foundation \nand the Department of Commerce confirm these conclusions, including the \nSeptember 2000 Report of the Congressional Commission on the \nAdvancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and \nTechnology, which concludes that, ``Unless the STEM labor market \nbecomes more representative of the general U.S. workforce, the nation \nmay likely face severe shortages in [STEM] workers and thus risks \nundermining its global competitiveness.''\n  We are at a serendipitous time, when our Nation's economic and \nsecurity imperatives are aligned with social justice. We must leverage \nthis opportunity to build the requisite partnerships with stakeholders \nin government, academia, and industry to recruit, train, and retain \nwomen and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. Not only is it a \nstrategy that will ensure our global competitiveness and national \nsecurity, but it is the right thing to do to ensure that all our \ncitizens have equal access to the education and training needed to \nsucceed.\n  In 1999, when I recognized that the jobs at the Maui High Performance \nComputer Center and other related research and development contract \nactivities were being filled by males recruited from the mainland, I \nsecured Department of Labor funding to launch the Women in Technology \nproject designed to bring Hawaii's women into these emerging STEM \nfields. The island of Maui reflects the characteristics of many rural \nAmerican communities: professional isolationism, limited access to \nhigher education, overdependence on a single economic engine, and \nperceived limited career opportunities for its young people. These \nconditions uniquely position Maui to pilot workforce development \nprogramming that can be exported to other rural communities.\n  The Women in Technology, WIT, project is administered by the Maui \nEconomic Development Board, a private nonprofit organization well \nrespected for its leadership in helping to diversify the economy \nthrough high technology industry development. The board of directors, \ncomprised of community leaders in industry, academia, business, and \ngovernment gave the project access to key partners. Interviews, focus \ngroups, and roundtable discussions helped establish the workforce \nchallenges and skill sets needed to sustain industry growth \nprojections. Workshops were designed to provide tools to educators and \nindustry on how to overcome the barriers that had created the chilly \nclimate for women. Buy-in was established that even though teachers and \nemployers had no\n\n[[Page S8419]]\n\nintent to track girls and women into different fields than boys and \nmen, long-established cultural stereotypes of gender roles were \nimbedded throughout society and insidious messages of what were \nappropriate female jobs versus male jobs were very strong. The WIT \nproject provides ongoing technical assistance to educators, guidance \ncounselors, and industry partners on recruitment and retention skills \nto overcome these societal barriers.\n  We must start young. By middle school our girls lose interest in math \nand science, unless proactive efforts are exerted. In a survey of Maui \nstudents, boys were five times more likely than girls to express \ninterest in careers in computer science and engineering. Despite the \nfact that girls outperformed boys academically in math and science, \ntheir personal esteem in these areas was significantly lower and they \ndid not self-select into the physical sciences. After compiling a \ndatabase of female industry role models, WIT has developed a multitrack \nprogram to keep girls engaged in the STEM pipeline. Job shadowing \nprograms, career days, science camps, and mentoring are anchor events \nin the program designed to influence career intent.\n  Attrition has been another factor in keeping the number of women in \nSTEM low. Mentoring has been identified as the most successful \nintervention strategy. WIT successfully negotiated with MentorNet, a \nPresidential award winning program that has been deployed at elite \nengineering research universities. Maui Community College was accepted \ninto MentorNet's first community college cohort and the program has \nsignificantly reduced the female attrition from its STEM courses.\n  The Women in Technology project continues to work with local industry \nto develop internship and apprenticeship programs. Four years later, \nthe number of women in technical employment at the Maui Research & \nTechnical Park has gone from 0 percent in November 1999 to 23 percent \nin June 2004. This is the direct result of a local industry and \neducation commitment to build a qualified resident workforce that \nreflects the diverse demographics of its community, including gender \nbalance.\n  We must use this time when both our Nation's security and its \neconomic strength are dependent on producing more citizens trained in \nSTEM fields, to assure that we do not perpetuate the climate which has \nprecluded women and minorities from entering these fields. Gender \nequity in science, technology, engineering, math, education, and \nemployment equals homeland security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8419-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

FLANAGAN\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to pay tribute \nto Newman Flanagan, a dedicated public servant from Massachusetts who \nis retiring after a distinguished career in law enforcement. Mr. \nFlanagan served as a Boston prosecutor for 32 years, with the last 14 \nof those years as Boston District Attorney. For the last 12 years, he \nhas served as the Executive Director of the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, a position from which he is now retiring. I commend him on \nhis many years of outstanding work and dedication.\n  Newman is a son of Boston who graduated from Boston College and the \nNew England School of Law. I had the privilege of serving under him and \nlearning from him when I was an assistant district attorney in the \noffice in the early 1960s, before I came to the Senate. He was elected \ndistrict attorney in 1978, and was re-elected for four additional \nterms. During his long and impressive career, he represented the state \nin more than 2,500 criminal prosecutions, including 75 murder cases. \nScott Harshbarger, former Attorney General of Massachusetts, described \nhim as ``Mister District Attorney of the United States.''\n  Newman also deserves great credit, in his years at NDAA, for his \nleadership in creating the National Advocacy Center, which trains local \nand Federal prosecutors, and is one of the finest training centers of \nits kind in the country. As James C. Backstrom, Dakota County Attorney \nin Minnesota and a past vice president at NDAA said, ``He will be \ndeeply missed by all members of NDAA's Board of Directors and \nprosecutors throughout America. Newman Flagagan has been a timeless \nleader of America's prosecutors for more than three decades. We all owe \nhim our thanks and gratitude for his efforts on our behalf.''\n  I know that his wife, Eileen, and his children and grandchildren are \nproud of all he has accomplished. Newman Flanagan has served the people \nof Massachusetts and our country well, and I wish him a long and happy \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8419-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On October 14, 2003, a gay man named Ricardo Lorenzana, 47, was \nstruck in the head with a baseball bat and needed 14 stitches to close \nthe wound. He said the attack makes him constantly worry about his \nsafety. Soon after Lorenzana was attacked, a 19-year-old gay man was \nassaulted, warding off blows from the bat but getting cut by a knife. \nAuthorities said the assailants used antigay slurs during that attack.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8419-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8419-S8420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO LAURANCE SPELMAN ROCKEFELLER\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a great \nAmerican, a true Vermonter and a good friend who passed away on July \n11th. That friend is Laurance Spelman Rockefeller.\n  Thirty-five years ago, Mr. Rockefeller received the highest honor \nthat our country can bestow upon a civilian when President Johnson \nawarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his philanthropic and \nconservation efforts. That award did not culminate a lifetime of \naccomplishment, but rather served as a milestone for the beginning of \nanother three-and-a-half decades of benevolent contributions by Mr. \nRockefeller. In 1991, Laurance Rockefeller was again honored with the \nCongressional Gold Medal awarded by President George H.W. Bush.\n  Laurance Rockefeller was instrumental in establishing the Virgin \nIslands National Park and donated land for, or helped with the \nacquisition of 11 other national parks, national battlefields and \nnational monuments.\n  In 1958 Mr. Rockefeller chaired the Outdoor Recreation Resources \nReview Commission. The Commission's landmark report led to creation of \nour national system of wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and \nFederally protected trails.\n  I knew Laurance Rockefeller and his wife, Mary French Rockefeller, as \nresidents of and benefactors to the town of Woodstock, VT. Laurance and \nMary Rockefeller preserved the character of Woodstock, as an historic \nvillage surrounded by rolling hills and farms, while also building its \neconomic vitality. The Rockefellers built the Woodstock Inn and Suicide \nSix ski area into successful economic engines for the area, and \nestablished the Billings Farm and Museum. Conservation easements were \nalso secured on surrounding lands to help protect the village from \nsprawl.\n  These projects were all undertaken with a careful eye towards \nsustainability. The businesses are viable enterprises and the nonprofit \nentities are\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\ngenerously endowed and tended to by the Woodstock Foundation, also \ncreated by the Rockefellers.\n  Mr. Rockefeller was a quiet and unassuming man who sought no personal \nrecognition for his work in Woodstock and truly loved the small \nvillages and agricultural landscape of rural Vermont.\n  The crown jewel of the Rockefellers' contributions to Woodstock and \nto the Nation is the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical \nPark, encompassing the buildings and grounds of their family estate, \nwhich they donated to the United States. As the only national park \ndedicated to the history and future of conservation thought and \npractice, the park is a fitting legacy for a man known as America's \nleading conservationist.\n  Laurance will be sorely missed by all those who knew him and by those \nwho have been able to enjoy the fruits of his conservation \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8420-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION: PRESERVING HISTORY AND PERPETUATING \n                               TRADITION\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I would like to \nshare with you and my colleagues my appreciation for Neal Corey of \nMcCook, NE. Neal is my cousin and a role model to Americans, a \npreserver of history, and a perpetuator of tradition.\n  Neal Corey, who is now a retired conductor for Burlington Northern \nRailroad, is the third generation of his family to maintain a farm in \nRed Willow County, a homestead that is still on its original site in \nNebraska. A pioneer of subsurface irrigation in his county, Neal has \nhelped others in his area to set up similar irrigation systems during \nhis retirement to improve farming efficiency.\n  As you can see, Neal has been perpetuating tradition and preserving \nhistory through a lifetime of service to his family at the farm, to the \nrailroad, and to his neighbors. History has always interested him, but \nit literally took a greater vessel to move him to become an active part \nin preserving it. Neal's curiosities were piqued when he read a small \narticle in the hometown newspaper we share, the McCook Gazette, about \nthe recreation of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n  After Neal sent in his $50 membership fee to the Discovery Expedition \nof Saint Charles, MO, he decided that wasn't enough. No, Neal decided \nhe wanted to contribute something more than $50. So he looked into what \nit would take to be a part of this expedition.\n  He thought it might be fun to get out and do some ``camping'' during \nhis retirement. It was only during his training for the expedition, \nwhen he found himself wearing historical fashions that include long-\nsleeved cotton shirts, canvas pants, and a wool army coat during the \nsummertime, that he realized just which kind of camping he would do.\n  To this day, Neal selflessly contributes his time, his enthusiasm, \nand his energy to the Discovery Expedition of Saint Charles, MO. \nThrough this expedition, Neal's goal is to preserve the history made by \nMeriwether Lewis and William Clark when they first set out to explore \nthe unknown of a new Nation.\n  Each year, the Discovery Expedition reenacts a different part of the \noriginal river journey--a journey that began in 1803 in Elizabeth, PA, \nand extends to Great Falls, MT.\n  This year, Neal will be participating in the Nebraska portion of the \nriver journey of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. This portion is \nscheduled to reach the Missouri River around July 16, and will include \nweek-long activities at Fort Calhoun, NE, beginning July 30.\n  I have been so inspired by Neal's energy and enthusiasm that I, too, \nwill take part in a portion of this great commemoration. Through his \nexample and his service, Neal Corey has been a force in both the \npreservation of American history, and the perpetuation of American \ntraditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8420-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING THE CITY OF FREEMAN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to publicly recognize \nand acknowledge the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of \nFreeman, SD.\n  Freeman was settled throughout the 1870s by German and Russian \nimmigrants. By 1879, like many cities throughout South Dakota, a \nrailroad stop had been established in Freeman and was a center for \nimmigrants arriving at that period of time. In 1893, the town was \nofficially incorporated.\n  By 1893, Freeman had established numerous businesses, schools, and \nmany residences. The town of Freeman combines a rich heritage with \nstrong hopes for the future. The Freeman Area Veterans Memorial and the \nHeritage Hall Museum are two examples of the town's appreciation for \nits rich history. Two strong schools give the town an appeal to \nfamilies raising children and comprehensive medical services attract \npeople to retire in Freeman. A strong, diverse economy including retail \nbusinesses, professional services, and manufacturing components keeps \nFreeman strong.\n  Freeman is the type of town that forms the backbone of rural life in \nSouth Dakota. Hometown values, respect for neighbors, and a commitment \nto its past all point to a prosperous future for Freeman. It is with \ngreat honor that I advise my colleagues of the achievements made by \nthis great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8420-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO FRANCIS MATTHEW McFAUN\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate and thank \nFrancis Matthew McFaun, an outstanding citizen and a Vermont leader in \nthe fight against poverty. As he prepares to retire from his position \nas manager of the Central Vermont and White River district offices of \nthe Vermont Department of Employment and Training, it is significant to \nrecognize how much one person can achieve in serving others.\n  ``Topper,'' as he is known to his colleagues, family, and friends, \nhas had a distinguished 37-year career with the State of Vermont. He \nmoved to Vermont in 1966 to start a pilot of the Neighborhood Youth \nCorps Program with the Central Vermont Community Action Agency. He \nmoved up through the organization, quickly becoming director of the \nVermont Office of Economic Opportunity. From there he began working for \nthe Vermont Department of Employment and Training, where he has become \nan institution. Topper is deeply committed to improving the quality of \nlife of Vermonters through strengthening communities and improving our \nworkforce. He has also served with great distinction and exhibited \nleadership at both the State and local level and is involved with \nnumerous community activities. From his current role as chairperson of \nthe Barre Town Select Board to his veteran position as the Spaulding \nHigh School Varsity Ice Hockey coach, Topper is tireless in his \ndevotion to his State.\n  I also have the pleasure of having his daughter, Molly McFaun, on my \nState staff. Molly exhibits the work ethic and compassion that has \ndriven her father throughout his career. Topper established himself \nthrough his efforts to help others, and the legacy of his work lives on \nin his daughter. We are truly fortunate to have Topper and Molly \nworking in a field where the benefits of their kindness and support are \nreaped by people all around the State. I thank Topper not only for his \nmany years of exemplary service, but also for teaching his children the \nvalue that is public service.\n  It is people like Topper, who give so greatly of themselves without \nexpectation of recognition or personal gain, that make our communities \nstronger, better places to live. I want Topper McFaun to know that his \nyears of dedicated service have not gone unnoticed. I am proud to stand \nhere and tell you about such a great Vermonter. I wish him and his \nwife, Mary Ann, best wishes as they venture into the next chapter of \ntheir lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8420-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8420-S8421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING THE CITY OF BROOKINGS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I would like to honor and \npublicly recognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of \nBrookings, SD.\n  The city and the county were both named for Wilmot W. Brookings, one \nof the first settlers in the Dakota Territory. Arriving in June of \n1857, Brookings was a highly respected explorer with great amounts of \ncourage, energy, ability, and perseverance. He settled in Sioux Falls \non August 27, 1857. Beginning the trip in January of 1858, he was\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\nsoon set upon by a heavy blizzard, the result of which required the \namputation of both feet. Not to be deterred, Brookings continued settle \nthe area, eventually becoming a leader in a number of government \nentities. The town and county were named for him in his honor and out \nof respect for all he did in the settlement of Dakota Territory.\n  Before Brookings' arrival, the area was populated by American \nIndians. Large mounds that were used as burial grounds have been found \nin the area, as well as stone hammers and other stone tools. Fur \ntraders entered the area as early as 1750.\n  Originally, settlers founded the town of Medary in 1857 in what would \nbecome Brookings County. Oakwood and Fountain, two other small \nsettlements, were also founded at this time and all were hopeful that \nrailroad tracks would be laid through the city. On October 18, 1879, \nthe railroad passed through Main Street in Brookings, which greatly \nhelped the town to grow and prosper. Many of the residents and \nbusinessmen in Medary and Fountain would eventually move to Brookings.\n  Currently, over 18,000 people live in Brookings. The town boasts \nnumerous businesses, as well as South Dakota State University. The city \nhas already started celebrations for its 125th anniversary and will \ncontinue them throughout the year. These include a ``Crazy Days'' \ncelebration, a large art exhibit, and a tour of historic homes \nthroughout the city. It is with great honor that I advise my colleagues \nof the achievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8421-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8421-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/19/senate-section/article/S8421-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1914.

A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to provide States with the option to cover certain legal immigrants \nunder the Medicaid and State children's health insurance programs; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am introducing the Immigrant Children's \nHealth Improvement Act today.\n  This legislation would allow States the option to once again provide \nMedicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) coverage \nto legal immigrant children and pregnant women.\n  Traditionally, Medicaid and SCHIP have served as vital components of \nour nation's health care safety net. These programs have provided \ncoverage to over 50 million non-elderly, low-income Americans, most of \nthem children, and have helped to dramatically reduce infant mortality \nand provide health care for millions of poor children whose families \ncannot afford the high cost of private health insurance.\n  However, for many low-income families that are income eligible for \nMedicaid and SCHIP, these safety programs are today little more than a \nmirage--an illusion to those who need them most. The 1996 welfare \nreform law arbitrarily barred states from using Federal funds to \nprovide health coverage to low-income legal immigrants during their \nfirst 5 years in the United States.\n  While the goal of welfare reform was to encourage self-sufficiency in \nadults, the legislation unfortunately has punished children. Today, \nhalf of all legal immigrant children from families making less than 200 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Level are uninsured. That's over two and \na half times the uninsured rate for children who are United States \ncitizens.\n  In the long term, ignoring the health care needs of legal immigrant \nchildren\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\nand pregnant women will prove more costly than providing care today. \nChildren and pregnant women who do not have access to preventive care \noften use the emergency room as a first resort--an expensive treatment \nfor conditions that could have been treated at a fraction of the cost \nor possibly even prevented.\n  The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2000 estimated \nthat $1 spent on prenatal care for immigrant women saved $3 in short-\nterm postnatal costs and $5 in longer-term costs. By spending on \nprevention today, we can reduce health care costs in the future.\n\n  Another result of the 1996 legislation was to push the costs of care \nto the States. The 20 states with the highest number of legal \nimmigrants all used to have state-financed health care programs for \nlegal immigrant children or pregnant women. States put these programs \nin place because they recognized the enormous toll the 1996 rules have \ntaken on state budgets, when states have to provide preventable \nemergency-room care to thousands of uninsured legal immigrants.\n  But due to the recent State budget crisis, some of these states \ncannot now afford programs that are exclusively state-financed. In my \nhome state of Florida, for example, new enrollment in the program has \nbeen frozen.\n  This amendment allows states the option to use Medicaid and SCHIP \nfunding to cover legal immigrant children and pregnant women. Over the \nlast 6 years, Senator Chafee and I, along with our colleagues in the \nHouse and Senate, have worked to restore this option and we've come \nvery close to achieving our goal.\n  Last year, a 3-year restoration provision was included in the Senate-\npassed Medicare prescription drug bill, with 65 Members supporting it. \nOver 400 national, state, and local organizations have supported this \nlegislation, including the National Governors Association, the National \nConference of State Legislatures, the American Academy of Pediatrics, \nand numerous immigrant, ethnic, labor, health and faith-based \norganizations.\n  Despite this support, Congress has yet to enact legislation that \nrestores health benefits to legal immigrant families.\n  Why?\n  Some Members argued it didn't belong on a Medicare bill but instead \non a welfare reauthorization bill. That was one of the reasons it was \ndropped from the Medicare bill. But the same argument has been made \nwhen it was discussed in the context of welfare--that it is not a \nwelfare issue, it's a health care issue.\n  Well, while this volleyball match continues, legal immigrant families \nin this country continue to work hard and pay taxes, while being denied \nthe benefits of the system they are paying into. Meanwhile, States \ncontinue to provide as much care as they can from strapped state \nbudgets. We need to send a clear message about our concern for \nuninsured children and we need to stop pretending that our federal \npenny-pinching is cost free to the states or to taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, legal immigrants pay taxes, serve in the military, and \nhave the same social obligations as United States citizens. Legal \nimmigrant children are, as much as citizen children, the next \ngeneration of Americans. It is important that all children start off on \nthe right foot towards good health. This provision can help them do \njust that.\n  This legislation is offset by a custom user fee extension included in \nthe President's budget.\n  I hope that we will begin consideration of this important measure \nbefore the August recess. The health and lives of many children is at \nstake, and there is simply no reason to delay any further.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Alexander, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2686. A bill to amend the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical \nEducation Act of 1998 to improve the Act; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Carl D. \nPerkins Vocational and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2004. The \nPerkins Act is a central part of a combination of federal education and \ntraining programs that provide opportunities for lifelong learning to \nour workforce. The Perkins Act, together with the Workforce Investment \nAct, the Higher Education Act, and other federal education programs, \nprovides the resources that are needed to help adequately prepare \nstudents of all ages for jobs in high-wage and high-skilled \noccupations. In this technology driven, global economy, everyone is a \nstudent who must adapt to the changing needs of their jobs and the \nworkforce by continuing to pursue an education in their chosen field. \nIn turn, Congress must ensure that education and training are connected \nto the needs of business, including small businesses, now and into the \nfuture as well.\n  It is my hope that this body will take the necessary action to \nreauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act. \nThe Act is an essential part of a combination of federal education and \ntraining programs that will strengthen our workforce and enable America \nto compete--and succeed--in the global economy.\n  At a hearing held on June 24, 2004, before the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, members heard testimonies from leaders in \ncareer and technical training emphasizing the importance of constant \ntraining, retraining and upgrading of the skills today's jobs require. \nMany students leaving high school or college and entering the workforce \nfind that they are unprepared for life because they lack the skills \nthey need to succeed in the workforce. This country created over 1 \nmillion new jobs since January. That's great news. Unfortunately, the \ncomplaint heard from employers is that there are too few skilled \nworkers to meet their needs. We have a strong interest in making sure \nthis is corrected. The Perkins Act, along with the Higher Education and \nWorkforce Investment Act would provide both strong academic and \nrelevant job skill training to promote and sustain the long-term \ncompetitiveness of this country.\n  A unique aspect of the Perkins program that addresses the needs of \nthe changing workforce is that it targets funds to both secondary and \npostsecondary schools. This unique aspect also provides a good platform \nfrom which we can better coordinate workforce preparation policy and \ntraining with an emphasis on lifelong learning. It is essential to \nfacilitate a sequence of career or technical education courses that a \nstudent can complete before they even get to college, and that they can \ncontinue at the postsecondary level, whenever they decide to go on. Dr. \nMichael Rush, the Idaho Division of Professional-Technical Education, \nBoise, ID, Administrator, used the example of student Chelsie Lea \nMarier in his testimony to stress this point. He said Chelsie \ntook professional-technical classes in welding, auto technology, \nmechanics and power technology at her home high school, Meridian High. \nAs a high school senior, she enrolled in an automotive collision repair \nprogram at the Dehryl Dennis Technology Center. During this time, \nChelsie took advanced placement academic classes and was President of \nher Skills-USA chapter. She is now enrolled in the auto body program at \nthe College of Southern Idaho, and she intends to continue her \neducation and become an auto collision forensics investigator. She is \nan excellent example of how linking academic and technical skills \nattainment can lead to success in the workforce.\n\n  In order to strengthen schools programs at both the secondary and \npostsecondary level that meet local workforce needs, provisions in the \nPerkins Act must include the participation of business, including small \nbusiness. In my home state of Wyoming, a career and technical education \ninstructor by the name of Ted Schroeder is doing a lot of what I've \njust described. He has met with the local Chamber of Commerce in Rock \nSprings, WY, to identify workforce needs and matched his programs with \nindustry standards to meet those needs. When the local business \ncommunity suggested they needed students with computerized accounting \nskills, he took on the task of designing curriculum to help his \nstudents acquire the skills the businesses had requested. His efforts \nare a good example of what\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\nPerkins funds are intended to accomplish. It is my hope that we can \nincrease the successes of the Perkins program, just like Ted has done \nin the community of Rock Springs.\n  I'm pleased to have worked with the Members of the Committee and \nstakeholders on a bipartisan bill that will improve the Perkins Act to \nbetter meet the needs of students, workers, and business. The \nlegislation I am introducing today, with my colleagues Senators Gregg, \nKennedy, Alexander, Dodd, Jeffords, Bingaman, Murray, Sessions, Reed \nand Clinton, will help strengthen the Perkins program by improving \naccountability, involving businesses in career and technical education \nprograms, emphasizing challenging academic instruction, and advancing \nthe field of career and technical education by linking those programs \nto advances in industry.\n  This legislation would also encourage greater collaboration between \nstate agencies responsible for education and workforce activities. This \nlegislation requires state agencies to work together on identifying the \nneeds of the workforce and designing curriculum to match those needs. \nIt also emphasizes the needs of nontraditional students and other \nlifelong learners, who are returning to school for the first time, or \nthose who are seeking additional skill training.\n  This legislation also continues to emphasize the need to introduce \nwomen and girls to high skill, high wage jobs. It is important that we \nhelp expand the vision of our students to ensure they consider all the \noptions that are available to them, not just the ones that fit general, \nand sometimes erroneous, conceptions.\n  I hope our bipartisan efforts will continue to produce results as we \nmove the bill through the Senate and into Conference. I do not wish to \nsee another piece of bipartisan legislation lost in the legislative \nlimbo of election year politics. An important step that the Senate must \ntake is to appoint conferees to finish the reauthorization of the \nWorkforce Investment Act. That program offers the resources that are \nneeded to help adequately prepare more than 900,000 unemployed workers \nfind work each year. It passed the Senate unanimously, both in \nCommittee and the floor. Conferees must now be appointed before the \nAugust recess. It we are going to help workers in this country, we must \nsend this important legislation to Conference so that it will \nultimately reach the President and be signed into law.\n  I cannot stress enough the importance of federal initiatives like the \nCarl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act and the \nWorkforce Investment Act to keep American workers and businesses \ncompetitive. The Perkins Act can help close the gap that threatens \nAmerica's long-term competitiveness. It is essential that we take \nadvantage of the opportunity we have during this reauthorization \nprocess to improve the link between education and relevant academic and \nskills preparation. By so doing, we will create a pathway to prosperity \nfor American workers and businesses alike, that both will make good use \nof for years to come.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues, \nSenators Gregg, Enzi, Dodd, Jeffords, Bingaman, Murray, Reed and \nClinton in introducing the bipartisan reauthorization of the Carl \nPerkins Vocational Education Act. We have worked closely with leaders \nof the secondary and post-secondary vocational education community to \nmake important improvements in this important program in current law. \nAmong the key issues we addressed are the more effective integration of \nacademic and technical education, the use of funds for secondary and \npost-secondary programs, the Tech Prep Programs that form the bridge \nbetween the high school and college training programs, and the need for \nstudents to have access to good information about emerging and existing \njob opportunities in high-wage, high-skill and high-demand careers.\n  Since passage of the original Smith-Hughes Act in 1917, the Federal \nGovernment has recognized the importance of good preparation for \ntechnical occupations. Over the years, we have made a series of \nrevisions in the law to reflect the growing importance of combining \nacademic learning with technical skill learning in order to meet the \nchanging needs of American business and industry.\n  This bill is an example of how we can work well together when we \nfocus on good policy. I look forward to action on this bill in our \nLabor Committee before the recess, and to its enactment into law this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 2687. A bill to provide coverage under the Railway Labor Act to \nemployees of certain air and surface transportation entities; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nhelp ensure that employees of ``express carrier'' delivery companies \nare treated like employees who perform the same duties for other \ndelivery, companies when it comes to Federal labor law jurisdiction.\n  Over the years, there have been many advances made in the way \ncitizens and businesses ship goods from city to city. Numerous air-\ncarrier and cargo services make the delivery of goods speedy, reliable \nand affordable. Truck, air and rail delivery networks are in place \nacross the country. These operations employ large workforces that \nperform various types of work in a range of conditions.\n  Some of the leading delivery companies appear to have similar \norganizational structure and clientele. But there is a disparity in the \nterms and conditions of their workers' employment. Some of the \ncompanies provide full- and part-time workers with good wages and \nbenefits, including medical plans, dental coverage and paid vacation \ntime. Others take a lower road, in part by using independent \ncontractors and anti-union campaigns.\n  Unfortunately, Federal law facilitates this difference. It ensures \nthat all of the workers at one of the largest companies which delivers \nby air are covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), even when those \nworkers do the same jobs as employees at other delivery companies who \nare covered by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). What is the \ndifference? Under the NLRA, workers can act locally in seeking to \norganize and bargain collectively. Under the RLA, workers must organize \nnationally, an enormous challenge in today's labor environment.\n  Congress created the concept of an ``express carrier'' in 1996, \nputting all the employees of one large company under RLA jurisdiction, \nregardless of individual employees' relation to air transportation. \nThat means those workers cannot organize a union chapter locally, \nweakening their opportunity to bargain for better wages, benefits and \nworkplace conditions.\n  This bill provides that employees of an express carrier will be \ngoverned under the RLA only if they are licensed airmen, aircraft \nmaintenance technicians or aircraft dispatchers. That is consistent \nwith the treatment of other delivery companies' workers.\n  The bill delivers fairness to responsible employers trying to do the \nright thing for workers while remaining competitive. It seeks to raise \nliving standards, not encourage a race to the bottom.
