Mr. President, I would like to use a few minutes of my \nleader time to talk about a remarkable new effort that is being \nlaunched today to try to develop a broader national consensus about the \nkind of future we want in America and how we can achieve it. It is \ncalled the Wellstone Civic Dialog Project. It is being organized by \nWellstone Action, a progressive advocacy organization created by Paul \nand Sheila Wellstone's sons Mark and David to keep their parents' work \nand spirit alive.\n  The first meetings will be held this evening. In what may be the \nlargest book group ever, thousands of ordinary Americans in 40 States \nwill meet in private homes, schools, churches, community centers, \nbookstores, and hundreds of other places to discuss the direction and \nthe future of our Nation. Those attending the discussion are encouraged \nto read a book Senator Wellstone wrote which was published the year \nbefore he died. It is called ``The Conscience Of A Liberal.'' If the \ntitle evokes memories of another book, it is deliberate.\n  In the introduction of his own book, Paul recalled the good-natured \nribbing some of his Republican colleagues gave him when he attended \nBarry Goldwater's funeral service.\n\n       They gave me Goldwater's ``The Conscience of a \n     Conservative'' to read on the plane. ``Paul,'' they said, \n     ``read this; we read this book at young ages and it set us on \n     the right path. We still have hope for you.''\n\n  Paul replied that he, too, had read Senator Goldwater's book at a \nyoung age and explained: ``That's why I'm a liberal.''\n  ``But,'' he said, ``I also told them that I admired Barry Goldwater \nfor his political integrity.''\n  More than almost anyone else I have ever known, Paul Wellstone had an \nunshakable faith in the fundamental decency of most people and in the \ngenius of democracy. He believed if we\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\nfaced our challenges squarely and listened respectfully to each other, \nwe would discover that most of us share the same values, the same \nconcerns, and the same dreams; that we would also discover the \nsolutions and strength to overcome almost any obstacle.\n  The Wellstone Civic Dialogue Project is an attempt to bring ordinary \nAmericans together to develop a consensus to move America in a more \nhumane, more progressive direction. It is what Paul called ``citizen \ndemocracy.''\n  Groups will meet in more than 600 communities throughout America. In \na touch that I am sure Paul Wellstone and Barry Goldwater would have \nappreciated greatly, in several of the groups self-declared Republicans \nand Democrats have agreed to sit face to face and discuss their ideas \nand values.\n  The first meetings, as I said, will take place this evening in more \nthan 600 communities throughout America. A topic for tonight's \ndiscussion is ``Can we dream again?'' It is a reference to a quote by \nEleanor Roosevelt that Paul loved and preached often. The future will \nbelong to those ``who believe in the beauty of their dreams.''\n  It is expected that groups will meet as many as eight additional \ntimes over the next several months to discuss issues ranging from \neducation and health care, to domestic violence, money and politics, \nand the war in Iraq. Anyone interested in attending a Civic Dialog \nProject discussion can go to the Wellstone Action Web site, \nwww.wellstone.org, to find a discussion group near them or to download \nstudy guides for any of the discussion topics.\n  If there isn't a group in your neighborhood, you might want to \nconsider starting one. The Wellstone Action group has trained hundreds \nof volunteer facilitators to help people set up and run discussion \ngroups in their own communities.\n  Before Paul came to the Senate, he was a political science professor. \nBut there was nothing the slightest bit academic or abstract about his \npolitics. He used to say: ``People yearn for a `politics of the \ncenter'--not the `center' so widely discussed by politicians and \npundits in Washington but, rather, a politics that speaks to the center \nof people's lives: affordable child care, good education for children, \nhealth security, living-wage jobs that will support families, respect \nfor the environment and human rights, and clean elections and clean \ncampaigns.\n  You can see that yearning today in the record turnouts in \nPresidential caucuses in primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, and so many \nother States. Instead of questioning each other's character and motives \nand patriotism, people want politicians to talk honestly about the \nconcerns at the center of people's everyday lives.\n  One of the concerns is the refusal by some insurers to provide fair \nand equitable treatment for people with mental illness. Nothing made \nPaul angrier nor offended him more deeply than the stigma attached to \nmental illness and the discrimination and suffering that people with \nmental health problems suffer as a result of that stigma. He thought it \nwas cruel that people with mental health problems often received lesser \ncare than those with physical health problems. He was outraged by the \nterrible toll such discrimination often takes on people with mental \nillness and their families. He and Senator Domenici introduced a bill--\nnow called the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act--to \nend such discrimination. The bill was reintroduced at the beginning of \nthis Congress, but it has been stalled in committee for more than a \nyear now because of opposition from the insurance industry and its \nallies.\n  Last October, on the first anniversary of the plane crash that killed \nPaul and Sheila, their daughter Marcia, and four others, I asked \nunanimous consent that the Senate take up and pass the Wellstone Mental \nHealth and Treatment Act. It would have been the perfect tribute to \nPaul.\n  The Republican leadership blocked that request. But they gave us \ntheir word that the Senate will consider the Wellstone mental health \nbill early this year. I am here to say, very clearly, that Democrats \nintend to hold them to that promise.\n  Like tens of millions of Americans, Paul Wellstone knew well the \nanguish that mental illness can cause families.\n  Nearly 50 years ago, when his older brother Stephen was a freshman in \ncollege, he suffered a severe mental breakdown. Stephen Wellstone spent \nthe next 2 years in mental hospitals. Eventually, he recovered and \ngraduated from college--with honors--in 3 years. But it took his \nimmigrant parents 20 years to pay off the bill from those 2 years.\n  In his book, Paul recalled the years that Stephen was hospitalized. \n``For two years,'' he wrote, ``the house always seemed dark to me--even \nwhen the lights were on. It was such a sad home.''\n  Fifty years later, there are still far too many sad homes in America; \nthere are still far too many families that are being devastated by the \nphysical and financial consequences of mental health problems. In many \ncases, they have health insurance. But their insurance companies refuse \nto pay for the mental health care they or their loved ones need.\n  I hear from such families every week.\n  Three days ago, a woman from Sioux Falls called my office. She is \nabout 50. She and her husband have two children, and they have health \ninsurance through his job. Years ago, she suffered one of the most \nagonizing losses a person can endure: Her 3-year-old daughter died from \nspinal meningitis.\n  She now suffers from chronic depression, which she manages with the \nhelp of medication and therapy.\n  Recently, the cost of her medication jumped from $100 a month to $500 \na month, and her insurance company informed her that she has now hit \ntheir lifetime cap on mental health benefits, so they will no longer \npay anything for her medications or her therapy.\n  So she and her husband now face a choice: pay the entire cost of her \nprescriptions and her therapy each month, out of pocket, or pay their \nmortgage.\n  She was fighting back tears when she called my office. She said, ``If \nI had a heart ailment, they wouldn't think twice about sending me to a \ncardiologist. But there's such a stigma associated with mental \nhealth.''\n  She added, ``This isn't something I've chosen any more than people \nwho suffer from diabetes or heart disease chose their conditions.''\n  What makes her story even more terrible is how many other people in \nthis country are having to fight the same fight, and make the same \nawful choices. No family is untouched by mental health problems. Fifty-\nfour million Americans suffer from some form of mental illness. They \ninclude Republicans, Democrats, and people who don't care at all about \nparty labels.\n  Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici were about as far apart politically \nas two people could be. But they shared a common bond: They both had \npeople in their families, who they loved, who were affected by mental \nillness. They were unlikely but great allies.\n  In 1996, thanks in large part to their leadership, Congress passed \nthe Mental Health Parity Act. It says that group health plans sponsored \nby employers with 50 or more workers cannot place annual or lifetime \ndollars limits on mental health benefits that are more restrictive than \ntheir limits for physical health care.\n\n  It was an important step forward. But discrimination persists; we \nknow that. Some insurers openly disregard the law. Some have found new \nways to restrict mental health benefits. The results can be \ndevastating: unemployment, broken homes, shattered lives, poverty, poor \nschool performance--even suicide.\n  The Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act does not \nforce employers to offer mental health coverage. It simply says that if \nemployers offer mental health benefits, insurers cannot provide more \nrestrictive coverage for mental health benefits than they do for other \nmedical and surgical benefits.\n  Some insurers already meet this basic fairness standard. They are to \nbe commended for doing the right thing. But others will not do the \nright thing unless they are required by law to do so. So Congress needs \nto act.\n  The insurance industry claims--incorrectly--that requiring insurers \nto treat mental illness the same way they treat physical illness will \ndrive premiums up so high that more people will lose their health \ninsurance. Their claims are not true. They are simply scare tactics; \nwe've heard them before.\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\n  The truth is, two highly respected organizations have analyzed the \nPaul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act. The private \naccounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts the bill would \nincrease health insurance premiums by one percent. One percent. That \nworks out to $1.32 per month. The Congressional Budget Office predicts \nan even smaller average increase: nine-tenths of 1 percent. I think \nmost families would consider that was a very good deal.\n  Senators Domenici and Wellstone modeled their bill on the mental \nhealth parity provisions on the Federal Employee Health Benefits \nProgram. For 3 years, Senators and the other 8.5 million members of \nthat program have had the protection of genuine mental health parity. \nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, it has increased \npremiums only 1.3 percent. And that includes parity for substance abuse \nservices, which are not included in the Wellstone mental health bill.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, President Bush said, ``Our country must make a \ncommitment: Americans with mental illness deserve our understanding and \nthey deserve excellent care. They deserve a health care system that \ntreats their illness with the same urgency as physical illness.'' We \nurge the President to back up his words with leadership.\n  The Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act is \ncosponsored by 68 Senators--more than two-thirds of this Senate. It is \nalso supported by more than 360 national organizations--90 of which \nhave added their support just since October.\n  Groups endorsing the Wellstone bill include the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the Alzheimer's Association, the National PTA, the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America, Catholic Charities, the \nNational Association of Counties, the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Nurses Association, the American Association of Pastoral \nCounselors, the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, the National \nRural Health Association, the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome, and many other groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the complete list be inserted at the \nclose of my remarks in the Congressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, nearly 50 years after mental illness \nbrought such sadness and financial strain to Paul Wellstone, doctors \nand scientists have made great strides in understanding and treating \nmany mental health problems. But those advances mean little to those \nwho cannot afford them.\n  In South Dakota and throughout America, there are still too many \nhomes that seem dark even when the lights are on. There are too many \npeople who are being denied essential mental health care because of \narbitrary decisions by insurance companies putting profits ahead of \npeople.\n  The Wellstone bill can change that. We have a commitment from the \nMajority Leader that the Senate will deal with this issue early this \nyear. We are determined to see that that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n361 organizations supporting the paul wellstone mental health equitable \n  treatment

Mr. President, during this week, I have \nspoken--and this will be the third statement--about the need to reform \nour Nation's intelligence agencies. I have suggested that the horrific \nacts of September 11, 2001--acts which killed nearly 3,000 Americans in \nNew York, Washington, and Pennsylvania--could have been avoided if our \nintelligence agencies had been more organized and more focused in \ndealing with the threat of international terrorism. These conclusions \nwere largely the result of the work of the House-Senate joint inquiry \non September 11, 2001. This bicameral, bipartisan committee finished \nits investigation on December 20, 2002, and filed its report. In that \nreport, it concluded there were a number of problems with our existing \nintelligence networks and it made 19 recommendations of how to fix \nthose problems.\n\n  Repairing the flaws in our intelligence community is a matter of \nnational security, a matter of the highest importance and urgency. As \nwe are now learning in the context of the war with Iraq and Saddam \nHussein's weapons of mass destruction, policymakers cannot make wise \ndecisions affecting the security of American people without timely, \naccurate, credible information, and tough-minded, independent analysis, \nand will use that information to shape the judgments of the President \nand other decisionmakers, not to validate previously held opinions. If \nwe fail to accurately perceive future threats, we will be poorly \nprepared to respond to them. If we do not perceive current threats \naccurately, then our response may be either inadequate or excessive.\n  Whether restraining the development of proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction or interdicting terrorists, now, more than ever, \nintelligence matters. If there is another terrorist attack on American \nsoil, the American people will demand to know what the Congress, what \nthe President, what other governmental institutions learned from the \nSeptember 11 attacks, and now the prewar intelligence in Iraq, and how \nthat information was used to protect them. There will be no avoidance \nof accountability for the next attack, either for Congress or the \nPresident. We must take our responsibility seriously.\n  Further, we must recognize that every day needed intelligence reforms \nare delayed is a day of unnecessary risk for the American people. \nUnfortunately, with regard to the recommendations of the joint inquiry \ncommittee, very little has been accomplished to date. In my two \nprevious statements, I discussed the status of these recommendations \ndealing with the intelligence community reform and specific responses \nto terrorism. I particularly commend Senator Dianne Feinstein for her \nleading role in the area of reorganization of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Today I will turn to two additional areas of particular concern: the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the application of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which governs the use of \nelectronic eavesdropping on foreign nationals in the United States. \nHere, I particularly recognize the contributions of Senators DeWine, \nDurbin, Edwards, and Kyl to this section of our report.\n  We know now the FBI did not have or did not give adequate attention \nand resources to the problem of terrorism prior to September 11, 2001. \nFor the FBI, terrorism was a lesser priority and its personnel did not \nunderstand the FISA and therefore did not use effectively its available \ninvestigative authority. Important information was not shared with \nother agencies, was not shared even within the various branches of the \nFBI itself. During the summer of 2001, separate parts of the FBI had \ninformation that could have been used to disrupt or destroy al-Qaida's \nhijacking plot, but that information was never collectively analyzed.\n  For example, what agents in Minnesota knew about Zacaria Moussaoui, \nthe so-called twentieth hijacker who was taken into custody in August \nof that year, is he was studying to fly commercial airlines but was \ndisinterested in either taking them off or landing them. Meanwhile, a \nPhoenix field agent of the FBI had become suspicious of radical \nIslamists who were also learning to fly airplanes. An agent in San \nDiego was working with an informant who knew at least two of the \nhijackers. The informant was aware that one of the future hijackers was \nmoving to Arizona with a fellow terrorist--again to attend flight \nschool.\n\n  If these agents had been aware of each other's activities or if the \nanalysts at FBI headquarters had connected these geographically \nseparate events, portions of the September 11 plot might well have been \nuncovered and disrupted. Unfortunately, the FBI lacked the sufficient \nnumber of analysts to process all the relevant information, and \nbarriers to sharing information prevented agents from learning about \neach other's activities, even though both the Phoenix memo which \nexpressed concern that bin Laden was sending young recruits to the \nUnited States for pilot training and the\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\nMoussaoui investigation were handled by the same unit at FBI \nheadquarters.\n  Furthermore, although existing laws gave FBI agents the authority to \npursue these leads, individual agents were in some cases unaware of \ntheir powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and this \nconfusion prevented them from pursuing aggressively potentially helpful \nlines of investigation.\n  With these facts in mind, the joint inquiry made four recommendations \nrelated to the FBI and FISA which I will now discuss.\n  Recommendation No. 6 calls for the FBI to improve its domestic \nintelligence capability as fully and as quickly as possible and to \nestablish clear counterterrorism priorities for the agency to follow. \nSpecific areas for improvement are mentioned, including the need to \nimprove analytical capability, the need to disseminate intelligence \ninformation within the FBI and among Government agencies, the need to \nimprove knowledge of national security laws, the need to hire more \npersonnel with linguistic skills, and the need to fix persistent \ninformation technology problems.\n  Our joint inquiry report gives a thorough explanation of why each of \nthese improvements is necessary. In the years leading up to September \n11, the FBI was faced with a shortage of counterterrorism personnel \npartly due to a lack of overall resources, partly because \ncounterterrorism priorities were not clearly established or followed. \nIn particular, the number of qualified intelligence analysts was at a \ncritically low level. This is the reason the memo from the FBI agent in \nthe Phoenix field office did not generate any further discussion or \nanalysis and is also the reason no one at the FBI headquarters was able \nto connect the dots and see that information collected by the FBI in \nCalifornia, in Minnesota, in Arizona was all related to a larger \nterrorist plot. The analyst shortage was compounded by outdated \ninformation technologies and the lack of a good counterterrorism \ndatabase which made it difficult for analysts to assess and organize \ncrucial information.\n  Prior to September 11, the FBI also had a severe shortage of \nlinguists. For example, 35 percent of all materials collected by the \nFBI in the Arabic language were not even reviewed because there were \nnot enough persons within the FBI to translate that material. This one \nfact may have deprived the Bureau of potentially valuable terrorist-\nrelated intelligence which could have avoided September 11. Even in \nthose cases where the Bureau did collect and identify information on \nterrorist activity, it failed to share that information with other \nagencies, both inside and outside the intelligence community.\n  For example, if the Federal Aviation Authority had been told in \nAugust of 2001 that the FBI had identified a potential airline suicide \nhijacker in Minnesota, the FAA would have had at least the opportunity \nto increase security precautions on domestic flights such as by \nreinforcing the doors between the cockpit and the passenger cabin. \nTragically, this did not happen.\n  I am pleased to report some improvement has been made in these \nproblem areas. In 2003, the Bureau developed a strategic plan outlining \nits top counterterrorism priorities. It has also increased hiring and \ntraining and many agents have been permanently reassigned to high \npriority areas. However, while hiring and training have increased, the \nGeneral Accounting Office has suggested the FBI continues to lack fully \nadequate analytical capability and that the Bureau continues to face a \nshortage of linguists and information technology personnel as well as \nadministrative staff.\n  Even more troubling is the fact that officials in Federal agencies, \nState governments, and local levels continue to report they do not \nconsider the current information-sharing system to be effective. With \nfew exceptions, these individuals say they are not receiving all the \ninformation they need to fulfill their responsibilities as the front \nline of our war against terrorism.\n  In some cases this is because information is simply not available. \nBut too often it is because of institutional practices that prevent \nimportant information from being shared. Even when information is \ndisseminated, officials at all three levels report that it is \nfrequently inaccurate, irrelevant, and not received in a timely \nfashion.\n  This situation is made worse by the fact that none of these problems \nare new. In the year 2000, two separate commissions on national \nsecurity pointed to these same weaknesses within the FBI and urged that \nthey be corrected.\n  The National Commission on Terrorism, also known as the Bremer \ncommission, issued its report in June of 2000, and the Advisory Panel \nto Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism Involving \nWeapons of Mass Destruction, known as the Gilmore commission, issued \nits second report the following December.\n  Both commissions stated that the FBI needed to improve its analytical \ncapability and disseminate information in a more timely manner inside \nand outside the Bureau.\n  The two commissions also suggested that FISA gave the FBI more \ninvestigative powers than were currently being used, and the Gilmore \ncommission suggested that this was due to misunderstanding and \nconfusion regarding the law. The Bremer commission also called \nattention to the shortage of skilled linguists within the agency, which \nis a problem that we still face today.\n  Since September 11, FBI Director Mueller has initiated a serious and \nsustained effort to reform and reshape the FBI to fight terrorism. \nProgress has been made. However, much is left to be done.\n  One particular area of concern is the information technology systems \nat the FBI. The computer and communication systems at the FBI have been \nnotoriously outdated.\n  I recall a meeting at one of our CIA stations in the Middle East \nduring which the agency personnel pleaded with the Members of Congress \nwho were present to push the FBI toward adopting computer systems that \nwould be compatible with the CIA's so that basic information could be \nshared.\n  A recent report by the General Accounting Office on this subject is \nhighly critical of the FBI's attempts to improve its information \ntechnology systems. As we saw in our investigation of the September 11 \nattacks, the best work of skilled agents is wasted if they cannot \ncommunicate it to those who will use it. We cannot rest until we are \ncertain the FBI has made all the changes it so desperately needs.\n  Recommendation No. 7 advises the Congress and the administration to \nevaluate and consider changes to the domestic intelligence sector.\n  In the short term, our national security interests are best served by \ntaking actions to improve the capabilities of the FBI. However, over \nthe long term, we must decide on the best way to organize our domestic \nintelligence agencies and consider serious restructuring if we conclude \nthat the current structure is inadequate to serve our national security \ninterests.\n  The joint inquiry recommended that FISA be included in this review. \nThis recommendation reflects concerns that the FBI, which is primarily \na law enforcement organization, is inherently ill-suited to the \nchallenge of domestic intelligence gathering.\n  While the agency has done a commendable job carrying out its law \nenforcement missions, preventing attacks before they occur requires an \napproach very different from finding and punishing criminals after they \nhave acted. Throughout its history, the FBI's focus has been on \ninvestigating crime and arresting criminals rather than preventing \ncrime.\n\n  The lapses that preceded 9/11 may therefore be in part the \nconsequence of requiring the same agency to carry out two very \ndifferent functions. One example of this tendency of the FBI is how it \ndefines investigatory targets. It tends to do so in terms of those that \nare likely to result in a prosecution as opposed to those that pose the \ngreatest threat.\n  I recall during one of our Senate Intelligence Committee hearings a \nsenior FBI official was asked to provide an estimate of the number of \nsuspected terrorists within a specific region of the country. He \nresponded by giving us the number of open investigative files at a \ncertain field office--clearly a law enforcement methodology rather than \nthe approach that an intelligence agency would take. I would note that \nnone of the 19 hijackers of September 11 had an open FBI file that \nwould have\n\n[[Page S605]]\n\nmarked them as a suspected terrorist in our midst.\n  Our recommendations on the FBI consisted of three parts: First, we \nsaid in the short term we should do everything possible to strengthen \nthe capability of the FBI to fight the war on terror. The FBI is all we \nhave at the present time, and we need to make it as effective as \npossible.\n  Second, we need to conduct an open debate on the type of domestic \nintelligence that we as a nation want and need. We can look to other \nnations for models which are based on the perceived threat within the \nborders of each of those nations. They range from the extremely high \nlevel of surveillance that the Israeli Government exercises to protect \nits citizens from internal terrorist threats to the resistance to \nscrutiny of private citizens in certain regions of Germany.\n  Third, we need to evaluate the enhanced capability of the FBI against \nthe model that we establish as our desired end state, and then \ndetermine if our security needs could be better met by creating a \nseparate domestic intelligence agency, leaving the FBI to focus on law \nenforcement priorities. That model exists in Great Britain, where \nScotland Yard, like the FBI, handles national domestic law enforcement \nmatters, but there is a separate agency, the MI5, which performs \ndomestic intelligence gathering.\n  To date, no changes have been made to FISA since we issued our \nreport, nor has the larger debate regarding the structure of our \ndomestic intelligence community taken place.\n  Our joint committee called for Congress to request a report from the \nadministration regarding the structure of our domestic intelligence \nprogram. So far, no action has been taken on this recommendation.\n  Recommendation No. 8 calls for the Attorney General and the FBI to \nassure that the FBI uses its powers effectively and disseminates \ninformation quickly. In particular, it calls for FBI personnel to \nreceive in-depth training on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nand to implement a plan to use FISA to assess the threat of terrorist \ngroups within the United States. It specifically refers to the need to \nidentify whether and how any of these groups receive funding or support \nfrom foreign governments.\n  The need for clearer guidelines and better training regarding the \nFISA was made abundantly clear during the FBI's investigation of \nZacharias Moussaoui. Agents in Minnesota correctly suspected that he \nwas involved in a hijacking plot, but even after he was detained by the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, the agents concluded that FISA \ndid not give them the authority to search his belongings since it was \nnot established that Moussaoui was acting as an agent of a foreign \npower.\n  This conclusion was incorrect under the FISA law. It demonstrates the \nsignificant confusion and ambiguity that has developed surrounding the \nuse of FISA and that reform is important and urgent.\n  FISA is also one of the best tools we have for tracking terrorist \nfunding. However, it is not always used to its fullest potential. For \nexample, the chief of the FBI's Financial Crimes Section told our \ncommittee that if asked, he would have been able to locate hijackers \nNawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mindhar by tracking credit card and \nbanking transactions. These same powers could have been used by the FBI \nto track foreign sources of terrorist funding, with the aim of cutting \noff funds for terrorists and attacking these sources of funding \ndirectly.\n  The FBI has made significant progress in increasing awareness and \nknowledge of FISA. The Attorney General has issued new guidelines \nregarding terrorist investigations, and both current personnel and new \nhires are now receiving training on these guidelines.\n  Unfortunately, the Bureau has not made very good progress identifying \nforeign sources of funding for terrorist groups within the United \nStates.\n  As an example, as I emphasized in my previous statements, the joint \ninquiry uncovered significant evidence of foreign government \ninvolvement in the 9/11 attacks, and raised the possibility that \nforeign governments continue to provide support to terrorist groups \nwithin the United States.\n  In spite of this alarming assessment, the FBI has not even developed \nan effective plan to assess the threat of foreign funding for terrorist \ngroups, let alone combat this threat.\n  The USA PATRIOT Act and subsequent modifications have given the \nBureau expanded access to banking and financial records, but it has \nbeen widely noted that terrorist groups use alternative methods of \ncollecting, moving, and storing their money.\n  These methods include illegal drugs and other contraband; shipment of \ngems and other commodities; informal financial networks, such as the \nhawala system; and nontransparent organizations, such as charities and \nreligious organizations.\n  The FBI, which is responsible for leading these investigations into \nterrorist financing, has acknowledged it does not systematically \ncollect and analyze data on alternative financing mechanisms. Unless \nal-Qaida develops a policy of transferring money entirely by ATMs, the \nFBI's current investigatory methods are unlikely to be very effective.\n  The final recommendation of this report is No. 9, which urges the \nHouse and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees to evaluate the \nFISA, and all modifying legislation, such as the USA PATRIOT Act, to \nensure that our legal system adequately addresses current and future \nterrorist threats. These House and Senate committees have effectively \nbegun to follow through on this task, and I am confident they will \ncontinue to do so.\n  This last report is one bright spot on an otherwise disappointing \nreport card.\n  In evaluating the status of the joint inquiry's recommendations, I \nhave tried to give due attention to those areas in which progress has \nbeen made. However, we must not ignore those shortcomings that remain, \nparticularly when so many of them are of such a serious nature. We must \novercome bureaucratic inertia and organizational difficulties to fix \nthese problems in an effective and expeditious manner. We must not \ncontinue to be a slave to the status quo. Our national security and the \nwell-being of the American people demand nothing less, as does the \nmemory of nearly 3,000 innocent American lives lost on September 11, \n2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the recommendations of the Joint Inquiry \nCommittee, as adopted on December 10, 2002, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Recommendations--December 10, 2002\n\n       Since the National Security Act's establishment of the \n     Director of Central Intelligence and the Central Intelligence \n     Agency in 1947, numerous independent commissions, experts, \n     and legislative initiatives have examined the growth and \n     performance of the U.S. Intelligence Community. While those \n     efforts generated numerous proposals for reform over the \n     years, some of the most significant proposals have not been \n     implemented, particularly in the areas of organization and \n     structure. These Committees believe that the cataclysmic \n     events of September 11, 2001 provide a unique and compelling \n     mandate for strong leadership and constructive change \n     throughout the Intelligence Community. With that in mind, and \n     based on the work of this Joint Inquiry, the committees \n     recommend the following:\n       1. Congress should amend the National Security Act of 1947 \n     to create and sufficiently staff a statutory Director of \n     National Intelligence who shall be the President's principal \n     advisor on intelligence and shall have the full range of \n     management, budgetary and personnel responsibilities needed \n     to make the entire U.S. Intelligence Community operate as a \n     coherent whole. These responsibilities should include: \n     Establishment and enforcement of consistent priorities for \n     the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence \n     throughout the Intelligence Community; setting of policy and \n     the ability to move personnel between elements of the \n     Intelligence Community; review, approval, modification, and \n     primary management and oversight of the execution of \n     Intelligence Community budgets; review, approval \n     modification, and primary management and oversight of the \n     execution of Intelligence Community personnel and resource \n     allocations; review, approval, modification, and primary \n     management and oversight of the execution of Intelligence \n     Community research and development efforts; review, approval, \n     and coordination of relationships between the Intelligence \n     Community agencies and foreign intelligence and law \n     enforcement services; and exercise of statutory authority to \n     insure that Intelligence Community agencies and components \n     fully comply with Community-wide policy, management, \n     spending, and administrative guidance and priorities.\n       The Director of National Intelligence should be a Cabinet \n     level position, appointed\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\n     by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. Congress \n     and the President should also work to insure that the \n     Director of National Intelligence effectively exercises these \n     authorities.\n       To insure focused and consistent Intelligence Community \n     leadership, Congress should require that no person may \n     simultaneously serve as both the Director of National \n     Intelligence and the Director of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, or as the director of any other specific intelligence \n     agency.\n       2. Current efforts by the National Security Council to \n     examine and revamp existing intelligence priorities should be \n     expedited, given the immediate need for clear guidance in \n     intelligence and counterterrorism efforts. The President \n     should take action to ensure that clear, consistent, and \n     current priorities are established and enforced throughout \n     the Intelligence Community. Once established, these \n     priorities should be reviewed and updated on at least an \n     annual basis to ensure that the allocation of Intelligence \n     Community resources reflects and effectively addresses the \n     continually evolving threat environment. Finally, the \n     establishment of Intelligence Community priorities, and \n     the justification for such priorities, should be reported \n     to both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on an \n     annual basis.\n       3. The National Security Council, in conjunction with the \n     Director of National Intelligence, and in consultation with \n     the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the \n     Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, should prepare, \n     for the President's approval, a U.S. government-wide strategy \n     for combating terrorism, both at home and abroad, including \n     the growing terrorism threat posed by the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and associated technologies. This \n     strategy should identify and full engage those foreign \n     policy, economic, military, intelligence, and law enforcement \n     elements that are critical to a comprehensive blueprint for \n     success in the war against terrorism.\n       As part of that effort, the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall develop the Intelligence Community \n     component of the strategy, identifying specific programs and \n     budgets and including plans to address the threats posed by \n     Usama Bin Ladin and al Qa'ida, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other \n     significant terrorist groups. Consistent with applicable law, \n     the strategy should effectively employ and integrate all \n     capabilities available to the Intelligence Community against \n     those threats and should encompass specific efforts to: \n     Develop human sources to penetrate terrorist organizations \n     and networks both overseas and within the United States; \n     fully utilize existing and future technologies to better \n     exploit terrorist communications; to improve and expand the \n     use of data mining and other cutting edge analytical tools; \n     and to develop a multi-level security capability to \n     facilitate the timely and complete sharing of relevant \n     intelligence information both within the Intelligence \n     Community and with other appropriate federal, state, and \n     local authorities; enhance the depth and quality of domestic \n     intelligence collection and analysis by, for example, \n     modernizing current intelligence reporting formats through \n     the use of existing information technology to emphasize the \n     existence and the significance of links between new and \n     previously acquired information; maximize the effective use \n     of covert action in counterterrorist efforts; develop \n     programs to deal with financial support for international \n     terrorism; and facilitate the ability of CIA paramilitary \n     units and military special operations forces to conduct joint \n     operations against terrorist targets.\n       4. The position of National Intelligence Officer for \n     Terrorism should be created on the National Intelligence \n     Council and a highly qualified individual appointed to \n     prepare intelligence estimates on terrorism for the use of \n     Congress and policymakers in the Executive Branch and to \n     assist the Intelligence Community in developing a program for \n     strategic analysis and assessments.\n       5. Congress and the Administration should ensure the full \n     development within the Department of Homeland Security of an \n     effective all-source terrorism information fusion center that \n     will dramatically improve the focus and quality of \n     counterterrorism analysis and facilitate the timely \n     dissemination of relevant intelligence information, both \n     within and beyond the boundaries of the Intelligence \n     Community. Congress and the Administration should ensure that \n     this fusion center has all the authority and the resources \n     needed to: Have full and timely access to all \n     counterterrorism-related intelligence information, including \n     ``raw'' supporting data as needed; have the ability to \n     participate fully in the existing requirements process for \n     tasking the Intelligence Community to gather information on \n     foreign individuals, entities and threats; integrate such \n     information in order to identify and assess the nature and \n     scope of terrorist threats to the United States in light \n     of actual and potential vulnerabilities; implement and \n     fully utilize data mining and other advanced analytical \n     tools, consistent with applicable law; retain a permanent \n     staff of experienced and highly skilled analysts, \n     supplemented on a regular basis by personnel on ``joint \n     tours'' from the various Intelligence Community agencies; \n     institute a reporting mechanism that enables analysts at \n     all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to post \n     lead information for use by analysts at other agencies \n     without waiting for dissemination of a formal report; \n     maintain excellence and creativity in staff analytic \n     skills through regular use of analysis and language \n     training programs; and establish and sustain effective \n     channels for the exchange of counterterrorism-related \n     information with federal agencies outside the Intelligence \n     Community as well as with state and local authorities.\n       6. Given the FBI's history of repeated shortcomings within \n     its current responsibility for domestic intelligence, and in \n     the face of grave and immediate threats to our homeland, the \n     FBI should strengthen and improve its domestic capability as \n     fully and expeditiously as possible by immediately \n     instituting measures to: Strengthen counterterrorism as a \n     national FBI program by clearly designating national \n     counterterrorism priorities and enforcing field office \n     adherence to those priorities; establish and sustain \n     independent career tracks within the FBI that recognize and \n     provide incentives for demonstrated skills and performance of \n     counterterrorism agents and analysts; significantly improve \n     strategic analytical capabilities by assuring the \n     qualification, training, and independence of analysts, \n     coupled with sufficient access to necessary information and \n     resources; establish a strong reports officer cadre at FBI \n     Headquarters and field offices to facilitate timely \n     dissemination of intelligence from agents to analysts within \n     the FBI and other agencies within the Intelligence Community; \n     implement training for agents in the effective use of \n     analysts and analysis in their work; expand and sustain the \n     recruitment of agents and analysts with the linguistic skills \n     needed in counterterrorism efforts; increase substantially \n     efforts to penetrate terrorist organizations operating in the \n     United States through all available means of collection; \n     improve the national security law training of FBI personnel; \n     implement mechanisms to maximize the exchange of \n     counterterrorism-related information between the FBI and \n     other federal, state and local agencies; and finally solve \n     the FBI's persistent and incapacitating information \n     technology problems.\n       7. Congress and the Administration should carefully \n     consider how best to structure and manage U.S. domestic \n     intelligence responsibilities. Congress should review the \n     scope of domestic intelligence authorities to determine their \n     adequacy in pursuing counterterrorism at home and ensuring \n     the protection of privacy and other rights guaranteed under \n     the Constitution. This review should include, for example, \n     such questions as whether the range of persons subject to \n     searches and surveillances authorized under the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) should be expanded.\n       Based on their oversight responsibilities, the Intelligence \n     and Judiciary Committees of the Congress, as appropriate, \n     should consider promptly, in consultation with the \n     Administration, whether the FBI should continue to perform \n     the domestic intelligence functions of the United States \n     Government or whether legislation is necessary to remedy this \n     problem, including the possibility of creating a new agency \n     to perform those functions.\n       Congress should require that the new Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of the \n     Department of Homeland Security report to the President and \n     the Congress on a date certain concerning: The FBI's progress \n     since September 11, 2001 in implementing the reforms required \n     to conduct an effective domestic intelligence program, \n     including the measures recommended above; the experience of \n     other democratic nations in organizing the conduct of \n     domestic intelligence; the specific manner in which a new \n     domestic intelligence service could be established in the \n     United States, recognizing the need to enhance national \n     security while fully protecting civil liberties; and their \n     recommendations on how to best fulfill the nation's need for \n     an effective domestic intelligence capability, including \n     necessary legislation.\n       8. The Attorney General and the Director of the FBI should \n     take action necessary to ensure that: The office of \n     Intelligence Policy and Review and other Department of \n     Justice components provide in-depth training to the FBI and \n     other members of the Intelligence Community regarding the use \n     of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to \n     address terrorist threats to the United States; the FBI \n     disseminates results of searches and surveillances authorized \n     under FISA to appropriate personnel within the FBI and the \n     Intelligence Community on a timely basis so they may be used \n     for analysis and operations that address terrorist threats to \n     the United States; and the FBI develops and implements a plan \n     to use authorities provided by FISA to assess the threat of \n     international terrorist groups within the United States \n     fully, including the extent to which such groups are funded \n     or otherwise supported by foreign governments.\n       9. The House and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary \n     Committees should continue to examine the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act and its implementation \n     thoroughly, particularly with respect to changes made as a \n     result of the USA PATRIOT Act and the subsequent decision of \n     the United States Foreign Intelligence Court of Review, to \n     determine whether its provisions adequately address present \n     and emerging terrorist threats to the United States. \n     Legislation should be proposed by those Committees to remedy \n     any deficiencies identified as a result of that review.\n       10. The Director of the National Security Agency should \n     present to the Director of National Intelligence and the \n     Secretary of Defense by June 30, 2003, and report to the\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\n     House and Senate Intelligence Committees, a detailed plan \n     that: Describes solutions for the technological challenges \n     for signals intelligence; requires a review, on a quarterly \n     basis, of the goals, products to be delivered, funding levels \n     and schedules for every technology development program; \n     ensures strict accounting for program expenditures; within \n     their jurisdiction as established by current law, makes NSA a \n     full collaborating partner with the Central Intelligence \n     Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the war on \n     terrorism, including fully integrating the collection and \n     analytic capabilities of NSA, CIA, and the FBI; and makes \n     recommendations for legislation needed to facilitate these \n     goals.\n       In evaluating the plan, the Committees should also consider \n     issues pertaining to whether civilians should be appointed to \n     the position of Director of the National Security Agency and \n     whether the term of service for the position should be longer \n     than it has been in the recent past.\n       11. Recognizing that the Intelligence Community's employees \n     remain its greatest resource, the Director of National \n     Intelligence should require that measures be implemented to \n     greatly enhance the recruitment and development of a \n     workforce with the intelligence skills and expertise needed \n     for success in counterterrorist efforts, including: The \n     agencies of the Intelligence Community should act promptly to \n     expand and improve counterterrorism training programs within \n     the Community, insuring coverage of such critical areas as \n     information sharing among law enforcement and intelligence \n     personnel; language capabilities; the use of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act; and watchlisting; the \n     Intelligence Community should build on the provisions of the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 regarding \n     the development of language capabilities, including the Act's \n     requirement for a report on the feasibility of establishing a \n     Civilian Linguist Reserve Corps, and implement expeditiously \n     measures to identify and recruit linguists outside the \n     Community whose abilities are relevant to the needs of \n     counterterrorism; the existing Intelligence Community Reserve \n     Corps should be expanded to ensure the use of relevant \n     personnel and expertise from outside the Community as special \n     needs arise; Congress should consider enacting legislation, \n     modeled on the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, to instill the \n     concept of ``jointness'' throughout the Intelligence \n     Community. By emphasizing such things as joint education, a \n     joint career specialty, increased authority for regional \n     commanders, and joint exercises, that Act greatly enhanced \n     the joint warfighting capabilities of the individual military \n     services. Legislation to instill similar concepts throughout \n     the Intelligence Community could help improve management of \n     Community resources and priorities and insure a far more \n     effective ``team'' effort by all the intelligence agencies. \n     The Director of National Intelligence should require more \n     extensive use of ``joint tours'' for intelligence and \n     appropriate law enforcement personnel to broaden their \n     experience and help bridge existing organizational and \n     cultural divides through service in other agencies. These \n     joint tours should include not only service at Intelligence \n     Community agencies, but also service in those agencies that \n     are users or consumers of intelligence products. Serious \n     incentives for joint service should be established throughout \n     the Intelligence Community and personnel should be rewarded \n     for joint service with career advancement credit at \n     individual agencies. The Director of National Intelligence \n     should also require Intelligence Community agencies to \n     participate in joint exercises; Congress should expand and \n     improve existing educational grant programs focused on \n     intelligence-related fields, similar to military \n     scholarship programs and others that provide financial \n     assistance in return for a commitment to serve in the \n     Intelligence Community; and the Intelligence Community \n     should enhance recruitment of a more ethnically and \n     culturally diverse workforce and devise a strategy to \n     capitalize upon the unique cultural and linguistic \n     capabilities of first-generation Americans, a strategy \n     designed to utilize their skills to the greatest practical \n     effect while recognizing the potential counterintelligence \n     challenges such hiring decisions might pose.\n       12. Steps should be taken to increase and ensure the \n     greatest return on this nation's substantial investment in \n     intelligence, including: The President should submit budget \n     recommendations, and Congress should enact budget authority, \n     for sustained, long-term investment in counterterrorism \n     capabilities that avoid dependence on repeated stop-gap \n     supplemental appropriations; in making such budget \n     recommendations, the President should provide for the \n     consideration of a separate classified Intelligence Community \n     budget; long-term counterterrorism investment should be \n     accompanied by sufficient flexibility, subject to \n     congressional oversight, to enable the Intelligence Community \n     to rapidly respond to altered or unanticipated needs; the \n     Director of National Intelligence should insure that \n     Intelligence Community budgeting practices and procedures are \n     revised to better identify the levels and nature of \n     counterterrorism funding within the Community; \n     counterterrorism funding should be allocated in accordance \n     with the program requirements of the national \n     counterterrorism strategy; and due consideration should be \n     given to directing an outside agency or entity to conduct a \n     thorough and rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the resources \n     spent on intelligence.\n       13. The State Department, in consultation with the \n     Department of Justice, should review and report to the \n     President and the Congress by June 30, 2003 on the extent to \n     which revisions in bilateral and multilateral agreements, \n     including extradition and mutual assistance treaties, would \n     strengthen U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The review should \n     address the degree to which current categories of \n     extraditable offenses should be expanded to cover offenses, \n     such as visa and immigration fraud, which may be particularly \n     useful against terrorists and those who support them.\n       14. Recognizing the importance of intelligence in this \n     nation's struggle against terrorism, Congress should maintain \n     vigorous, informed, and constructive oversight of the \n     Intelligence Community. To best achieve that goal, the \n     National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \n     States should study and make recommendations concerning how \n     Congress may improve its oversight of the Intelligence \n     Community, including consideration of such areas as: Changes \n     in the budgetary process; changes in the rules regarding \n     membership on the oversight committees; whether oversight \n     responsibility should be vested in a joint House-Senate \n     Committee or, as currently exists, in separate Committees \n     in each house; the extent to which classification \n     decisions impair congressional oversight; and how \n     Congressional oversight can best contribute to the \n     continuing need of the Intelligence Community to evolve \n     and adapt to changes in the subject matter of intelligence \n     and the needs of policy makers.\n       15. The President should review and consider amendments to \n     the Executive Orders, policies and procedures that govern the \n     national security classification of intelligence information, \n     in an effort to expand access to relevant information for \n     federal agencies outside the Intelligence Community, for \n     state and local authorities, which are critical to the fight \n     against terrorism, and for the American public. In addition, \n     the President and the heads of federal agencies should ensure \n     that the policies and procedures to protect against the \n     unauthorized disclosure of classified intelligence \n     information are well understood, fully implemented and \n     vigorously enforced.\n       Congress should also review the statutes, policies and \n     procedures that govern the national security classification \n     of intelligence information and its protection from \n     unauthorized disclosure. Among other matters, Congress should \n     consider the degree to which excessive classification has \n     been used in the past and the extent to which the emerging \n     threat environment has greatly increased the need for real-\n     time sharing of sensitive information. The Director of \n     National Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, and the Attorney General, should review and report \n     to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on proposals \n     for a new and more realistic approach to the processes and \n     structures that have governed the designation of sensitive \n     and classified information. The report should include \n     proposals to protect against the use of the classification \n     process as a shield to protect agency self-interest.\n       16. Assured standards of accountability are critical to \n     developing the personal responsibility, urgency, and \n     diligence which our counterterrorism responsibility requires. \n     Given the absence of any substantial efforts within the \n     Intelligence Community to impose accountability in relation \n     to the events of September 11, 2001, the Director of Central \n     Intelligence and the heads of Intelligence Community agencies \n     should require that measures designed to ensure \n     accountability are implemented throughout the Community. To \n     underscore the need for accountability: The Director of \n     Central Intelligence should report to the House and Senate \n     Intelligence Committees no later than June 30, 2003 as to the \n     steps taken to implement a system of accountability \n     throughout the Intelligence Community, to include processes \n     for identifying poor performance and affixing responsibility \n     for it, and for recognizing and rewarding excellence in \n     performance; as part of the confirmation process for \n     Intelligence Community officials, Congress should require \n     from those officials an affirmative commitment to the \n     implementation and use of strong accountability mechanisms \n     throughout the Intelligence Community; and the Inspectors \n     General at the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of \n     Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of \n     State should review the factual findings and the record of \n     this Inquiry and conduct investigations and reviews as \n     necessary to determine whether and to what extent personnel \n     at all levels should be held accountable for any omission, \n     commission, or failure to meet professional standards in \n     regard to the identification, prevention, or disruption of \n     terrorist attacks, including the events of September 11, \n     2001. These reviews should also address those individuals who \n     performed in a stellar or exceptional manner, and the degree \n     to which the quality of their performance was rewarded or \n     otherwise impacted their careers. Based on those \n     investigations and reviews, agency heads should \n     take appropriate disciplinary and other action and the \n     President and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees \n     should be advised of such action.\n       17. The Administration should review and report to the \n     House and Senate Intelligence Committees by June 30, 2003 \n     regarding what\n\n[[Page S608]]\n\n     progress has been made in reducing the inappropriate and \n     obsolete barriers among intelligence and law enforcement \n     agencies engaged in counterterrorism, what remains to be done \n     to reduce those barriers, and what legislative actions may be \n     advisable in that regard. In particular, this report should \n     address what steps are being taken to insure that perceptions \n     within the Intelligence Community about the scope and limits \n     of current law and policy with respect to restrictions on \n     collection and information sharing are, in fact, accurate and \n     well-founded.\n       18. Congress and the Administration should ensure the full \n     development of a national watchlist center that will be \n     responsible for coordinating and integrating all terrorist-\n     related watchlist systems; promoting awareness and use of the \n     center by all relevant government agencies and elements of \n     the private sector; and ensuring a consistent and \n     comprehensive flow of terrorist names into the center from \n     all relevant points of collection.\n       19. The Intelligence Community, and particularly the FBI \n     and the CIA, should aggressively address the possibility that \n     foreign governments are providing support to or are involved \n     in terrorist activity targeting the United States and U.S. \n     interests. State-sponsored terrorism substantially increases \n     the likelihood of successful and more lethal attacks within \n     the United States. This issue must be addressed from a \n     national standpoint and should not be limited in focus by the \n     geographical and factual boundaries of individual cases. The \n     FBI and CIA should aggressively and thoroughly pursue related \n     matters developed through this Joint Inquiry that have been \n     referred to them for further investigation by these \n     Committees.\n       The Intelligence Community should fully inform the House \n     and Senate Intelligence Committees of significant \n     developments in these efforts, through regular reports and \n     additional communications as necessary, and the Committees \n     should, in turn, exercise vigorous and continuing oversight \n     of the Community's work in this critically important area.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nSenator from Florida, I thank him for his presentation. Essentially, I \nthink what the Senator suggested was the Intelligence Committee, which \nis the appropriate committee of jurisdiction, have hearings and take a \nlook at the recommendations he just outlined as a result of the \ninvestigation by the House and Senate on the 9/11 tragedy. As I have \nindicated to the Senator before--and he has written me a letter--both \nSenator Rockefeller and I think that is most appropriate, and we intend \nto hold hearings just as soon as we can get our current inquiry on the \nprewar intelligence in Iraq out in a situation where we can present it \nto the public. I think the Senator has provided a valuable service.\n  One of the important aspects when discussing intelligence is not only \nto find out the accuracy and timeliness of the prewar intelligence but \nalso to really get into the recommendations on how we fix things. The \nSenator has done us a good service. We will have hearings on these \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. I \nparticularly appreciate his sense of urgency to move forward on these \nissues and present to the Senate and the American people a set of \nreforms that will give them greater security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S608-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S608-S610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ACTIVITIES OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE--IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in order to update my \ncolleagues in this body on the recent activities of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence with respect to Iraq. This is a subject that \nhas been in the headlines consistently for many different reasons. But \nmy purpose in rising today is to report to the Senate, for it is an \nimportant day in that the Intelligence Committee members, as of this \nafternoon, will be presented the working draft of what the staff has \nbeen working on for better than 7 months.\n  In June of last year, nearly 8 months ago, the Intelligence Committee \nbegan a formal review of U.S. intelligence into the existence of Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction programs, Iraq's ties to terrorist groups, \nSaddam Hussein's threat to regional stability and security in the \nPersian Gulf, and his violation--obvious violation--of human rights.\n  This review was initiated as part of the committee's continuing \noversight of the U.S. intelligence community's activities and programs, \nwhich is always continuing. Our committee staff had, for the previous \nseveral months, already been examining the intelligence activities \nregarding Iraq, including the intelligence community's support to the \nUnited Nations weapons inspections in Iraq and the community's analysis \nand collection of reporting related to the alleged Niger-Iraq uranium \ndeal.\n  On June 20, 2003, however, Vice Chairman Rockefeller and I issued a \npress statement. We announced a joint commitment to continue the \ncommittee's thorough review of prewar U.S. intelligence. In that press \nstatement, Senator Rockefeller and I agreed to examine the following: \nthe quantity and quality of U.S. intelligence on the Iraqi regime's \nweapons of mass destruction programs, its ties to terrorist groups, the \nregime's threat to stability and security in the region, and its \nrepression of its own people.\n  We also agreed to look at the objectivity and the reasonableness, \nindependence, and accuracy of the judgments reached by the Intelligence \nCommunity; whether those judgments were properly disseminated to \npolicymakers in the executive branch and the Congress; whether--and \nthis is very important--any influence was brought to bear on anyone to \nshape their analysis to support policy objectives; finally, other \nissues we might mutually identify in the course of the committee's \nreview.\n\n  I laid out three phases of the committee's overall Iraq review. \nFirst, to evaluate the quantity and quality of the intelligence \nunderlying prewar assessments concerning Iraq; second, to determine \nwhether the analytical judgments contained in those assessments were \nobjective, independent, and reasonable; third, to evaluate the accuracy \nof those assessments by comparing them with the results of the ongoing \ninvestigative efforts in Iraq.\n  This afternoon, as I have stated, our committee members will begin \nreading and reviewing the staff's draft report, which does contain the \ncommittee's efforts to complete the first and second phases of the \nreview. The third and final phase will be completed when the Iraq \nsurvey group completes its work in Iraq.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am privileged to serve on the committee \nwith the Senator. There has been criticism, raising the inference that \nwe have not in the Senate been addressing this with the depth and \nsincerity and interest we should.\n  I take great umbrage at that. Under the leadership of the chairman \nand, indeed, myself, we are the ones who brought David Kay up. We are \nthe ones who put David Kay on the stand, the Intelligence Committee \nfirst, and before the Armed Services Committee immediately following, \nand subjected him to cross-examination after the delivery of his \nreport. His report is a mixed one in certain ways, in my judgment, but \nnevertheless in no way were we not taking the initiative to bring this \nto the forefront.\n  I say also, yesterday the Armed Services Committee heard from the \nSecretary of Defense. The distinguished chairman was present. He is a \nmember of that committee. Again, the first questions on WMD and \nprecisely the question of whether or not there was any manipulation or \ndistortion came from the Chair, myself, addressed directly to the \nSecretary.\n  Any objective analysis of the reports out of that hearing this \nmorning--it was covered by the press--he faced it head on and answered \nthose questions.\n  As we are speaking, I just departed the television where Director \nTenet is now addressing the Nation. So I think the President and his \nprincipal deputies are facing square on these complex issues, as is the \nSenate.\n  I commend the chairman, and perhaps he will agree with my \nobservations.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I fully agree with the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and I am very proud to serve \non that committee, as well as privileged being the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  We discussed this at great length. All members of these committees \ndiscussed it at great length. We have a responsibility to the American \npeople to\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\nfully investigate this and to publicly, when we can, when we are not \ndealing with any classified information, tell the American people what \nthey should know and have a right to know. We are proceeding in that \nfashion. We are taking this very seriously, which is why I am trying to \nsummarize now for the Senate and for all those who may be interested in \nthis issue precisely what we have done to date in regard to the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  The Senator is exactly right, he has taken the lead in the Armed \nServices Committee with the appropriate people within the military, and \nI thank him for his contribution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, our review in the Intelligence Committee \nbegan in earnest in early June of last year when the intelligence \ncommunity did provide our committee with 19 volumes--19 volumes, floor \nto ceiling--and they contained approximately 15,000 pages of \nintelligence assessments and sources and source reporting underlying \nthe assessments of the Hussein regime's WMD programs. They also \npertained to ties to terrorist groups, the threat to stability and \nsecurity in the region, as I have said before, and the repression of \nhis own people.\n  Our committee staff began immediately to read and analyze every \nreport provided to determine how intelligence analysts reached their \nconclusions and whether any assessments were not supported by the \nintelligence provided to the committee.\n  Our committee staff endeavored to the greatest extent possible to \ndisregard--to disregard--postwar revelations concerning Iraq in order \nto replicate the same analytical environment enjoyed by the \nintelligence community analysts prior to the war.\n  In late August and early September of 2003, our committee staff did \nrequest additional intelligence to substantiate the intelligence \ncommunity's assessments which staff judged were not sufficiently \nsupported by the intelligence that had been previously provided. Not \nonly did we ask for the original information, but when we were not \nsatisfied, we asked for more; we demanded more.\n  Our committee staff began to receive this additional supporting \nintelligence in October of 2003. In late October, the staff requested \nany intelligence which had not already been provided that contradicted \nthe intelligence community's prewar analysis in regard to Iraq.\n  For example, the committee staff requested intelligence that showed \nIraq had not reconstituted its nuclear program, had not renewed the \nproduction of chemical agents, and had abandoned an offensive \nbiological weapons program. In early November of 2003, the intelligence \ncommunity wrote to the committee that it was working to provide the \ncontradictory intelligence we requested.\n  In the same letter, the community stated it had uncovered an \nadditional six volumes of intelligence material that supported its \nassessments on Iraq's WMD programs, and the community did provide the \ncontradictory intelligence information in late November.\n  I want my colleagues to realize that this has been an extremely \nthorough undertaking. During the 8 months of the committee's review, \nour committee staff submitted almost 100 requests for supplemental \nintelligence information, received over 30,000 pages of documents in \nresponse to those requests, and reviewed and analyzed each document \nthat was provided.\n  Additionally, our committee staff have interviewed more than 200 \nindividuals, including intelligence analysts, senior officials within \nthe Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, \nDepartment of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of State, \nNational Ground Intelligence Center, the Air Force, and the Federal \nBureau of Investigation.\n  They have also questioned former intelligence analysts, national \nintelligence officers, operations officers, collection managers, \nsignals intelligence collectors, imagery analysts, nuclear experts with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, ambassadors, former United \nNations inspectors, Department of Defense weapons experts, State \nDepartment officials, and staff members of the National Security \nCouncil.\n  Additionally, the committee has held three hearings on aspects of \nUnited States intelligence on Iraq, a hearing on the Iraq-Niger \nconnection, a briefing by the CIA and State Department inspectors \ngeneral on their review of the Iraq-Niger issue, and a hearing on the \nhistory and the continuity of weapons of mass destruction assessments \nthat pertain to Iraq.\n  These efforts have enabled our committee staff to develop a full \nunderstanding of the quantity and quality of intelligence reporting \nsupporting the intelligence community's prewar assessments.\n  Our committee staff have also gained an understanding of how \nintelligence analysts throughout the community used that intelligence \nto develop their assessments on these issues and how those assessments \nwere actually disseminated to policymakers, and whether those \nassessments were reasonable, objective, independent, or if there was \nany political consideration and, again, whether any influence was \nbrought to bear to shape their analysis to support any policy \nobjective.\n\n  The professional bipartisan staff of the Intelligence Committee I \nthink has done an outstanding job. It is a very complete job. For the \nnext 3 weeks, however, it will be the members of the committee, our \nturn to do our work by reading and reviewing and suggesting any changes \nto the report.\n  I only hope that members will not prejudge the report. Let me repeat \nthat. I only hope that members will not prejudge the report--there has \nbeen activity in the past indicating plans to do just that; I hope that \ndoes not happen--and that they will take the time to actually read the \ninformation in order to make informed critiques of the material.\n  This report can have a profound impact--it will have a profound \nimpact--on the future of our intelligence community as we face the \nthreats of a new century. However, this can only be done if colleagues \non both sides of the aisle put aside election year politics and review \nthe facts in an objective and unbiased manner.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I wish to read a statement by Winston \nChurchill which I think has application to the inquiry we are \nconducting in the Intelligence Committee and the whole issue in regard \nto the credibility and the timeliness of intelligence prior to the war \nin Iraq. Sir Winston Churchill said this upon hearing about the attack \non Pearl Harbor:\n\n       Silly people, that was the description many gave in \n     discounting the force of the United States. Some said they \n     were soft, others that they would never be united--\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       That they would never be united, that they would never come \n     to grips. They would never stand bloodletting. Their system \n     of government and democracy would paralyze their war effort.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       Their system of government and democracy would paralyze \n     their war effort.\n       Now we will see the weakness of this numerous but remote, \n     wealthy and talkative people.\n\n  Referring to Americans.\n\n       But, I have studied the American Civil War fought out to \n     the last desperate inch. American blood flowed in my veins. I \n     thought of a remark made to me 30 years before: The United \n     States is like a gigantic boiler. Once the fire is lighted \n     under it, there is no limit to the power it can generate. It \n     is a matter of resolve.\n\n  I am concerned in what appears to be almost a blast furnace of \npolitics at a very early time, in an even-numbered year--and I \nunderstand that. I know politics is not bean bagged, and I know that my \ncolleagues have very serious differences of opinion, as we will on the \ncommittee, but I hope what Sir Winston said: ``Some said they were \nsoft, others that they would never be united . . . their system of \ngovernment and democracy would paralyze their war effort,'' is not true \nin regard to the global war on terrorism. I have some concerns about \nthat.\n  I indicated at the first, when I knew it was our responsibility and \nobligation, in working with the distinguished vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, that we would do our job and that we would do \nit just as bipartisan as we possibly could, that it would be\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\nthorough. It is my view that this draft report, and then what the \nMembers will agree to, will be the most thorough review of the \nintelligence community in the last decade. I also said that we will \nmake every effort to hold public hearings, because the American people \nhave a right to know, and we will let any political chips fall any way \nthey want to fall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Under the previous order, the \nmajority leader controls the next 23\\1/2\\ minutes and the Senator from \nCalifornia then would control 23\\1/2\\ minutes. The Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with the Senator's agreement I will go ahead \nand proceed since we did have, I think, about 27 or so minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the floor. May I inquire as to how much time I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that that time be yielded to the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S610-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S610-S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        KEEPING POLITICS OUT OF INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE FUNCTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me first commend and congratulate \nSenator Roberts, the chairman of our Select Committee on Intelligence, \nfor the leadership he is giving on that very important committee. It is \na very important and difficult assignment.\n  I thought his statement today was a very good one. I jokingly said, \nbut I meant it sincerely, I could not quite tell when he went from \nquoting Churchill to speaking for himself because the eloquence was \nvery close.\n  He makes a plea that is so important, and that is: Do not prejudge \nwhat the subcommittee is going to do. Members of the Intelligence \nCommittee should not prejudge the information we are going to receive \nin the staff report. We should work together to see what we have and \nwhat conclusions we reach and what should be done. That is our job.\n  I acknowledge that this is another in a series of what has been \ndescribed in many different ways but I just refer to it as ``oops'' \nhearings--oops, we missed something here. But it has been going on for \nyears.\n  There was not a clear indication of what was happening in the Soviet \nUnion, that they were imploding economically and they did not have the \nstrength we thought they did in the defense area. We had Khobar Towers. \nWe have had a series of events that our intelligence did not pick up. \nOnce again, we find ourselves now, with the 9/11 Commission, working to \nsee what we missed perhaps in our intelligence and law enforcement \ncommunity before 9/11. It should not be approached, though, with the \nidea of condemning some particular individual but finding out what \nhappened: Why did we not do a better job? What did we not know? And \nmore importantly, what are we going to do about it?\n  I am tired of oops hearings that happen after the fact and nothing \nreally changes. Are we going to make a real change this time? Can we do \na better job with our intelligence, and our intelligence community? I \nthink we can.\n  By the way, when we start pointing a finger of blame, we better look \nin the mirror first. We have had these intelligence committees since \nthe 1970s. We have known that their budget has not been adequate \nthrough much of the 1990s. We have known that we lost our ability to \nhave human intelligence, people on the ground. It became politically \nincorrect in the 1970s to have the head of, say, a financial \ninstitution in Buenos Aires to be headed by an American who was an \nagent, or a journalist who was working for a newspaper but was an \nagent. We have made it extremely difficult. We have become too caught \nup in sophistication, thinking we could get enough with satellites or \nwith technology. It is not enough.\n\n  I think what we need to do is lower the rhetoric. I know this is a \npolitical year, an election year. Everything is going to be somewhat \npolitical on both sides, but can we spare one thing, just one thing, \nfrom the political agenda? Can we not separate out intelligence and how \nwe support it? Can that not be bipartisan? Now there is a call for an \nindependent commission. We have even dropped ``bipartisan.'' Now it is \n``independent.''\n  Who decides that it is independent? Some people are indicating if the \nPresident calls for an independent commission, one to which he appoints \ngood men and women, that is not independent, but if it is one \nestablished by the Congress where we name Republicans and Democrats; \nthat is independent.\n  Quit the blame game. Ask legitimate questions. Work together. Draw \nconclusions and, more importantly, take action. Intelligence is so \ncritical. In some respects it is even more critical than defense \nspending, because if we do not have good intelligence and if we do not \nhave a reliable intelligence apparatus that works with our defense, our \nmen and women are exposed to uncertainty, unknown difficulty, and \ndeath.\n  We are talking about the lives of young men and women. Is it good \nthat we are condemning and revealing information about the quality of \nour intelligence community while our men and women are today in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and all over the world, who are relying on the ability of \nour agents, the CIA, the DIA, the different organizations we have doing \nintelligence? Even doing that is dangerous, in my opinion.\n  We should do our work. I am not happy with the intelligence. I do not \nthink the intelligence was what it should have been. It was inadequate, \nmaybe even inaccurate. But why? There was large agreement not only \nwithin our community but also with agencies from around the world.\n  Has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Senator from Kansas yielded to me some more \nof his time, if I could inquire about using an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nor his designee has 24\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield myself an additional 2 minutes of \ntime that has been designated for the leader or Senator Roberts. I will \nbe brief because I know Senator Feinstein is waiting.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I think the original order has it that the majority \nleader or his designee will be recognized for the next 24 minutes. In \ndiscussing this with Senator Feinstein, I know she has waited patiently \nand she has 22 minutes reserved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after the remarks of Senator Lott \nSenator Feinstein be recognized for her remarks and we would reserve \nthe remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I conclude by talking about what we should \ndo now. The Intelligence Committee should do its job. We should not \njump to conclusions. Let's review the report. Let's do our homework. We \npushed so much of it off on our staff, now it is time we do it \nourselves. Let's read what is in there and then let's decide what \nrecommendations we are going to make.\n\n  Why do we have these committees that are evenly divided? I have \nstudied the history. I have been involved in how the Intelligence \nCommittee works. We have carefully tried to make sure we put our best \non that committee and that it is equally divided and that it is not \npartisan. The same thing in the House. Now it is time we lead and show \nsome direction.\n  I hope we will take some action. I am for actually making some really \naggressive rules. I am not sure our intelligence community is set up \nproperly. I don't like the idea that we have 13 different agencies \nrunning around. Who is in charge, who coordinates and asks them and \ndirects them? I think there are some problems there.\n  Then there are those saying we need an independent commission. The \nPresident said we should have one. Let's do everything we can to find \nout the facts and see the recommendations and take action and reassure \nourselves and the American people. Now that is being condemned.\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\n  I think we should do our work in the Intelligence Committee. Let the \nPresident appoint this independent commission. Let's do this job in a \nresponsible way and not rush to judgment.\n  There will be efforts today to say, well, the report is totally \ninadequate, before the Senators even read the report. I realize \nSenators don't like to have lengthy sessions of reading material to \nreview these recommendations. But never before has it been more \nimportant that we do this right.\n  I think we should make changes. I personally think there need to be \nsome personnel changes. That may not be my decision. But hopefully I \ncan help get a result that will make sure we don't have another, ``Oh, \nmy God, what didn't we know?'' hearing. This is too serious. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's do our job, let's do it in \na nonpartisan way, and let's try to keep politics, as much as we can, \nat least out of Intelligence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S611-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S611-S613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee for his remarks. I think he well and ably set \nout the structure of what we are doing.\n  I also thank Senator Lott for his remarks, particularly the remarks \nthat said we should work together. That has been one of the problems. I \nwant to go into that.\n  But before I do, I would like particularly to thank the Senator from \nFlorida, the former chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, for his three speeches. I had the privilege of previewing \nthese. I think he delivered them eloquently and forcefully. I want him \nto know I very much appreciate his careful scholarship and his reasoned \napproach, which mark not only his remarks here but also his tenure as \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee. He has presided over what \ncontinues to be one of the most difficult chapters in the history of \nour intelligence community.\n  Senator Lott has just said, with considerable spark, that we should \nwork together. I could not agree more.\n  Second, the committee has been prevented from examining the use of \nintelligence by policymakers. This I believe is a real problem. Our own \nresolution sets out that we should be able to examine the use of \nintelligence by policymakers and administration officials. To a great \nextent this is the reason we are here today creating an independent \ncommission which will have more authority than the elected officials of \nthis Government have.\n  I learned this morning that the independent commission that is \nfunctioning today has access to the President's daily intelligence \nbriefs. The Intelligence Committee of the Senate does not have access \nto the President's daily intelligence briefs, nor have we had, to the \nbest of my knowledge, through this investigation.\n  I was very pleased to see that over the past weekend the President \nhas apparently reversed course, accepting the recommendations from Dr. \nKay, from Members of the Senate, and from a host of experts to the \neffect that only a full and outside investigation will be able to be \nboth credible and acceptable to the world at large.\n  I did not believe so before. I voted against the Corzine resolution \nwhen it came up before. I changed my mind because if we, the elected \nrepresentatives, are not permitted to look into the use of intelligence \nas provided by S. Res. 400, and it has to be an outside committee that \nwill have that right, so be it. But I find it to be really \nidiosyncratic, because I believe the full power should be vested in the \nofficials of our Government, of which the Senate plays a very major \nrole, not necessarily always an independent committee, as it appears to \nbe happening.\n  Such a commission, though, will be able to remove some of the \npartisanship that has infected this issue and, I hope, provide a \nreasoned, careful, and credible assessment. I am concerned that the \nPresident has let it be known he intends to appoint all of the members \nof the commission and carry this out through Executive Order. This I \nbelieve will adversely affect the commission's independence.\n  Let me give you an example. Many believe the handling of the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States--that is a \nCommission now functioning--headed by Gov. Thomas Keane and Congressman \nLee Hamilton, is a case in point. There have been many reports that \nchronic delays in providing documents and foot dragging in arranging \ninterviews have frustrated the efforts of this Commission to complete \nits work within the timeline the White House insisted upon.\n  The Commission is asking for an extension of time and Senators McCain \nand Lieberman have introduced legislation to do so. I understand the \nPresident yesterday agreed to extend this timetable to July 26 of this \nyear. I strongly believe the Commission should be given whatever time \nit needs to complete its examination and we, in fact, should pass the \nMcCain-Lieberman bill.\n  Nevertheless, it is my hope that a commission, whether it is created \nby Executive order or by statute, will be able to answer four \nquestions.\n  The first is: Were the prewar intelligence assessments of the dangers \nposed by Saddam Hussein's regime wrong? This is not as simple a \nquestion as it seems, for in the months prior to the invasion of Iraq \nthese assessments had two separate, equally important parts. The first \nis whether Iraq had the capability to place the United States in such \ndanger as to warrant the unprecedented step of a unilateral preemptive \ninvasion of another sovereign nation. Just two days ago Secretary \nPowell, asked if he would have recommended an invasion knowing Iraq had \nno prohibited weapons, replied: ``I don't know because it was the \nstockpile that presented the final little piece that made it more of a \nreal and present danger and threat to the region and to the world.'' He \nadded: ``The absence of a stockpile changes the political calculus; it \nchanges the answer you get.''\n  Second, was such a threat imminent or was it grave and growing? \nCritical to this debate during the Summer and Fall of 2002 was the \nimmediacy of the threat which supported the argument that we needed to \nattack quickly, could not wait to bring traditional allies aboard or to \ntry other options short of invasion.\n  The second question is: Whether the intelligence assessments were bad \nas well as wrong.\n  This requires a fine distinction between an intelligence assessment \nthat is wrong, and one that is bad. Intelligence assessments are often \nwrong, for by their nature they are an assessment of the probability \nthat a future event will take place. But wrong does not always mean \nbad. Sometimes an intelligence assessment follows the right logic and \nfairly assesses the amount, credibility and meaning of collected data, \nand still is wrong. What the independent commission needs to do is to \nseparate these two different, but related, issues.\n  The third question is to determine--if the intelligence assessment \nwas both bad and wrong--to what degree and why?\n  Did the intelligence community negligently depart from accepted \nstandards of professional competence in performing its collection and \nanalytic tasks?\n  Was the intelligence community subject to pressures, personal or \nstructural, which caused it to reach a wrong result through bad \nanalysis?\n  Were the ordinary internal procedures by which intelligence is \nsubject to peer review properly carried out?\n  A commission must delve deeply into the mechanisms of intelligence \nanalysis to reach these answers.\n  The fourth and final question is whether the intelligence assessments \nreached by the intelligence community, whether right or wrong, good or \nbad, were fairly represented to the Congress and to the American \npeople. Did administration officials speaking in open and closed \nsession to members of Congress accurately represent the intelligence \nproduct that they were relying upon? Were public statements, speeches \nand press releases, fair and accurate? This is the cauldron boiling \nbelow the surface.\n  This final question is particularly grave, because it touches upon \nthe constitutionally critical link between the executive and \nlegislative branches. The Founders knew what they were doing\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\nwhen they developed a shared responsibility for war making--only \nCongress can declare war, with the President, as Commander in Chief, \nconducting it--and the need is vital for Members of Congress to have \nfairly presented, timely and accurate intelligence when they consider \nwhether to invest the President with the authority as Commander in \nChief to put American lives, as well as those of innocent civilians, at \nrisk.\n  My vote, in particular, was based largely on intelligence, and \nstatements about that intelligence, related to Saddam's certain \npossession of chemical and biological weapons and the probability or \nlikelihood, that he had both weaponized and deployed them. Also, the \nfact that he had violated the U.N. missile restrictions and possessed a \ndelivery system for a chemical or biological warhead, and could deliver \nthat warhead 600 miles, threatening other Middle Eastern nations or \nperhaps, from offshore, the United States.\n  There were many statements made by the administration that when \ncombined with the intelligence created an overwhelming case, I think \nparticularly for me and for many others. I don't think there would have \nbeen 77 votes in the Senate to authorize use of force had these \nstatements not been made.\n  Let me give just five examples of such statements:\n  Secretary of State Powell, on September 8, 2002, said on Fox News \nSunday: ``There is no doubt that he has chemical weapons stocks.'' He \nalso said: ``With respect to biological weapons, we are confident that \nhe has some stocks of those weapons, and he is probably continuing to \ntry to develop more.''\n  President Bush, on September 12, 2002, said in his address to the \nU.N. General Assembly: ``Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving \nfacilities that were used for the production of biological weapons.''\n  President Bush, in his October 7, 2002, address also said: ``We know \nthat the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, \nincluding mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, and VX nerve gas.''\n  Secretary Powell, again in his February 5, 2003, address to the U.N. \nSecurity Council, said:\n\n       Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a \n     stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons \n     agent. That is enough agent to fill 16,000 battlefield \n     rockets. Even the low end of 100 tons of agent would enable \n     Saddam Hussein to cause mass casualties across more than 100 \n     square miles of territory, an area nearly 5 times the size of \n     Manhattan . . . when will we see the rest of the submerged \n     iceberg? Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein \n     has used such weapons. And Saddam Hussein has no compunction \n     about using them again, against his neighbors and against his \n     own people.\n\n  What a strong statement--a statement that has to be backed up with \nalmost certain facts.\n  President Bush said, on October 2, 2002, in Cincinnati: ``Facing \nclear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the \nsmoking gun that may come in the form of a mushroom cloud.''\n  I remember hearing this speech, which made a deep impression upon me.\n  The President of the United States said this. Members of the \nIntelligence Committee are looking at intelligence. When combined with \nthe President's statements, the statements of the Secretary of State \nand the statements of the Vice President, how can you not believe them? \nThat is why this committee's investigation into the use of intelligence \nwhich we have been prohibited from entering into is so important that \nwe do. We are the official people's representatives on this Committee \non Intelligence, and to cut us out from one part of an investigation \nthat our own resolutions say we should look at, I think, is \nunconscionable.\n  When all of this is combined with the intelligence provided to \nCongress, the aerial photographs of what was believed to be chemical \nweapons plants, and the National Intelligence Estimate of October 2002, \nthis information created an overwhelming belief that there was an \nimminent threat to our Nation, and a dominant majority of the Senate of \nthe United States voted for the resolution authorizing the use of \nforce.\n  You can imagine my surprise that after more than 1,500 sites--top \npriority sites--have been searched and millions of dollars spent on Dr. \nKay's special investigation, no weapons have been found. And Dr. Kay \nsubmits to us that he does not believe any will be found.\n  So the reality of what has been learned in Iraq versus the \nintelligence presented to us causes enormous concern.\n  Again, I truly believe that had it not been for the strength of the \nintelligence and statements made to Congress, including the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, a vote for regime change alone, \nwithout the belief of an imminent threat, would not have had the \nmajority it did, may well not have passed, and if it did, most likely \nwould have passed with a bare majority.\n  These statements and the intelligence upon which they were based now \nappear to be unsupported by the available evidence, and have been \ncontradicted by Dr. Kay's findings. A commission must look closely at \nthese and other similar statements.\n  Even as the commission moves forward, I believe Congress should \nundertake two related tasks. The first is to carefully review the \nimplications of the President's so-called preemption doctrine. I have \nstrongly criticized this policy since its inception. Although, clearly, \nthe United States will always retain the right to defend itself in \nspecific circumstances from a real, imminent threat, preemption as a \ndoctrine departs from core American values. We must be strong in \ndefense but not allow this country to become an aggressive nation of \nconquest.\n  I also believe the doctrine runs counter to 50 years of bipartisan \nAmerican foreign policy, which is based on the belief that \ninternational law, multilateral agreements, and diplomacy are also \neffective means to promote and to protect American security.\n  Finally, and on a more fundamental and practical level, the doctrine \nrequires a faith in the perfectibility of intelligence analysis that is \nsimply not attainable. Preemption inherently requires us to be right \nevery time on the nature and imminence of threats.\n  Unfortunately, as every senior intelligence official to whom I have \nspoken tells me, intelligence is rarely going to be that accurate, for \nthe very reason I have mentioned earlier it is, at its heart, \nprobability analysis.\n  This past weekend, Dr. Kay spoke to this issue, saying, and I quote, \n``if you cannot rely on good, accurate intelligence that is credible to \nthe American people and to others abroad, you certainly can't have a \npolicy of preemption.''\n  The preemptive concept bets everything on one roll of the dice and we \nhad better be right every time.\n  I spoke about this when the doctrine was announced and offered the \nhypothetical of a preemptive attack based on intelligence that was \nwrong, that results in destruction and death, and undermines American \ncredibility and our position around the world. The hypothetical, so \nfar, at least, is true in Iraq.\n  I hope the President and his advisers will reconsider the ill-advised \nadoption of preemption in light of what we have already learned from \nits first exercise.\n  The second thing the Congress should do, and do now, is begin the \nprocess of restructuring the intelligence community and begin by taking \na single, critical step: Pass legislation creating a Director of \nNational Intelligence and change from the current situation where a \nsingle man is both head of the entire intelligence community--with its \n15 departments and agencies--and the head of the Central Intelligence \nAgency. It is an impossible job with insufficient authority.\n  I have introduced legislation that would accomplish this in both the \n107th and 108th Congresses. Each time I stood on this floor to urge its \npassage and each time I expressed my belief that the current structure \ncould result in a colossal intelligence failure.\n  In June of 2002, I said: ``This legislation creates the Director of \nNational Intelligence to lead a true intelligence community and to \ncoordinate our intelligence and anti-terrorism efforts and help assure \nthe sort of communication problems that prevented the various elements \nof our intelligence community from working together effectively before \nSeptember 11 never happen again.''\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\n  I fear it has happened again. Once more, I stand in the Senate to \nurge the passage of the legislation.\n  It has to be pointed out that our present intelligence structure for \nthe most part is based on a post-World War II, cold-war environment. It \nis not suited for the new challenges of asymmetric threats and non-\nstate entities, as well as quite possibly from states also involved in \nterrorism. We have a Soviet-era intelligence community in a post-Soviet \nworld.\n  We need to have a Director of National Intelligence now more than \never and we should not wait any longer for the results of another \ncommission. I remind my colleagues that creating a Director of National \nIntelligence was the very first recommendation of the bipartisan Joint \nInquiry into the Attacks on September 11, a recommendation contained in \na report signed by every member of the Intelligence Committees of the \nSenate and the House. Senator Graham spoke earlier about this \nprovision, and I agree with his explanation of the pressing need for \nthe change.\n\n  Such a position, if created today, would provide substantial \nimprovement in the function and quite possibly the restructuring of the \nmore than one dozen agencies and departments. It would give one person, \nappointed by the President for a 10-year term, the statutory authority \nto determine strategies across the board, to set priorities, and to \nassign staff and dollars across departments and agencies.\n  It is my understanding the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nwill take up this legislation in 2004, I am told, in April. It is my \nhope that working together we can include this legislation as part of \nthe Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005 and make it law \nthis Spring.\n  As I have said earlier, the so-called ``bipartisan'' investigation by \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has had little effective \nparticipation by Democratic Senators, or their staffs. In fact, in many \nways had the Intelligence Committee been able to carry out its \nresponsibilities, as set for in Senate Resolution 400, much of the \ndebate on the floor on this issue would be unnecessary. Nonetheless, I \nlook forward to this afternoon when the report will be made available \nto committee members.\n  I deeply believe that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nshould turn its attention to its core responsibilities--conducting \nvigorous oversight of the intelligence community, and carefully \nconsidering legislation to make necessary changes. To that end I urge \nChairman Roberts to take up legislation restructuring the Intelligence \nCommunity, including, but not limited to, my bill to create a Director \nof National Intelligence, hold comprehensive hearings on these \nproposals, and report out legislation in time for inclusion in this \nyear's Intelligence Authorization bill.\n  As I have said earlier, my vote in favor of the resolution to \nauthorize the use of force in Iraq was perhaps the most difficult, and \nconsequential, vote of my career. It was a decision based on hours of \nintelligence briefings from administration and intelligence officials, \nplus the classified and unclassified versions of the National \nIntelligence Estimates. My decision was in part based on my trust that \nthis intelligence was the best our Nation's intelligence services could \noffer, untainted by bias, and fairly presented. It was a decision made \nbecause I was convinced that the threat from Iraq was not only grave \nbut imminent.\n  Because of my vote, and the votes of the 76 other Senators who voted \nfor the resolution, our troops are stuck in Iraq, under fire, and \ntaking casualties. Our armed forces are stretched thin; we have \nantagonized our enemies and alienated many of our closest allies.\n  In the post-9/11 world, a world where we confront asymmetric threats \nevery day, intelligence plays a key role informing the policy-making \nprocess. The administration bears primary responsibility for our \nintelligence apparatus--ensuring that it works well, is honest, and is \nproperly focused. The administration is also responsible for honestly \nand fairly presenting the results of the intelligence process to the \nCongress, informing, for instance our vote on the resolution to \nauthorize force.\n  I now fear that the threat was not imminent, that there were other \npolicy options, short of war, that would have effectively met the \nthreat posed by Saddam Hussein.\n  And that is why a full investigation of the prewar intelligence is so \ncritical.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we have heard a number of speakers \nin the Senate this week. It has been an important week. We have had the \ntestimony of David Kay, the United Nations inspector who just came back \nfrom Iraq. We had the reaction to his testimony. We had reports from \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And today we are going to \nhave a major speech by the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nGeorge Tenet.\n  It is very important that we put in perspective what is happening and \nthe steps that should be taken to ensure we are addressing the problems \ncorrectly.\n  First, Mr. Kay, who is totally credible on the issue of weapons of \nmass destruction, made the following statements in his Armed Services \nCommittee testimony.\n  Senator McCain asked the question:\n\n       [Y]ou agree with the fundamental principle here that what \n     we did was justified and enhanced the security of the United \n     States and the world by removing Saddam Hussein from power?\n\n  Mr. Kay:\n\n       Absolutely.\n\n  Senator Kennedy:\n\n       Many of us feel that the evidence so far leads only to one \n     conclusion: That what has happened was more than a failure of \n     intelligence, it was the result of manipulation of the \n     intelligence to justify a decision to go to war . . .\n\n  Mr. Kay:\n\n       All I can say is if you read the total body of intelligence \n     in the last 12 to 15 years that flowed on Iraq, I quite \n     frankly think it would be hard to come to a conclusion other \n     than Iraq was a gathering, serious threat to the world with \n     regard to weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I think the world is far safer with the disappearance and \n     removal of Saddam Hussein. I have said I actually think this \n     may be one of those cases where it was even more dangerous \n     than we thought. I think when we have the complete record \n     you're going to discover that after 1998 it became a regime \n     that was totally corrupt. Individuals were out for their own \n     protection. And in a world where we know others are seeking \n     weapons of mass destruction, the likelihood at some point in \n     the future of a seller and a buyer meeting up would have made \n     that a far more dangerous country than even we anticipated \n     with what may turn out not to be a fully accurate estimate.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       Saddam Hussein developed and used weapons of mass \n     destruction; true?\n\n  Mr. Kay:\n\n       Absolutely.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       He used them against the Iranians and the Kurds; just yes \n     or no.\n\n  Mr. Kay:\n\n       Oh, yes.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       OK. And U.N. inspectors found enormous quantities of banned \n     chemical and biological weapons in Iraq in the '90s.\n\n  Mr. Kay:\n\n       Yes, sir.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       We know that Saddam Hussein had once a very active nuclear \n     program.\n\n  Mr. Kay:\n\n       Yes.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       And he realized and had ambitions to develop and use \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Mr. Kay:\n\n       Clearly.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       So the point is, if he were in power today, there is no \n     doubt that he would harbor ambitions for the development and \n     use of weapons of mass destruction. Is there any doubt in \n     your mind?\n\n  Mr. Kay:\n\n       There's absolutely no doubt. And I think I've said that, \n     Senator.\n\n  So I think, when we look at the testimony of the man who has been on \nthe ground, who has searched for the weapons of mass destruction, who \nknows what all the clues are, who knows what the body of intelligence \nwas--and he\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\nsays it really could have been more dangerous than we even ever \nthought--I think we have to assess that in the context of all of the \nrhetoric we are hearing about second-guessing a decision that was based \non what we had at the time.\n  Senator Feinstein said we should relook at our intelligence-gathering \norganization. I do not think anyone would disagree with that, including \nthe President of the United States.\n  In our first effort to address the issues of the failure that led to \n9/11, we all tried to look at the intelligence failures, to look at the \nthings that did not compute, to look at the communications systems that \ndid not match up. We tried to put a grid in place in the agency that \nwas created for homeland security that would allow all of the \nintelligence gathering that is done in and for our country to be put \nthrough a grid to warn us when there was an imminent danger.\n  Let's talk about what the result has been because we have tried to \naddress those failures. We have prevented potential terrorist acts. We \nknow we prevented an airliner from being blown up because a very smart \nflight attendant saw a man get ready to strike a match and light his \nshoe. We know from that experience what to look for in an airline \npassenger, and we have refined the system. We have seen flights \ncanceled because there was a suspicion there might be something going \non. Who knows what was prevented in that instance?\n\n  We have seen arrests in very remote parts of our country because of \nintelligence gathering. We have not had a terrorist attack on our \ncountry since the time we were attacked on 9/11. We have had attempts, \nbut we, because we have processes in place from what we have learned, \nhave thwarted those attempts, including one this week in the United \nStates Senate.\n  So, yes, we need to relook at our intelligence gathering. Yes, we are \nlearning every day. And, yes, the President of the United States has \nalready said he will have an independent investigation of our \nintelligence gathering that led to the invasion of Iraq. He has said he \nwould do that. The President has also agreed to the extension asked for \nby the 9/11 Commission, the bipartisan commission that is looking into \nwhat happened before and during the 9/11 incident. He has said, yes, I \nwill agree to an extension, because he was asked. The President of the \nUnited States is being open. The President of the United States is \ntrying to do the right thing to get to the bottom of this because he \nhas the interests of the United States at heart.\n  Let's look at some other results. Let's look at the difference in the \nhope of the people of Iraq and Afghanistan today. Yes, there are \ncontinuing problems. Yes, it grieves every one of us. Our hearts stop \nwhen we hear there has been another bombing or mishap that has hurt one \nof our soldiers or killed one of our soldiers or an Iraqi citizen. Yes, \nit hurts.\n  But do the people of Iraq today have a better chance to live in \nfreedom and prosperity than they had the entire time they had been \nruled by a despot? Absolutely. Do the people of Afghanistan today have \nthe hope for a future of freedom more than they had under the Taliban \nand the other despots under whom they have been buried for all these \nyears? Oh, yes. They have a constitution that is getting ready now to \nbecome implemented that actually says women will be equal in that \ncountry.\n  We have come a long way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma if he would like to extend the time or is he prepared to go to \nthe highway bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we are prepared to go back to the bill \nat this time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you.\n  Madam President, let me end by saying I hope we will come together \nand support the President in his initiatives to get to the bottom of \nthis issue. The President is looking out for the United States of \nAmerica, and we do not need partisan rhetoric on an issue such as this. \nWe need to come together. That is what we must do.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor, and I yield back the \ntime that was allocated for morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S614-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S614-S647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSAFE, ACCOUNTABLE, FLEXIBLE, AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT OF \n                                  2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

At this point, I will yield to the Senator from Iowa, and \nfollowing his remarks I will seek to be recognized.\n  (Mr. ENSIGN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to address the consideration \nthat the Senate Finance Committee gave to the portion of the highway \nbill that determines the size of the trust fund, source of the trust \nfund, and our committee's decisionmaking over that. And my speaking to \nthe Senate is based on the proposition, thus far, that we are moving \nahead with the total highway package the way that has been suggested by \nthe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Senate Banking \nCommittee, and the Senate Commerce Committee, with my committee working \nin cooperation with those three committees, at that level of \nexpenditure.\n  Somehow, if the President, in succeeding days, would say he is not \ngoing to sign a bill that is that big, I will moderate my remarks to \nconform with that. But right now, all I know is what this body has done \nin three of its committees to arrive at where we are now. I want to \naddress, within that framework and that environment, the work of our \ncommittee.\n  I will particularly speak about some other Members of this body who \nlack a consideration of the hard work that has been put into this \nproduct, as well as their philosophical objections to what we have \ndone. I don't have any question that any Senator can have any \nphilosophical objections to anything he wants, but I want everybody in \nthe Senate to know that the 21 members of the Senate Finance Committee \ndid not take this product lightly.\n  There has been a lot of harsh criticism of the upcoming Finance \nCommittee title of this highway bill.\n  What I will do is lay out the context of the funding portions of this \nlegislation and respond to this harsh criticism. The role of the \nFinance Committee on the highway bill is centered on the highway trust \nfund raising, not expending, funds. Finance Committee jurisdiction \ninvolves the Federal excise taxes, the highway trust fund, and the \nexpenditure authority of the trust fund. The Finance Committee has \nacted in all of these areas as recently as just this Monday.\n  The authorizing committee's actions will result in outlays from the \ntrust funds of $231 billion for highways, and $36.6 billion for \ntransit, spread out over the next 6 years. Essentially, those figures I \njust gave you represent the cash-flow out of the trust fund. The \nFinance Committee's action provided the resources in the trust fund to \ncover the cash outflows and provide a cushion in the trust fund \nbalances. This is how we arrived at that action of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  But some of the critics have said the Finance Committee should have \nfunded\n\n[[Page S615]]\n\nthe trust fund at the level of the motor fuel taxes and the compliant \nsavings resulting therefrom.\n  This is a very fair debate to have in the Senate, or in any \ncommittee, but I want the Members of this body who don't serve on the \nFinance Committee to understand that we had that fair debate in the \nFinance Committee on Monday, and in other sessions before that. This \ncommittee had to decide otherwise from those critics who have said that \nthe Finance Committee should have funded the trust fund at just the \nlevels of the motor fuel taxes and compliant savings.\n  So I think everybody in this body has a responsibility to be \nrealistic and wake up to the facts of life as we are considering this \nlegislation and in their responding to it because there will be a time \nwhen the Senate will express its will on this floor, and we all have to \nface the reality of the legislative process. The will of the Senate, at \nthe end of the day, will be to fund highways and transit programs at \nthe outlay levels provided by the three authorizing committees of \nBanking, Commerce, and Environment and Public Works.\n  So to my critics, some of whom chose to criticize me directly, let me \nremind them that last year I was 1 of 21 votes against the Bond-Reid \namendment during the budget debate. That wasn't an easy vote. So I \nunderstand the sentiments for lower funding levels, but Members of this \nbody need to understand that 21 is a sizable minority of this body, and \nthe vast majority decided more money should be spent on highways and \ntransit.\n\n  That was last year, and this is now, today. A majority of the Finance \nCommittee dealt with this fundamental reality. So I would like to ask \nthe critics to come out of their ivory towers and deal with the reality \nof the Senate.\n  The reality that faced us on the Finance Committee was how to bridge \nthe gap between the baseline revenue collections and the outlay levels \nof the three authorizing committees, which was considerably higher.\n  In consideration of this major problem facing us, the leader of the \nDemocrats on my committee, Senator Baucus, and I--and we try to work \ntogether whenever we can, and that is most of the time--had the reality \nof the Senate to take into consideration. We had to keep in mind the \ninstitutional issues with which the Senate Finance Committee has to \ndeal. We could not and we would not choose an option that would \nundermine the integrity of the trust fund, and we surely are not going \nto do anything to undermine the role of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  What do I mean by the integrity of the trust fund? The answer is that \nthe Finance Committee needs to ensure that there is a relationship \nbetween the receipts in the trust fund and the spending from that trust \nfund. To the extent that relationship is undermined, I say to my fellow \ncolleagues, the Finance Committee's role is undermined as well.\n  I also wish to point out the bottom line for those other 20 Senators \nwho, like me, voted against the higher trust fund spending last year. \nAgain, the political reality is that the Senate is going to approve \noutlays at the levels approved by these three authorizing committees.\n  One option would be a direct general fund transfer. A direct general \nfund transfer erodes the integrity of trust funds, and it dilutes the \nrole of the tax-writing committees. It directly delinks highway \nspending and highway receipts, and we believe those have traditionally \nbeen tied together and should be tied together. Because of that, the \nSenate did not go there.\n  There is a danger for us fiscal conservatives of such an approach \nbecause direct general fund transfers would potentially be open ended \nand no fiscal discipline whatsoever.\n  If the Finance Committee had done what the critics argue, what would \nhave been the outcome on the floor of the Senate? Does anyone believe \nthat we would have been left at the authorized funding amounts? No, we \nall know the funding levels would have gone way up. Where would we end \nup? The answer is that we would end up with a direct general fund \ntransfer.\n  Any Finance Committee member should be concerned about that bottom \nline result and what that does to the trust fund concept and the \nhistory of our committee's jurisdiction over that trust fund but, more \nimportantly, our responsibility we have to the Senate.\n  In the Finance Committee, we decided to maintain the relationship \nbetween the trust fund receipts and the trust fund spending. It is so \nimportant then to distinguish between trust fund receipts and revenues \nthat is counted for budget purposes.\n\n  Embedded in the trust funds are several policies that burden the \ntrust fund. The clearest of these, and one we always hear, is the \ntreatment of ethanol. The tax benefit for ethanol is the only--the \nonly--energy production incentive that is not borne by the general \nfund. There are billions of dollars in tax benefits for oil and gas \nthat are charged to the general fund, for instance. Do Senators from \noil and gas States understand that the tax benefit for ethanol is the \nonly energy production incentive that is not borne directly by the \ngeneral fund?\n  Under current law, the use of ethanol is prejudiced in terms of the \nhighway trust fund resources. That is because the benefit is charged \nagainst the trust fund up to this point when we adopt this legislation \nbecause my VEETC proposal eliminated the inequity by making sure the \ntrust fund is fully funded by those who use ethanol fuel. For my \nfriends who are always criticizing, the tax benefit for ethanol, like \nthat of any other energy source, will be borne then by the general \nfund.\n  There are numerous other exemptions from the fuel taxes in addition \nto ethanol. These exemptions further important policy purposes but \npurposes which are not embedded in highway policy. No one takes issue \nwith the exemption but whether they should be borne by the highway \ntrust fund. We don't hear that argument.\n  Contrary to what has been suggested, increasing highway funding in \nthis manner is not unlimited like the direct general fund transfers but \nis limited by the universe of exemptions.\n  For the 20 other Senators who, like me, last year voted for lower \nhighway spending, they have an interest in what the Finance Committee \ndid. By maintaining the relationship between highway receipts and \nspending, we maintain a ceiling on the spending. A direct general fund \ntransfer does not have such a limit.\n  I repeat and remind my colleagues, the bottom line is that the so-\ncalled illusory receipts that Finance came up with result in a ceiling \non highway and transit spending. Don't these other 20 Senators want \nsome sort of a ceiling? The ceiling is not available with a direct \ngeneral fund transfer.\n  The Finance Committee bill contains a self-imposed ceiling that \nrelates the receipts to expenditures of the trust fund and everything \nconnected with the trust fund.\n  Do these receipts end up as refunds or exemptions? No, those are \nlegitimate policy choices made by Congress in law. I cited the case of \nethanol. There are others. Those receipts represent the burden users \nput on our roads. The trust fund then properly accounts for these \nusers.\n  Where we have shifted the burden of an exemption or refund from the \nhighway trust fund to the general fund, the Finance Committee has \nprovided offsets. In the end the Finance Committee has made sure this \nwill not add to the deficit.\n  To those who choose to ignore the political reality of the Senate, \ndecisions made overwhelmingly by three other committees, decisions made \nlast year on the budget we are still operating under with only 21 \ndissenters, the rest of the Senate decided there ought to be more \nmassive amounts of money spent on roads.\n  That is the political reality of the Senate. I say to these people, \nwhat would you do? What would you do to make the trust fund a relevant \npart of the highway program, where it has been since we have had \nFederal gas taxes? What would you do to maintain the relationship of \nthe trust fund receipts and trust fund spending? What would you do to \navoid an open-ended general fund transfer where there is lesser, or \nmaybe absent any, fiscal responsibility?\n  I get back to some old sayings that can say it better than I can, and \nI think I read in Lyndon Johnson's biography, ``The Master of the \nSenate,'' that Sam Rayburn said something about any jackass can push a \nbarn down, but it takes a carpenter to build one.\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\n  We have a few people who are trying to kick the barn down. These \npeople are not really interested in building a barn like the three \nauthorizing committees are, as they tried to put something together. \nAlbeit there might be some sort of disagreement about exactly what the \nright and ideal level of expenditure is, but they have worked hard. The \nAmerican people want us building the legislative barn.\n  I turn to these people who do not want to build this barn--our \nFederal obligation under highways. It has been a pretty dominant \nFederal policy since Eisenhower and the interstate system, and of \ncourse a long time before that with other highways. They ought to quit \nkicking and focus on the reality of getting this highway bill done. The \nFinance Committee amendment took a step forward to getting this job \ndone.\n  The Finance Committee did the job. We provided the funding. More \nimportantly, we linked the highway receipts to the spending, and we did \nthis in a deficit-neutral way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee. I congratulate him and the ranking member for moving \nforward. I found the comments of my neighbor in Iowa to be particularly \nappropriate about the need to build the barn. Again, I express my \nthanks to our colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Reid, and the others, for moving forward.\n  Right now we are asking that Chairman Inhofe return. He has an \nimportant meeting right now and he is going to come out to assure we \ncan get more of this bill moving. We have a very short time window \ntoday. I know that on both sides of the aisle we would like to have \npeople come down, offer relevant amendments, try to get as much of this \nbill moving as possible, and begin the voting process.\n  As I said, we have much work going on just off of the Senate floor as \nwe try to move this legislation forward. We have several more pieces of \nSAFETEA to be brought forward. We are working with the other committees \ninvolved to make sure they come forward. I believe Chairman Shelby from \nthe Banking Committee will arrive shortly to bring forth a mass transit \nbill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, at this time I would like to recognize \nSenator Shelby for some comments about his amendment and then reclaim \nthe floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, was this a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the right to yield \nthe floor to another Senator.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2269\n\n(Purpose: To amend chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, relating \nto the authorization of Federal funding for public transportation, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2269.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the text of this amendment is identical to \nthe legislation that the Banking Committee ordered reported from the \ncommittee by a voice vote yesterday. In other words, it was a unanimous \nvote in the Banking Committee.\n  I rise today in support of the Federal Public Transportation Act of \n2004. This is the bill, as everyone knows, that was successfully \nreported out of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nyesterday.\n  I am proud of this piece of legislation which was crafted on a \nbipartisan basis with cooperation from the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Sarbanes, the committee's ranking member.\n  This amendment, which I hope will be part of the bill, provides \nrecord growth for public transportation at $56.5 billion--a 57-percent \nincrease over TEA-21. This funding level tracks with the growth in the \nhighway program to $255 billion. This combined funding will go a long \nway toward improving and expanding upon our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure. I am pleased, as I said, to be working with the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee chairman, Senator Inhofe, to \naccomplish this goal.\n  Our amendment, which will be part of the bill, we trust, accomplishes \nthree important policy goals. It creates funding flexibility, increases \naccountability, and improves the performance and efficiency of the \ntransit programs in the United States.\n  The bill creates several new formulas to better address growing \ntransit needs. A rural low density formula is created to allow for \ntransit services in sparsely populated areas where employment centers \nand health care are great distances apart. A growing States formula is \ncreated to allow communities with populations projected to grow \nsignificantly in the coming years to put in place needed transportation \ninfrastructure. A small transit intensive cities formula is created to \naddress the needs of communities where the level of transit service \nexceeds what their population-based formula provides.\n  Our bill also creates a super-high density formula to provide \nadditional funding for States with transit needs that are particularly \ngreat because they have transit systems in extremely urban areas with \nhigh utilization rates.\n  The bill increases the accountability within the transit program. It \nrewards transit agencies to deliver products that are on time, on \nbudget, and provide the benefits that they promised. Further, this bill \nallows communities to consider more cost-effective, flexible solutions \nto their transportation needs by opening up eligibility of a new starts \nfund to nonfixed guideway projects under $75 million in cost. With this \nchange, other solutions can be fostered, such as bus rapid transit, \nwhich can produce the majority of the benefit of rail at a fraction of \nthe cost.\n  Finally, the bill seeks to improve the performance and efficiency of \ntransit systems nationwide. It provides incentives for the coordination \nof human service transportation activities to eliminate duplication and \noverlap. It increases the focus on safety and security needs with \ntransit systems to insulate them against terrorist attacks. It also \nenhances the role of the private sector in providing public \ntransportation in an effort to reduce costs and to improve service.\n  In short, the Federal Public Transportation Act is a good bill and \none that will dramatically improve the public transportation program to \nhelp Americans with their mobility needs in urban and rural areas \nnationwide.\n  I commend this to the Senate and ask my colleagues for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Alabama, chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs, in very strong support of the Federal \nPublic Transportation Act of 2004.\n  First, let me express my appreciation to the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Shelby, who has worked assiduously on this \nlegislation, reaching across the aisle in a most cooperative manner to \ndevelop a transit bill that will begin to address the urgent needs \nfaced by communities all across the country.\n  As a result of his efforts and those of other members of our \ncommittee on the transit bill, the Federal Public Transportation Act of \n2004 was reported out of the Banking Committee yesterday morning with \nunanimous support. Every member of the committee supported this \nlegislation.\n  Let me also acknowledge the contributions made by Senator Allard of \nColorado and Senator Reed of Rhode Island, the chairman and ranking \nmember of our Housing and Transportation Subcommittee, who have worked \nwith us step by step to develop the package that is being brought to \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I also thank the distinguished leadership of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Chairman Inhofe\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\nand Ranking Member Jeffords, as well as the leadership of the Finance \nCommittee, Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus, with whom we \nhave worked closely in order to address a number of important issues \nrelated to the financing of this bill. Without their help and the very \ncommitted work of the Senate leadership, Majority Leader Frist and \nMinority Leader Daschle, I doubt that we could be where we are today. I \nthink it is important to recognize the broad effort and the broad \nsupport that exists for this legislation.\n  As we approached the expiration of the previous surface \ntransportation bill, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury, known as TEA-21, the Banking Committee and its Housing and \nTransportation Subcommittee held a series of hearings--some at the full \ncommittee level and some at the subcommittee level--on the Federal \ntransit program and its contribution to reducing congestion, \nstrengthening our national economy, and improving our quality of life.\n  Over the course of those hearings, which extended over roughly a 2-\nyear period, we heard testimony from dozens of witnesses, including \nSecretary of Transportation Norman Mineta, Federal Transit \nAdministrator Jenna Dorn, representatives of transit agencies from \naround the country, mayors, business and labor leaders, \nenvironmentalists, and transit riders--virtually all of the \nstakeholders in this important matter--and including economic \ndevelopment experts, a very important dimension of this, to which I \nwill refer again shortly.\n\n  Virtually all of the witnesses we heard agreed that the investment \nthat had been made under TEA-21--in other words, the predecessor \nlegislation to what we are now considering in the Senate--contributed \nto a renaissance for transit in this country. In fact, transit has \nexperienced the highest percentage of ridership growth among all modes \nof surface transportation, growing almost 30 percent between 1993 and \n2001.\n  We also heard testimony about the other benefits of transit. For \nexample, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce testified that $1 billion of \ncapital investment in transit creates almost 50,000 jobs. Moreover, the \neconomic development benefits of transit are becoming more and more \napparent as new systems come into service. For example, we heard \ntestimony from one of the county commissioners in Dallas that over $1 \nbillion had been invested in private development along Dallas's \nexisting and future light rail lines, raising nearby property values \nand supporting thousands of jobs.\n  We heard from a representative of BellSouth that his company decided \nto relocate almost 10,000 employees from scattered sites in suburban \nAtlanta to three downtown buildings near the MARTA rail stations \nbecause, as he put it, transit ``saves employees time. It saves \nemployees money. It saves wear and tear on the employees' spirit.''\n  Transit benefits the economy in other ways as well. For example, \ntransit investments in one community can have repercussions in many \nareas around the country. The president of the American Public \nTransportation Association, Bill Millar, who has testified before the \nSenate on a number of occasions and has brought extraordinary \nleadership to this effort, pointed out that when one locality builds a \nrail system or develops its bus system, much of that construction or \nthe assembly of those buses may well be done in a different \njurisdiction. So one has to keep in mind when considering the economic \nbenefits, it is not just the area that is upgrading the transit system \nthat is getting the money, but that area in turn is spending its money \non a whole range of supplies and services which take place elsewhere in \nthe country. When Texas cities buy buses, for example, it may be a \ncompany in Colorado that is producing the buses. As Mr. Millar said, \n``While the Federal money would appear to be going one place, the \nimpact of that money tends to go very far and wide.''\n  Of course, transit is about more than our economic life. It is also \nabout our quality of life. During our hearings, we heard a great deal \nabout the importance of transit to our senior citizens, our young \npeople, the disabled, and others who rely on transit for their daily \nmobility needs. There is a population out there, significant in number, \nwhose mobility depends on transit systems. They do not have the \nalternative of the automobile.\n  Several of our witnesses observed that the increased investment in \ntransit and paratransit services under TEA-21, the previous \nlegislation, provided the crucial link between home and a job, school, \nor a doctor's office, for millions of people who might not otherwise \nhave been able to participate fully in the life of their community.\n  Further, we saw after September 11 how transit can be an important \nlifeline in other respects, as well. We had very moving testimony \nduring our hearings about the efforts made by transit operators on that \nday to move tens of thousands of people quickly and safely out of our \ncity centers.\n  As a result of transit's many benefits, the demand for transit is \ncontinuing to increase all across the Nation. States that for a long \ntime had no interest in transit now have a very keen interest in \ntransit. I say to the Presiding Officer, the State of Nevada is \ndeveloping major transit in the Las Vegas area, for example, and it is \nmade necessary by the population explosion which has taken place in \nthat State over recent decades. Small towns, rural areas, suburban \njurisdictions, large cities, all are struggling to keep up with the \nneed to provide safe and reliable transit service for their citizens.\n  The Department of Transportation has estimated that nationally \ncommunities will need $14 billion per year in capital investment simply \nto maintain the condition and performance of their transit systems, let \nalone what is necessary to improve conditions and service. If we do not \nmake this investment today, we will be left with deteriorating \ninfrastructure and worsening congestion tomorrow and that, of course, \nwould be a depressing influence on our economy and would undermine our \neconomic strength and vitality.\n\n  The legislation before the Senate authorizes $56.5 billion in transit \ninvestment over the next 6 years. This is the amount approved by the \nSenate during consideration of the fiscal 2004 budget resolution and \nrepresents a substantial increase over TEA-21. Most experts conclude it \nis not adequate to address all the transit needs of the Nation, but it \ndoes represent a significant step forward in our efforts to improve our \ncitizens' mobility and strengthen our national economy through \ninvestments in our transportation infrastructure.\n  The legislation maintains a feature of both ISTEA and TEA-21, the two \nprevious surface transportation acts, namely, parity between the \ntransit program and the highway program so that they will be able to \nmove ahead in a parallel and comparable fashion. We are appreciative of \nour colleagues on other committees for recognizing the importance of \nthat proposition.\n  Moreover, the legislation maintains the existing 80% Federal match on \nnew starts transit projects. Again, that maintains the parallelism that \nhas existed between highways and transit so that the decision being \nmade at the local level is not weighted in one direction or the other \nbecause of the match that is required in order to move forward with the \ntransportation infrastructure. Mayor McCrory of Charlotte, North \nCarolina, made this point at one of our hearings when he observed that \n``there's a strong need to keep the program 80-20, as we do for other \nforms of transportation, including roads. That does send a strong \nmessage that transit is as important as our road network.''\n  The proposal brought forward by Chairman Shelby provides for growth \nin both the urban and rural formula program, with added emphasis placed \non the rural program. The committee was sensitive to the needs of the \nrural areas of our country, and the rural program will see significant \ngrowth in order to help States with large rural areas provide the \nservices their residents need.\n  The bill also increases the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program. \nThis funding is very important to helping cities with older rail \nsystems, which in some cases were built almost a century ago, make the \ninvestments needed to preserve those highly successful systems, which \nmove millions of people every working day.\n  The New Starts program, which helps communities make their first \nmajor investment in transit as well as expand\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\nexisting systems, also grows under this bill. The New Starts program \nwill allow communities to address their growing needs with transit \ninvestment and gain the benefits of transit that exist elsewhere in the \ncountry.\n  The bill makes a significant change in the New Starts program by \nallowing New Starts funding to be used for the first time to fund \ntransit projects that do not operate along a fixed guideway, as long as \nthe project is seeking less than $75 million in Federal funds. There \nare a few projects of this type currently operating the Nation, and I \nhope to work with the Federal Transit Administration to ensure that the \nFTA develops an appropriate quantitative methodology for evaluating the \ncosts and benefits of such projects, particularly as they relate to \nland use and economic development impacts. As we begin to experiment \nwith different forms of transit service, we must be careful not to \nadversely impact FTA's highly competitive and successful process for \nmoving projects through the New Starts program.\n  While the bill preserves the general structure of TEA-21, several new \nformulas are included to target transit funds more directly to those \nstates and cities with extraordinary transportation needs. The bill \nincludes a new Growth and Density Formula: the growth portion will \ndistribute funds to all states based on their expected future \npopulation, and the density portion will provide funding to those \nstates whose populations are above a certain density threshold. The \nbill also includes an incentive tier to reward small transit-intensive \ncities--those cities with a population between 50,000 and 200,000 which \nprovide higher-than-average amounts of transit service. The funds \ndistributed under these new formulas will help communities address \ntheir unique transportation needs.\n  So there is an effort in this legislation to recognize the various \ntypes of transit needs across the Nation. Of course, as you do any \nformula, no one gets as much as they would like to get, but you work \nwithin certain constraints. Given the framework within which the \ncommittee had to work, I think we have responded fairly and rationally \nto the needs that have been expressed to us. We have a new growth and \ndensity formula in this legislation. We make some changes in the fixed \nguideway program to give a little more discretion for smaller projects. \nBut, all in all, I think this is a balanced package. I commend it to my \ncolleagues, and of course I am happy to discuss with any of them any \nquestions they may have.\n  I want to highlight just a few more of the bill's provisions. The \nbill includes a requirement that metropolitan planning organizations \ndevelop a public participation plan to ensure that public \ntransportation employees, affected community members, users of public \ntransportation, freight shippers, private sector providers--all the \ninterested parties concerned about the transportation infrastructure--\nhave an opportunity to participate in the transportation plan approval \nprocess. Transportation investments are among the most important \ndecisions made at the local level. I firmly believe all interested \nparties should have an opportunity to contribute to this process. Our \ntransportation infrastructure is central to making our economy, and \nindeed our society in a broader sense, work day to day. That is why \nthis is such a critical and important piece of legislation.\n  I am pleased that the legislation includes a new transit in parks \nprogram to help national parks and other public lands find alternative \ntransportation solutions to the traffic problems they are now facing. \nThis is a program the administration supports, and it has had very \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate. It is an effort to address the \nproblem, made manifest in certain of our Western national parks, of the \novercrowding that has come with increased visitation. You have people \nwho wait in line all day long to get into Yosemite, for example. They \nget to the entrance and they cannot get in, because the park's roads \nand parking lots are at capacity. It is a very serious problem.\n  TEA-21 required the Department of Transportation to conduct a study \nof alternative transportation needs in our national parks and other \npublic lands, and that study confirmed that the parks are ready and \nwilling to develop transit alternatives. This legislation will help the \nparks make investments in traditional public transit, such as shuttle \nbuses or trolleys, or other types of public transportation appropriate \nto the park setting, such as waterborne transportation or bicycle and \npedestrian facilities.\n  I also want to note that the bill makes a number of modifications to \nsection 5333(b), known as section 13(c), the transit employee labor \nprotections. These provisions were the result of extended discussions \nbetween the transit labor unions and members of the committee who were \nconcerned about the impact of 13(c) on the transit program. I note that \nsection 13(c) has been a part of every transit bill since 1964, \nproviding crucial collective bargaining and job right protections. It \nhas served to unify a broad coalition of transit industry and employee \nrepresentatives to form a unique partnership which has worked together \nto expand the Federal transit program to what it is today: an \nunequivocal success. I want to mention one modification which addresses \nthe concerns of members regarding issues arising when one private \ncontractor replaces another private contractor through competitive \nbidding. Such rights were addressed in the Department of Labor's Las \nVegas decision dated September 21, 1994, as amplified by letter dated \nNovember 7, 1994. This legislation includes language in section 13(c) \nto ensure that the Department of Labor's decisions involving so-called \n``contractor to contractor rights'' are governed by the standards set \nforth in the Department's Las Vegas rulings, without otherwise \naffecting employee rights under section 13(c). In addition, I note that \nthe changes to section 13(c) are not intended to impact the level of \nprotections covering freight rail employees existing on the date \nimmediately preceding enactment of this act.\n  There are a number of other provisions in the legislation that modify \nprevious aspects of the transit programs, but for the most part the \ncommittee's intention was not to enact major changes to a program that \nhas worked well.\n  For example, while the bill enhances the role of private-sector \ntransit providers in several ways, it was not intended to change the \nlong-standing congressional policy that decisions involving the choice \nbetween public and private transit operators should be left to local \nauthorities who are better equipped to make local transportation \ndecisions, and the Federal Government should remain neutral with \nrespect to such local decision-making. In addition, while the \ndefinition of public transportation is modified slightly in the bill, \nthe intent is to clarify, rather than change, the universe of modes and \nservices encompassed by that definition.\n  And as I indicated earlier, some of the changes with respect to the \nformula seek to be sensitive to ensuring that all parts of the country \ncan participate in the transit programs. But we have tried to \nessentially maintain most of the previous arrangements which have \nworked so successfully.\n  I conclude by saying that this amendment provides essential support \nto our local and State partners in their efforts to combat congestion \nand pollution and to ensure that their citizens can access safe and \nreliable transit services. That is why the bill is strongly supported \nby a number of associations representing local officials, transit \nproviders, environmental groups, and others.\n  In a letter received by the committee yesterday, the American Public \nTransportation Association stated:\n\n       We support your commitment to retain the overall structure \n     of the federal transit program and the decision to increase \n     federal investment in transit infrastructure. This increased \n     investment will not only improve and modernize the nation's \n     transportation system, but it will also create and sustain \n     millions of badly needed jobs.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that letter, along with \nother letters of support, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will close by saying, as these letters \ndemonstrate, the legislation we are considering today is vitally \nimportant to\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\nkeep America moving forward in the 21st century. It is no exaggeration \nto say this is essential legislation for the future strength and \nvitality of our economy and of our society. I very strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support the legislation that has been brought forward \nfrom the Banking Committee, as I said, on a unanimous vote in a markup \nyesterday morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                          Community Transportation\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                                 February 5, 2004.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing \n         and Urban Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Shelby and Sarbanes: We'd like to take this \n     opportunity on behalf of our more than 7,000 members \n     providing community and public transportation services around \n     the nation, as well as the millions of Americans who rely on \n     these services every day, to commend you for your leadership \n     in the creation of the Federal Public Transportation Act of \n     2004.\n       This groundbreaking legislation builds the kind of 21st \n     century transportation network our nation needs. We're \n     pleased that it recognizes the real character of public \n     transportation and invests in transit for communities of all \n     sizes and locations. At long last, this bill begins to \n     adequately address the transportation needs of rural \n     Americans and of senior citizens.\n       Much of the success we've enjoyed in the past six years in \n     community and public transportation was based upon the \n     innovative guarantees and protections for transit financing \n     made by the federal government in TEA-21. Continuing these \n     guarantees in this important legislation is essential.\n       There's an old proverb that says the journey of a thousand \n     miles begins with a single step. This bill is a giant step \n     toward building the foundation for America's transportation \n     future.\n       We're grateful. Thank you on behalf of our members, and on \n     behalf of the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dale J. Marsico,\n     CCTM, Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                   Transportation Association,\n\n                                  Washington DC, February 4, 2004.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Minority member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing \n         and Urban Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the 1,500 member \n     organizations of the American Public Transportation \n     Association (APTA), I write to express our appreciation for \n     your outstanding efforts in marking up the Federal Public \n     Transportation Act of 2004 today. We strongly support the \n     bill and urge Senators to oppose any amendments that would \n     upset the carefully crafted compromise that the Banking \n     Committee developed. In addition, we understand that an \n     amendment will be offered to guarantee funding for transit \n     and highway investment authorized under the transportation \n     bill (S. 1072) now under consideration on the Senate floor. \n     We strongly support that amendment as well, and urge the \n     Senate to adopt it.\n\n\n                               about APTA\n\n       APTA is a nonprofit international trade organization of \n     more than 1,500 public and private member organizations \n     including transit systems and commuter railroads; planning, \n     design, construction and finance firms, product and service \n     providers; academic institutions, state associations and \n     departments of transportation. APTA members serve the public \n     interest by providing safe, efficient and economical transit \n     services and products. Over ninety percent of riders using \n     public transportation in the United States and Canada are \n     served by APTA member systems.\n\n\n                     senate banking committee bill\n\n       APTA applauds your leadership in crafting this important \n     legislation. We support your commitment to retain the overall \n     structure of the federal transit program and the decision to \n     increase federal investment in transit infrastructure. This \n     increased investment will not only improve and modernize the \n     nation's transportation system, but it will also create and \n     sustain millions of badly needed jobs.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Again, please accept APTA's gratitude and support for your \n     efforts. We look forward to working with you to enact \n     legislation that addresses the nation's critical need to \n     maintain and improve our surface transportation \n     infrastructure. If we can be of assistance in any way please \n     have your staff contact me or Rob Healy of APTA's Government \n     Affairs staff.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W.

Richard C. Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: In January the United States Conference of \n     Mayors met in Washington, D.C. for our 72nd Winter Meeting to \n     chart a new agenda for keeping America's metropolitan \n     economies strong. The cornerstone of that agenda is the \n     reauthorization of TEA-21 that invests in public transit.\n       From that discussion we write to express our support for \n     the Senate Banking Committee transit title funding level \n     providing $56.5 billion over six years for the federal \n     transit program with at least $47 billion of the $56.5 \n     billion for the transit program from the Mass Transit Account \n     of the Highway Trust Fund. We also urge you to protect the \n     funding guarantees and firewall for the transit program in \n     its entirety.\n       Mayors know all too well the negative impacts of increasing \n     congestion on our cities and recognize that anything less \n     than $56.5 billion for transit will continue America's \n     dependence on the automobile and continue the funding \n     challenges for the rail modernization, new starts, and bus \n     programs.\n       We applaud the Banking Committee's work on reauthorizing \n     the transit title of TEA-21 and look forward to providing \n     further feedback on other issues in the bill once we are able \n     to review the entire proposal. With strong backing from \n     mayors across the nation, we stand ready to work with you on \n     the reauthorization of TEA-21.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James A. Garner,\n     Mayor of Hempstead, President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 5, 2004.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing \n         and Urban Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shelby and Ranking Minority Member Sarbanes: \n     On behalf of the Surface Transportation Policy Project and \n     its many partner organizations, we are writing to convey our \n     support for the ``Federal Public Transportation Act of \n     2004'', legislation approved February 4 that provides for a \n     6-year, $56.5 billion program commitment to public \n     transportation as well as other critical transportation \n     policies under your Committee's jurisdiction.\n       We want to commend you and members of the Committee for \n     renewing the key program elements of current law, ensuring \n     that the recent successes in improving public transportation \n     services under TEA-21 will continue into this next renewal \n     period. Our support for this package, however, is conditioned \n     upon resolving outstanding funding issues with the full \n     Senate regarding funding guarantees and firewalled spending \n     to ensure that the critical feature of TEA-21 that made \n     expanded transit investment and improved services possible is \n     part of the final package. This must ensure that transit \n     providers, other agencies and the public can count on the \n     full $56.5 billion over the 6-year renewal period.\n       Specifically, we want to applaud your efforts to protect \n     the core elements of the existing program structure, ranging \n     from continuation of the Rail Modernization program to the \n     Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program, while finding \n     resources to support new policy efforts such as those \n     envisioned under the President's New Freedom Initiative and \n     Transit in the Parks program. Finally, we also want to convey \n     our support for the Committee's affirmation of current law \n     protections for clean air conformity and other clean air-\n     related provisions as well as preserving other important \n     current law policies governing NEPA and other project \n     delivery elements. It is our firm position that final \n     provisions in the Senate bill must fully account for the need \n     to consider fairly and fully transportation alternatives that \n     minimize or avoid adverse impacts and affirm locally \n     determined priorities. In this way, this renewal legislation \n     will ensure that State and local investment decisions are \n     more balanced, offering more choices to the public and making \n     continuing gains in air quality and other community health \n     and environmental objectives.\n       We support your legislation with the aforementioned \n     condition and urge your colleagues to support it fully during \n     Senate action on TEA-21 renewal.\n           Sincerely,\n         America Bikes, Association for Commuter Transportation, \n           American Society of Landscape Architects, Chicago \n           Bicycle Federation, Environmental and Energy Study \n           Institute, Environmental Defense, National Association \n           of Railroad Passengers, National Parks Conservation \n           Association, National Recreation and Park Association, \n           Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Smart \n           Growth America, Surface Transportation Policy Project, \n           Union of Concerned Scientist.\n\n\n[[Page S620]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. While the ranking member and the chairman are in the \nChamber, I wish to express my appreciation--and I think that of the \nentire Senate--for the bipartisan bill that is now going to be part of \nthis highway bill. These two men--the senior Senator from Alabama and \nthe senior Senator from Maryland--are legislators. They are \nexperienced. They understand when there is a time to be partisan and \nwhen there is a time not to be partisan. They understand when it is \nimportant to move forward for the good of this country. And that is \nwhat they did.\n  Without their leadership, we could not be in our present position. We \nhave the highway portion of this bill that has been laid down. We have \na few of our little technical things to do before they are joined \ntogether perfectly, but the transit portion of the bill--they are both \nexcellent pieces of legislation. The transit portion of the bill \naffects all of our country.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the city of Las Vegas--and Reno to a \nlesser extent--is very dependent on transit moneys now. I cannot say \nenough to express my personal appreciation and that of the Senate for \nthe work done by these two fine men. This is good legislation. I hope \nwe can move forward on it quickly.\n  I wish to say, after having issued this compliment, with which I want \nthe Record to be spread, that I have worked with Senator Inhofe on this \nlegislation for now more than a year, and Senator Bond, and, of course, \nmy distinguished former chairman and ranking member, Senator Jeffords.\n  The concern I see at this stage--we have been on this bill for some \ntime now, a matter of days--is that we have not moved far. We started \nat the goal line, and we are at about the 5-yard line. We have to get \nto the other goal line, which is 95 yards away.\n  There is an issue that has been brought up by the distinguished \nsenior Senator from the State of New Hampshire. I was talking to some \nof my friends earlier today. We have very few people in this \nlegislative body who are as experienced as the senior Senator from New \nHampshire--a House of Representatives Member, Governor, now a Senator--\nand he has brought forward an amendment he believes in, and he is not \ngoing to leave until something happens on this amendment. He may leave \nphysically, but he is going to be around here. We are going to have to \ndispose of this amendment.\n  It is obvious now that the majority will not accept a voice vote. We \ndo not have enough votes to table the amendment, and I would not vote \nto table his amendment anyway. So we have, on this amendment, a \nfilibuster. That is what it is. It is a filibuster by I don't know how \nmany members of the majority, but at least one.\n  I think we should recognize that it is holding up this bill. This \nbill is a very important piece of legislation: $255 billion that has \nbeen supported by trust fund moneys--all but $30 billion of it. The \nother $30 billion has been accounted for.\n  In my opinion, the administration has signed off on this. Any veto \nthreat they have issued has been related to what they are trying to do \nin the House. So as hard as the chairman of the committee, Senator \nInhofe, has worked, he cannot do anything as long as he has people on \nhis side trying to hold up this bill. I think there has to be a \ndecision made on what we are going to do about this. We have spent a \ncouple of days hoping the senior Senator from New Hampshire would go \naway. I have had a lot of experience with him and he doesn't go away \nvery easily.\n  I think we should recognize that we have an amendment that is popular \nand it has been brought here previously and more than 50 people will \nsupport his amendment. Whether 60 people will support it is another \nquestion. The leadership should understand that this bill is not going \nanyplace until we dispose of this amendment. It is extraneous, as the \nchairman will recognize. On this side, we believe in this bill and we \nthought, at least during this week, there should be no extraneous \namendments offered.\n  We want to get the bill passed. This is important to the people of \nthis country. If we want to create jobs, this is the way to do it: pass \nthe highway bill. As many as 2 million jobs could be created with this \nhighway bill. So I hope the majority realizes the predicament they are \nin. We are willing to work with them in any reasonable way to try to \nmove beyond where we are today. Just giving speeches out here on the \nbill is not going to do the trick. If we want to pass the bill, we are \ngoing to have to, in effect, get rid of the Gregg amendment. I have to \nbe careful how I say this. One of my friends told me something the \nother day. We were in a huddle talking about the bill, and I said: We \nare going to have to figure out a way to get rid of Judd Gregg.\n  He said: You better be careful saying stuff like that. In England, \nthe history is very clear that on the occasion when the King said the \nArchbishop is causing me a lot of problems, a couple days later three \npeople went out and assassinated the Archbishop.\n  We certainly don't mean to apply that to Judd Gregg. We are talking \nabout his amendment, not him personally. It is a problem with his \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I am sure we all appreciate \nthat clarification. I often wish the Senators who are not on the \ncommittee knew the time, effort, the bridges we have crossed, the \ncompromises we have made, and the time we have spent. We have some \nprovisions that have nothing to do with the formula or the issues or \nthe nongermane issues that the Senator from New Hampshire has. It has \nbeen very difficult. It has taken many hours and committee hearings. We \nhave had people coming in from local governments and State governments \nto get where we are today.\n  We would like to have gotten to this point back when the other \nauthorization ran out but were unable to do it. We made a commitment \nthat we would be there, and we are capable of being there now when this \nexpires on February 29. So there is going to be every effort to get \nthat done.\n  I know the Senator from Rhode Island wants to be heard. It will be my \nintention to reclaim the floor at the conclusion of his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Inhofe for his great \neffort to move the highway provisions forward. I very much would like \nto speak about the public transit issue.\n  Let me begin by commending Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member \nSarbanes for their extraordinary efforts on a bipartisan basis to \nensure that we continue the success that we have enjoyed since TEA-21 \nwith our public transit programs throughout the country. I also thank \nSenators Daschle, Jeffords, Santorum, and Baucus for their efforts to \nconvince the Finance Committee to provide us with the adequate \nresources that were necessary to bring this transit bill to the floor.\n  The bill before us today is a strong step forward toward meeting our \nNation's significant transit needs. Over the course of the last 2 \nyears, I had the opportunity, first, to serve as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Housing and Transportation of the Banking Committee, \nand then as ranking member to my colleague, Senator Wayne Allard of \nColorado. Our joint tenure as chair and ranking member, respectively, \nallowed us to look deeply at the issues confronting transit throughout \nthe United States. We had a number of hearings and we were able to get \na broad-based spectrum of witnesses to talk about the successes and the \nchallenges that face transit throughout the United States.\n  We heard from each region of the country--northern and southern, \nrural and urban. Mass transit is not exclusive to one region. In fact, \nwhat we are finding throughout the country, particularly as \nmetropolitan areas grow and transit needs increase and commuting \nincreases, every community is looking for ways to incorporate transit \nin their overall transportation plan--not simply to move people but \nalso to meet environmental standards, which are increasingly difficult \nto achieve without some type of transit system. We heard from \nbusinesspeople, environmentalists, senior citizens, the disabled, and \nthose making the transition from welfare to work. We heard from the \nadministration and from academics who are experts in the field of \ntransit.\n  Now, while these witnesses did not agree about every detail, they \nshared\n\n[[Page S621]]\n\none central message: TEA-21 works. The current Federal program for \ntransit support works very well, but preserving that success is \njeopardized by one simple thing: resources. We have to reinforce \nsuccess. If we do not provide the resources and continued commitment, \nwe will lose that success; we will disadvantage communities throughout \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased today that the bill we have before \nus in the Senate makes some changes to current law, but it takes that \ncentral message to heart and provides increased resources to meet the \ndemands of all of our communities for more effective public \ntransportation.\n  When we passed TEA-21 years ago, transit funding doubled and \nridership rose by 28 percent--faster than any other mode of \ntransportation. Mass transit is increasing faster in terms of its use \nby the American public than any other form of transportation. Another \nexample is how this program is being successfully greeted \nenthusiastically by people throughout this country. It is my hope the \nbill before us, which would provide $56.5 billion for transit of all \ntypes, can help achieve the same levels of return on our investment, \nand that we see a continued increase in ridership and use. That has a \npositive effect in terms of moving people throughout metropolitan areas \nand rural areas to get to their jobs. It has a positive effect in terms \nof making the cost of transportation lower for most people. Also, as I \nmentioned, it has beneficial environmental effects.\n  This bill would increase our transit formula programs by 56 percent, \non average, and no State sees a rate of increase below 37 percent for \nits apportionment, and the vast majority of States are at or above the \nnational average.\n  The bill is not just an urban transit bill. Indeed, rural transit \nprograms would grow from $1 billion under TEA-21 to almost $3 billion \nunder this legislation.\n  The committee also responded to the needs of States experiencing the \nhighest rates of population growth and those States with high levels of \npopulation density by creating a new program to address the traffic \ncongestion so commonly experienced in these areas.\n  The bill also increases funding for the Elderly and Disabled Transit \nProgram from $90 million in the current fiscal year to $187 million in \nfiscal year 2005 and would continue to increase this essential program \nto a total of $248 million in fiscal year 2009.\n  This legislation will also provide significantly greater \ndiscretionary funding to improve our Nation's bus fleets and expand or \nconstruct new transit projects.\n  One of the areas that was of great concern to Senator Allard and I in \nour deliberations was the impact of 9/11 on our transit system. This \nlegislation recognizes that after 9/11, we can't assume that transit is \njust business as usual. We all recognize the vital role that transit \nplayed in mitigating the damages, both in New York City and in \nWashington, DC.\n  The transit system in Washington, DC, was remarkable in terms of \nmoving and evacuating the city. The transit system in New York City was \ncritical in literally saving thousands of lives as alert and \nexperienced transit operators were able to close stations, move people \nout of stations, reroute trains, and save thousands of lives. We have \nto learn from that example. We have to incorporate in this \nlegislation--and I am proud to say we do--the responsibility and also \nthe flexibility so that local communities can use transit funds to \nprepare their workforce for these types of dangers. It is something \nthat is necessary and something, indeed, I am proud to see.\n  We held two hearings in the subcommittee with respect to transit \nsafety issues. In addition to that, Senator Sarbanes and I commissioned \na GAO study to look at the security needs for transit systems. Those \nneeds are significant. This bill at least attempts to provide the \nresources to begin dealing seriously with those transit security needs.\n  Indeed, I am glad recommendations by the GAO have been incorporated \nin the bill before us. I am particularly pleased that urban grant \nrecipients will be able to use their Federal funds to better train \ntheir personnel in security needs, as well as conduct emergency \nresponse drills to prepare for a potential terrorist incident. Such \ntraining is one of the single most important things that transit \nagencies can do to improve their passenger security.\n  This is an important step forward toward improved transit security. \nBut there are two other issues that Congress and the administration \nmust address.\n  First, the Department of Homeland Security must formally accept its \nresponsibility for protecting the millions of Americans who ride our \nbus and rail systems every day. I hope to offer an amendment, when \nappropriate, to this legislation to ensure the Department of Homeland \nSecurity does take these responsibilities seriously. And second, \nimproved transit security will require more resources than we are able \nto provide within the context of this reauthorization bill. I hope I \ncan count on all of my colleagues to support increased funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations so that it can use those \nfunds to enhance the security of transit systems throughout this \ncountry.\n  One of the unfortunate aspects of the world in which we live is that \nour foes seek the weakest links when they choose to attack us. \nUnfortunately, we have not invested in transit security to the degree \nwe have in aviation and port security. It is, unfortunately, the \nweakest link, and we have to improve it.\n  Transit is an essential part of our Nation's economy in every region \nof the country. The investments in this legislation will help to ease \ncongestion on our highways, reduce pollution, and provide for a \nsmoother functioning and more efficient economy. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this important measure.\n  Once again, I commend Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes for \ntheir great efforts, and also Senator Inhofe and Senator Jeffords for \ntheir leadership on the highway bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nof the Banking Committee not only for their work on this important part \nof the legislation but also for their willingness to work with me to \nreconcile the environmental provisions that are contained in this \namendment with the provisions contained in S. 1072.\n  S. 1072 amends title 23 of the United States Code to provide for \nadjustments in the transportation planning process. The amendment the \nBanking Committee has admirably drafted contains similar provisions \nthat amend title 49 of the code.\n  I understand that for the sake of good policy--that is, minimal \nconfusion to the entities that must implement this law--the chairman \nand ranking member are willing to work with us to craft provisions that \nare consistent with the two titles. I thank the Senators for their \nhelp.\n  Mr. President, I am also very pleased that the bill the Environment \nand Public Works Committee reported contains a provision that will help \nfund community efforts to provide safe routes to schools for \nschoolchildren who walk or who ride their bikes to school.\n  This would include funding for overpasses, underpasses, red lights, \nor other ways to help reduce accidents and keep schoolchildren safer.\n  The exact use of the funds would depend on the needs of the local \ncommunity. The funding is important because many school districts have \na policy of prohibiting bus service for children living within a mile \nor perhaps a half mile of the school.\n  A National Academy of Sciences report shows that, on average, almost \n16,000 schoolage children per year are injured or killed during normal \nschool travel hours. Let me repeat that number. Almost 16,000 \nschoolchildren are injured or killed during normal school travel hours. \nThus, I support strong funding for safer routes to the schools.\n  I know that in my home State of Vermont, especially in the dark \nwinter mornings when it is icy, schoolchildren can be at risk while \nwalking to school. When Vermont warms up, many schoolchildren may \nchoose to ride bikes to school, and we should make it as safe as \npossible for them to get safely to and from school.\n\n[[Page S622]]\n\n  Often school districts do not provide bus service to children living \nnear the schools they attend. Yet research shows that many children are \ninjured within a mile or so of their homes.\n  The provision in our bill will provide $70 million per year to help \nStates and local communities reduce these serious risks to \nschoolchildren. The committee report notes that the purpose of this \nprogram is to enable and to encourage children to walk and bicycle to \nschool and encourages a healthy and active lifestyle by making walking \nand biking to school safer or a more appealing transportation \nalternative for those living close to school.\n  I look forward to working with the other body on this important \ninitiative. I know that safe routes to schools is important to my \nfriend, Congressman Oberstar, and to a great many of his colleagues.\n  I thank Senators Inhofe and Bond for working with Senator Reid and me \non this important issue. We worked out a strong provision regarding \nsafe routes to school.\n  Mr. President, I wish to briefly discuss the freight provisions we \nhave included in this bill. We have crafted a package that provides \nconsiderable flexibility to States and metropolitan planning \norganizations in addressing freight rail concerns.\n\n  We have made improvements to intermodal freight transportation \nprojects eligible for the Surface Transportation Program and the \nNational Highway System funding.\n  We will have each State designate a freight coordinator to assist in \nintegrating freight concerns into statewide planning and metropolitan \nplanning.\n  We have also included funding to improve the condition and \nperformance of the National Highway System intermodal connectors. These \nconnectors are those last mile connections to ports and other freight-\nrelated facilities that experience a high volume of traffic and have \nnot received the proper amount of attention in the past.\n  These freight rail provisions make our bill very responsive to the \nneeds of the freight community.\n  These are important sections of the bill. I wish to emphasize the \nneed for transit improvement. As we travel around this Nation, from \nCalifornia to New York--wherever we go--we have to develop better ways \nfor our transit systems to be more effective. Looking worldwide, we \nhave seen incredible improvements in some countries that are very \npopulous with the utilization of new transit systems and new modes of \ntransportation, such as maglev and other evolving systems. This is very \nimportant, and it is going to be more important as we continue to go \nforward and continue to increase the number of automobiles on our \nhighways.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Before the Senator yields the floor, will he yield for a \nquestion?\n  First, I appreciate the fact the ranking member of the committee is \nbringing up these issues. Everything he mentioned was controversial. \nFortunately, we didn't have to handle a lot of the problems with \ntransit because that was done in another committee, and I certainly \ncommend the chairman of the committee, as well as the ranking \nmember, as well as the subcommittee ranking member and subcommittee \nchairman. I understand the subcommittee chairman is going to come on \nthe floor and make some comments.\n\n  When the Senator talks about safe routes to school, I think that is a \ngood example of the weeks and months we spent coming to an agreement. \nFrankly, Senator Jeffords is the one driving force to get up from $50 \nmillion to $75 million. I felt that perhaps priorities could be in some \nother areas.\n  In looking at this, I want to commend the Senator for the work he did \nbecause I think he is right. We probably spent several months just on \nthe freight area. Everyone knows that was not adequately addressed in \nTEA-21 and was not adequately addressed in ISTEA. I appreciate very \nmuch the time the Senator has spent in these very sensitive and \ncontroversial areas where it was give and take, it was compromise. Many \ntimes we gave up something we believed in in order to accomplish it and \ncome up with a bill, a good bill, which we have right now.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my chairman. I understand his dedication to \ndoing so much more as we go forward. We are accomplishing a lot today, \nand yet we still have to sit down and look to the future as soon as we \nare done with the present.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask if the chairman of the committee has any further \ncomments to make concerning this particular part of the bill, the \ntransit portion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I hope we can get together in the hours to \ncome and try to put a package together, perhaps, and move this bill. \nThis is an important bill in America for highways and transit. It \naffects everybody in America. It affects every Congressman's district, \nevery Senator, and I think it is too important to ignore in any way.\n  I commend the senior Senator from Oklahoma, the chairman of the \ncommittee, for the work he has done. He has been pushing this highway \nbill--I know because he has been pushing me--for months and months. I \ndo not know how many hours of work he and his staff have put in, along \nwith Senator Jeffords, Senator Bond, and others. This is just too \nimportant. It affects so many Americans. It covers everything dealing \nwith our infrastructure, and it will be good for the economy.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from one of the fastest growing States in \nthe United States. Moving people in his State, as well as a lot of \nothers, is very important. There has to be lead time to plan. I believe \nthis is a good bill, considering everything. We have put it together in \na bipartisan way in the Banking Committee where we, as well as the \nother committee, have authorization for transit. I stand ready to work \nwith the principals to move this bill as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I recognize my good friend from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks made by \nChairman Shelby. I think they are right on point. I want to stress \nagain to my colleagues, as I understand it, the highway bill was \nbrought out of the Environment and Public Works Committee with an \noverwhelming vote, almost unanimous but not quite. I think there were \ntwo exceptions, but otherwise all members of that committee on both \nsides of the aisle were supportive of this legislation.\n  The transit part that is being offered as a title or an amendment to \nthe highway bill came out of the Banking Committee with a unanimous \nvote. I think this reflects the fact that in both venues, both forums, \na major effort was made over a sustained period of time to address the \nproblems Members confronted and to try to develop a formula, an \nallocation, and other provisions of the legislation that would be \nresponsive to their needs.\n  So I say to my colleagues, this is legislation that has been very \ncarefully developed. It has been worked over and over and I think it is \na very good product. I think it has struck a very good balance. I think \nit contains within it a vision for the country.\n\n  There is a clamor across the country for this legislation on the part \nof the public and on the part of all of the stakeholders who deal with \nthese issues. State governments, local governments, the various highway \nand transit groups, business interests, labor interests, are all \nstrongly supportive of this legislation.\n  The reason they are so strongly supportive is because they recognize \nthis legislation is critical to moving the Nation ahead. It is \nessential for the economy. It is essential for enhancing the quality of \nlife. People are spending hours trying to get to and from work and we \nneed to help address that issue. Seniors, young people, and the \ndisabled need these various forms of transportation in order to live \ntheir lives. I strongly commend this legislation to my colleagues. A \ngreat deal of work has gone into it by many Members of this body. I \nthink it is very important that we move this legislation forward and \nover the next few days to come, I hope we will be able to accomplish \nthat and put into place this extremely important legislation.\n  Actually, in one of the statements of the majority leader he \nindicated he\n\n[[Page S623]]\n\nthought this might well be the most important legislation to be \nconsidered by this body in this session of the Congress. I do not think \nthat is an overstatement and I again commend this legislation to my \ncolleagues. I thank Chairman Shelby for the very productive, positive, \nand cooperative way in which he worked on this legislation and I join \nwith him in commending Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords for \nthe very fine work that was done in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus for their \nefforts in the Finance Committee that, in effect, developed a full \npackage that will make this legislation work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the comments the Senator made. I know it is \na very difficult area to deal in, but I think it is also interesting. \nWhen we look at the chairman, the ranking member, and then the chairman \nof the subcommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee, there \nis Alabama, Maryland, Colorado, Rhode Island. There is a huge \ndiversity. Most people think that geographically only certain parts of \nthe country have an interest in transit. It is not true at all because \nthere is equal enthusiasm. I am quite sure, knowing all four \npersonalities and the areas they represent, they spent a long time \nputting this together, coming up with the successes they did achieve.\n  I would like to go back and review a couple of subjects we have \ntalked about, but, first, I understand that perhaps Senator Carper was \nwanting to seek recognition.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. Chairman, when it is appropriate, I will welcome the \nopportunity to speak for maybe 5 to 10 minutes on the bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator may have longer than that if he wishes, and \nthen I would want to reclaim the floor at the conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Oklahoma yields \nthe floor. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, in \nvoicing my thanks for the work that has been done on the legislation \nbefore us today, and certainly to Senator Inhofe and his staff and \nSenator Jeffords and his staff.\n  As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, it has really been a \npleasure for me these last 12 months to work with our new chairman--\nwell, not so new chairman--Senator Shelby and our ranking member, \nformer chairman, Senator Sarbanes, as we have attempted to craft any \nnumber of pieces of legislation. Last year, the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct, which I described yesterday, with Senator Shelby, was just a model \nin the way we should be creating legislation in a badly divided \nCongress these days.\n  I don't know if the bill before us is going to be held out as a model \nfor crafting legislation, but my hope is the product is going to be a \ngood one for us and for our country.\n  I would like to speak for a few minutes about the transit provisions \nof this bill and then to talk a bit about our support as a nation for \nrail transportation and whether or not we have provided the right \nsupport and sense of priority for rail, be it freight rail or passenger \nrail.\n  Let's go back to the 1970s when something called the Urban Mass \nTransit Administration was created. We talk about legislation. We \ndidn't have ISTEA; we didn't have TEA-21; we had a highway bill. Every \nseveral years the Congress would pass a highway bill. Even after the \nUrban Mass Transit Administration was created, we would pass in the \nCongress from time to time a highway bill.\n  In due course, the Urban Mass Transit Administration became the \nFederal Transit Administration. Somewhere I believe in the 1980s, the \nFederal Transit Administration funding was joined with the highway bill \nto become a transportation bill and we began taking money. Today I \nthink it is a little less than 3 cents for every gallon of gasoline \nthat is sold that will be allocated to the Federal Transit \nAdministration to support mass transit services, including buses, \nincluding rail and a variety of other transit services.\n  With respect to the transit provisions of this bill, I think they \nrepresent our growing awareness that while roads and bridges and \nhighways are important and we still love our cars in this country--\ncars, trucks, and vans--more and more people are using transit. It is a \ngood thing they are. With the kind of congestion we have on our \nhighways, with the kind of dependence on foreign oil and the kind of \nproblems with air pollution, it certainly makes sense to have people \nget out of the cars, trucks, and vans to use transit to go to work or \ngo shop or go to a ball game or any variety of other purposes.\n  I would like us to think of our transportation system in this country \nholistically for just a moment. It includes our highways, our roads, \nour bridges. It also includes transit. Last year we spent a fair amount \nof time reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration. In doing so, \na variety of related programs, including the airport improvement \nprogram, were reauthorized. You may recall we fund aviation \nimprovements, and particularly airport improvements, from a variety of \nuser fees and some general fund moneys.\n\n  Last year we focused on aviation and how to improve our aviation \ncomponent of our transportation system. This week we are focusing on \nhighways and roads. Today we are focusing a bit on transit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a consent request? I ask \nunanimous consent to be able to proceed after the Senator from Delaware \nfinishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. At a day and age in which some 16 percent of our freight \nin this country is shipped by rail, all told over 40 percent of our \ntotal ton miles of intercity freight go by rail, we have not yet seen \nfit to say the Federal Government should have some interest, more than \njust a passing interest, in helping to support, to nurture the rail \ncomponent of our transportation system.\n  Later, probably not this week but I suspect next week, we will have \nthe opportunity to consider that question: What kind of attention, what \nkind of support should we in the Congress and in this country be \nproviding for freight rail service? What kind of support should we be \nproviding in this country for passenger rail service?\n  Amtrak has just concluded a year where they had the highest ridership \nin the history of the company. More than 24 million people rode \nintercity passenger trains, and they had the highest revenue, I \nbelieve, for any year in their history as well.\n  We spend a whole lot of time from year to year in this body talking \nabout passenger rail service and Amtrak. We really don't focus much on \nfreight rail. I would have us keep in mind, in a day and age where we \nare using some 55 percent of the oil we use to run our cars, trucks, \nand vans, 55 percent of it comes from foreign sources.\n  You can take 1 ton of freight, put it on a train here in Washington, \nDC, and take it up to Boston, MA, and you use 1 gallon of diesel fuel. \nLet me say that again. You take 1 ton of freight, put it on a freight \ntrain here in Washington, DC, take it up the Northeast corridor to \nBoston, MA, and that train will use 1 gallon of diesel fuel to move a \nton of freight by rail.\n  As Governor of Delaware, I was involved a whole lot in trying to \nimprove our highways, our roads, our bridges. There has been a lot of \nState money and, frankly, a good deal of Federal money. We are always \ngrateful for that partnership. We invest a considerable amount of money \nin transit services. We invest State money in airports along with \nFederal money.\n  We also invested State money in rail transportation projects. We did \nnot have as a partner in those rail transportation projects the Federal \nGovernment. However, if it were a highway project, for every 20 cents \nwe put up, the Federal Government would put up 80 cents to match. If we \nhad the opportunity to choose between projects where we were getting an \n80-20 match, an 80-cent match for our 20 cents on a highway project, \nand we had the option of putting our money and no Federal money in a \nrail project, the funding formula just automatically skewed our \ndecisionmaking.\n  We may have had a rail project that made a whole lot more sense for \nour State, got a whole lot better bang for\n\n[[Page S624]]\n\nthe buck than the highway project, but we were inclined and encouraged \nto use the money for the highway project because of a far better \nreturn, 80 to 20 versus nothing for our 100 cents.\n  What I think some of us will be really asked to think about next week \nis whether it makes sense to say the Federal Government should be at \nleast a modest partner in encouraging the utilization of freight rail--\ngreater utilization of freight rail. Today, the role is almost zero.\n  I believe we can do better than that. There are a whole lot of \ndifferent approaches, different ideas and thoughts about creating an \nentity that would issue bonds. The interest on those bonds would be \npaid for by the Federal Government through tax credits. The entity \nissuing those bonds would be essentially paid. There has been \ndiscussion of adding an extra penny or so to the Federal gas tax and \nusing those funds to support rail in some context.\n  I know when I served on the impact board--and former Governor Tommy \nThompson preceded me--he and I both suggested an extra half cent or so \nto the gas tax to provide additional money for capital investments for \ninfrastructure. We thought that made sense.\n  We may be asking our colleagues next week to look at an approach that \nsuggests maybe a source of funding through a gasoline tax. I don't \nthink creating an entity to issue new debt is the answer, at least not \nnow--but to look for some source of funding that would provide some \nmoney for the next 6 years to States that have identified good rail \nprojects, freight rail, or even passenger rail, which makes sense for \nthose States; if they are willing to put up their money in order to \nmatch moneys from a Federal grant through the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, I think that is an idea that may not have had a lot of \nmerit several years ago.\n  But, when you travel the highways around here or Delaware or Vermont \nor Maryland, I suspect even some places in Oklahoma, Missouri, \nMassachusetts, we see congestion on our roads the likes of which we \nhave not seen in our lifetimes. When you travel to airports, whether it \nis in Philadelphia, or BWI, or other places around the country, the \nkind of congestion we see is congestion I have never seen in my \nlifetime, and the kinds of delays we are facing I have never seen in my \nlifetime.\n  When I got out of the Navy in 1973 and got off active duty and moved \nfrom California to Delaware, about 30 percent of the oil used in \nDelaware back then in this country that year was oil we got from \noverseas.\n  When we can move a ton of freight from Washington, DC to Boston on a \nfreight train and use one gallon of diesel, that certainly says to me \nthere are some lessons for fuel economy in this day and age that we \nought to pay attention to.\n  Senator Jeffords has provided great leadership with respect to clean \nair issues. We are wrestling and wrangling before the committee on what \nis the right approach. We have seen improvements in certain aspects of \nair quality. In the Northeast, we still have huge problems with respect \nto smog and nitrogen oxide; great problems with respect to mercury. I \nbelieve others here will agree to disagree that global warming is a \ngrowing concern. But in that kind of environment, the notion that we as \na nation should be interested in fostering and encouraging a greater \ndependence on rail--freight and passenger--to move people and to move \ngoods is I think the right notion.\n  I want to close by going back to where I started.\n  Again, we worked a whole lot last year on aviation. This week we are \nworking on highways, roads, and bridges, and that certainly is \nappropriate. During today's debate, hopefully we will introduce transit \ninto the fray. That is another important component of our \ntransportation system that should get special attention. I don't know \nhow long I am going to be in the Senate. I hope I will be here for a \nwhile. But I am going to keep reminding my colleagues that rail \ndeserves a place at the table. If we provide that place, without even \nproviding a huge amount of money, I think we are going to find our \ncountry and our respective States are well served by that attention.\n  I thank the Senator very much for yielding the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield without losing the right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yielded to the Senator from Delaware at his request, \nand I asked that I get the floor when he finished. I want to explain to \nthe Senator why I wanted to get the floor back. We are on the transit \nsection. The chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Allard, has been \nwaiting to be heard on that. I only inquire about how long the Senator \nwill be until we regain the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is a relevant point. If the Senator is here and wants \nto make a brief statement on it, I would be glad to yield now if I have \nthe right to follow.\n  Mr. INHOFE. How much time does the Senator think he will require?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Probably 20 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If he is here on the relevant part, I would be glad to \nwait. That is an enormously important sector of it. I intend to speak \nvery briefly about it, but I don't intend to be longer than that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Shelby and Senator \nSarbanes for their bold transit proposal that is before us. Throughout \nthis process, they have been resolute in their defense of mass transit \nand the result is the proposal that benefits cities across this \ncountry. Simply put, mass transit, subways, commuter rail, and rapid \ntransit is the lifeblood of metropolitan economies. We cannot expect \nour cities to remain the enormous economic engines they are today \nunless we make the critical investments.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors recently released a study that shows \nU.S. metropolitan areas have accounted for 87 percent of the Nation's \neconomic growth and have generated over 85 percent of the economic \noutput, labor, income, and jobs over the past 10 years. Eighty-seven \npercent of the Nation's economic growth was from the cities.\n  When we consider statistics like these, I think my colleagues will \nagree this Senate should invest in transportation resources in a manner \nthat benefits America's metropolitan areas.\n  I am particularly happy to report that the package crafted by \nSenators Shelby and Sarbanes does just that, and all of us in the \nSenate are truly in their debt.\n  On another matter, I strongly support the Public Safety Employer and \nEmployee Cooperation Act amendment. I commend my colleague of the HELP \nCommittee, Chairman Judd Gregg, for sponsoring the Public Safety \nEmployer and Employee Cooperation Act, and for offering it as an \namendment on this bill. I am a cosponsor on this bill which was \nreported out of the committee last fall. We are joined by 25 other \nsponsors of the Senate, including a number of our Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Our public safety workers play a tremendous role in protecting our \ncommunities and families. I remember the extraordinary courage we saw \namong those rescue workers, among those firefighters, and among those \npolice officers on September 11 in 2001. They entered those burning \nbuildings, risking their lives, and after the buildings fell, they \nraised an American flag amid the ruins. That image captures perfectly \nwhat these brave men and women do. They not only protect homes and our \nlives, they represent the very best that is in us. The courage and the \nsacrifice of ordinary working Americans is our Nation's greatest \nstrength.\n\n  We were prepared to call on these men and women on 9/11, and they \nanswered the call. It is time to honor them--to honor their service and \ntheir sacrifice--by giving them collective bargaining rights.\n  For more than 60 years, collective bargaining has enabled labor and \nmanagement to work together to improve job conditions and to increase \nproductivity. These productive relationships also help workers to \nobtain better wages, better health benefits and pension benefits.\n  Collective bargaining in the public sector, once controversial, is \nnow widely accepted. It has been common at\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\nleast since 1962 when President Kennedy signed an executive order \ngranting these basic rights to Federal employees. Indeed, over 30 \nStates already recognize bargaining rights for these employees. \nUnfortunately, public safety employees in many States still lack the \nright to bargain collectively. They lack a voice on the job. By giving \nthem this voice, we will not only help these brave workers, but we will \nalso increase the safety and effectiveness of our public services.\n  This amendment guarantees the fundamental rights necessary for \ncollective bargaining--the right to form and join a union, the right to \nbargain over working conditions, and the right to legally enforceable \ncontracts.\n  The benefits of this legislation are clear and compelling. First, \nthis amendment will improve public safety. Our firefighters and police \nofficers are better equipped than anyone else to know how to improve \nour public safety.\n  As the former president of the Fraternal Order of Police testified at \na congressional hearing in 2000: ``Public safety service is delivered \nby rank-and-file officers. Therefore, it is their observations and \nexperience which will best refine the delivery of service. To exclude \nthem from having any input relating to their job, particularly when \ntheir lives are on the line, is not only unfair to the officers, but \nthe public they are sworn to protect.''\n\n  Unfortunately, many public safety officers do not have this right \ntoday. They risk their jobs when they speak out about working \nconditions that are a danger to themselves and the public. Take, for \nexample, the firefighters in Springdale, Arkansas, who testified to the \ncity council about the need for better equipment in staffing. He was \nfired for insubordination. Or the firefighters in Odessa, Texas, who \nset up a Web site and newsletter publicizing the fire department's \nfailure to provide them protective masks in the case of a chemical \nattack and were interrogated and disciplined for their actions.\n  There are too many examples like this of public safety workers who \nsee inadequate staffing and equipment, placing themselves and the \npublic at risk, who do not have the right to bargain to change the \nproblems in a contract. Our public safety employees know best what is \nneeded to keep us safe. Under this amendment they would have the right \nto negotiate these workplace conditions with cities and towns they \nserve. This will lead to greater cooperation, improved labor-management \nrelations, and better service.\n  One example of this success can be found right here with the Capitol \nPolice. When the Capitol Police were granted collective bargaining \nrights, their contract provided for a joint labor-management relations \ncommittee to review police practices, equipment, and officers' safety. \nAs a result of these discussions, the United States Capitol Police were \ngiven greater access to body armor and upgraded weapons. Over a year \nbefore September 11, 2001, our officers were already aware of the need \nfor increased security in the Capitol buildings, something we are \nreminded of every day, particularly this week.\n  Collective bargaining is also more cost effective. A study by the \nInternational Association of Firefighters shows some States and \nmunicipalities that have given firefighters the right to discuss \nworkplace issues have lower fire department budgets than States without \nsuch laws.\n  Not only would collective bargaining benefit the public, it would \nhelp these employees who do so much to protect us. Every year more than \n15,000 police officers and 75,000 firefighters are injured on the job. \nOn average, 160 police officers and nearly 100 firefighters die in the \nline of duty each year. This amendment gives these workers the \nopportunity to discuss the on-the-job safety concerns with the \nmanagement. It would also give workers a chance to improve their wages \nand benefits.\n  Public safety employees without collective bargaining rights are \noften paid less than their representative counterparts. In some of \nthese States, it is not unheard of for firefighters to earn less than \n$18,400, the Federal poverty level for a family of four. Many of these \nworkers have to pay for their own health insurance. This costs \nthousands of dollars a year they cannot afford.\n  Some of my colleagues have previously expressed concern that this \nlegislation affects States rights and public safety. This amendment \nwould preserve States rights. Each State would maintain and administer \nits own collective bargaining law. States would have the ability to \ndecide how they want to provide the collective bargaining rights. \nIndeed, the majority of the States already meet the amendment's \ncriteria.\n  This amendment also recognizes the importance of community security. \nI strongly believe our police officers and firefighters will always act \nto protect the safety of the public first. However, in order to ensure \nthere is no possible risk to this, this amendment expressly prohibits \nthe right to strike. My colleagues should, therefore, have no concern \nthat this would in any way compromise the safety of our cities and our \nneighborhoods.\n  The Federal Government recognized the right to collective bargaining \nmore than 60 years ago. Public safety workers are one of the largest \nsectors of the workplace who do not yet have that basic right. Our \nNation's police officers, firefighters, and emergency rescue workers \nhave earned that right. I urge my colleagues to give them that right by \nsupporting this amendment.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. President, on another matter, the administration is robbing the \nMedicare Program to finance the Bush reelection campaign. That is \nwrong. Today, we call on the Comptroller General of the United States \nto investigate the legality, propriety, and accuracy of this \nunprecedented and improper use of taxpayers' money. The Washington Post \ndescribes the ads the Bush administration is running as designed to \nbuild public support for the new Medicare prescription drug law, \nseeking to counteract Democratic criticism that changes to the program \nwill harm older Americans.\n  The $12.6 million of Medicare money the Bush administration will \nspend on these ads is on top of the $10 million they plan to spend on a \ndeceptive mailing to all 40 million Medicare beneficiaries touting the \nnew law. There is no purpose for these advertisements except to \nconvince senior citizens the Medicare bill is good for them. They are \nnothing more than propaganda for the Bush reelection campaign, using \n$23 million of senior citizens' own Medicare money.\n  The merits of the new law are a legitimate subject for political \ndebate. Democrats intend to keep talking about this issue all the way \nto November. We will be fighting to rewrite this deeply flawed and \ndestructive bill. President Bush will be claiming credit for it, \ndefending it, as he did in the State of the Union Message. He is \nentitled to do that. But he is not entitled to use senior citizens' own \nmoney, the taxpayers' own money, to sell this bill like a car or a cake \nof soap so the President can improve his fading chances of reelection.\n  For those who have not seen the advertisement, it features actors \npretending to be Medicare beneficiaries. Every question the actors ask \nis answered with a variant of a simple-minded slogan which is shown \nthroughout the advertisement: Same Medicare, more benefits.\n  The advertising campaign is managed--listen to this--the advertising \ncampaign is managed by the same firm that works for the Bush reelection \ncampaign and for the drug industry. If there is anyone who thinks the \nsole purpose of these ads is not to promote President Bush's \nreelection, they must come from another planet, maybe Mars.\n  There is a lot the ads and mailings do not tell the senior citizens \nbecause the Bush administration understandably does not want them to \nknow the facts of the new law. Its bland assurance that the elderly can \nkeep their Medicare does not tell them the administration's own \nestimates project over $50 billion in excess payments to Medicare HMOs \nin order to prevent Medicare from competing on a level playing field \nand ultimately privatizing the whole program.\n  It does not tell them up to 6 million senior citizens will be forced \ninto a vast demonstration program that will require them to pay higher \npremiums if they want to keep their Medicare.\n  It does not tell them if the insurance company offering the drug \nbenefit in their area charges a premium that is too high or does not \ncover the drugs\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\ndoctors prescribe, the only way they can get the drug benefit is to \nleave regular Medicare and join an HMO or other private insurance plan. \nIt does not tell them that.\n  There is a lot more this ad leaves out. It does not tell senior \ncitizens the bill has provided over $100 billion in windfall profits \nfor the pharmaceutical companies and that the Government is prohibited \nfrom negotiating better prices for senior citizens.\n  It does not tell them almost 3 million senior citizens will lose good \nretirement coverage and be forced into the inadequate Government \nprogram.\n  It does not tell them if they are poor and on Medicaid they will have \nto pay more for drugs they need and have less access to the drugs their \ndoctor prescribes.\n  It does not tell them if they wait a year or two and see how the \nprogram turns out before they join it, they have to pay higher \npremiums. In fact, it does not even tell them they will have to pay a \npremium.\n  It does not tell them they are prohibited from using their own money \nto buy supplemental coverage to fill in the gaps in the inadequate \nMedicare benefit.\n  It does not tell senior citizens the Bush administration \nmisrepresented to their own party and to the American people the costs \nof the bill.\n  The more senior citizens learn about this program, the angrier they \nbecome. I predict when they learn this misleading ad, designed to help \nthe President's reelection campaign, is paid for by their own Medicare \nmoney, they are going to be even angrier.\n\n\n                              Unemployment\n\n  Finally, I bring to the attention of the Senate an excellent report, \nthe Economic Policy Institute report that talks about the wage and \nsalary income for workers in this country. It is an ominous report and \nis something all Members who have been traveling around our States \ncertainly have found out in talking to any of the workers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the document printed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the Economic Policy Institute Economic Snapshots, Feb. 4, 2004]\n\n             Wage and Salary Income Yet To Share in Growth\n\n       The Department of Commerce's advance release on gross \n     domestic product (GDP) estimated that the U.S. economy grew \n     4% in the last quarter of 2003. This is a solid growth \n     number, although well off the extraordinarily high (and \n     unsustainable) 8.2% rate of the third quarter. However, the \n     rise in GDP has not yet translated into higher wages and \n     salaries for many U.S. workers.\n       Despite solid GDP growth in the second half of 2003, many \n     Americans continue to rate addressing the economy and jobs as \n     the nation's highest priority. One possible reason for this \n     continued anxiety in the face of rising GDP is shown in the \n     figure below: the current recovery remains the single worst \n     on record in terms of generating the real (inflation-\n     adjusted) growth in wages and salary income that is the \n     economic lifeblood of most American families.\n       In the 25 months since the recession ended, total wage and \n     salary income is up only 0.4%. It should be emphasized that \n     this is growth after the recession ended and does not include \n     income losses incurred while the economy was contracting. \n     This is the slowest wage and salary growth of any recession \n     since 1959, the first year in which monthly data on total \n     wage and salary income is consistently available.\n       Wage and salary income after the previous five recessions \n     was an average of 9.4% higher by this point in the recovery. \n     Prior to this recovery, the worst post-recession spell for \n     wage and salary growth was the last jobless recovery of the \n     early 1990s, which still saw wage and salary income rising \n     nine times faster (3.6%) than in the past 25 months. The \n     current slow growth of wages and salaries means that many \n     U.S. workers are not reaping the benefits of the recent GDP \n     growth.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is the first time in over 50 years that long-term \njoblessness has reached such high rates. Mr. President, 22.3 percent of \nthe unemployed have been out of work for more than 6 months. Without \nworkers being offered any Federal job benefits, every week 90,000 \nworkers are running out of unemployment benefits.\n  In the Senate, we have tried more than a dozen times to extend the \nunemployment benefits to ensure that those workers can continue to \nsupport their families while they look for a job. More than a dozen \ntimes our Republican colleagues have said no.\n  The White House has been silent on the issue claiming ``mission \naccomplished'' on the economy while millions of Americans remain out of \nwork. The Bush economy continues to create only one job for every three \npeople out of work.\n  But yesterday we finally had some good news. Our colleagues in the \nHouse recognized the unemployment crisis and voted, 227 to 179--\nincluding 39 Republicans--to reinstate the Federal unemployment \nbenefits for 6 months. Workers have paid into the unemployment \ninsurance trust fund. The trust fund is now $17 billion. The extension \nwould cost $6 billion to $7 billion. This is a matter of fairness.\n  In December, only 1,000 new jobs were created. Tomorrow we will find \nout how many jobs were created in January. I hope it is good news. But \nI can assure you right now, it will not be enough to restore the 2.4 \nmillion jobs lost under President Bush or enough to ensure that every \nworker who wants a job can have one.\n  That is why we need to reinstate the unemployment benefits. Americans \nare suffering. They are struggling to pay their mortgages and keep food \non their families' tables.\n  If the House of Representatives can accept this, in a bipartisan way, \nwith 39 Republicans, you would think we would be able to accept it and \nnot have it continually blocked.\n  I will just show a chart. This chart shows the average number of out-\nof-work Americans running out of unemployment benefits without finding \na job from 1973 to 2003. For 30 years it has averaged 151,000. In \nJanuary of this year, 375,000. Our Republican friends refuse--\nabsolutely refuse--to permit the continued help and assistance which \nthose workers have paid into the unemployment compensation fund, which \ntoday is $17 billion in surplus.\n  The House of Representatives has accepted it. Thirty-nine Republicans \nwent along with it. I wait, as many of our colleagues, for the \namendment that will be offered by our friend and colleague, a leader on \nthis issue, Senator Cantwell, who will offer that amendment; and it \nwill give an opportunity for the Senate to address this issue.\n  But I also point out--I see my leader in the Chamber--the Economic \nPolicy Institute, on February 4, issued a presentation of which I cite \na chart entitled ``Real growth in wages and salaries, 25 months since \nrecession's end.'' They go back to 1961, 1970, 1975, 1982, 1991, and \n2001. In the 25 months since the recession ended, wages and salaries \nhave only grown 0.4 percent. It is the lowest in the history of any \neconomic recovery that has ever been recorded.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I had to step off the floor, but I did come back and heard \npart of the Senator's statement regarding Medicare.\n  It is true, is it not, that the taxpayers of this country are paying \nfor political advertisements to talk about how good the bad Medicare \npackage is? Is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator is absolutely correct. A total of $23 \nmillion will be money that is paid in for our seniors. It is taking \nthat money that was to be used for the protection of our seniors, and \nit says $12 million--$6 million will be spent on the television. That \nis on top of the $10 million that will be done for a mailing to all 40 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries. The ad house that is handling this is \nin charge of the Bush administration's reelection campaign.\n  Mr. REID. May I ask another question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Please.\n  Mr. REID. So the Senator is saying, not only are taxpayers' dollars \nbeing spent to promote a bad Medicare program, but that the advertising \nis being done by the President's own reelection media team?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely right. I know the Senator is \nin disbelief of the gall the administration would have to take $23 \nmillion out of Medicare to use it with their own ad agency for mailings \nto 40 million seniors and to use on the airwaves in support of a bill \nand in misrepresenting the bill itself.\n  I took a moment of time to show how the ad itself is so \nmisrepresentative of what is in the bill. But the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one other question?\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is it also true that in the mailings and the television \nthey do not bother to tell what is going to happen after the election \nthat takes place in November with Medicare? Because I believe--and \nthink the Senator from Massachusetts believes--most of the bad stuff \nhappening in this bill comes after the election. Is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct, although he is not \nentirely correct. The bonuses that are going to the HMOs--some $12 \nbillion now will go to the HMOs to treat any person who would qualify \nfor Medicare. They will get a 25-percent bonus over Medicare with \ndirect subsidies, which is not a level playing field, of which we hear \nso much from the other side, but direct subsidies. Those subsidies \nstart in March of this year.\n  So you are right, the benefits are way down the road. The benefits \nthat will affect the poorest of the poor are going to be after 2006. \nBut the payoffs, the bonuses to the HMOs of $12 billion will start in \nMarch. In fact, the Administration's own internal estimates, that were \nkept secret from the American people, and have just been released, \nindicate that the payoffs will be more than $50 billion.\n  So I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nMassachusetts being sensitive to the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransit who wants to come down to the floor. He will be here shortly.\n  Mr. President, what I thought I would do is continue to go through--\nin these moments where there is a little bit of a lull--this section-\nby-section analysis, as arduous as it may be to some people. But I \nthink we need to have it in the Record so everybody has an \nunderstanding of not the hours, not the days, but the more than an \nentire year we have worked very carefully with the Senator from Nevada \nand the Senator from Vermont in coming up with the agreements and the \ncompromises we have.\n  As we had said before, the goals of the reauthorization of TEA-21--\nwhich for the next 6 years we refer to as SAFETEA--have been to \nincrease the rate of return to donor States. This is something of which \ncertainly the Presiding Officer is fully aware. It is something we are \nall sensitive to.\n  My State of Oklahoma, for example, was down in the 70 percent range \nprior to ISTEA. Then with ISTEA and TEA-21 we crept up to 90.5 percent. \nThis bill will take us up so every State will be guaranteed to get back \n95 percent. I think that goes a long way. Some people who are a bit \nsensitive to the plight of donor States believe that getting to 95 \npercent pretty much resolves the problem.\n  That was one of the points we dealt with, and that took a long time \non which to get an agreement. At the same time we did that, we wanted \nto make sure we were not negatively impacting donee States. We hear \npeople come down and complain about the formula approach, their State \nperhaps is not getting what they should be getting. Then we hear later \non a donee State will come down. We have to recognize, if we don't have \nfloors and ceilings and we take care of all the needs of the donor \nStates, it is going to affect the others.\n  For the fast growing States, that is a consideration in the formula. \nWe have never done this before. For those States that are growing very \nfast, we had to put in a ceiling, so we bumped the ceiling; otherwise, \nthere wouldn't be anything for the other States.\n  We have to keep in mind that the three largest, fast growing States \nare consuming in this bill 26 percent of the growth. Consequently, as \npeople have come to the floor, if you try to look at that and say, yes, \nwe are sensitive to this, we must do something about the fast growing \nState, and yet at the same time you have one of the States such as New \nYork or Pennsylvania that would be negatively impacted by the same \nthing. So this was a compromise all the way through.\n  Streamlining is something we tried to address. I was actively \ninvolved in the other body during the development of ISTEA in 1991 and \nthen again in TEA-21 in 1998 on this side. We were not successful in \ndoing it. In other words, there are things we can do to streamline some \nof the regulations we have to deal with. Many of those are \nenvironmental regulations where we can get that taken care of first, \nand we have provisions in this legislation that will do that and end up \ngetting a lot more for our dollars.\n  The reason we are calling this SAFETEA is that right now we have some \n43,000 deaths on the highway. We are looking now at a trend line that \nis going the wrong way. So it is time to address that. We even have the \nname SAFETEA. That is very appropriate.\n  Freight movement: We haven't really spent a long time on addressing \nthese things. Nonetheless, this bill does do it. The Federal Highway \nSystem is a key component to continued economic growth in this country. \nWe have talked about the positive effect of this bill when we get it \npassed and get by these parliamentary obstacles. Keep in mind, it \nbothers me a little bit that we have obstacles from perhaps 5 or 6 \npeople when we had 75 votes to move on and invoke cloture.\n  Remember when we saw in one of the publications on the Hill the ``Men \nWorking'' sign, and then, superimposed in the middle of that, ``Men Not \nWorking.'' That is a sign that we still have a problem. We have an \neconomy that is on the rebound now, but jobs are lingering behind.\n  There is no program out there that is more of a significant jobs \nprogram than this bill. The IPAM provisions in the legislation will \nallow those projects which are immediately ready to be completed. I \nknow the Senator from Oregon has been very concerned about how quickly \nwe can get in there and get some of these jobs going. That is why that \nprovision is in there, so you can move immediately to those projects \nthat have been approved without going through a long and arduous \nprocess.\n  That is the major concern the American people have with our not \ngetting something done. There is a lag behind highway construction and \ngetting the job done, we all know that.\n  When you talk about deficient bridges, of all 50 States, my State is \nNo. 1. People are very sensitive to that. But they also recognize that \neven when we pass this, it is going to take a while to get this done.\n  What they are aware of is, you pass this and immediately it is going \nto have a very positive impact on the job market. In calculating job \nopportunities, it is about quadruple the number of jobs that would be \ncorrected with this legislation. The reason is this: If a guy has a \njob, he is out building a road; he is also buying goods and services. \nThe manufacturing jobs are improving. We are talking about a huge \nissue. There is nothing we can do that would more quickly take care of \nthis problem.\n  The old bills had what was called a minimum guarantee. TEA-21 had a \nminimum guarantee. We all remember. We remember that formula, the 1104 \nformula. As you looked at the formula, each State had a percentage of \nthe total amount, and that was what was called the formula. But \npolitically speaking, once you get up to the 60 votes you need, it does \nnot make any difference what they did. Consequently, it didn't have any \nof the provisions in there that would try to do the most good, build \nthe best roads, and take care of the problems in the States where they \nare the most serious. We have done away with that.\n  It would have been easier to just go ahead with that because \neverybody understands that and you get 60 people happy and you have a \nbill. But we didn't want to do that because there are a lot of the \ncategories of people in the States that need to be taken care of.\n  One of the problems we have with the very fast growing States and the \nlarge States is that while we are going to end up in 2009, at the end \nof this 6-year period, with 95 percent in terms of the donor States, \nthe fast growing States, the large States will not reach that until \n2009. I regret that is necessary, but frankly there is no other way to \nmake this happen. So what we did was to put the formula into effect and \nlet the formula work.\n  I have been going through and outlining the various sections of the \nbill. We have done it from the very beginning, section 1101, all the \nway up now to 1620.\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\n  Section 1620 is the Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Program. \nAs introduced, S. 1072 did address the issue of contaminated storm \nwater runoff from highways. Specifically, it expanded the eligibility \nof storm water projects to be able to use a State's funds under the NHS \nprogram and extended the eligibility of storm water projects to \nmitigate runoff on existing Federal aid highways, ongoing \nreconstruction, rehabilitation, resurfacing, or restoration projects. \nAn amendment was adopted to create a 2 percent set-aside from the \nSurface Transportation Program amounting to nearly $1 billion.\n  This is something about which I know a lot of Members have a concern. \nMy position has always been that if a State wants to use a 2 percent, a \nState can do it. If you have a mandatory set-aside, it puts us all in \nthe position of where not only do we not have a choice, no other State \nhas either. When you add it up, that is a lot of money. You are talking \nabout a billion dollars. That is something that is going to be dealt \nwith, it is my understanding, by interested Members. We will have to \ndebate that.\n  My concern is getting to the position where we can debate legitimate \ndifferences of opinion. And that was one on which our committee was \ndivided right down the middle. The concern I have right now is we are \nnot debating things where there is a legitimate difference of opinion \nor even things that are germane. I hope that we can get to a point \nwhere we can table all nongermane amendments. I don't think we are \ngoing to get there, but I would like to get there. If we did, that \nwould resolve that problem.\n  There are legitimate issues to deal with, with amendments. Section \n1701 is transportation systems management and operations. Despite the \nhistoric increase in highway investment following the enactment of TEA-\n21, operational performance has declined. For example, a trip that \nwould have taken 25 minutes during the congested period in 1987 now \ntakes an additional 5 minutes. What we are talking about here is we \nhave more congestion. I have seen this congestion mount. I was in the \nother body for 8 years. I was on the Transportation Committee during \nthat time. The committee structure in the other body is not the same as \nhere. In the other body, all they deal with is transportation.\n  Over here, we have Environment and Public Works, so we have other \nissues with which to deal. But when I got to the Senate, a vice \nchairmanship of the subcommittee became available. That was clean air. \nWe went through the clean air problems we had during the Browner \nadministration in the EPA. A lot of the problems that came up in my \nState--in fact, with original proposals that came through, out of 77 \ncounties in Oklahoma we would have had some 50 counties that would have \nbeen out of attainment. We worked on that and tried to get something \ndone that would be successful.\n  But when we deal with this section 1701, we are saying that if you \nare out there taking a trip, going from one point to another, and \nbecause of congestion you have to stop and let your engine idle and let \nthe truck idle, you are using up a lot of fuel unnecessarily, and we \nwill quantify that in a moment in our discussion. No. 2, it is a time \nwaste. So you have an air quality problem as well as a pollution \nproblem. This bill makes several changes to improve the transportation \nsystem's management and operations, including the creation of a \nfoundation for transportation systems management and operations. \nThrough the provisions of this bill, transportation systems management \nand operations programs and projects are integrated into the capital \nplanning and construction processes. States are given tools for \nreducing traffic delays caused by vehicle accidents and breakdowns on \nhighways during peak traveling times. The bill encourages continued \ndevelopment and deployment of safety measures, notification systems to \ndisseminate safety information on Federal aid highways to motorists and \npublic safety agencies as needed. Examples may include traffic \ncongestion, freight movement and conditions, amber alert, weather event \nemergency notifications, and border and homeland security \nnotifications.\n  I have been informed there may be another Member who wants to speak \nfor a specific period of time on an unrelated issue.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will yield----\n  Mr. WYDEN. For a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. First, I express my appreciation to the chairman on the \ncommittee on which I sit. He has worked very closely with Senator Smith \nand me, and we appreciate that. If it doesn't cause any great travail, \nI was interested in speaking for maybe 10 minutes on a health care \nissue. I see our friend from Colorado. Maybe something could be worked \nout among the three of us whenever the chairman has completed his \nremarks. I think at 1:30 the rule kicks in where you can address other \nissues. If something could be worked out, it would be helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is 1:49 when that rule kicks in.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Oregon be recognized for up to 12 minutes on a subject of his \nchoice and that Senator Allard be recognized immediately after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wanted to understand where we were. The \nSenator is going to speak for 12 minutes and then I will be recognized \nfor 10 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n\n                              The MEND Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, skyrocketing prescription drug bills are \nhitting senior citizens in this country like a wrecking ball. It seems \nto me it is critically important that the Congress move on a bipartisan \nbasis to put in place aggressive cost containment measures that can \nbest be achieved by making sure that the Medicare Program has real \nbargaining power, that the barriers are eliminated to bringing in drugs \nthat are safe from other countries, and that seniors are in a position \nto compare prices, with real price disclosure in markets across the \ncountry.\n  Today I have introduced, along with the senior Senator from Maine, \nMs. Snowe, legislation that would do just that. I believe it is \ncritically important for Congress to move on this legislation in the \ndays ahead. If for no other reason, the legislation I introduced with \nSenator Snowe should be priority business because of the developments \nin the last week.\n  In the last week, it has become clear that the prescription drug \nmeasure passed last year--a measure I voted for--will cost over $130 \nbillion more than was originally anticipated. So I think there was a \nstrong case for the cost containment measures that Senator Snowe and I \nare advocating today even before the developments of the last week.\n  But on the basis of what we have learned in the last week, I don't \nsee how you can logically argue that Medicare should not have the same \nauthority to bargain for seniors who need those prescription drugs that \nMembers of Congress benefit from because of the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program that goes to bat for us.\n  So I am hopeful that this bipartisan legislation--which I believe is \nthe first significant bipartisan health reform bill this Congress--will \nbe considered quickly. Certainly the developments of the last week have \ngiven, in my view, new impetus for this legislation.\n  Our legislation is called the MEND Act, the Medicare Enhancements for \nNeeded Drugs Act. It attacks the high prices seniors are facing in four \nmajor ways:\n  First, it leverages the market share of tens of millions of seniors \ninto real bargaining power.\n  Second, it breaks down the barriers to reimportation of lower cost \ndrugs.\n  Third, it makes Congress a watchdog against unfair price spikes.\n  Fourth, it creates real incentives for seniors to get the best prices \nfor their medicine.\n  I think colleagues understand, having been home over the last few \nweeks, that there is tremendous concern with respect to this \nlegislation. There is confusion about what it stands for. I think we \nhave all heard that. But at the top of the list of concerns seniors are \nbringing to us is the question of what is being done to rein in these \ncosts. It seems to me that with an opportunity to address this in a \nbipartisan way, which is what I have done with Senator Snowe--we have \nbeen at this now for 5 years--the Congress could come together.\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\n  Now, if that is not done, it seems to me that given the developments \nof the last week, and the legislation costing $100 billion-plus more \nthan anybody anticipated, we are going to see the frustration mount not \njust with seniors but with taxpayers across the country.\n  I am going to be talking about this legislation more in the days \nahead. I am very pleased that the Senator from Colorado was kind enough \nto give me the opportunity to speak for a few minutes in the Chamber \ntoday. I am very pleased that, with Senator Snowe, we have a \nbipartisan, commonsense proposal that can help America's seniors \nreceive the prescription drugs they need.\n  Our legislation will give seniors a powerful one-two punch to fight \nback against high prescription drug prices. It will help seniors save \nmoney on every prescription and give the new Medicare benefit even more \nbuying power.\n  Under our bipartisan bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ncould fight on behalf of seniors for lower drug prices and individual \nMedicare plans would actually have incentives for negotiating prices \ncomparable to the VA.\n  Seniors should not have to underwrite tax breaks for companies that \ntry to keep affordable, reimported drugs out of their hands. Today, \ndrug companies get a dollar-for-dollar tax writeoff on their \nadvertising, advertising that is helping, in my view, to drive up the \ncost of prescription medicine. In the last year for which we have \nfigures, direct-to-consumer advertising cost $2.5 billion.\n  What we say in our bipartisan legislation is if the drug companies \nsay no to affordable reimported drugs for seniors, then they are going \nto have to say no to the tax breaks that are paid for with seniors' tax \ndollars.\n  I hope in this session of Congress we will see an effort on a \nbipartisan basis to improve on the legislation that was passed last \nyear. I voted for that bill last year. I still have the welts on my \nback to show for it. But I also came to the floor at that time and said \nI think the Congress can do better in terms of cost containment, not by \nsetting price controls, not by some big Government regime that has the \nGovernment interfering in various kinds of areas where there is no \nappropriate role. But I said there is no logical reason why Medicare \nshouldn't have the same bargaining power to get a good price for \nseniors the Federal employee plan has for Members of Congress. Now \nthere is a bipartisan proposal before the Senate that will get seniors \na fair shake using marketplace forces.\n  I hope in the remaining days of this session, legislation can be \nacted on favorably. Senator Snowe and I have worked as a bipartisan \nteam for 5 years now in an effort to try to get this prescription drug \nissue right.\n  At the top of our seniors' concerns today is the need for better cost \ncontainment. We can do it with marketplace forces. The Senate now has \nbipartisan legislation that will do just that. I hope my colleagues \nwill support it.\n  Again, I express my thanks to Senator Allard and look forward to \nworking with him on the transportation bill as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \ncomments. I, too, look forward to working with him on these \ntransportation issues. We worked together on a number of issues \nthroughout our careers. I always look forward to the cooperation he is \nwilling to share in a bipartisan way.\n  While we are passing out some ``atta boys,'' I want to again \ncongratulate the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nfor getting this bill to the floor. It was not easy. I know he worked \nall last year, and while most of us were on break, he was working hard \ntrying to work out compromises so this legislation would be one of the \nfirst with which we would be dealing when we came back in for this \nparticular session of the Congress.\n  Historically, transportation issues have not been partisan. Usually, \nit is approached in a bipartisan way. It is very complicated. Every \nState is affected differently. The bill has a highway transportation \nportion and a mass transit portion. Usually, there are some provisions, \nsuch as we saw this year, that come out of the Commerce Committee. The \nFinance Committee gets involved because there are some issues on how we \nare going to come up with the money that is required.\n  I also wish to compliment Chairman Shelby. Chairman Inhofe is \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and then we \nhave Chairman Shelby who is chairman of the Banking Committee. A major \npart of the mass transit provisions comes out of that committee. He has \nbeen working with the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes. I am chairman \nof a subcommittee in the Banking Committee that deals with housing and \ntransportation, so I have oversight over mass transit. I work with the \nranking member, Senator Reed of Rhode Island. They, too, spent a great \ndeal of time working on this legislation, and I thank them for working \nin a bipartisan way to reach a consensus on this bill.\n\n  One of the issues we struggled with is how we are going to pay for \nwhat everybody wants in highway transportation and mass transit. It is \nsomething with which Congress has been struggling.\n  This bill came out of the Finance Committee, and they put in \nprovisions. My concern is that we don't add to the deficit and we use \nthose dollars that are available in the highway trust fund to finance \ntransportation needs, particularly for highways.\n  The bill is a step in the right direction. It makes important steps \nin a number of areas. I come from a State that has experienced rapid \ngrowth. I know a lot of Members of the Senate who come from rural \nareas, particularly in the West and the South, have experienced similar \ngrowth rates in their particular States. So we all are challenged with \nthe transportation problems that come with that rapid growth. One \nproblem is mass transit.\n  Historically, most of the dollars in mass transit have gone to those \nStates that have large metropolitan areas or directly to a large \nmetropolitan area, such as New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago. But those \nof us who come from relatively small metropolitan areas but are showing \na lot of growth have never had access to dollars that are required for \nus to begin to move forward with mass transit.\n  In the State of Colorado, Denver is our metropolitan area. It was \nvery difficult at one point to access the dollars to start mass transit \nsystems. There were provisions put in place when we had Chairman \nAlfonse D'Amato from New York. I worked with him to try and put \ntogether a formula for mass transit where the smaller States could \nbegin to participate in some of the mass transit dollars. That \noriginally got put in place when Alfonse D'Amato, who was from New \nYork, was chairman of the committee. Like I said at the time when we \nwere working with Chairman D'Amato, we don't want to take all the money \nfor small States, but I think when we have more than 90 percent of the \ndollars in mass transit going just to 11 cities, that is not a good \nbalance either. So we needed to work out a formula.\n  We worked out a formula where the smaller growing metropolitan areas \nin this country would have some additional access to mass transit \nmoney.\n  We continue to work on that provision in this bill. We are beginning \nto recognize the growth and the needs in many other communities \nthroughout the United States and working to give them flexibility to \napproach their transportation problems with different perspectives. We \ngive them as many alternatives as they possibly can select in trying to \nmeet their transportation needs.\n  One area is using buses, what we call rapid transit buses. These are \nbuses that have dedicated lanes on highways. In some areas, it is \ncheaper to put down roads and highways than it is to build rail. They \nuse that and then use buses instead of mass transit. It has the \nadvantage of additional flexibility because the bus doesn't have to \nstop at one particular station. I know my State of Colorado is looking \nat this as an alternative.\n  We have money in the section that came out of Banking to provide \nadditional flexibility to the States and local communities so they can \nlook at these various alternatives as to what they can afford. There is \nno getting around it; when you start putting in a fixed rail system, \nthey are very expensive.\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\n  I am happy to report in my State of Colorado, we have a major \nconstruction project combining expanding highways with mass transit. \nThat particular project has been under budget and is ahead of schedule. \nAs a result of that, the State is developing a good reputation in that \nregard. We have tried to put incentives in this legislation that says \nto communities throughout the country if you begin to take on these \nprojects, we have incentives where you can work on the project, and if \nyou are responsible with the taxpayers' dollars and you are ahead of \nschedule and under budget, this is all good news, so we want to \nencourage that type of behavior.\n  That is so much of what we have been trying to accomplish in the mass \ntransit section of the bill.\n  Highways, obviously, are important as far as rural transportation is \nconcerned but also is bus service. In some isolated areas of this \ncountry, there are elderly people, and many rural communities are \ndisproportionately impacted by again rural populations. So they need to \nhave some other alternatives of being able to get to their doctor or \nbeing able to get down and around in their communities to take care of \ntheir vital needs. So we have provided some programs that begin to \nprovide bus service for the rural communities.\n  Overall, I think there has been a little bit of shift, if one looks \nat this transportation bill, from large States to the smaller States \nand giving the smaller States some flexibility as far as the dollars. \nThat is good because that is kind of what is happening with the \npopulation. There is a lot of population change. People are moving from \nthe larger communities and going out into the smaller communities, and \nsometimes it has to do with the quality of life. They are going out in \nthe smaller communities because they have smaller classes in the \nschools. They like the rural living. They like easier access without \nhaving to deal with traffic problems.\n  We need to keep this in mind. So there is a provision in there to \nhelp take care of some of these big issues. We figured out that about \n40 percent of the counties in this country do not have any transit at \nall and they are looking at some ways of trying to meet the needs of \ntheir local citizens.\n  Overall, this package has some good in it. We just need to work out \nhow we are going to pay for all of it.\n  The other thing I would mention is, the private sector plays a key \nrole in all of this. We sort of leaned on the private sector to help \nprovide the expertise, and we want to be sure they have an opportunity \nto get into public-private partnerships because it can benefit all \nparties. Many times if it can be opened to a free market approach, it \nholds down the cost of the project. If projects develop into monopolies \nwhere one company, one group of employees, or one community has such \ncontrol, then we do not have the competition out there to hold down the \ncost of the project.\n  I am one who ordinarily believes that if costs for a project are to \nbe held down, competition is the way to do it. Rules and regulations \nare passed, as well as having price controls. Basically, it is going to \nbe competition that best serves the customers, whatever that transit \nproject would happen to be, and also would be a process where we do not \nhave an overburdensome bureaucracy which in itself does a lot to add to \nthe cost of the project because of so much oversight.\n  So it is kind of a balance between where is the proper level of \nregulation so they can assure that things are done right but on the \nother hand hold down on the regulations so there are not unnecessary \nbureaucratic delays.\n  This is sort of a broad-brushed approach to our transportation needs. \nWe began to recognize that there are lots of ways people can travel, \nand I think we have done that in this particular bill.\n  I want to talk a little bit more about my own State of Colorado and \nwhat is happening. If we look at the highway transportation funding \nformula, Colorado does well as far as the formula is concerned. This \nkind of chart sort of illustrates that. If we look at TEA-21, the 6-\nyear average is $335 million available for Colorado in the previous 6 \nyears, per year. TEA-21 is the highway transportation bill that was \npassed and its funding ended in 2003. Now we are on 2004. This is what \nwe call SAFETEA. If we look at the funding there, we have $423 million \nin 2004 for Colorado. In 2008, it goes up to $505 million, but in the \nlast year we have a real balloon that goes up to $603. Some people say: \nI do not know if it is going to be there.\n\n  Well, it is out there quite a ways, 6 years. In the last \ntransportation bill we had, it was available for the State of Colorado. \nIn the last transportation bill, they had flexibility that the States \ncould use. There were some rather unique happenings in the Denver \nmetropolitan area in trying to meet the transportation needs of the \nState as well as that metropolitan area. So for the State of Colorado \nit is about a 46-percent increase. All total, we are talking about \n934.3 million new dollars over and above what was provided in TEA-21. \nIf we want to spill those over into jobs, it is estimated that could \ncreate as much as 44,300 new job opportunities in the State of \nColorado. So there is no doubt that if the infrastructure is worked on \nand it is done the right way, it can create a lot of opportunity in \none's State. Certainly in the State of Colorado it is creating a lot of \nopportunity for us.\n  Now, when we talk about transportation issues in my State, there are \na lot of things with which the local communities have to deal. \nObviously, there are those who have to commute to work who want to get \nto work as fast as possible. There are those who say, look, we have air \npollution problems and as a result of that we want to restrict the \namount of driving that goes on. So maybe mass transit is one of the \nways to do that.\n  The first large mass transit line that we put in the State of \nColorado, in the Denver metro area, out toward what we would refer to \nas the southwest corridor, has helped hold down our air pollution. \nPeople are using that.\n  Some people say we spent a lot of money on mass transit but it does \nnot get used. Well, at least as far as the Denver metro area, it is \nbeing used. In fact, it is being used to the point where it has \nexceeded the amount of revenue that anybody anticipated. The usage is \nmuch higher. There is so much demand to get on the train that one of \nthe things that has become an issue is parking, where are people going \nto park around the various stations in order to be able to take the \ntrain to work.\n  So now this has been moved a step further. With the success of that \ntrain, they are taking the money and saying, OK, now we can expand it \nout to the major project they are doing now, which is between two major \nbusiness centers. As far as Denver is concerned, it is going to help \nthe economy a lot. So when done right, this can create a lot of \nopportunities in the various States.\n  Again, I would stress the importance of the provisions that we have \nin here that encourage local control, encourage accountability, \nencourage efficiency so public policymakers in one's State will ask: \nWhat is it that we can do that will allow this project to move forward, \nwithout unnecessary delays? Our communities will benefit if we can get \nthese projects done under budget and ahead of schedule.\n  This is something I think every community should have the opportunity \nto strive for. As policymakers at the Federal level, it is something we \nneed to begin to push.\n  Again, the issue we are all facing is how to pay for this. I know the \nFinance Committee struggled. We are still struggling with it. What is \nthe proper funding level for mass transit? I think the key markers that \nthe President and so many Members have talked about is that we have to \nmake sure the money is money that does not come out of the general \nfund, that it stays with the--now I am talking about highways--gas tax, \nbecause the gas tax is an allocated stream of revenue that has gone to \na special purpose, and that special purpose is to build roads and \nhighways and meet the needs of this Nation.\n  We need to make sure we stay with that principle. Also, we want to \nmake sure we do not begin to spend money on a bill, or through a bill, \nthat is going to add to our Nation's deficit. Our deficits in this \ncountry are reaching historic highs, and we need to do something now to \nget deficit spending under control.\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\n  I think the Budget Committee and the Members of this body are \nbeginning to treat that issue in a very serious way. So we still have \nsome challenges ahead of us, as we move forward with this particular \nlegislation.\n  I have a lot of confidence in Chairman Inhofe as well as Chairman \nShelby. I think they have the ability to shepherd this very \ncontroversial, very complicated piece of legislation through the \nprocess.\n  This is just one body. You have the House. They take a little \ndifferent perspective on the highway transportation bill because they \nhave districts they have to represent, and they don't look at it from a \nState view like those of us here in the Senate.\n  I don't like, in my State, to be putting in special projects because \nwhat happens with special projects is they take away the flexibility of \nthe State. You are telling your State where they ought to be spending \ntheir money on certain projects. I think that ought to be left to the \nStates.\n  For example, in the State of Colorado we have sort of a complicated \nprocess. We have a highway commission. They allocate. They make \nrecommendations to the Governor and legislature. I don't feel \ncomfortable as a policymaker here in Washington telling my Governor and \nthe highway commission, people who know what is happening as far as \ntheir transportation needs, what should be done in the State of \nColorado. So I try to avoid what is referred to as porkbarrel spending, \nwhere you earmark any particular projects in your particular State \nbecause I think that ought to be done in the State level.\n  In the Senate that has never been much of a problem. When you get to \nthe House side, where Members have their own districts they have to \nworry about, sometimes they worry about not having adequate voice even \nat the State level for the district they represent, particularly if it \nis a rural area, because it gets run over by the masses in the \nmetropolitan areas. So on the House side you will see more earmarking, \nbut on the Senate side you don't see so much. If I talk to my \ncolleagues I try to encourage them to stay away from earmarking \nprojects.\n  I think the chairman on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nshares those views. He has done a good job of making this a responsible \npiece of legislation. We still have a few challenges ahead of us, but \nit has been a pleasure working with the chairman.\n  I see he has made it here to the floor. I don't see anybody else \nright now here who is interested in speaking, so without any more \ncomment on anything.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the efforts my \ncolleague from Colorado has made on the committee all the way through, \nin addition to the transit portion of this bill. We have had a very \ncohesive committee in the time, well over a year, we have worked on \nthis issue.\n  I would like to go through a few more sections here until someone \nappears, wanting to be recognized.\n  Arguably, this bill could be characterized as the most significant \nbill we will deal with in terms of how it affects so many people.\n  Regarding the Real-Time System Management Information Program, real-\ntime information is the key to enhancing the operation and performance \nin the management of our transportation system. In drafting this \nlegislation we adopted the ambitious and important goal of providing \nnationwide capability of real-time traffic and travel information. The \nmore up-to-date information available to highway users, the better they \nare able to utilize the highway transportation system efficiently. The \nobjectives of the Real-Time System Management Information Program \ninclude improving the security of the surface transportation system, \naddressing congestion problems, improving responses to weather events, \nand facilitating national and regional travel information.\n  As part of this real-time information program, States are required to \nestablish a statewide incident reporting system within 2 years unless \nthe Secretary grants a longer extension of time.\n  We try to recognize all the way through the bill what we don't want \nto do. Having been a mayor of a major city for four terms, I know what \nunfunded mandates are. That is something we don't want to be a part of, \nand we are not. We were sensitive to the problems of States and local \ngovernments so unique problems we cannot foresee at this time are taken \ncare of with the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation.\n  Regarding future Interstate System routes, under current law, States \nhave 12 years to construct National Highway System roads according to \nthe standards of a highway on the Interstate System if they wish to \ndesignate the highway as a future Interstate System route. Recognizing \nthe relative needs of the States and their respective abilities to meet \nthese standards, this bill extends the current 12-year requirement to \n25 years in order to give States more time to substantially complete \nthe construction of highways designated as future Interstate System \nroutes.\n  One of the problems, if we didn't do this, is that is making this a \nrace to complete projects. The decision that programs should warrant \nmore time, we feel, is going to end up being in everyone's benefit.\n  Stewardship and oversight is section 1802. Value engineering is \nanother important stewardship tool for reducing the total cost of \nprojects and improving their quality. Along these lines, States must \nannually certify the adequacy of their financial management systems and \nproject delivery systems to meet all Federal requirements for financial \nintegrity.\n  Accordingly, the Secretary is required to develop minimum standards \nfor estimating project costs and to periodically evaluate the States' \npractices for estimating costs, awarding contracts, and reducing costs. \nStates must apply a value engineering analysis during the design phase \nof all highway projects on the Federal aid system over $25 million and \nall bridge projects over $20 million to reduce the overall cost of the \nproject and improve project quality.\n\n  Not only are States required to meet standards of financial integrity \nfor federally funded projects, but they must also determine that \nsubrecipients of those Federal dollars also have sufficient accounting \ncontrols and project delivery systems.\n  The bill also contains mechanisms to protect future Federal aid \nprojects from fraud by mandating the debarment of contractors who have \nbeen convicted of fraud related to Federal aid highway or transit \nprograms. It mandates the suspension of contractors who have been \nindicted for offenses relating to fraud.\n  This has become a problem because there is no mechanism set up to \nkeep this from happening. We now will have the mechanism.\n  Section 1803 is design-build contracting. Under the current law, a \ndesign-build contract is defined as an agreement that provides for both \nthe design and construction of a project. The goal of design-build \ncontracting is to reduce costs by contracting out the design and \nconstruction of a project to a single contractor. At Senator Cornyn's \nrequest, the bill expands eligibility for design-build projects to \ninclude the design and construction of intermodal facilities.\n  Section 1804 is program efficiencies financing. To address certain \nprogram efficiencies in the area of financing, the bill revises current \nlaw by removing the existing restrictions that States must obligate all \napportioned or allocated funds or demonstrate they will use all \nobligation authority allocated to it for a Federal aid highway or \nhighway safety construction before advanced construction projects are \napproved. This revision clarifies that advance construction procedures \ncan be used for all categories of Federal aid funds, and that when a \nproject is converted at a regular Federal aid project, any available \nFederal aid funds may be used to convert the project.\n  The bill further removes the existing requirement that the Secretary \nfirst approve an application from the State before authorizing the \npayment of the Federal share of the cost of the project when additional \nfunds are later apportioned or allocated to the State.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be speaking, for the next several \nmoments, on leader time.\n\n\n                     DC School Choice Incentive Act\n\n  Mr. President, very briefly, I will address two issues, the first \nrelating to a bill we passed 2 weeks ago. In fact, 14 days ago--exactly \n2 weeks ago--the Senate voted 65 to 28 to help liberate Washington, \nDC's schoolchildren from its worst performing public schools. The bill \nitself was called DC Choice. The ``DC'' is obviously the District of \nColumbia. And the ``choice'' really is right at the heart of empowering \nparents and families and schoolchildren to participate in the decisions \nthat we know strike right at the heart of opening that American dream \nand giving hope to young schoolchildren here in the District.\n  DC Choice had weathered years of debate and even a veto by President \nClinton, but finally DC Choice is on its way to the District's neediest \npublic school children.\n  It was 2 weeks ago that we passed a bill that helps schoolchildren \nhere in the District. Under the DC School Choice Incentive Act, the \nDistrict will receive 40 million new dollars to support public schools \nand charter schools and choice scholarships. Indeed, nearly 2,000 \nDistrict schoolchildren will now be able to receive federally funded \nopportunity scholarships to the tune of about $7,500 each in order to \nattend schools of their choice.\n  I take this opportunity to thank some of the people--I regard them as \ntrue leaders--who made this historic legislation happen.\n  First, I commend Senator DeWine for his integrity and fairness in \nguiding the school choice debate. Senator DeWine, as we all know, is a \nconsummate gentleman and has been an invaluable ally in the cause of \njustice for the District's schoolchildren.\n  I also express my deep appreciation and respect for Senator Judd \nGregg. His passion for this issue, his dedication to this issue, his \nunflagging commitment to seeing that DC's children get the very best \neducation possible, the best education we can offer, really is an \ninspiration to us all.\n  Senator Feinstein also deserves tremendous praise for her leadership. \nHer devoted support for DC schoolchildren was critical in moving this \nlegislation, this effort forward.\n  But in addition to our colleagues, none of this would have been \npossible without the leadership and courage of the city's elected \nleadership, people such as Mayor Anthony Williams. He has been sincere \nand tenacious throughout the discussion and the debate. He has again \nand again reflected his belief in and commitment to the District of \nColumbia's children. Over the last several weeks and months, he has \nshown extraordinary strength and determination in achieving that goal \nof giving children here in the District that hope for the future, that \nopportunity to succeed, to realize the American dream.\n  Others who have been instrumental in this effort--Cardinal McCarrick, \nPeggy Cooper Cafritz, Kevin Chavous, and Virginia Walden Ford--have \ndemonstrated exemplary leadership in accomplishing passage of this \nlegislation. They are, to me, true champions of the public good, and \nthe District of Columbia is made better by their leadership.\n\n  I also thank Senate staffers Mary Dietrich, Sharon Soderstron, \nTownsend Lange McNitt, and Denzel McGuire for their hard work, their \ncompassion, and their dedication to passage of this bill. They devoted \nlong hours to this legislation.\n  Washington, DC, the District here, is blessed to have caring and \ncommitted citizens pressing for change. And with passage of this bill, \nchange is coming soon to the District's classrooms.\n  Some colleagues--some in this body and others--have implied that they \nwant to reverse this historic accomplishment. These individuals, I \nthink, by doing so, by expressing they want to see the reversal of this \nhistoric accomplishment, at least imply to me tolerating the status \nquo. That simply is unacceptable--the status quo--where we do have too \nmany failing schools here in the District, where we have frustrated \nparents who see their children locked in these failing schools.\n  We have kids here in the District, within blocks and miles of this \nCapitol Building, without hope, without ambitions, without dreams. We \nhave an obligation to help reverse this hopelessness, and indeed that \nis exactly what this legislation does.\n  We no longer can keep this city's children in the shadows. It is time \nto help lift them up, lift them up to ours and their parents' and their \nfamilies' highest expectations. Lifting the District's children out of \nilliteracy and educational poverty, putting the District's children on \nthe path to academic excellence, is just too important. The District's \nleaders want it, the District's parents want it, and, most importantly, \nthe District's children deserve it.\n  We can all expect intense scrutiny as this choice plan, which is now \nlaw of the land, unfolds. Critics, I know, are going to assail every \nperceived setback. But also expect the District of Columbia \nschoolchildren to prove them wrong. In cities such as Detroit and \nMilwaukee, where choice has been tried, choice has thrived. We see \nscores go up; we see educational gaps narrow; we see parents much more \npleased, much happier with their children's schools; and we see that \npublic support for school choice rises.\n  Choice in the District will succeed because it is based on the belief \nthat achievement is for everyone and not just a privileged few; that if \nyou open the door to opportunity, hard-working people are going to step \nthrough that door.\n  I am proud of everyone who made the D.C. educational choice happen. \nIt begins with the parents, probably ends with the legislators, but \nalso includes the elected officials and committed community leaders.\n  I am also proud of the District schoolchildren. Now, because of DC \nChoice, they are more likely to have that more cherished of American \nbirthrights: a solid education, something we all know is the key to the \nAmerican dream.\n\n\n                                Marriage\n\n  Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes and comment on another \nissue, an issue that relates to the decision yesterday by the \nMassachusetts Supreme Court. By now we have all heard that, in the \ndecision yesterday made by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, same-sex \nmarriage is the law of that State according to the courts. Indeed, \nsame-sex marriage licenses will be issued beginning May 17 in \nMassachusetts.\n  Same-sex couples from across the Nation will go to Massachusetts to \nget married. They will return to their home States--whether it be \nTennessee or Alabama or Wyoming or Ohio, all 50 States--and I would \nthink and assume that all of them would sue.\n  Some of our best legal minds conclude that courts will require \nrecognition of same-sex marriage in every single State in the Nation.\n  Marriage should remain the union of a man and a woman. The evidence \nis overwhelming that children do best with a mother and a father. We \nare gambling with our future if we permit activist judges to redefine \nmarriage for our whole society.\n  I want to be very clear: We reject intolerance. We reject hatred. We \nmust treat all our fellow citizens with civility and kindness. But \nmarriage should not be redefined by the courts, and we in this body \ncannot let it. We will not let it.\n  The U.S. Congress has codified this principle in the Defense of \nMarriage Act. It passed with 85 votes in the Senate and was signed by \nPresident Clinton in 1996. We must protect, preserve, and strengthen \nthe institution of marriage against activist judges. If that means we \nmust amend the Constitution, as it seems increasingly likely, then we \nwill do just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                                  Cuba\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to spend some time today \ntalking about the issue of Cuba. This was an issue that the Senate \nspent a lot of time on last year, and I am here today to tell my \ncolleagues we are just as committed this year.\n  Last year, as most Members know, we made tremendous progress toward \neliminating the Cuba travel ban and\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\neasing the four-decade-old embargo. As part of the appropriations \nprocess last year, both the Senate and the House passed amendments \noverwhelmingly that would temporarily suspend enforcement of the Cuba \ntravel ban.\n  I was, frankly, not only disappointed but outraged that this \nprovision was taken out of the final omnibus bill. It should not have \nbeen, especially since the measure passed both bodies by very large \nmargins. In stripping out that provision, the leadership broke the \nrules of Congress and defied the will of the majority of both Houses. \nThat is simply undemocratic. It is wrong. It is not the way bills \nshould be handled.\n  While disappointed, I emphasize today that the majority of us who \nfavor ending this embargo will work hard this year to pass legislation, \none way or another, through both bodies of the Congress, through \nconference, and on to the President's desk. Senators Enzi, Dorgan, and \nI have introduced legislation that would permanently end the travel \nban. Last year, that legislation passed out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee by a vote of 13 to 5, a very large margin. The bill has 33 \ncosponsors and is now ready for floor consideration. I respectfully ask \nthe majority and minority leaders to make floor time available to \nconsider the legislation.\n\n  The fight to end the Cuba travel ban is not over. It has just begun. \nIt is ironic that we finally face this moment at the same time that we \nare scrutinizing both the war on terrorism and the stretched Federal \nbudget because enforcing the Cuba travel ban means the use of scarce \nFederal resources.\n  It is important for Senators to understand that the Cuba travel ban \nis enforced by the same Federal agency--the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl or OFAC--that also is charged with rooting out the sources of \ninternational terrorist financing and stopping the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction. Somewhere overseas, a massive international financial \nnetwork routes millions of dollars to Osama bin Laden and other \nterrorists. Their access to dollars is their lifeline, their sole means \nof attacking our citizens and our soldiers. Rooting out this network \nand shutting it down is clearly one of our Nation's top priorities. Yet \nthe very agency that is charged with this crucial task must divert \nvaluable resources to enforce an absurd travel ban that a clear \nmajority of Congress has already voted to terminate. It doesn't make \nany sense.\n  By its own estimate, OFAC diverts one-sixth of its employee resources \nto enforcing a silly travel ban. How can we justify diverting $1 of \nthis limited budget, let alone one-sixth of our resources? Just as \ndisturbing, late last week the Department of Homeland Security \nannounced that it, too, would divert some of its resources to \nmonitoring U.S. citizens who might have traveled to Cuba.\n  In a post-9/11 world, I do not understand the administration's \npriorities. I hope this year we can finally change this policy and the \nSenate will have a chance to fully debate the issue so we can finally \nmake some sense out of the travel policy we do not have with Cuba.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. What is the matter now before the Senate? Is it the Dorgan \namendment or the Gregg amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The matter before the Senate is the Shelby \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            MAD COW DISEASE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to take a minute to come to the \nfloor this afternoon to talk about the report issued yesterday by an \ninternational panel of experts that was convened by the Department of \nAgriculture to look at this whole issue of BSE, otherwise known as mad \ncow disease. They have, once again, announced--and publicly stated--\nwhat many of us have known for a long time, that there are still many \noutstanding questions about BSE.\n  I think the unfortunate fact about all of this is that the one \nquestion for which there isn't any doubt is the origin of the mad cow \nproblem to date: one Canadian-born cow which cost a tremendous amount \nof market and value in the agricultural markets today. The one cow has \nshed an adverse light on American cattle producers in a way that is not \nonly unfair but extraordinarily costly to every producer in the country \ntoday.\n  Just yesterday--yesterday--the cost per hundred in the Chicago \nMercantile Exchange was $75. A couple of weeks ago, it was $118 per \nhundred. So we have seen a precipitous drop in the marketplace. Yet we \nstill see a resistance on the part of many with regard to one simple \neffort that could change a great deal of confidence on the part of the \nAmerican consumer--a change that has already been adopted by 43 other \ncountries. Forty-three countries currently have country-of-origin \nlabeling. We have been told by some of our exporting partners in some \nof those markets abroad that unless we implement country-of-origin \nlabeling, we can forget about exporting our products to those \ncountries. So we languish with tens of millions of dollars of product \nstill on the water unable to unload in those markets, and unable to \nbring the product back to this country because we don't want to further \njeopardize what fragile market there is.\n  We have--I do not recall now the exact figure--tens of millions of \npounds worth hundreds of millions of dollars out there on ships unable \nto go anywhere in large measure because we continue to refuse to label \nthe product. It is not just a question of consumer information, as \nimportant as that is.\n  I find it intriguing that today we label for content. We can tell you \ndown to the last gram what is in a can or a package. We can tell you \nwhat the nutritional value is. We can tell you how many carbohydrates \nthere are. We can tell what the calories are and the fat, but we can't \ntell you from what country it has come. It is a remarkable omission.\n  What is all the more remarkable is that there are those who actually \nargue that it would be an impractical requirement. We have already \nadjusted to content. We have adjusted to nutrition. But somehow it is \nimpractical--and we are told almost impossible--for us to put country-\nof-origin label. I don't know anybody who honestly believes that, but \nthere are those who profess that.\n  There is a reluctance on the part of the administration and a \nreluctance on the part of some in the Congress to recognize what I \nthink is inevitable. One day we will have country-of-origin labeling. \nOne day we will have the full advantage--I would say the patriotic \nadvantage--of ensuring that we know we are eating American beef and \nagricultural products--one day. But that day should have been a year \nago when we passed the farm bill. We gave them a year. They had until \nlast September to implement it, and we have now been put on a 2-\nyear delay.\n\n  But this international export issue, the consumer information issue, \nand the tremendous advantage in creating greater competence for \nproducers alone ought to be arguments that the time has come for us to \npass country-of-origin labeling without incumbrance.\n  For the life of me, I can't understand in this day and age, with all \nthe facts on the side of those who argue in favor that there can still \nbe the intransigence, that there can still be the reluctance and that \nthere can still be the opposition from the administrations, the \nmeatpackers, and some of our Republican colleagues in the House in \nparticular. This is not a partisan issue in the Senate. There have been \na number of Republican and Democratic Senators who have worked together \nto cosponsor legislation. An overwhelming number of Members have voted \nin favor--not once but twice so far. We have had ample debate. I must \nsay I think the arguments get flimsier and flimsier.\n  The international panel that convened and looked at this situation \nonce again offer us yet another illustration as to why it is important \nfor us to do this now.\n  Let's pass country-of-origin labeling. Let's ensure that consumers \nhave the same information as fellow consumers have in 43 other \ncountries. Let's do for origin what we have already done for nutrition \nand for content.\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\n  We will continue to offer amendments. We will continue to make it the \npolicy of this Senate, we will continue to ask for rollcall votes, and \nwe will continue to keep the pressure on until this job is done. I \nthink it is inexcusable and somewhat embarrassing that in this day and \nage with all the facts presented to us, as they now have been, that \nthere could be any question. We need to get this job done--I think for \ngood reason among producers and consumers alike. Patience is wearing \nthin.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from South Dakota yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say that the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Daschle, has been leading on this issue for some long, long \nwhile.\n  Country-of-origin labeling is a requirement under the law. We passed \nit. It is just that this administration and the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture doesn't want to implement country-of-origin labeling.\n  I held up a beefsteak by consent here on the floor of the Senate \nabout 2 weeks ago, and I asked the question: Can anyone here tell me \nwhere this piece of beefsteak came from? Everyone can say where his \nnecktie comes from. That is labeled. Just turn it over. But can anyone \ntell where a beefsteak comes from? Could it have come from the plant in \nMexico where one USDA inspector showed up, and found diseased carcasses \nhanging, covered with feces, getting ready to be put in the meat supply \nfor human consumption in the United States? Could it be from that \nplant?\n\n  After that USDA inspection, that plant changed its name, changed \nowner, the inspector has never been back, and that plant is certified \nnow to ship into this country. The question was, did that beefsteak \ncome from that plant, a plant from Guatemala, Canada, the United \nStates? Where? No one knows.\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota, can he tell me which special \ninterest has fought so aggressively, so long, and so hard to try to \nprevent country-of-origin labeling and prevent consumers and farmers \nand ranchers from being able to understand where this meat comes from? \nWho has the administration listened to, in deciding not to implement \ncurrent law?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is a very good question, and I must say I know the \nSenator from North Dakota certainly knows the answer, but for the \nrecord it is the packers. There is an amazing coalition on one side, \nover 160 consumer groups--agriculture groups, good government groups of \nall kinds, people who have said without equivocation, this is good law, \nit ought to be done--160-plus groups on one side, the packers on the \nother side. Guess who has sided with whom? The administration is \nsaying, we have to listen to those packers.\n  The point made by the Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right. \nWe have had a change of heart with regard to downer cattle in this \ncountry and it goes to the point the Senator from North Dakota is \nmaking. We had the picture of a British downer cow, crippled, sick, \nunhealthy, and that picture was portrayed over and over and over again. \nRarely was it noted that downer cow was not from the United States, \nthat was a British downer cow. But it left the perception there are \ndowner cows in this country that were entering the meat system, sick \ncattle, diseased cattle entering the meat system. So that steak could \nhave come from a downer cow, a diseased cow.\n  What happened? The administration rightfully said, we are going to \nban downer cattle from the market. I applauded it when they did. Now \nthey say, by and large, other countries are beginning to comply, as \nwell. But we do not have any assurance that downer cattle are going to \nbe prevented from entering our meat processing system even now. While \nwe have the safest system in the world, we ought to be able to buy and \neat and be confident about our beef products because we have such a \nsafe system, wouldn't it be nice to know whether or not an imported \nproduct which potentially could be a product from a downer cow came \nfrom Canada or Mexico or some other country? Wouldn't it be nice to \nknow we have that additional confidence that we are eating beef where \ndowner cattle have been expressly prohibited?\n  That is what we are talking about, improving upon an already good \nmeat safety system. That, too, is a good reason why country-of-origin \nlabeling ought to be law today.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would allow me to inquire further, the \nopposition to country-of-origin labeling, as the Senator indicated, \ncomes from the big meat packing plants, the beef packing plants. Eighty \npercent of the beef packing is controlled by four companies. It is a \ncase of big interests versus the rest.\n  The ranchers of South Dakota and North Dakota produce the best \nquality beef in the world. We know that. They know that. So the \nquestion is, why should the consumers not be able to have access to the \ninformation about where this beef comes from at the meat counter when \nthey purchase the meat? Is it South Dakota beef, North Dakota beef, \nGuatemala beef, or Mexico beef?\n  I will read the specifics regarding the Mexican plant because it is \nimportant. I discussed this previously in the Senate. In 1999, in May, \none inspector from this country paid a surprise visit to a meat packing \nplant in Mexico. He found ``shanks and briskets contaminated with \nfeces; disease condemned carcass was observed ready for boning and \ndistribution into commerce.'' Then the Mexican officials took note, \nwent to work to restore that plant's ability to sell meat in America. \nThe Mexican plant regained the export license, it switched owners, it \nswitched its name, and it now sells meat in America.\n\n  The question is, in South Dakota, when you buy a beefsteak, is it \ncoming from a ranch in South Dakota? The consumers ought to have a \nright to know and ranchers and farmers want them to have that right. \nThis Congress and this President ought to stand up for the interests of \npeople out there farming and ranching in this country who demand this \ncountry-of-origin labeling become law.\n  Senator Daschle has led the fight for some years. I appreciate the \nfact today you said you will not quit. We will get this done. And \nwhether it is forcing them to see the light or feel the heat, one way \nor the other, this administration has to stand aside and get out of the \nway and let us get this done for the American consumer.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I reiterate my thanks to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota because he has been right alongside those fighting from \nthe very first. I remember during the debate on the farm bill he was in \nthe room as we began writing country-of-origin labeling. He was \nextremely helpful in ensuring we did the right thing in terms of the \nway the legislation initially was drafted. His point is well taken.\n  Today, we see an unusual phenomenon. It is not often producers and \nconsumers merge, coalesce, and form the coalition they have in support \nof public policy. But in this case, it is one of those occurrences. One \nhundred and sixty organizations, consumers, producers, virtually every \ngood government organization that cares about nutritional issues and \nagricultural issues, food and production issues, have joined together \nto say the time has come for us to do this. We have to do it now in \nlight of BSE, in particular. Let's get this job done.\n  The international experts convened. They, too, said there are a lot \nof questions out there. We need to make sure we get the right answers \nto those questions. I am simply saying, as a result of yet another \nreport, we have one more reason why country-of-origin labeling should \nbe law today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                         State of Intelligence\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, George Tenet gave a speech today at \nGeorgetown that was profoundly disturbing to me and I want to visit \nabout it for a moment.\n  I am not on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I am not someone who \nclaims to have substantial knowledge or detailed knowledge about all of \nthese issues. I spend a great deal of time concerned about economic \nissues and think I know something about some of those, but I do not \npretend to be an expert in foreign policy or intelligence issues.\n  I, as have all of my colleagues, have sat in rooms with a label \ncalled ``top\n\n[[Page S635]]\n\nsecret'' and listened to briefings, top-secret, classified briefings \nfrom Mr. Tenet, from the Vice President, from National Security Advisor \nCondoleezza Rice, from Secretary Powell, and others. I, like others, \nhave watched what has happened in recent weeks with the testimony from \nDavid Kay in which he came to the Senate as a witness and said, look, \nwe got it all wrong. We were all wrong about the intelligence with \nrespect to Iraq.\n  I listened to David Kay describe his assessment of the intelligence \nsystem--again, this is the top weapons inspector, appointed by \nPresident Bush--and what he said was, this country got it all wrong. \nIts intelligence service got it all wrong. He said, they failed the \nPresident.\n  They did not just fail the President of the United States, if they \nfailed. They failed the President and they failed those in Congress who \nthey looked right in the eye as they gave top-secret briefings to us \nabout their assessment of intelligence. They failed the American \npeople, in my judgment. So this failure was much greater than just a \nfailure to properly inform the President.\n  This country has an enormous stake in making sure we have an \nintelligence community that works, one we support, and one we are proud \nof. Why? Someplace this afternoon there are intelligence agents who are \npouring over the thinnest of hints about what terrorists might be \ndeciding to do to murder Americans, to attack an American city, to \ncommit a terrorist act against our country, and we must rely on those \nintelligence agents and the intelligence community to understand it and \nto get it right, not to exaggerate it, not to misinterpret it, but to \nunderstand it and get it right. The safety and security of this country \ndepends on it.\n\n  None of us wants the intelligence community to be held up in anything \nother than the highest esteem. I want to be able to say the \nintelligence community gets it and gets it right. But I cannot do that \nat the moment.\n  Something is wrong, and we must fix it. When the top weapons \ninspector comes to the Congress and says, look, the intelligence was \nall wrong, it failed the President, you don't need much more than that \nto understand somebody has to be accountable. We have to, posthaste, \nbegin to fix that which failed us.\n  I have not heard of all of Mr. Tenet's presentation; I just heard the \nhighlights a bit ago in which he was defending the CIA. But let me \ndescribe one of the reasons I found Mr. Tenet's remarks so distressing.\n  Last evening I happened to be watching something on ``60 Minutes.'' \nThey were interviewing a gentleman named Greg Thielmann. Mr. Thielmann \nhad been in charge of analyzing Iraqi weapons threats for Secretary of \nState Colin Powell's Intelligence Bureau. He was the one who, after 25 \nyears, became the Acting Director of the Office of Strategic \nProliferation and Military Affairs. He was responsible, before he \nretired, for analyzing the Iraqi weapons threat.\n  He and his staff had the highest security clearances. They saw \nvirtually everything, whether it came in to the CIA or the Defense \nDepartment. He was, by all accounts, admired by everyone, and had a \nlong and distinguished career.\n  During the ``60 Minutes'' interview, Mr. Thielmann describes watching \nthe February 5, 2003, presentation Secretary Powell made to the United \nNations. He says at the time Secretary Powell made that presentation he \nwas nonplused by what Secretary Powell was saying. He says what Powell \nwas saying about a range of things was not at all in concert with the \nintelligence the State Department had. About the charge that Iraq was \nimporting aluminum tubes to use in a program to build nuclear weapons--\nhe said:\n\n       This is one of the most disturbing parts of Secretary \n     Powell's speech for us.\n\n  He is talking now of those who were part of the intelligence-\ngathering part of the State Department.\n  Intelligence agents intercepted the tubes in 2001, and the CIA said \nthey were parts for a centrifuge to enrich uranium--fuel for an atom \nbomb. But they got information from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory--\nthose are the scientists who enrich uranium for our bombs, our nuclear \nweapons--and the experts there advised that the tubes were all wrong \nfor a bomb program and the aluminum, apparently, it turns out, after \nfurther inspection, was exactly what the Iraqis wanted for artillery.\n  So they sent the word up to Secretary Powell this is not about \nnuclear weapons, it is about artillery, and the fellow who is at the \nOak Ridge Laboratory, Houston Wood, said:\n\n       I guess I was angry, that's the best way to describe my \n     emotions. I was angry at that.\n\n  Mr. Thielmann was talking now about Secretary Powell's speech to the \nUnited Nations. He said he found that the tubes could not be what the \nCIA thought they were. They were too heavy, three times too thick, and \ncertain to leak.\n  The transcript says:\n\n       ``Wasn't going to work. They would have failed,'' says \n     Wood. . . .\n\n  And they reached that conclusion in 2001.\n  They reported to Secretary Powell's office that they were confident \nthe tubes were not for a nuclear program. And then nothing happened. \nAbout a year later, when the administration was building the case for \nthe war, the tubes were resurrected on the front page of the New York \nTimes. And Mr. Wood says:\n\n       I thought when I read that there must be some other tubes \n     that people were talking about. I just was flabbergasted that \n     people were still pushing that those might be centrifuges.\n\n  The New York Times reported that senior administration officials \ninsisted the tubes were for an atom bomb program.\n  Again, Mr. Wood, the expert from Oak Ridge Laboratories, says:\n\n       Science was not pushing this forward. Scientists had made \n     their determination, their evaluation, and now we didn't know \n     what was happening.\n\n  The scientists had already said this cannot be for the development of \nnuclear weapons.\n  So in his United Nations speech, Secretary Powell acknowledged there \nwas a disagreement about the aluminum tubes, but he said most experts \nagreed with the nuclear theory. Mr. Powell said:\n\n       There is controversy about what these tubes are for. Most \n     U.S. experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in \n     centrifuges used to enrich uranium.\n\n  Most of the experts--nearly all of the experts--are at Oak Ridge. And \nMr. Houston Wood, at Oak Ridge, claims he does not know anyone in \nacademia or a foreign government who would disagree with his appraisal.\n  He said: I don't know a single person anywhere who believed that \nthese aluminum tubes were for a nuclear program.\n  Now, I do not understand this. It appears to me that information was \navailable that would have debunked several key portions. I have not \ntalked about the alleged yellowcake purchase from Niger, which was in \nthe President's State of the Union Address, which turned out to have \nbeen wrong, or the UAVs, the most sensitive of information, which \nturned out to be wrong.\n  Mr. Thielmann, who was, again, the top official at the State \nDepartment for the gathering of intelligence for presentation to \nSecretary Powell, talked about some of the slides Secretary Powell was \nusing. He talked about the stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of \nchemical weapons. He said part of the stockpile was clearly in these \nbunkers. He was showing slides:\n\n       The four that are in red squares represent active chemical \n     munitions bunkers. How do I know that, how can I say that? \n     Let me give you a closer look.\n\n  Up close, Powell said you could see a truck for cleaning up chemical \nspills. It is a signature for a chemical bunker.\n  Quote:\n\n       It's a decontamination vehicle in case something goes \n     wrong.\n\n  But again, Mr. Thielmann, who is the top intelligence person who is \nproviding information to Powell, said:\n\n       My understanding is that these particular vehicles were \n     simply fire trucks. You cannot really describe [that] as \n     being a unique signature.\n\n  In fact, it is interesting, when the weapons inspectors showed up \nover there, that is what they discovered, it was firetrucks. And in \nother circumstances, that which was part of the slides shown, they were \ntrucks with cobwebs in them and had not been used for a long while. \nThere was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n[[Page S636]]\n\n  So this is a ``60 Minutes'' presentation from the last evening, in \nwhich a top intelligence person, with all the clearances, having seen \nall the intelligence, says Secretary Powell, and others, would have had \nthe intelligence to deal with these questions easily.\n  This debate is not about pulling Saddam Hussein out of a rat hole. \nSaddam Hussein was more than a rat. Saddam Hussein was an evil man who \nkilled thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands. It is the case our \ncountry has opened mass graves the size of football fields, and those \ngraves contain the skeletons of thousands and thousands and thousands \nof Iraqis. The world is much better off because Saddam Hussein has been \napprehended and no longer runs the country of Iraq.\n  But the question for this country--and it is an important question--\nis, when the call is made the next time--perhaps an hour from now, \nperhaps a month from now--to have our intelligence community make an \naccurate assessment, will they make an assessment that is accurate? \nWill they fail us? Will they fail the President? Will they fail our \ncountry? This is a very significant issue.\n  Mr. Tenet's speech today was not only defensive, but Mr. Tenet's \nspeech failed, in my judgment, to acknowledge what the country has \nwidely acknowledged, starting with David Kay and others, that the \nintelligence failed us with respect to Iraq. And that bothers me a \ngreat deal.\n  Now, I know there will be people who come to the floor of the Senate, \nand they will say none of this really matters. Saddam Hussein was a bad \nguy. He was; no question about that. But if you say that good \nintelligence does not matter, then don't sleep very well tonight \nbecause terrorists want to commit terrorist acts in this country. \nTerrorists want to kill people in this country. The only way we are \ngoing to make certain we protect this country is through good, strong \nintelligence.\n  I worry a great deal about an intelligence community that does not \nseem to be accountable, does not get it right, and no one cares. The \nPresident ought to be furious about what is happening. The Congress \nought to be apoplectic about what is happening. Both should demand on \nan urgent basis a complete, thorough review of what went wrong and how \nto fix it--not tomorrow, not yesterday, but right now. I don't see that \nurgency at all. What I see is the President finally getting pushed and \nnudged the last couple days, saying: I will put together an independent \ncommission that can investigate intelligence, only under pressure.\n  Then we have people who come to the floor and say: There is no \nproblem here. Saddam Hussein was a bad guy found in a rat hole. It is \nbetter that he is in jail.\n  Every single one of us--Republicans, Democrats, the White House, and \nthe Congress, and especially the American people--must rely on a strong \nsystem of intelligence that gets it right to protect this country's \nlong-term security. To the extent that, as David Kay indicated, it \nfailed and to the extent that, as so many others have testified, \ncircumstance after circumstance that was alleged was not accurate, and \nto the extent now that Mr. Tenet continues today to seem to believe all \nwas well and all those who are critical are somehow just plain wrong, \nAmerica is weakened for that.\n  We will strengthen ourselves when we understand we must rely on good \nintelligence. And if we have not received good intelligence, we must \nfix that system now. It must be done posthaste. It must be job one. \nThere is an urgency for us to take action now to make certain the next \nintelligence assessment, perhaps an hour from now, to try to protect \nthis country will be an assessment that is accurate and one upon which \nwe can rely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to respond to a few of the comments \nour colleague from North Dakota has just made. I begin with the \nproposition that it does help to have been on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee or to be a member of the committee today to conduct a more \nthoughtful, reasoned discussion of this debate than has generally been \ncharacterized by the media accounts.\n  People in the media tend to try to capsulize everything in an \nattention-grabbing headline way when in fact intelligence is a very \ncomplex, difficult proposition that needs to be handled and approached \nin the most cautious and careful manner.\n  I think it is important for those people who have been on the \ncommittee or, as the Senator from Missouri sitting next to me noted, \ncurrently just received briefings as a member of the committee--it is \nimportant for them to be able to respond when comments have been made \nsuch as those just concluded.\n  David Kay did not say we got it all wrong. I invite anyone who would \nlike to bring to this floor a quotation from David Kay that says ``we \ngot it all wrong'' to do so. He did not say that. I know that is what \nopponents of the Bush administration wish he had said, but he didn't \nsay that. Let me quote to you some of the things he did say.\n  He was asked a question by Senator McCain testifying before the House \nArmed Services Committee:\n\n       You agree with the fundamental principle here that what we \n     did was justified and enhanced the security of the United \n     States and the world by removing Saddam Hussein from power?\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       Absolutely.\n\n  But then Senator Kennedy asked a question that kind of got to some of \nthe points our colleague from North Dakota just made. He asked:\n\n       Many of us feel that the evidence so far leads only to one \n     conclusion: that what has happened was more than a failure of \n     intelligence, it was the result of manipulation of the \n     intelligence to justify a decision to go to war.\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       All I can say is if you read the total body of intelligence \n     in the last 12 to 15 years that flowed on Iraq, I quite \n     frankly think it would be hard to come to a conclusion other \n     than Iraq was a gathering, serious threat to the world with \n     regard to WMD.\n\n  That is exactly the conclusion that other Members of this body \narticulated. I won't quote names, but I remember several of my \ncolleagues, including a Member on the other side of the aisle, saying \npretty much the same thing.\n  President Clinton said almost exactly the same thing. In fact, in \n1998, we overwhelmingly passed a resolution in this body authorizing \nPresident Clinton to take action to remove the Saddam Hussein regime in \nIraq precisely because of this. The intelligence that existed then, \nthat existed before then, and that existed before our most recent \nconflict with Iraq all verified what David Kay said was true.\n  So far from saying that we got it all wrong, David Kay is saying we \nwere perfectly justified in taking the action we took. Part of getting \nit all wrong would have been the information that we had regarding the \nviolations of the U.N. resolutions. What did David Kay think about \nthat?\n  He said:\n\n       In my judgment, based on the work that has been done to \n     this point of the Iraq Survey Group, and in fact, that I \n     reported to you in October, Iraq was in clear violation of \n     the terms of Resolution 1441. Resolution 1441 required that \n     Iraq report all of its activities: one last chance to come \n     clean about what it had. We have discovered hundreds of \n     cases, based on both documents, physical evidence and the \n     testimony of Iraqis, of activities that were prohibited under \n     the initial U.N. Resolution 687 and that should have been \n     reported under 1441, with Iraqi testimony that not only did \n     they not tell the U.N. about this, they were instructed not \n     to do it and they hid the material.\n       Iraq was in clear and material violation of 1441. They \n     maintained programs and activities, and they certainly had \n     the intentions at a point to resume their program. So there \n     was a lot they wanted to hide because it showed what they \n     were doing was illegal. I hope we find even more evidence of \n     that.\n\n  This is what David Kay actually said. One of the arguments made was \nthat, somehow or other, the CIA and our intelligence community were \npressured by the Bush administration to somehow modify the intelligence \nto suit their nefarious purposes, the implication being that the \nadministration wanted to go to war and needed to somehow manipulate the \nintelligence to reach that conclusion.\n  Here is what David Kay said about that:\n\n       And let me take one of the explanations most commonly \n     given: Analysts were pressured to reach conclusions that \n     would fit the political agenda of one or another \n     administration. I deeply think that is a wrong explanation. \n     And never--not in a single case--was the explanation, ``I was \n     pressured to do\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\n     this.'' The explanation was, very often, ``The limited data \n     we had led one to reasonably conclude this. I now see that \n     there's another explanation for it.'' And each case was \n     different, but the conversations were sufficiently in depth \n     and our relationship was sufficiently frank that I'm \n     convinced that, at least to the analysts I dealt with, I did \n     not come across a single one that felt it had been, in the \n     military term, ``inappropriate command influence'' that led \n     them to take that position.\n\n  Some people in saying, well, maybe we didn't get it all wrong, but \nwhat was the real state of intelligence here and did it comport with \nwhat we thought we knew--I thought the colloquy between Senator McCain \nand David Kay at this hearing was most interesting.\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       Saddam Hussein developed and used weapons of mass \n     destruction; true?\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       Absolutely.\n\n  Parenthetically, I would note, this is not an answer from a man who \nis saying we got it all wrong because, remember, the allegation had \nbeen that Saddam Hussein had developed and used weapons of mass \ndestruction. So he didn't say: We got it all wrong. He said: \nAbsolutely.\n  Senator McCain then:\n\n       He used them against the Iranians and the Kurds; just yes \n     or no.\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       Oh, yes.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       OK. And U.N. inspectors found enormous quantities of banned \n     chemical and biological weapons in Iraq in the '90s?\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       Yes, sir.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       We know that Saddam Hussein had once a very active nuclear \n     program.\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       Yes.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       And he realized and had ambitions to develop and use \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       Clearly.\n\n  Senator McCain:\n\n       So the point is, if he were in power today, there is no \n     doubt that he would harbor ambitions for the development and \n     use of weapons of mass destruction. Is there any doubt in \n     your mind?\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       There's absolutely no doubt. And I think I've said that, \n     Senator.\n\n  There is one final thing I would like to talk about that David Kay \nactually said. Senator Clinton asked him a question at that hearing as \nfollows:\n\n       I think that rightly does raise questions that we should be \n     examining about whether or not the U.N. inspection process \n     pursuant to 1441 might not also have worked without the loss \n     of life that we have confronted both among our own young men \n     and women, as well as Iraqis.\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       Well, Senator Clinton, let me just add to that. We have had \n     a number of Iraqis who have come forward and said, ``We did \n     not tell the U.N. about what we were hiding, nor would we \n     have told the U.N. because we would run the risk of our \n     own''--I think we have learned things that no U.N. inspector \n     would have ever learned given the terror regime of Saddam and \n     the tremendous personal consequences that scientists had to \n     run by speaking the truth. That's not to say, and it's not \n     incompatible with the fact that inspections accomplish a \n     great deal in holding a program down. And that's where the \n     surprise is. In holding the program down, in keeping it from \n     break out, I think the record is better than we would have \n     anticipated. I don't think the record is necessarily better \n     than we thought with regard to getting the final truth, \n     because of the power of the terrorist state that Saddam \n     Hussein had.\n  The bottom line is that David Kay recognizes that, while the U.N. \ninspectors found certain things, the inspections that he performed were \neven more helpful because of the pressure that the Iraqis had been \nunder when Saddam Hussein was in power. But what David Kay said--if you \nread all of the rest of the testimony--was basically this: There are \nmany things we found about Saddam Hussein's weapons program. We even \nfound some weapons, and we talked to a lot of Iraqis who told us that \nhe had every intention of reinitiating the programs once the sanctions \nwere lifted. Everything was in place for him to do that.\n  The thing that puzzled David Kay is that we had not found the stocks \nof chemical weapons, primarily. We knew that he had artillery shells, \nsome of which were filled with chemical agents, and others that could \nbe filled with chemical agents, and that he had large stocks of those \nagents, as well as some biological agents.\n  How do we know that is true? Because the Iraqis admitted that and the \nU.N. inspectors confirmed it. He admitted it in 1998. He never \nexplained what happened to those stocks thereafter.\n  Now, one would think that when he admits that he has the stuff--and \nwe know that he used that same kind of weapon before--that if he \ndoesn't prove to us that he got rid of it--in fact, he offers no \nexplanation about where it is--you have to assume that he hasn't. It \nwould be imprudent to assume otherwise.\n  So to suggest that David Kay came back and said, no, we got it all \nwrong, that is wrong. What he puzzles about was why we had not found \nthis stock of artillery shells.\n  Before the military activity was taken, all of the Senators were \ninvited every day at 9 o'clock to go to the secure area of the Capitol \nto visit with the general and CIA people who briefed us on the status \nof the war. Every morning, if colleagues will remember, one of the \nthings they briefed us on was how close our troops were getting to the \nred line--that line around Baghdad--where we had information that \nartillery with chemical shells could be lobbed against our soldiers. We \ndid everything we could to stop that. We bombed warehouses of \nartillery, and we were trying to take out the command and control that \nwould issue the orders. We dropped millions of leaflets on the military \ncommanders of the Iraqis, saying they would be war criminals if they \ncarried out orders to fire those artillery shells against our troops.\n  We were surprised when we took the Baghdad Airport and they had not \nfired the artillery shells. We thought they were going to use them. We \nwent to a lot of trouble to take them out. Maybe we took them out. \nMaybe we ruined their plan with command and control. Maybe they had \ngotten rid of them by then. Maybe they buried them or sent them to \nSyria.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld testified yesterday that there are about five \ndifferent scenarios that could explain why we have not found the \nartillery shells so far. David Kay says he is not sure we will ever \nfind them, or that they existed on the day we went to war against Iraq. \nMaybe they had been destroyed, although you would wonder why Saddam \nHussein didn't tell anybody about it. Maybe they were sent to other \ncountries or maybe they were given to terrorists. That would be a \nterrible thing, but we don't know.\n  Obviously, we had no evidence that they no longer existed. At one \ntime, they existed. So it is far from David Kay saying we got it all \nwrong; he is saying that we got it all right, except--and I am \nparaphrasing here--for the fact that we cannot explain what happened to \nthose weapons, and he wonders whether they existed when we went to war.\n\n  What does George Tenet have to say about it? Our colleague says that \nGeorge Tenet's comments were defensive. Maybe they were a little \ndefensive. If you have been the subject of attack for several weeks \nabout how you got it all wrong, you would be defensive, too.\n  I found his speech today to be a very interesting presentation, a \ncareful presentation about what, in fact, we knew, why we knew it, and \nwhy it would not have been prudent for us not to take action on it. I \nthought this to be particularly interesting.\n  One of the things that he said was:\n\n       To understand a difficult topic like Iraq takes patience \n     and care. Unfortunately, you rarely hear a patient, careful, \n     or thoughtful discussion of intelligence these days. But \n     these times demand it because the alternative--politicized, \n     haphazard evaluation, without the benefit of time and facts--\n     may well result in an intelligence community that is damaged \n     and a country that is more at risk.\n\n  I don't find that defensive. Rather, I find it an attempt to try to \nput this discussion into a thoughtful, careful way of analyzing where \nwe were right and where we were wrong, and how to make sure we are as \nright as possible in the future. He went on to say:\n\n       By definition, intelligence deals with the unclear, the \n     unknown, the deliberately hidden. What the enemies of the \n     United States hope to deny, we work to reveal. The question \n     being asked about Iraq in the starkest terms is, were we \n     right or were we wrong? In\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\n     the intelligence business, you are almost never completely \n     wrong or completely right.\n\n  He goes on to detail the information we had about the missile program \nof the Iraqis. I would like to say to colleagues, with respect to the \nmissile program, it appears that we got it right. He talks about what \nwe thought we knew, what he told the President we thought we knew, and \nwhat we believe is the case of our military actions. And with respect \nto their efforts to develop missiles that were in violation of U.N. \nresolutions, they appear to have gotten that pretty well right.\n  His conclusion on that was this, and I will quote it:\n\n       My provisional bottom line on the missiles: We were \n     generally on target.\n\n  He says that because he urges us to consider the fact that there is \nstill a great deal of information left to be discovered in Iraq. They \nare nowhere near complete in their effort to try to find what Saddam \nHussein had and to analyze how dangerous it was.\n  With respect to that general proposition, I want to quote this:\n\n       And to come to conclusions before the war other than those \n     we reached, we would have had to ignore all the intelligence \n     gathered from multiple sources after 1998.\n\n  He detailed many here. He said:\n\n       My provisional bottom line on missiles: We were generally \n     on target.\n\n  Regarding the unmanned aerial vehicles, he said:\n\n       My provisional bottom line today: We detected \n     the development of prohibited and undeclared unmanned \n     aerial vehicles. But the jury is still out on whether Iraq \n     intended to use its newer, smaller, unmanned aerial \n     vehicle to deliver biological weapons.\n\n  With regard to nuclear weapons, he said:\n\n       My provisional bottom line today: Saddam did not have a \n     nuclear weapon, he still wanted one, and Iraq intended to \n     reconstitute a nuclear program at some point. We have not yet \n     found clear evidence that dual-use items Iraq sought were for \n     nuclear reconstitution. We do not yet know if any \n     reconstitution efforts had begun. But we may have \n     overestimated the progress Saddam was making.\n\n  That is in contrast to what he said before the first gulf war when he \nnoted that that colored the way they approached their analysis with \nrespect to his nuclear program.\n  Then, with respect to a biological program, he said:\n\n       My provisional bottom line today: Iraq intended to develop \n     biological weapons. Clearly, research and development work \n     was underway that would have permitted a rapid shift to agent \n     production if seed stocks were available. But we do not yet \n     know if production took place. And just as clearly, we have \n     not yet found biological weapons.\n\n  Finally, with regard to the chemical weapons, he said:\n\n       My provisional bottom line today: Saddam had the intent and \n     capability to quickly convert civilian industry to chemical \n     weapons production. However, we have not yet found the \n     weapons we expected.\n\n  I will quote a little more on this point:\n\n       I have now given you my provisional bottom lines, but it is \n     important to remember that estimates are not written in a \n     vacuum. Let me tell you some of what was going on in the fall \n     of 2002.\n\n  He proceeds to detail several kinds of sources that came to the \nattention of the intelligence community, sources which provided \ninformation which no rational intelligence leader would have ignored: \nSaddam Hussein calling together his nuclear weapons committee--I am not \ngoing to go into all of this detail. He quotes, ``A stream of reporting \nfrom a different sensitive source'' that caused the intelligence \ncommunity to advise the President, the Vice President, and others that \nthey believed Saddam Hussein was actively trying to pursue these \nprograms.\n  He said:\n\n       So what do I think about all of this today? Based on an \n     assessment of the data we collected over the past 10 years, \n     it would have been difficult for analysts to come to any \n     different conclusions than the ones we reached in October of \n     2002.\n\n  That is what George Tenet said. You can say he is being defensive. I \nsay it is important for George Tenet to speak out and to explain to the \nAmerican people how difficult it is to get intelligence, what we \nthought we knew at the time, what he advised our leaders of, what we \nthink we know today.\n  He also noted the fact they have instituted efforts internally to try \nto discover why they didn't know things perhaps they should have known, \nhow they can do it better in the future.\n  When you combine that with what David Kay said about the fact there \nwas no evidence that our leadership in any way pressured our \nintelligence community to come to different conclusions, you have to \nstand up to the people who gathered this intelligence and presented it \nto the leaders. They maybe didn't get it all right, but they did their \nbest. And with respect to our leadership, there is no reason to believe \nthey didn't treat this information with the utmost of seriousness and \nhonesty; that they presented it to the American people, exactly as \nGeorge Tenet said today. They presented it in an honest way and that it \nwould have been irresponsible of them to have acted any differently, to \nhave presented it any differently given the information that had been \npresented to them.\n  I think that had the President, knowing what he now knows and all of \nthis would eventually come out even though a lot of it is classified \ninformation, if the President had not taken action and, God forbid, \nsomething had happened, a lot of people on the Senate floor, in the \nSenate, around the country, and certainly pundits would be saying: Why \ndid President Bush ignore these warnings? Why did he ignore what the \nintelligence community came up with?\n  There are some people who are saying that with respect to the attack \nof 9/11 when the President had virtually nothing, in fact, when we had \nobviously no reason to believe that on September 11 there would be an \nattack from the airliners that would be used by the al-Qaida \nterrorists, and yet with virtually nothing to go on, people are saying \nthe President should have known and done something about it.\n  With all of the evidence we had about Saddam Hussein and all of the \nevidence with regard to Iraq, to have ignored that would have been \nabsolutely irresponsible. My colleagues who are criticizing him today \nfor acting would then be criticizing him for not acting, I believe.\n  In a political season, you are darned if you do and darned if you \ndon't. We understand that. But I think it is important, as George Tenet \nasked us to do, especially for those of us in the Senate, especially \nthose of us who served on the Intelligence Committee, to urge people to \napproach this subject from a sober, careful, nonpoliticized point of \nview because lives are at stake.\n  We make decisions and the executive branch and military make \ndecisions based upon our intelligence. We have to make sure that the \nway we restructure intelligence, the funding decisions that we make, \nand the other things we do are not based upon quick judgments, on \npolitical judgments certainly, but rather are based upon a calm \nanalysis, a reflection based upon perspective and certainly an \nunderstanding of the difficulties that the intelligence community \nfaces.\n  When you do all of that, I think you can come to no other conclusion \nthan what David Kay came to, that George Tenet said, the President, the \nVice President, Secretary Powell, before the United Nations, that there \nwas a problem here that could not be ignored.\n  It would be absolutely wrong for anybody to suggest today that we got \nit all wrong and that for some reason that is President Bush's fault \nand certainly not for anyone to suggest that somehow or another our \nleadership misled the American people in order to go to war. That would \nbe the absolute height of irresponsibility. No President, Republican or \nDemocrat, I can think of would ever do such a thing.\n  I am disappointed that some--and I am not referring to anybody in \nthis body at this point--that some people would actually suggest that \nwould be the case. But when we talk about the intelligence the way it \nhas been discussed here today, it leads to that kind of conclusion. I \nthink that is unfortunate.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to try to discuss this in a relatively \nimpassioned way, a carefully constructive way so working together we \ncan craft the kind of policies that will provide for our security in \nthe future, protection of the American people, and certainly the \nprotection of the people we send into harm's way to protect us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague's admonition in using care in\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\ndiscussing this issue is admirable. Care is exactly what we ought to \nuse when we evaluate what has happened and not happened.\n  My colleague, incidentally, has just made the point that there was \nintelligence that suggested that Iraq posed a threat. And that was \nexactly my point. That is exactly the intelligence that was represented \nto this body and to the House and to the American people. But it turns \nout the intelligence, the specific intelligence, that was presented was \nwrong.\n  My colleague also, at the start of his presentation, defied anyone to \nshow him a quote from Mr. Kay that said he was wrong or we were wrong. \nI will do that. My colleague will likely want to then revise his \nremarks. My hope is he might do that.\n  Here is the front cover of Newsweek this week. Mr. David Kay--and \nthis is in quotes--says:\n\n       We were all wrong.\n\n  I will go to the inside on page 27, again a direct quote of Mr. Kay:\n\n       It turns out we were all wrong probably in my judgment.\n\n  This is testimony before the Armed Services Committee. On a third \npoint, in the fourth paragraph of his prepared testimony given before \nthe Armed Services Committee, quoting David Kay:\n\n       Let me begin by saying we were almost all wrong.\n\n  My colleague challenged someone to come up with a quote. There are \nthree of them, and my hope is the record might at least stand on direct \nquotes that are presented here before a committee of the Senate.\n  If one dare whisper these days--just whisper--about these issues, it \nis perceived as a frontal assault against the President of the United \nStates. That is sheer, utter nonsense.\n  The question before this body and this country, in my judgment, is if \nthe top weapons inspector appointed by this President goes to Iraq and \ncomes back to us and says that body of intelligence that was given us, \ngiven our country, given our Congress before we went into Iraq was all \nwrong, we have an obligation to address that issue, not later, but now. \nWe have an obligation not to try to protect someone in the \nadministration or in Congress. We have an obligation to protect the \nAmerican people not later, but now.\n  I am not on the Intelligence Committee. I have deep admiration for \nall who do serve, Republicans and Democrats. But I would hope, just as \none Member of the Senate, that the most significant energy in this body \nto follow where this string leads and try to determine what is wrong, \nwhat happened, what persuades Mr. Kay to come and say, ``It turns out \nwe were all wrong,'' I would expect my colleagues on the Intelligence \nCommittee, without respect of politics, just to follow that string to \nfind out what on Earth happened and how do we fix it immediately.\n  To suggest that somehow that we ought not worry about this, that \ninvading Iraq was fine because Saddam Hussein was an evil man, just \nchanges the subject. Sure he was an evil man. We found him in a \nrathole. He was a rat in a rathole. He is a killer, a murderer. The \nworld is better off because he doesn't lead Iraq. That is not the \nquestion.\n  The question is what trust, what confidence do we have in this \ncountry's system of intelligence today? Our intelligence system needs \nto pore over information about chatter, about satellite photos, about \nraw intelligence to determine who might be planning an attack tonight \non an American city, who might be designing right now to kill \nAmericans. I want that intelligence community to get it right. I want \nit to be the finest intelligence community in the world. I am sorry \nthat I say Mr. Tenet is defensive. I am sorry to have to say that I \nthink he got it wrong. But David Kay says it and others say it.\n\n  All of us in this Chamber depend on our intelligence community. We \nspend a great deal of money on it. I want the finest we can possibly \nhave protecting this country. If anyone believes our intelligence \ncommunity got it all right, did just fine, then they ought to sleep \nlike a baby--go to sleep early and sleep late and have a great night's \nsleep. But if they believe, as Mr. Kay does--and, yes, that is what he \nbelieves. I have quoted three different occasions where he said we got \nit wrong, and if someone believes, as many respected foreign policy \nthinkers and intelligence thinkers do believe, that there is something \nwrong, something significantly wrong that we need to address, then we \nought to join together, Republicans and Democrats, and not worry about \nwho might be criticized, just decide we are going to fix it. That is \nour job.\n  It is not our job to protect the Senate, to protect the President. It \nis our job to protect this country. I worry a great deal about what is \ngoing on. My colleague went far afield and made a defense of the Iraq \nresolution. Well, a good many of us in the Senate and in the Congress \nvoted for that resolution. Now we discover Mr. Kay suggests the \nintelligence got it all wrong, the basis for that resolution got it all \nwrong.\n  Mr. KYL. Will my colleague yield for one moment on that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. I really do appreciate that. I think what the Senator \nreferred to and what he read was that Mr. Kay said: We all got it \nwrong. But he did not say: We got it all wrong.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Go right ahead and read that again. That is the distinction \nI would make. We did get one thing wrong. We cannot find the weapons.\n  Mr. DORGAN. With due respect, and I have great affection for my \ncolleague from Arizona, he has it wrong. Let me read from the fourth \nparagraph of Mr. Kay's testimony given to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee: ``Let me begin by saying we were almost all wrong.''\n  Now, this is not about parsing words. It is Mr. Kay saying: Look, the \nintelligence was wrong.\n  I say to my colleague from Arizona, my point is not about the \nPresident, it is not about the Vice President, it is not about \nCondoleezza Rice or Secretary Powell or Mr. Tenet. It is about whether \nthis country is well served by the current intelligence community. Do \nthey have it right or not? If they got it wrong, as many suggest they \nhave, and it is pretty hard to make the case they got it right, then \nwhat do we do about it?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for two quick \nquestions?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield for one question and then \nanother.\n  Mr. BOND. Well, the most important question and I know this is a very \nimportant debate--the Senator from Maine was hoping to speak on the \nbill and I wondered how much longer the Senator from North Dakota was \ngoing to speak.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I do not have a gauge on the tank. In fact, I \nbarely came to the Senate expecting to speak for 5 minutes and then the \nSenator from Arizona piqued my interest and I decided I had to go find \nsome quotes and respond to his presentation. I know the Senator from \nMaine has been here awhile, and I will not be much longer.\n  Mr. BOND. If the Senator will yield for one additional question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BOND. Does the Senator realize all the rest of the Intelligence \nCommittee is in S-407 receiving a 300-page report compiled over 8 \nmonths by the entire staff of the Intelligence Committee, after over a \ncouple of hundred interviews and reviewing tens of thousands of \ndocuments, which goes right to this question and which we in the \ncommittee will be working on and trying to present either in classified \nor we hope mostly unclassified material so we can carry on this debate? \nIs the Senator aware that the reason there are not members of the \nIntelligence Committee here is that they are getting that information \nright now? Is the Senator aware of that?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am aware of that. I might say I have \nhigh hopes that that study, which has been underway for some long \nwhile, will be helpful to us. I must say also that there is a portion \nof the study that is a black hole. The study that is going on up there \nand will be released deals only with the gathering of intelligence, \nwhich I think shortchanges this Senate and the American people, because \nit does not deal with the use of that intelligence. But we can deal \nwith the issue of the use of intelligence at another time. I wish it \nhad been done in the same report.\n\n[[Page S640]]\n\n  Again, this issue of intelligence is critical to this country's \nprotection and security interests. I believe that is something on which \nwe would agree. We share that understanding, and my hope is that up in \n407--the Senator from Missouri refers to a room in the Capitol Building \nthat is a room where the Intelligence Committee meets. It is a room \nwhere top secret briefings are given. One of the things that persuaded \nme to come to the floor this afternoon is I have sat in that room. I \nhave sat in that room with a neon sign that says ``top secret'' up on \ntop flashing, and I have had the very people who developed this \nintelligence assessment look me in the eye and give me information that \nI now know to be wrong. That bothers me a lot.\n  I do not know how that happened. I do not know whether it was just \nbad collection of data, bad interpretation of data, or misuse of data. \nI do not have the foggiest idea, but I am saying this, that as one \nSenator I have been sitting in that room, I have asked direct \nquestions, and I have had people look me in the eye and give me an \nanswer that I now know to be wrong. I think most Senators who have had \nthat experience are concerned about it.\n  I say to the Senator from Missouri, because I do not know whether he \nheard me say it, I have great admiration for those who serve on the \nIntelligence Committee. I do not serve there. I do not profess to be an \nexpert in intelligence or foreign policy, but all of us have an \nobligation to be as informed as possible about all of these issues.\n  I expect the most aggressive Members of this Senate, following the \ntrail of where this leads, to be those who serve on the Intelligence \nCommittee. If Mr. Kay truly believes we got it all wrong, quote, \nunquote, then I would expect the Intelligence Committee to lead the way \nin finding out why that happened and how we get to a point where we \nnever have that assessment again when it comes to this country's vital \nnational interests.\n  Again, my colleague from Maine has been patient and I would not have \nspoken at this length except that I was intrigued and interested by my \ncolleague from Arizona.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will take less than 1 minute, because I do \nnot want to excite my friend any further, to say that all of us on the \nIntelligence Committee not only share the commitment to getting to the \nbottom of what went on, but we also know that David Kay said it was \nabsolutely right and prudent to go into Iraq because it was more \ndangerous than we knew in certain areas. I hope the report we issue \nwill answer questions that I and the other members of the Intelligence \nCommittee have raised and that all Members of this body ought to be \nraising, and that we will provide some recommendations for curing the \nproblems we find.\n  I hope now we can turn back to the SAFETEA bill, S. 1072, which is \nvery important. I appreciate the patience of the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as the Senate begins consideration of the \ntransportation legislation, let me first commend the distinguished \nmanagers of this bill, Senator Inhofe, Senator Bond, Senator Jeffords, \nand Senator Reid for their efforts to bring this vital 6-year \nreauthorization bill to the Senate floor. I particularly wish to \nrecognize the efforts of Senator Bond. He has been a tireless champion \nof improving the transportation infrastructure in this country. He has \nworked night and day to craft a well-balanced bill. I hope we can move \nforward in considering this bill without undue delay.\n  This legislation would be very beneficial for the people of Maine and \nfor our national economy. Nationwide, our transportation system is the \nlifeblood of economic development, the catalyst for the creation of \nthousands of jobs. Our transportation system affects our \ncompetitiveness, both within the United States and competing \ninternationally.\n\n  For our economy to prosper, we need an integrated modern \ntransportation system that realizes our goal of cost-effective and \nefficient modes of transportation while also recognizing the need for \ncontinued progress in improving the quality of our air. That is why I \nhave not only supported funding for our highways and our bridges, but \nalso I have advocated increased Federal funding for mass transit, for \npassenger rail initiatives, and alternative means of transportation as \nwell.\n  In a large rural State such as Maine, an effective transportation \nnetwork is absolutely essential. Maine has 1.3 million people spread \nout across roughly 34,000 square miles. Our State has by far the lowest \npopulation density in all of New England. Consequently, continuing to \nupgrade and improve our roads, highways, and bridges is essential to \nMaine's future prosperity. It is also a vital part of the economic \nstrategies in our State that are aimed at increasing job opportunities \nfor all of our citizens.\n  It is my hope that the Federal funding that is included in this \nlegislation will support a strong partnership with the States that will \nallow us to build, repair, and maintain our surface transportation \nsystem into the 21st century.\n  The bill would also allow us to pursue some high priority \ntransportation projects over the next 6 years. For example, as a native \nof Aroostook County in northern Maine, I understand how important it is \nto construct a north-south highway, a modern limited access highway \nthrough Aroostook County. This project has been in the works for more \nthan 20 years. The interstate, when it was first constructed, for some \nreason stopped at Houlton, ME, rather than going through Aroostook \nCounty to the Canadian border. For that reason there have been economic \ndevelopment projects underway for some time, calling on us to construct \na north-south highway to the Canadian border.\n  This project has been funded through the preconstruction stages and \nis currently undergoing the necessary review to complete the required \nenvironmental impact statement.\n  Northern Maine desperately needs the transportation and safety \nimprovements such a highway would bring. For this reason I have made it \nmy top transportation priority since being elected to the Senate in \n1996. I hope the higher funding levels authorized by this legislation \nwill enable the State of Maine to continue moving this vitally \nimportant project forward to the construction phase.\n  Just as I believe that the Aroostook highway project is critical for \nthe transportation system and the economy of northern Maine, I also \nbelieve that an east-west highway, potentially running from the \nmaritime provinces in Canada through eastern, central, and western \nMaine, to Quebec and northern New York State would significantly boost \neconomic growth, job creation, and development throughout the entire \nregion. This is an important transportation project, not only for that \nregion of Maine but also for our Canadian neighbors.\n  Maine, like many other States in the Northeast, is facing an aging \ntransportation infrastructure. It requires maintenance, rehabilitation, \nand in some cases outright replacement. The most urgent example of this \nproblem is the Waldo-Hancock Bridge, a major suspension bridge that \ncarries U.S. Route 1 over the Penobscot River, south of Bangor, and \nacts as a gateway to downeast Maine, one of the State's most widely \nvisited regions.\n\n  The nearest alternative for crossing the Penobscot River is some 20 \nmiles away in Bangor, and any interruption in the service would thus \nrequire a detour of at least 40 miles.\n  Unfortunately, due to safety concerns, last summer the State \nDepartment of Transportation had to lower the weight limits for \nvehicles using this bridge. The condition of the bridge has been \ndeclining steadily for a number of years, and despite efforts by the \nState to rehabilitate the existing structure, it has now become evident \nthat the bridge must be replaced as soon as possible.\n  While providing States with adequate funding to move forward with \nhigh priority projects such as the east-west highway, the Hancock-Waldo \nbridge, and the Aroostook highway, as well as the funding of other more \nroutine highway and transit projects as a major focus of this \nlegislation, I also see this bill as an opportunity to address some \nimportant transportation safety issues.\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\nThe most pressing transportation safety issue in my State has to do \nwith Federal truck weight limits.\n  Under current law, trucks weighing as much as 100,000 pounds are \nallowed to travel on Interstate 95 from the border of Maine with New \nHampshire, to Augusta, our capital city. At that point, right before \nAugusta, trucks weighing more than 80,000 pounds are forced off \nInterstate 95, which proceeds north to Houlton. Heavy trucks are forced \nonto smaller, secondary roads that pass through our cities, our towns, \nand our villages.\n  Augusta is an example of the problems this creates. When the trucks \nleave the interstate, they frequently travel down Western Avenue to \nencounter two heavily traveled traffic circles. These traffic circles \nhave some of the highest accident rates in our State, and having these \nlarge, heavy trucks travel through the congestion of Western Avenue, \naround these two traffic circles and then continue on secondary roads \nposes a serious safety threat.\n  A uniform truck weight of 100,000 pounds on all of Interstate 95 in \nMaine would reduce highway miles and travel times necessary to \neconomically and efficiently transport freight throughout Maine that \nwould result in both economic and environmental benefits.\n  Moreover, Maine's extensive network of State and local roads would be \nbetter preserved without the wear and tear of heavy truck traffic. But \nmost importantly, as I indicated with my example of the traffic circles \nin Augusta, ME, a uniform truck weight limit on the interstate would \nkeep trucks on the interstate, which is designed to handle heavy \ntrucks. That is where they belong rather than on the roads and highways \nthat pass through Maine's cities, towns, and neighborhoods.\n  Maine's citizens and motorists are needlessly at risk because too \nmany heavy trucks are diverted from the interstate and onto local \nroads.\n  Senator Snowe and I have an initiative to deal with this issue. We \nhope to work closely with the managers of the bill to address this very \nimportant traffic safety issue.\n  With 3,400 miles of coastline and 14 inhabited islands, there is \nanother very important feature of transportation that affects my \nconstituents. The Federal Highway Administration's Ferry Boat \nDiscretionary Program is vitally important to the Maine State Ferry \nService and the Casco Bay Island's Transit District, which provide \ncritical transportation services to Maine's island communities. I have \njoined with my colleague, Senator Murray, and a bipartisan group of \nSenators in sponsoring the Ferry Transportation Enhancement Act, which \nwould significantly increase funding that is available for ferry \nprojects. We hope to pursue this proposal as the debate on this \nimportant legislation continues.\n  While this highway reauthorization legislation includes funding for \ntraditional transportation programs, I am also pleased that it includes \nincreased funding for both transportation enhancements and the \nRecreational Trails Program. Both have allowed States to greatly expand \ntheir bicycle path systems.\n  In Maine, for example, 94 bicycle paths and pedestrian walkways have \nbeen built with funding from these special programs.\n  I also believe that it is in our national interest to pursue and \nstrengthen passenger rail services in the United States and to help \nmaintain the solvency of Amtrak, even as we put reforms in place. \nCurrently, there is no long-term stable funding source for passenger \nrail in the United States. Since 1971, when Amtrak was created, $25 \nbillion has been spent on passenger rail. This contrasts sharply with \nthe $750 billion that has been invested in our highways and aviation.\n  As the Senate moves forward in considering a wide range of \ntransportation issues and funding questions in this vital bill, I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues to make sure we pursue the \ngoal of ensuring that our roads, our highways, and bridges are able to \nmeet the needs of our citizens and commerce as we move forward in the \n21st century.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise in support of the transit amendment \nto the highway funding bill.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee, I commend Chairman Shelby, \nSenator Sarbanes, and their staffs for their hard work and their \nwillingness to reach consensus on this important measure.\n  I also commend members of the Finance Committee for also discharging \ntheir duty to fully finance the transit spending authorized in the \nbudget. Our Democratic leader, who also sits as a member of that \ncommittee, was particularly helpful in that regard.\n  The legislation passed yesterday by the Banking Committee was no easy \nachievement. The members of the Banking Committee have different \ntransit needs for their States. There are some Senators on the Banking \nCommittee from mostly rural States, others from States with largely \nurban centers, and others whose States have a combination of both.\n  The transit title, which was unanimously approved yesterday in the \nBanking Committee, goes a long way toward balancing these needs. \nAlthough this legislation is not perfect, it does come close to \nachieving a national transit policy, which is a goal I believe was not \nachieved in the highway funding portion of the bill.\n  The transit bill has a number of important provisions:\n  It provides $56.5 billion for mass transit over the next six years. \nThis amount is a significant investment for the future. I am hopeful \nthat more progress can be made to increase assistance for those regions \nthat rely heavily on mass transit but whose aging infrastructure needs \nrepair and modernization.\n  If anybody were to deny that a problem exists in this regard, I would \nurge them to read an article which appeared in yesterday's Stamford \nAdvocate entitled ``Metro-North Struggles To Keep Cars in Service.'' It \ndescribes how a combination of cold weather and aging railcars has \nknocked one-third of the aging New Haven Line out of service for \nseveral weeks.\n  In fact, about 37 percent of the New Haven Line is out of service for \nmaintenance. The Metro-North Line has lost 230 out of its 800-car fleet \nfor repairs. Thousands of commuters in Connecticut rely on this service \nto get to and from work, travel to and from school, and to see their \nfamilies.\n  The legislation devotes significant resources to the Job Access as \nwell as the Elderly and Disabled transit programs, which have been \nsuccessful in providing transportation services to many of the most \nvulnerable members of society. Such transportation services enable low-\nincome individuals, as well as senior citizens and the disabled, to \nhave access to jobs, education, and training, which ultimately fosters \nself-sufficiency and improves their quality of life.\n  The transit title also includes funds to small communities with \nsignificant transit infrastructure that currently do not qualify under \nexisting formula programs. Many cities in Connecticut and throughout \nthe region could benefit from this program.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the transit amendment includes language I \nauthorized to promote the establishment of medical access programs. \nMany Americans lack transportation services to take them to the \nhospital to see a doctor, get medication, or undergo dialysis.\n  Often their only choice is to call an ambulance, even if it is not \ntruly a medical emergency, because such services are reimbursed under \nMedicare. By encouraging community transit systems to establish medical \naccess programs, we can reduce costs to Medicare while serving as a \nlifeline to those Americans in need of health care.\n  I am hopeful that more progress can be made to increase our \ninvestments in mass transit. I am grateful to Chairman Shelby and \nSenator Sarbanes for listening to other Senator's concerns throughout \nthis process, and I look forward to working with them as this \nlegislation moves forward.\n  I as unanimous consent to print the article to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Stamford Advocate, Feb. 4, 2004.]\n\n             Metro-North Struggles To Keep Cars in Service\n\n                        (By Katherine Didriksen)\n\n       Metro-North Railroad is bracing for another bout of wintry \n     weather today while it\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\n     struggles to fix widespread equipment problems caused by \n     recent bitter cold and drifting snow.\n       The railroad has been unable to run a regular schedule \n     during peak morning and evening hours for several weeks as \n     more than one-third of its aging New Haven Line fleet has \n     been knocked out of service.\n       ``(The railcars) are just dying faster than we can fix \n     them,'' Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said. ``It's \n     cumulative.''\n       Heavy electrical components, including traction motors and \n     motor alternators, are particularly hard-hit by extreme cold \n     and dusty snow, she said.\n       Trains have had decent on-time performance despite the car \n     shortages, but customers will face standing-room-only \n     conditions all week, Anders said.\n       Metro-North has lost 230 railcars out of its 800-car fleet \n     to repairs. The railroad reached a high of 217 disabled \n     railcars on Jan. 21. On the New Haven Line, 126 of 342 \n     railcars, or about 37 percent, are out of service for \n     maintenance.\n       On an average day, 50 to 60 cars are out of service for \n     maintenance, Federal Railroad Administration-mandated \n     inspections or major repairs, said Harry Harris, chief of the \n     Connecticut Department of Transportation's bureau of public \n     transportation.\n       ``You never run 100 percent of your fleet. You can expect \n     to have about 18 percent out for one reason or another,'' he \n     said. ``When you start reaching 80, 90, 100 cars, you are \n     cutting in substantially to the fleet.''\n       Today's forecasted wintry mix offers the railroad little \n     time for repairs and presents other challenges. Cold and \n     freezing rain causes problems with equipment on the ground, \n     including track switches, Anders said.\n       Trains on the New Haven Line will continue to run under a \n     speed restriction overnight to reduce stress on the overhead \n     catenary wires that become brittle and taut in the cold, she \n     said.\n       ``It's getting pretty bleak,'' said Jim Cameron, vice \n     chairman of the Metro-North-Shoreline East Rail Commuter \n     Council. ``They absolutely are desperate for capacity now.''\n       Commuters are getting increasingly angry and upset, he \n     said.\n       ``My frustration is that they still don't understand the \n     enormity of the situation or who's at fault,'' Cameron said. \n     ``Commuters don't like being kept in the dark, and they don't \n     like being lied to.''\n       The lack of communication lies on Hartford's shoulders, \n     rather than on the railroad or the state DOT, he said.\n       Extreme weather is exacerbated by the state's aging \n     equipment. The bulk of the New Haven Line fleet was \n     commissioned in 1973--an average train lifespan is about 20 \n     years--and the catenary wire system was built in the early \n     1900s.\n       ``It's a real challenge to keep all this equipment going,'' \n     Harris said. Repairs are complicated by a lack of maintenance \n     space and replacement parts, he said.\n       Connecticut also hosts the only commuter railroad service \n     that runs a dual-powered system of third-rail and overhead \n     catenary wires, Harris said. A new car that fits the dual-\n     powered system has a price tag of $4.5 million, he said.\n       ``There is no quick solution, barring some kind of an \n     economic miracle,'' Harris said. Commuters are not likely to \n     see funds for new railcars until 2006, he said.\n       In the meantime, Metro-North and the state DOT are merely \n     looking to survive the winter.\n       ``The worst-case scenario is no service,'' Anders said. \n     ``We're not even close to that.''\n       The railroad alerted passengers to the following timetable \n     alterations through Monday: In the morning rush hour, the \n     6:42 a.m. train from New Haven, due in Stamford at 7:30 a.m. \n     and arriving at Grand Central at 8:18 a.m.; and the 7:37 a.m. \n     train out of Port Chester, N.Y., due in Grand Central at 8:20 \n     a.m., are canceled.\n       During the evening rush hour, many trains departing Grand \n     Central will be combined or canceled:\n       The 4:11 p.m. train from Grand Central to South Norwalk and \n     the 4:16 p.m. train to New Haven are combined, departing at \n     4:16 p.m.\n       The 4:49 p.m. train from Grand Central to New Haven will \n     terminate at Stamford. Customers for stations east of \n     Stamford must take the 5:01 p.m. train.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say a \nfew words about the highway bill. This legislation is of immense \nimportance not only to my State of Alaska, but to the Nation as a \nwhole. It is unlikely that this Congress will do anything of greater \nimportance for our economy.\n  We all know that if our economy is our strength, transportation is \nour circulatory system. Without it, we cannot function. And make no \nmistake, we are not keeping up with the task.\n  Thirty-two percent of our major roads are in poor condition. Twenty-\nnine percent of our bridges need replacement or repair. Urban rail and \nbus systems are in equally poor shape.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, we should be spending \nover $100 billion per year on highways and over $20 billion per year on \ntransit. But we cannot do that. We are constrained by reality. The \ncomponents of the Senate bill will approximate only half that amount.\n  That is deeply disappointing to the Nation's 12,500 road construction \ncontractors, and it is deeply disappointing to all our States and to \ntheir municipal governments, and to all our constituents.\n  We do not live in a perfect world. And given that reality, our job is \nto pass the best bill we can possibly pass.\n  It was no easy task to develop the bill before us today. We owe a \ntremendous debt of gratitude to the leaders of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee for their efforts, and to the leaders of the \nother committees necessary to make this bill a reality. No one could \nhave worked harder and longer than Senator Inhofe, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Bond and Senator Reid.\n  Is this a perfect bill? No, indeed. There are many things I would \nlike to see changed. For example, I strongly agree with the comments \nmade by Senator Voinovich about the need for additional streamlining so \nthat projects can get off the ground faster.\n  For my own State, I would like to see greater flexibility in a number \nof areas. I would also like to see greater recognition given to the \nfact that my State is far behind all the others in road miles, and that \nlack is holding back not only our economy but limiting our ability to \ncontribute to the Nation as a whole. This bill does not address that \nfact to satisfaction.\n  By the same token, I understand that many of the donor States want to \nsee more of their highway fuel tax dollars returned to them, and \nreturned faster. I cannot blame them. At the same time, I want to \nremind my colleagues of this very important fact: This bill is not \nabout my roads or your roads. This bill is about our roads.\n  We are all in this together. Let's not forget that fact.\n  The bill before us will increase every State's minimum guarantee to \nthe 95 percent level they have long sought. And it will ensure that \nevery State will see a significant increase in real dollars, an average \nincrease of over 35 percent.\n  We cannot afford not to move forward.\n  In the last decade, travel on the Nation's highways increased almost \n30 percent. By 2020, projections indicate travel will increase by \nanother 50 percent. Those number don't just indicate a need; they \ndemand a response. They demand that we move forward on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 1072 is the pending business.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2269 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I think I have an amendment pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2269 is pending.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I understand that if I ask that the \namendments be set aside so I can send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration, there is an objection to that; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has not yet been an objection.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I did not hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not yet an objection.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, it is my understanding that \nthere will be an objection.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that we have an \nobjection to further amendments so that we can't set aside some of \nthose that have been here and we are not making the kind of progress I \nthink we should be making on this bill and that some in this body will \nnot allow us to make progress and consider a germane amendment that has \nbroad support. What I am going to do is file the amendment and \nhopefully get to it in due course.\n  Two days ago, I came to the floor to express my support for this \nbill. I praised the managers for their work in putting this compromise \ntogether. I said that the bipartisan spirit of this bill led me to \nbelieve we could actually get something accomplished, which is contrary \nto the predictions of many people for this session of Congress. I even \nborrowed from one of my models when I was Governor: Together we can do \nit. And together we can. We can get this bill passed if we have enough \nfolks who are willing to compromise and understand there is an enormous \nneed to deal with the infrastructure problems and challenges of our \ncountry and also understand the need for the jobs this bill will create \nin our respective States.\n  Today and yesterday we have seen, however, that some do not want to \nwork in a bipartisan manner and pass this bill which will put hard-\nworking Americans back to work and jump-start our sluggish economy, \nparticularly in States such as Ohio. This is the case even though 75 \nMembers voted to invoke cloture and proceed to the bill. Sadly, until \nthis logjam is broken, we can't even make progress on issues of broad \nagreement.\n  Regardless of these difficulties, I am pleased to announce that this \namendment represents an agreement reached by the transportation \ncommunity and the historic preservation community. I greatly appreciate \nthe work of the many groups that worked on this amendment, including \nthe National Trust for Historic Preservation, Preservation Action, the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. I \ncommend the Ohio Department of Transportation, especially Gordon \nProctor, Tim Hill, and Michelle Holdgreve, for their tireless effort. \nThey have worked very hard with us on this amendment. The hard work by \nall these interested groups have led to this carefully crafted \ncompromise amendment that I believe will go a long way in expediting \nthe time and decreasing the cost of transportation construction \nprojects.\n\n  This amendment addresses section 4(f). Section 4(f) of the Department \nof Transportation Act of 1966 prohibits the Department of \nTransportation from approving any highway project that uses publicly \nowned land or a historic site of national, State, or local \nsignificance, unless, one, there is no prudent and feasible alternative \nthat avoids such resources or causes less harm to them, and, two, the \nproject includes all possible planning to minimize harm to those \nresources.\n  If publicly owned land or a historic site is chosen for use in the \nproject, an evaluation must demonstrate that the use of other \nalternatives would have resulted in unique problems. ``Unique \nproblems'' are present when there are truly unusual factors, or when \nthe costs to the community's disruption reach ``extraordinary \nmagnitude.'' This test was introduced in Citizens to Preserve Overton \nPark v. Volpe, referred to as the ``Overton Park criteria.''\n  Section 4(f) was developed in the late 1960s to address a real \nproblem. Construction of the Interstate Highway System was at its peak, \nand these projects took the path of least resistance, which, in many \ncases, was parkland because it was easy to acquire and cheap to build \nthrough.\n  The passage of section 4(f) was intended to protect parks and \nhistoric sites that could be adversely impacted by construction of the \nInterstate System. We all understand that. That makes sense.\n  Today, however, highway projects are more likely to involve \nmaintenance and modernization of the current system. The problem is \nthat section 4(f), which basically prohibits all use of protected \nresources, is difficult to apply to projects that would have some, but \nnot significant, impact on a protected resource. Yet this law has never \nbeen amended since its creation almost 40 years ago. We need to address \nour attention to that.\n  When highway projects have resulted in litigation, section 4(f) has \nbeen a frequent cause. Moreover, inconsistent interpretation of the \nOverton criteria has been identified as one need for changes in section \n4(f) to allow for a more balanced interpretation of its requirements. \nOne of the reasons for this litigation is the subjective terms used in \nthe law: ``prudent and feasible,'' ``all possible planning to minimize \nharm,'' ``unique problems,'' and ``extraordinary magnitude.''\n  I will tell you, these provisions are a lawyer's dream and a \nnightmare for the courts that have to interpret it and the States and \nU.S. Department of Transportation, which has to enforce the law. The \nresult has been needless confusion, significant delays, and high cost \nfor issues that defy common sense. What we are talking about here is \ncommon sense.\n  In my State of Ohio, for example, a privately owned barn was \nconsidered eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. It \nwas in the path of a needed road improvement. Let me clarify that the \nbarn was eligible because it was more than 50 years old. Soon, we won't \nbe able to do any improvements because sidewalks will be 50 years old \nin this country. After considerable delay, needless studies, and \nsignificantly increased costs, a decision was made to avoid the barn. \nThe road improvement was rerouted and the barn protected. This is the \nbarn in this photo that we were protecting because it was over 50 years \nold. Look at that.\n\n  The cost to reroute this was $100,000 and 4 months of delay. Anybody \nwho knows about highway projects knows that for every day of delay, it \ncosts money. Time is money. However, the barn fell down due to owner \nneglect a few years later.\n  The point is that, while transportation planners have to do all they \ncan to protect something that is ``eligible'' for the register, the \nprivate owner of the place, or even another Federal agency, can destroy \nit without sanction. That just doesn't make any sense.\n  Section 4(f) was enacted in 1966, 37 years ago. It only applies to \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation, not any other Federal agencies. \nIt is an extremely stringent law that has been interpreted by the \ncourts, as they say, in vastly different ways.\n  While it was created with good intentions and at a time when the law \nwas arguably needed, U.S. DOT and State departments of transportation \nhave become good stewards of the environment.\n  One of the things that happens in Washington is we give no credit at \nall to State organizations or local organizations, in terms of their \nconcern about the environment. So often, we think we are the only ones \nwho really care about the environment.\n  Section 4(f) requirements have been identified by State departments \nof transportation as a significant deterrent to timely environmental \nreviews of transportation projects. The requirements to avoid section \n4(f) resources applies in all cases, even when the impact is minor, \nresulting in situations in which a minor historic property is protected \nat the expense of other more sensitive environmental resources or \ncommunities.\n  In April of 2003, the General Accounting Office reported the \ntransportation stakeholders consider section 4(f) reviews as burdensome \nand inflexible and that alternative approaches could protect historic \nproperties and take less time to reach resolution.\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\n  In that report, a large majority of the stakeholders indicated that \nhistoric property protections under section 106 of the National \nHistoric Preservation Act of 1966 offered a more flexible mediation \nprocess. This law requires that Federal agencies consider the effect of \nproperties either in or eligible to be in the National Register of \nHistoric Places. It brings all parties into the discussion and allows \nfor better outcomes that preserve the goals of the transportation \nproject, while protecting historic properties. This concept is included \nin this compromise amendment.\n  We are using something with which people are familiar. It worked in \nother places and it can work in terms of highway construction.\n  Currently, section 4(f) does not provide exceptions for impacts with \nno adverse affect or even a beneficial effect. For example, in Ohio, a \nnew highway project adjacent to a publicly owned golf course was being \nconstructed, and the golf course asked if work could be performed to \nalleviate persistent flooding. However, the work would have required a \nsection 4(f) study. As a result, the work wasn't performed and the golf \ncourse still floods to this day just because of this 4(f).\n\n  In more extreme cases, projects with very minor impacts on protected \nsites have had to be realigned at high social, environmental, and \neconomic costs. The peculiarities of the law led to well-documented, \nunintended consequences.\n  The confusion over existing law and problems with delays has led to \nseveral attempts at remedies. AASHTO, the organization that represents \nall 50 State transportation departments, voted unanimously to reform \nsection 4(f).\n  Section 4(f) is also one of the highest priorities of our own U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, which proposed changes to section 4(f) in \nits surface transportation reauthorization proposal, SAFETEA, which is \nwhat we worked off when this bill was being put together.\n  This amendment remedies many of the problems with section 4(f). While \nmany groups would have preferred greater reform, the final text is a \ncompromise that satisfies major stakeholders in this debate. Again, \nthis was a compromise between a lot of groups, including \ntransportation, environmental, and historic preservation groups.\n  Specifically, the amendment states that section 4(f) requirements are \nsatisfied if the Secretary makes a finding of de minimis impact to a \nprotected site. For historic sites, such a finding occurs if the \nproject has no adverse effect on a historic site and there is written \nconcurrence from the State or tribal historic preservation officer.\n  So we go through this process, and it is looked at as de minimis and \nhas to be signed off by the people who care.\n  For parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, such \na finding only occurs if the project will not adversely affect the \nactivities, features, or attributes of the resource, and there is \nwritten concurrence from the officials with jurisdiction over the \nresource. The amendment also requires public notice--the public knows \nall about this; there is nothing under the table--and public comment on \nthe process. So we vet this decision so everybody knows what is going \non.\n  What is good about this amendment is it allows for better community \noutcomes. This amendment would require the Secretary, when making a \nfinding of de minimis impact, to consider all ``avoidance, \nminimization, mitigation, and enhancement measures'' that have been \nincorporated into the project. The language serves an important \nfunction: It builds in an incentive for projects' sponsors to \nincorporate environmentally protective measures into a project from the \nbeginning, in order to support a finding of de minimis \nimpact. Otherwise, the resource would be avoided and the project would \nmove forward without providing any of the associated benefits to the \ncommunity.\n\n  In addition, the amendment requires the Secretary to promulgate new \nregulations to determine standards to define whether avoiding a \nprotected resource is prudent and feasible.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to achieve greater clarity and \nconsistency with regard to the application of the Overton Park standard \nin a variety of circumstances. Let me provide some examples of problems \nwith the section 4(f). I have already done one. Let's look at others.\n  In Pennsylvania, the State department of transportation had to make a \nhighway improvement. This project required that one of two farms near \neach other be sacrificed. One of them was an inactive farm eligible for \nthe registry that was barely maintained and its owner lived out of \nState. The second was a working farm owned by a man and his two sons \nwho were actively working the land.\n  The owner of the second farm intended to pass the land down to the \nfamily to continue the farming operation. Section 4(f) forced the State \ndepartment of transportation to demolish the nonhistoric farm, even \nthough it was actively being farmed and planned to be part of the \nfamily's livelihood for years to come. In the end, the historic farm \nwas bought and developed.\n  This is ridiculous. Section 4(f) led to the destruction of both \nfarms. It forced the officials to go against a hard-working family for \na rundown farm that happened to be 50 years old. And then this law \ncouldn't even protect it from being developed.\n  This amendment would at least have allowed the State preservation \nofficer to make a balanced decision considering all of the information \nand alternatives.\n  Another good example comes from our neighboring State of Kentucky. A \nfarmhouse and a farm was deemed historic. As a result of the project \ndevelopment process, the best alignment for a four-lane highway was \nfound to be through the property and would separate the historic house \nfrom the rest of the farmstead. However, through coordination with \nhistoric preservation groups, the highway was realigned so that it \nwould cross in front of the house, impacting only a small strip of land \nat the front edge of the property.\n  Everyone involved thought it was great. Then came section 4(f). \nSection 4(f) required total avoidance of this historic farmhouse. The \nresult was less desirable, more costly, and required the acquisition \nand removal of a home that was not historic.\n  In the end, the family whose home was to be relocated bought the \nhistoric house from the contractor, tore down the old house, and \nrelocated their modern house where the historic house had stood.\n  Let's think about this. This is a picture of the historic house. What \nhappened was, they wanted to take a little piece of this property, but \noh, no, under section 4(f), you can't do that. Oh, no. So they went \nacross the street to a house more modern and said: We are going to take \nyour property. These people had to relocate their house. They relocated \ntheir house. Do you know where they relocated it? They tore the old \nhouse down and relocated the modern house to where the old house was \nlocated.\n  That is the kind of result we get from section 4(f). It \nis understandable that this needs to be changed.\n\n  This is a compromise amendment that has broad support and will \ncorrect a problem that has plagued State and local officials for nearly \n40 years. It is time for this inflexible and outdated law to be fixed.\n  I congratulate all involved on this work. Again, historic \npreservation groups came together and said: This is crazy; let's see if \nwe can work something out. And they did it.\n  I think it is unfortunate this amendment will not be considered \ntoday. As I said, it has broad support.\n  I wish to say one other thing about the highway bill. There is no \nquestion that there is an overwhelming need for this legislation. In \nfact, if you look at the needs that have been projected by the \nDepartment of Transportation, the amount of money we are spending \ndoesn't meet the need, but it is a reasonable compromise to start to \naddress forthrightly some of the problems I have in Ohio, you may have \nin Texas, Mr. President, or the chief sponsor may have in Oklahoma, and \naround this country.\n  It also provides needed jobs for people in our respective States. To \nmy knowledge, this is going to be the only jobs bill to come out of \nthis Congress at this time. Those jobs are needed.\n  I was talking with some of my colleagues the other day and they said: \nIt is not needed and there are no projects out there ready to go. I \nwould like to say that in my State we have $164 million of work that, \nif the money were\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nthere, could start tomorrow. It could start tomorrow.\n  The economy in my State is not doing too well. We are getting killed \nbecause of manufacturing. We need this bill. There was a great \nconservative President of the United States named Ronald Reagan. He is \non the altar and worshipped by conservatives all across America. He was \na real conservative, a real fiscal conservative. In 1983, unemployment \nwas up. I remember because I was mayor of the city of Cleveland. People \nneeded work. Ronald Reagan, in his wisdom, saw a need out in the \ncountry. He went to Congress and asked for the emergency jobs bill. \nThat bill extended unemployment benefits. That bill provided moneys to \ncities and counties.\n  When I was mayor, we were really hurting. It provided us $12 million \nfor public works so I could put people to work. It provided $6 million \nto Cuyahoga County. That was Ronald Reagan, a fiscal conservative, a \nman of compassion. He reached out, saw these people on the unemployment \nline, saw that jobs were needed. He also understood that we had some \nreal infrastructure needs in this country, and on April 1 of 1983, \nRonald Reagan said: I don't want to borrow the money; I don't want to \nborrow the money to provide more money for highways, and suggested and \ngot the Congress to agree to increase the gas tax by 5 cents.\n  It seems to me that some of my colleagues--and I consider myself a \nconservative--ought to look at the reality of all of this. I suggest to \nour administration, our President, who is compassionate, and his \nadvisers, that they ought to also look at the needs we have.\n  I went along with a grant to Iraq because I wanted to rebuild their \ninfrastructure, and we are borrowing that money. We are borrowing a lot \nof money for a lot of purposes. I think Senator Grassley and the \nFinance Committee have tried to come up with some reasonable ways of \npaying for this bill and some offsets. Some people may nitpick it, but \nthe fact is, they did genuinely try to do something about it.\n  Everyone who is concerned about it ought to look at this \nrealistically. This is a very modest, responsible proposal that deals \nwith great infrastructure needs in this country.\n  I come from a just-in-time State, and our roads and bridges are in \nbad shape. I come from a State where we have thousands of people who \nlose their lives because our roads are not what we want them to be--\nroute 24, particularly. So we have these needs. This is not porkbarrel. \nWe have real needs.\n  On top of that, the frosting on the cake is we need the jobs. I am \nhoping that the Holy Spirit will enlighten our President and his \nadvisers and Members on my side of the aisle and on the other side of \nthe aisle to do something good for America and get on with this bill, \nget it passed, and get the money on the street so we can put some \npeople to work and get on with our infrastructure needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have some remarks in conjunction with \nthe statement of Senator Voinovich. I will yield to the Senator from \nFlorida as soon as I make a couple of comments.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amendment offered by \nmy colleague from Ohio, Senate Voinovich. First, I thank him for \nworking so hard on this very important issue. I know this issue has \nbeen controversial, and I appreciate his dedication to working out a \ncompromise. Senate Voinovich's amendment adds much-needed reforms to a \nprovision in current law commonly referred to as section 4(f) review.\n  Section 4(f) was approved by Congress as part of the Department of \nTransportation Act of 1966 to protect public parks, recreation areas, \nwildlife and waterfowl refuges, and public and private historic sites.\n  It is important to protect our historic treasures and environmental \nand recreational resources. Our Government has invested money in \nestablishing and maintaining these resources for the public's use. We \nshould not allow another department to turn around and diminish those \ninvestments without good reason.\n  Unfortunately, court decisions have led to an interpretation of \n``avoid at all costs.'' In addition to adding significant time delays \ncaused by extensive study of alternatives, this interpretation has led \nto some really bad public policy decisions--decisions that defy common \nsense.\n  For instance, does it make sense to spend a hundred thousand dollars \nto shift an alignment in order to avoid an old, abandoned, dilapidated \nbarn? I don't think so, but it has happened. Should private citizens \nlose parts of their front yards to road expansion so that we can save \nthe supposed parkland between the current road and the ditch that runs \nalongside it? I don't think so, but it has happened.\n  Those are just a couple of examples of where section 4(f) is \nobviously broken and desperately needs to be fixed. I am pleased that \nSenator Voinovich has brought us such a fix.\n  The State of Oklahoma DOT is pleased with this language. Our folks \nwho actually deal with this issue on a regular basis believe this will \nhelp them make better decisions with less delay.\n  I think this amendment represents good policy all the way around--\ntransportation officials will be able to make commonsense decisions, \nparticularly when it comes to projects that will have minimal impacts, \nand we can all be assured that these important environmental and \ncultural resources are protected.\n  It is my understanding that this language was developed by a wide \nrange of stakeholders, including Ohio DOT, AASHTO, the National Trust \nfor Historic Preservation, Defenders of Wildlife, Environmental Defense \nand the Natural Resources Defense Council. I commend Senator Voinovich \nfor bringing forward this section 4(f) amendment, and I am happy to add \nmy support to it. I regret that we cannot consider his amendment today, \nbut I assure the Senator that I will work to have his amendment \nadopted.\n  Mr. President, what my friend from Ohio is saying is what we have \nbeen saying since Monday morning.\n  The Senator is exactly right. I do not know how many times I have \nstood on this floor and said those of us who are conservatives \nhistorically have to stop and look at what is Government here for. \nConservatives are generally big spenders when it comes to defense, when \nit comes to infrastructure. We need to defend America and we need \ninfrastructure. Right now, I am sure there are some States that are not \nas sensitive as the Senator from Ohio and I are because they do not \nhave the problems, but when we look at what this bill is doing to try \nto correct the problem of, just as an example, our deteriorating \nbridges, my State of Oklahoma ranks dead first in terms of the \ndeteriorated condition of bridges, and I chair the committee.\n  We are going to have to get a bill through. There has been some \nrecent suggestion that it be pared down a little bit. I can assure my \ncolleagues the figure we are talking about right now is a figure that \nis not acceptable to those on the other side of the Capitol, and this \nis the only way we can get one.\n  I thought we were making some headway. We have all of these little \nprocedural hurdles. We are not able to send the amendment of the \nSenator to the desk, but I will tell the Senator right now I am going \nto do what I can about it.\n  First, I do agree with the Senator's amendment and I know how hard he \nhas been working on it. A lot of people do not realize this section was \napproved by the Congress as part of the Department of Transportation \nAct of 1966. It is obvious it is not working now and we need to do \nsomething about it. Certainly the Senator is as enthusiastic about \nprotecting any of our historical sites as we are, but we need to have \nsomething that is workable.\n  I know there is someone else who wants to speak, but let me give the \nSenator my assurance, as chairman of the committee, I will do \neverything I can to make sure he gets his amendment in, which I \nsupport. More important than his amendment, we want to get this bill \npassed so we can get America back to work again.\n  Remember, not long ago one of the publications in the Capitol had a \n``men working'' sign on it, and they put a ``not'' right in the middle: \nMen not working. That is exactly what is happening right now. If we \nplay around\n\n[[Page S646]]\n\nwith the reductions, with the temporary extensions and all of that, we \nare not going to be able to get people back to work.\n  We have the infrastructure needs. We have the needs for jobs, and I \nwill be there beside the Senator from Ohio doing what I can to make \nthat a reality.\n  Before I yield the floor, let me ask my good friend with whom I was \nprivileged to share this morning's chairmanship at the National Prayer \nBreakfast--one of the truly great moments of my life with my good \nfriend. We are trying to stay on the highway bill. We have others who \nare going to be coming down. Could I inquire as to how much time the \nSenator from Florida would like to have?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Probably no more than 8 or 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that he be given 15 minutes and \nthen after I be recognized as having the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from \nOklahoma. It has been a pleasure working with him as the cochairman of \nour Senate prayer breakfast, and now having the opportunity this \nmorning with 4,000 people assembled at the Washington Hilton to cochair \nthe National Prayer Breakfast with him--which really is a misnomer \nbecause it is an international prayer breakfast. We had people from 150 \nnations. We had five heads of state there. Of course, we had dual \nspeakers this morning in the persons of former Congressman J.C. Watts \nand Congressman John Lewis. They were both riveting. I appreciate his \ncollegiality and considerable cooperation as we entered into this \ndelightful once-a-year event that occurs in Washington.\n  I say to the Senator from Ohio, though, before he walks out the door, \nthat as he was talking about the transportation bill providing jobs, we \nhave a saying in the south: ``Amen, brother.'' We need the jobs in \nFlorida, too. Indeed, they are needed all over the country and that is \nwhy I will support this bill, and that is why I did.\n  I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member of the committee \nin how they have fashioned this bill. There are parts of this bill I \nwould like to see improved. For years, my State of Florida has given a \ndollar in in tax and only gotten back about 80 cents. Over the years, \nmy senior colleague, Senator Graham of Florida, has been working on \nthat. Since I have been in the Senate the last 4 years, I have been \nworking with him to improve that. We have got that ratio up to 90.5 \npercent that we get back for every dollar we send.\n  In the bill the chairman and the ranking member have crafted, over \nthe 6-year period that will rise to 95 percent. Floridians will be very \ngrateful for that. I wish it could rise 1 percent a year over those 6 \nyears instead of the way it is crafted, which is that it stays at a \n90.5 percent return on Florida's tax dollar and then it jumps in the \nsixth year to 95 percent return on the dollar, but that was part of the \ngive and take.\n  I would certainly like to improve it, but I am grateful for it, \nbecause finally this battle Florida has had for ages in getting a \nreturn on its tax dollar, particularly a gas tax dollar it sends to the \nFederal Government, is going to get some equalization, particularly \nwith other States that have in the past gotten in excess of a dollar's \nworth when they send in a dollar to the Federal gas tax trust fund. I \nhave lots of good things to say about it, but, oh, does it make it \ntough in this environment in which we are, a highly charged partisan \nenvironment in an election year in which the deficit that was just \nannounced 3 days ago is over a half a trillion dollars.\n  Now, deficit is a fancy word, but let me say to my colleagues simply \nwhat I think it means. It means if we are spending this much in this \ncoming fiscal year, but we only have this much coming in in tax \nrevenues, the difference, since we are spending more than we have \ncoming in in revenue, is the deficit. That has been estimated, in the \nPresident's budget, at $525 billion. That is over a half trillion \ndollars.\n  Well, what does one do? Where does it come from? If spending is going \nto be here, but the tax revenues are only here in a given year, what is \nto be done? The difference is borrowed, and that difference then, when \nborrowed, is added to the national debt.\n  We can see if we are borrowing to the extent of over half a trillion \ndollars a year, it does not take too long to see the national debt just \ncontinue to go out of sight, and then on that debt we have to pay \ninterest. When the interest rates go up after this year, then that is \nanother big slug out of the Federal budget we will have to pay, \ninterest on the national debt.\n  Goodness gracious. And think what we could be doing with money: $200 \nbillion a year in interest. Think what that would buy in the programs \nthat are being cut under this President's budget. These are programs \nsuch as law enforcement assistance from the Federal Government such as \nthe COPS program, putting police on the beat, on the street. That is \nbeing cut. Education expenditures are being cut. Children's health \nprograms are being cut. Environmental programs are being cut. I could \ngo on.\n  Yet that creates the environment, the fiscal reality, that in times \nof huge budget deficits, if you are going to get that figure from here \nto match your revenues, you either have to cut spending or raise taxes \nor, in the alternative, stop tax cuts that are projected to go into \neffect in the future and don't let them go into effect, or both, in \norder to get your Federal budget into balance.\n  We had a chance 3 years ago. We were in a surplus situation with so \nmuch surplus projected over 10 years. We could have paid off the \nnational debt if we had been wise and conservative in our approach. But \nwe didn't. We went and blew it. We were like drunken sailors, spending \nand enacting tax cuts that were targeted to the more well off among us. \nThe result is what the President's budget just said. In the budget that \nwas just released, the deficit spending this next fiscal year is going \nto be over half a trillion dollars.\n  This is not conservative fiscal policy. This is wild and reckless \npolicy. When you give a continued tax cut to the rich to be financed by \nout and out borrowing, that is not conservative fiscal policy. That is \nout of control fiscal policy.\n  By the way, guess where we borrow that money. We borrow it from \nSocial Security recipients, because we are taking it out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund. Guess where else we borrow it. We borrow it from \nother countries and their companies and their investors. You think it \nis just you and I who buy U.S. Treasury bills? Some of us do. And we \nborrow it from us. But you would be shocked to know how much of the \nNation's debt and the new borrowing that will occur is being bought up \nby corporations and governments in China and Japan. If they end up \nhaving a good bit of our debt that is owed to them, what does that do \ntoward putting us in a vulnerable position in the future with regard to \nour foreign policy with those countries, China and Japan? If they own a \nlot of our debt or, put another way, if we owe them a lot of money, \nthat is not a position in which I think America ought to be.\n  There are some clever little tricks in this budget, too. They are \nvery technical. For example, one provision is that people are \nencouraged, if the President's proposal is enacted, to take money out \nof their individual retirement accounts, IRAs, or their 401(k) plans \nand put them over into basically a privatizing of Social Security \naccounts. But the little fiscal sleight of hand is that when you take \nit out of an IRA, you are going to have to pay taxes on it. Lo and \nbehold, that gins up an additional $15 billion over this 5-year \nprojection in the budget of new tax revenue, to make it appear as if \nthere is going to be more revenue coming in than there is.\n  This is really not an economic document. It is a political document. \nUnfortunately, it is a political document that is not a conservative \npolitical document. So I am looking forward to us getting our fingers \ninto this budget and beginning to pick it apart. But what it does when \nyou have a budget this much out of control is it makes it so much more \ndifficult for very important programs such as this transportation bill \nthat will provide so many jobs, that will cause dollars to be spent and \ncirculated and restore the economy--it causes it to be a very difficult \ntime in which to enact this kind of legislation, particularly at the \nlevel that some of us would like.\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to share my thoughts on this subject.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the statement of my friend from Florida.\n  I would say, in terms of who the villain is in the deficit we are \nfacing right now, there are two big villains. One is the war, and then \nthe economy. As we started losing economic ground, a downturn back in \nMarch of 2000, people didn't realize for every 1 percent change in \neconomic activity it translated into $45 billion in revenue. In other \nwords, as the economy is rebounding now, the revenue is coming back up. \nEven continuing in the effort, the war effort--which I am afraid is \ngoing to last for quite a while--we are going to be facing end strength \nproblems and that will have to go on.\n  I believe the best thing we can do is do it through the economy. At \nthe same time there are certain things that have to happen in America. \nWe have to do something about roads in America. I probably have as many \ntownhall meetings as anyone. I suggest the Senator from Florida does, \ntoo. I can't remember one I have had where they haven't said something \nabout roads.\n  In Oklahoma what they say is, we can always tell when we are around \nThanksgiving time, when we have family coming in, we have friends \ncoming in, we can always know when we get to Oklahoma because of the \nroads. I add to the Presiding Officer, when they come from Texas they \nmake that comment about Oklahoma roads. So we do have a very serious \nproblem. It seems to be more serious in my State.\n  Part of that is due to the donor status we have had for quite some \ntime. Of course, we have not had the money with which to do it. I feel \nan obligation, and believe it is very appropriate for conservatives, to \nget out and vote in favor of this type of an infrastructure program. \nThis translates directly into jobs, translates directly into the \neconomy, translates directly into increasing economic activity and \nadditional revenue that will come into Government.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S647-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  One such crime occurred in Greenwich Village, NY. There, a 36-year-\nold man was assaulted by a group of 15 men on his way to a gay bar. \nAnother man on the street yelled an anti-gay slur, and when the victim \nturned to see who had yelled at him, he was punched in the back of the \nhead.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S647-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TAIWAN'S PEACE REFERENDUM\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, for the past 54 years, Taiwan and the \nUnited States have been allies in the international arena, democratic \npartners and friends. In times of need and turmoil, both countries have \nalways come to each other's aid. In the aftermath of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks, Taiwan immediately offered help to Americans through \nthe U.S. Government. In recent months, Taiwan has offered humanitarian \naid to post-war Iraq.\n  Today Taiwan is being threatened. Taiwan's planned referendum on \nMarch 20, 2004 has been called a move toward Taiwan independence. Some \nsay it will push Taiwan to the ``abyss of war.'' Such rhetoric is a \ndistortion of Taiwan's true intentions. In the face of an overwhelming \nmilitary threat against Taiwan, Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian's peace \nreferendum asks Taiwan voters whether they should buy more anti-missile \nweapons if the People's Republic of China refuses to withdraw its 496 \nmissiles targeted at Taiwan and whether Taiwan should open up talks \nwith the People's Republic of China about issues of peace.\n  Taiwan's democratically elected president, President Chen, has made \nit clear that he continues to hold to the ``five no's'' of his \ninauguration speech, including the promise not to hold a plebiscite on \nthe issue of Taiwanese independence. The referendum merely aims to \navoid war, free its people from fear and maintain the status quo.\n  Taiwan, our ally and friend, is a democracy. Its people have every \nright to hold their referendum this March 20. Taiwan's referendum law \nis a basic democratic right that the United States should support \nrather than denigrate. The future of Taiwan must be determined \npeacefully, with the express consent of the people of Taiwan. Since its \nestablishment, the United States has been the foremost champion of \nliberty and democracy in the world. We can, therefore, not afford to \ntell the people of Taiwan not to hold a referendum.

Mr. President, I am proud to recognize and pay \ntribute to my good friend, a great Minnesotan, and a real American \nhero, the late Herb Brooks, whose memory, accomplishments, and \ncontributions are being memorialized today for all time in St. Paul.\n  Herb Brooks and I cam from two different worlds. I am so glad I got \nto know him in this place. Like a lot of sports fans, he gave me the \ngreatest spectator moment of my life in Lake Placid. But what he has \ntaught me about life is so much more significant.\n  Herb was a son of the East Side of Saint Paul. It's neighborhood that \nhas produced mayors, Governors, and two Supreme Court justices. I \nwonder if there is a neighborhood that has touched more lives for good \nthan the East Side.\n  Herb had a lot to say, and not all of it would go in a PG movie. He \ntold his hockey team, ``Gentlemen, we're not talented enough to win on \ntalent alone.'' That was pretty autobiological, I think.\n  Tonight, we in Minnesota, Herb's home State that loved him so much, \nhave the honor to unveil a permanent tribune to Herb's remarkable \ncareer, a career devoted not only to athletic excellence, but character \nand integrity. Then, we get to relive and relish the moment that \nreminded all Americans to start believing in miracles again at a \nscreening of the new Hollywood feature film ``The Miracle,'' based on \nthe USA hockey team's shining moment in Lake Placid under Herb Brooks.\n  I learned a great deal about leadership from Herb Brooks. He was not \na man of many words, but when Herb spoke, people listened, because what \nhe had to say was always profound.\n  More importantly than what Herb said was what he did. He was the kind \nof leader we need more of, the kind that leads by example. Herb Brooks \nlived an amazing, remarkable life. He is a hero of mine, and was to \nmillions of other Americans.\n  But what summed Herb Brooks up for me was this Brooksism: ``Everybody \nis important, but not too important.'' That was how he articulated his \nteam concept.\n  If we could all go through life seeing every person we meet as \nimportant and not seeing ourselves as too important--who knows, maybe \nthere would be a lot more miracles.\n  Herb will always be remembered in the hearts and minds of my fellow \nMinnesotans. But tonight we unveil a statue--in a city that Herb loved \nand loved him back--that will forever immortalize Herb Brooks's image \nin Minnesota history. This is a wonderful tribute, and one I am deeply \nhonored to be a part of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S648-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FIGHTIN' BLUE HENS CELEBRATE NATIONAL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in my 33 years as a U.S. Senator \nfrom Delaware, I have had the opportunity to give hundreds of speeches \non the Senate floor, but today is a first. It gives me tremendous pride \ntoday to officially congratulate my alma mater, the University of \nDelaware, on winning its first-ever NCAA Division I-AA National \nFootball Championship.\n  Players, fans, and students will celebrate this milestone in the \nUniversity of Delaware's history at a rally on Tuesday, February 10, \n2004, at the Bob Carpenter Center. And we have much more than the \nnational championship to celebrate. The Fightin' Blue Hens played one \nof the most outstanding seasons in college football history, with a \nrecord of 15 and 1 and setting a school record for victories in a \nseason.\n  After clinching their seventh Atlantic 10 Football Conference \nchampionship, the 2003 squad sailed through the Division I-AA playoff, \noutscoring opponents by a combined score of 149 to 23. In fact, they \nwon the championship game by shutting down Colgate 42 to 0. You can be \nsure I attended every playoff game, along with tens of thousands of \nother devoted Blue Hen fans.\n  As I said earlier, this marks the University of Delaware's first \nDivision I-AA title crown, but we earned six other football titles as a \nDivision II school. The last Division II title in 1979 was significant \nbecause our current coach, K.C. Keeler, played on that 1979 \nchampionship team as a linebacker.\n  In just his second year at the helm of UD football, K.C. Keeler took \nhis team to the national championship; but, K.C. is the first to give \nhis predecessor, legendary Hall of Fame coach Tubby Raymond, all the \ncredit for recruiting and building this team. Tubby, this championship \nis yours, too.\n  To be sure, UD football has come a long way since the 1960s when I \nwas at the University. But at a time when we all need some good news, \nthe 2003 University of Delaware football team has given our State \nplenty to cheer about. My warmest congratulations to the coaches, \nplayers, parents, school officials, cheerleaders, marching band \nmembers, students, and, of course, the diehard fans, as we celebrate \nbeing national football champions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S648-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S648-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate communities.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S648-5", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3030.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nEl Camino Real de Los Tejas as a National Historic Trail; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto recognize the oldest highway in Texas and establish the El Camino \nReal de Los Tejas National Historic Trail.\n  This bill will preserve a vital piece of Texas history for \ngenerations to come. The El Camino Real trail established a key \ncorridor for settlers, immigrants and militaries helping lay the \ngroundwork for our state's future. It also served as a path for such \nTexas heroes as Davy Crockett and Sam Houston who both fought in the \nstruggle for Texas independence from Mexico.\n  The 300-year-old corridor also served as a critical trade route, a \npost road, cattle trail and a military highway. The trail opened \nAmerica to Texas and Texas to the world. Still today the trail \ncollectively represents a series of roads and paths extending more than \n2,500 miles in length from the Rio Grande River near Eagle Pass and \nLaredo through San Antonio, Bastrop, and Nacogdoches, Texas to \nNatchitoches, Louisiana. While 2,500 miles of the trail are in 40 Texas \ncounties, the last 80 miles are in Louisiana.\n  The El Camino Real served as a strategic corridor during Texas' \nstruggle for independence. Critical supplies made their way via the El \nCamino Real for the Republic of Texas Army as they victoriously forged \nahead to defeat the Mexican Army in the Texas Revolution.\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\n  This legislation will recognize the significance of the El Camino \nReal and preserve its historic importance, as well as direct the \nNational Park Service to establish the El Camino Real trail as a \nNational Historic Trail. It will also allow our state agencies such as \nthe Texas Historical Commission to participate in the establishment and \ndesignation of the trail, while protecting the private property of \nlandowners along its route. This legislation will allow Texans and the \nthousands who visit our state each year to learn more of the rich \nhistory that forged the Lone Star State.\n  I am proud to offer this legislation to pay homage to an important \npiece of Texas and U.S. History, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthe El Camino Real de Los Tejas National Historic Trail Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2052\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``El Camino Real de los Tejas \n     National Historic Trail Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1244(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(23) El camino real de los tejas.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), El Camino \n     Real de los Tejas (The Royal Road of historic Tejas) National \n     Historic Trail, a combination of historic routes totaling \n     2,580 miles in length from the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and \n     Laredo, Texas, to Natchitoches, Louisiana, and including the \n     Old San Antonio Road, as generally depicted on the maps \n     entitled `El Camino Real de los Tejas', contained in the \n     report prepared pursuant to subsection (b) entitled `National \n     Historic Trail Feasibility Study and Environmental \n     Assessment: El Camino Real de los Tejas, Texas-Louisiana', \n     dated July 1998. The National Park Service is authorized to \n     administer designated portions of this trail system as a \n     national historic trail as set forth in this paragraph.\n       ``(B) Establishment.--\n       ``(i) Publicly owned lands.--Congress authorizes the \n     establishment of El Camino Real de los Tejas national \n     historic trail and the respective administration on those \n     portions of the historic trail routes and related historic \n     sites within publicly owned lands when such trail related \n     resources meet the purposes of this Act or certification \n     criteria set by the Secretary of the Interior per section \n     3(a)(3) of this Act.\n       ``(ii) Privately owned lands.--Congress authorizes the \n     establishment of El Camino Real de los Tejas national \n     historic trail and the respective administration on those \n     portions of the historic trail routes and related historic \n     sites within privately owned lands only through the voluntary \n     and expressed consent of the owner and when such trails and \n     sites qualify for certification as officially established \n     components of the national historic trail. The owner's \n     approval of a certification agreement satisfies the consent \n     requirement. Certification agreements are not legally binding \n     and may be terminated at any time. Should land ownership \n     change at a certified site, the certification will cease to \n     be valid unless the new owner consents to a new agreement.\n       ``(C) Private property rights protection.--Nothing in this \n     Act or in the establishment of any portion of the national \n     historic trail authorizes any person to enter private \n     property without the consent of the owner. Nothing in this \n     Act or in the establishment of any portion of the national \n     historic trail will authorize the Federal Government to \n     restrict private property owner's use or enjoyment of their \n     property subject to other laws or regulations. Authorization \n     of El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail under \n     this Act does not itself confer any additional authority to \n     apply other Federal laws and regulations on non-Federal lands \n     along the trail. Laws or regulations requiring public \n     entities and agencies to take into consideration a national \n     historic trail shall continue to apply notwithstanding the \n     foregoing. Notwithstanding section 7(g) of this Act, the \n     United States is authorized to acquire privately owned real \n     property or an interest in such property for purposes of the \n     national historic trail only with the consent of the owner of \n     such property and shall have no authority to condemn or \n     otherwise appropriate privately owned real property or an \n     interest in such property for the purposes of El Camino Real \n     de los Tejas National Historic Trail.\n       ``(D) Coordination of activities.--The Secretary of the \n     Interior may coordinate with United States and Mexican public \n     and nongovernmental organizations, academic institutions, \n     and, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the \n     Government of Mexico and its political subdivisions, for the \n     purpose of exchanging trail information and research, \n     fostering trail preservation and educational programs, \n     providing technical assistance, and working to establish an \n     international historic trail with complementary preservation \n     and education programs in each nation.\n       ``(E) Consultation.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     consult with appropriate State agencies in the the planning, \n     development, and maintenance of El Camino Real de los Tejas \n     National Historic Trail.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/05/senate-section/article/S651-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2269.
