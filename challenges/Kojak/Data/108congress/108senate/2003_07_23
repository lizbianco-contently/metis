Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business for an hour. Following morning business, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of H.R. 2555, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. Yesterday, we made progress, as the \nSenate was able to dispose of the Byrd amendment with a vote of 43 to \n50 on waiving the budget. It is my understanding that this morning, at \napproximately 10 o'clock, Senator Boxer will be prepared to offer an \namendment to the bill. Senator Cochran will be here, and it is my hope \nwe can try to reach short time agreements on amendments that are \noffered as we go forward.\n  It is our desire to finish this bill today or this evening, if \nnecessary. That would enable the Senate to consider another \nappropriations measure this week prior to resuming the Energy bill next \nweek. Again, Members should notify the managers of their intention to \noffer amendments to the Homeland Security bill this morning. The \nchairman and ranking member would then be able to discuss an order of \nconsideration of these amendments.\n  With the schedule announced, I will now yield myself time from my \nallotted time in morning business.\n  First, let me ask the Democratic leader, through the Chair, if he has \nany comments on the schedule.\n  I now yield myself my allotted time in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9741-7", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9741-S9743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1019\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Laci and Connor Peterson murders in \nCalifornia have brought before the American people a critical question \nthat deserves a response: When a criminal attacks a woman who is \npregnant, killing both her and her unborn child, has he killed one \nvictim or two?\n  I believe the answer is two. Laci Peterson was not the only person \nkilled but her unborn baby, Connor, was also murdered.\n  Unfortunately, there is a loophole in Federal law that does not \npermit prosecutors to charge suspects with killing both mother and \nchild. Twenty-seven States have moved to close this loophole in their \nState laws. Indeed, California is one of those States. That is why \nState prosecutors have charged Scott Peterson with the deaths of his \nwife Laci and his son Connor.\n  I believe it is long past time for the Senate to close this loophole \nfor Federal crimes. We have been working with our friends across the \naisle since June 26 to reach an agreement to bring up this bill but so \nfar we have been unsuccessful. But we are not going to give up.\n  Thus, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar item No. 89, S. \n1019, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2003, under the following \nconditions: 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form; \nfurther, that no amendments be in order and that all points of order be \nwaived; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be read a \nthird time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the measure, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n\n[[Page S9742]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are very close to a point where we could \noffer the leader the ability to modify his unanimous consent request. \nSenator Feinstein, we would ask, would offer an amendment which would \nbe a substitute. Senator Murray would offer one on domestic relations, \nand another Senator would offer one that deals with intent. We think \nthere may be one other amendment, maybe two, that we would be able to \nenter into. Maybe later today, or probably tomorrow, would be the best \ntime to again renew the request of the majority leader.\n  At this time we cannot agree; therefore, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have been working on this very important \nissue with the other side of the aisle, and it is absolutely critical \nthat we address the issue, we believe, as soon as possible. Therefore, \nI am very pleased that we are hearing what the nature of the amendments \nmight be. This is the first time I have heard what those amendments \ncould possibly be. I look forward, again, to working to bring this bill \nto the floor as soon as possible.\n  I am sorry that my friend from Nevada objects to bringing up this \nbipartisan bill now. We believe it is a critically important bill that \ndoes deserve prompt consideration.\n  Sharon Rocha, the mother of Laci Peterson and the grandmother of \nConnor Peterson, has written an eloquent letter asking that the Senate \nquickly pass this bill, pass this bill as soon as possible.\n  The House of Representatives, as my colleagues probably know, has \npassed this very bill twice but the bill keeps being blocked in the \nSenate.\n\n  I know my colleague from Ohio, who is the sponsor of the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act, has been working very hard, mentioning to me \nalmost daily the need to get this bill to the floor as soon as possible \nand to address this important issue.\n  Thus, I yield to my distinguished colleague from Ohio.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  I am sorry we are not able to bring this bill up today. I hope that \nwhat I hear from my colleague from Nevada is encouraging words and that \nwe will be able to get an agreement shortly.\n  Let me say, as my colleague from Tennessee, the majority leader, has \npointed out, that now in over half the States in the Union, if you \ncommit a crime of violence against a pregnant woman and her unborn baby \ndies, you can be punished for the violence against both the mother and \nthe unborn child.\n  But the other side of that story is, in roughly half of the States in \nthe Union, they do not have this law, and in the Federal Government we \ndo not have this law. We have been trying to rectify this since 1999, \nwhich is the first time I introduced this bill.\n  My colleague Lindsey Graham, who is going to speak in a moment, was \nthe leader in the House of Representatives when they passed the bill \nseveral times in the past. So, this is not something that just came up \nin the last few months.\n  Let me make a couple comments before I yield to my colleague. First, \nthis has nothing to do with abortion. We have a very specific exception \nin this bill in very definite language that states it has nothing to do \nwith abortion. You can't write it any clearer or any plainer than we \nhave written the language.\n  Second, let me give an example that will show the compelling need for \nthis bill. Even though over half of the States now have very similar \nlegislation, consider this situation. Assume that an airman stationed \nat Dover Air Force Base in Delaware attacks a pregnant woman--his \ngirlfriend, wife, someone he doesn't know. Assume his intent is to \nterminate her pregnancy and he savagely beats her with a specific \nintent to terminate that pregnancy. Assume that, in fact, that is what \nhappens, and the child does, in fact, die. Under current Federal law, \nthe only thing the Federal prosecutor could charge him with is the \nassault against the mother. The reason for that is there is no Federal \nlaw such as the one we are talking about, and Delaware does not have a \nlaw.\n  That is not right. That is not justice. We need to say that is not \nright. We need to close that loophole because everyone in this country, \nI believe, recognizes there is a second victim, and it is not just, it \nis not right that that child should not be recognized as a victim. And \nthere is no one in this country who believes that man should walk away \nwith the only charge against him being a simple assault.\n  We had a case in Ohio a few years ago that turned out differently. It \nwas a tragic case, but at least justice was done. It was the exact same \ncase--a man was stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, an \nairman, had a pregnant girlfriend. He decided that he was going to end \nher pregnancy. He savagely beat her, terminated her pregnancy. She \naborted and lost her child. The Federal prosecutor gets the tragic case \nand finds out there is no Federal law that says he can charge. He looks \naround and says: What am I going to do? Fortunately, Ohio had just \npassed a law similar to this. So under the Federal assimilative law he \nwas able to assimilate the Ohio law into the Federal code and was able \nto charge him with the murder of the child. But in those States, those \n23 States that do not have that, if that Air Force base had been \nlocated in any of those States, justice would not have been done.\n  What we are saying is, it is time for there to be justice. It is time \nfor there to be a Federal law. This law simply recognizes what every \nperson in this country understands that there is, in fact, a second \nvictim.\n  I yield back to the majority leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank my distinguished colleague from Ohio for his \nlongstanding leadership on this particular issue. We all know the issue \nhas been highlighted by the recent tragic events with the Peterson \nfamily. Again, both my distinguished colleague from Ohio, as well as \nanother colleague I will turn to shortly, have been at this a long \ntime. We appreciate their leadership and look forward to addressing \nthis issue on the Senate floor when we have that opportunity.\n  I would now like to turn to my colleague from South Carolina, the \nchampion of this bill when he was in the House of Representatives \nbefore coming to the Senate.\n  I yield to my friend from South Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I thank the majority \nleader and publicly acknowledge all the hard work on his behalf, \nworking with my colleagues on the Democratic side. Senator Frist has \nbeen very responsive, trying to get this bill up for a vote, and it \nseems we are making progress. In terms of our leadership, I could not \nbe more pleased with the efforts he has made to fill in this gap.\n  The Laci Peterson case probably explains the dynamic better than I \ncould ever explain it. However, there has been an ongoing fight to fix \nthis problem of the Federal law for many years. Senator DeWine has been \nthe champion of this bill in the Senate. When I first introduced it in \nthe House, in the 106th Congress, it passed by 254 votes to 172 with \nover 50 Democratic Members. A lot of pro-choice people voted for the \nbill because America does divide on a woman's right to choose evenly. \nBut when you ask Americans if a woman chooses to have the child and \nthat child is harmed while she is pregnant through criminal assault, \nabout 80 percent of Americans, Democrats and Republicans, say together \nthat the criminal should be prosecuted for both events, damage to the \nmother and the child.\n  There is a lot of bipartisan support for this bill. It passed in the \n106th Congress in the House, 107th Congress in the House with over 250 \nvotes, with Democrats and Republicans, pro-choice, pro-life people \ncoming together. Senator DeWine has been an advocate for this bill \nsince it originated. I thank him.\n  The reason we need this bill is because there are more events such as \nthis than you would want to believe where people attack pregnant women, \ncausing them to lose their child, and in a certain class of cases where \nthe Federal jurisdiction is the exclusive form\n\n[[Page S9743]]\n\nof prosecution, there is no right under Federal law for a prosecutor to \ngo after the harm done to the unborn child.\n  In the Oklahoma City bombing case there was a lady working for the \nDEA. She was a secretary, Carrie Lenz. On the day of the bombing, she \ncame to work early to show her coworkers an ultrasound picture of her \nunborn child, Michael Lenz III. She was showing her coworkers the \nultrasound picture and the building blew up, killing her and her child. \nIn the House when we were doing hearings on this bill, the father, \nMichael Lenz, came to testify. He told us in very emotional, eloquent \nterms that that day he lost two things. He lost his son Michael James \nLenz III and he lost his wife. If this law had existed, the prosecutor \nwould have been able to prosecute Timothy McVeigh for two acts of \nviolence, not one.\n  We need this bill. Unfortunately, these events do happen. And when \nthey do happen, most Americans, a high percentage in polling, Democrats \nand Republicans in the House and I do believe in the Senate, would want \nthe full weight of the law to go against defenders who attack pregnant \nwomen. I believe this bill will be signed by the President because he \nsaid he would sign it. I know it will pass the House. If we can get a \nvote in the Senate, it will pass the Senate with a strong bipartisan \nvote.\n  I thank Senator Frist for pushing this measure, and I hope we can \naccommodate our friends on the Democratic side to get a vote on this \nbill so that we can do something that will be very positive in this \nCongress, and that is make sure the people who attack pregnant women \nget whacked as hard as we can whack them.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in closing, I look forward to working with \nthe Democratic leadership in terms of bringing this to the floor of the \nSenate as soon as possible. It really does boil down to the fundamental \nquestion of when a criminal attacks a pregnant woman, killing both the \nwoman and her unborn child, has there been one or two victims? That is \nwhat this legislation addresses in a very direct fashion.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my following remarks be taken from leader \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The leader has that right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9743-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A REMARKABLE NEWS DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday was a remarkable day in many, \nmany ways. Private First Class Lynch returned to her home after so many \nweeks and months away. She is a true American hero. We had Ambassador \nJerry Bremer brief 65 Senators yesterday on the real progress being \nmade in Iraq and on the reconstruction and reconstitution that is going \non there.\n  Then we had the news that began late in the morning, and was \nconfirmed in the afternoon, that Saddam's two sons, Uday and Qusay, \nhave been eliminated as threats to Iraqi freedom.\n  It was truly a remarkable day. We are driven by headlines so much. \nThey influence us in such a direct way. As we looked at these three \nsequences of events, you could not help but feel pride and optimism as \nwe move forward in this fight for freedom around the world.\n  We do greet the news yesterday, with the elimination of Saddam's two \nsons, with pride and with respect--respect for our troops, for our \nmilitary men and women who have devoted their lives and demonstrated an \nunmatched professionalism and maturity. It is clear--we have no doubt--\nthat we have waged a just war, that the bloody tyrant Saddam Hussein \nhas been defeated; that Iraq is better without Saddam and his \ndiabolical offspring terrorizing and murdering the Iraqi people; and \nindeed America is better off without Saddam Hussein and his murderous \ncabal that had been in power, which clearly sat back and had plans and \ncarried out terror and domination and mass murder.\n  It is a tough road. In talking to Ambassador Bremer, it is clear that \nour reconstruction and capturing what we know this is all about, which \nis in the words ``Operation Iraqi Freedom''--it is freedom that we have \nfought for and that we continue to fight for. This will continue to \ntake time and patience. It will continue to take resources from this \nbody. But for the first time in 30 years, the Iraqi people are free to \nlive without fear and without tyranny. They are participating for the \nfirst time in 30 years in the planning and the future of their own \ngovernment.\n  Indeed our hearts go out to the families who have lost loved ones on \nthe battlefield and who continue to lose them in this effort. Each day \nit seems we are greeted with another distressing story of a Baathist \nattack. We are entitled to feel this grief and, indeed, this \nfrustration. But in honor and respect for the individuals who have \ngiven their lives, and who continue to give their lives to protect our \nfreedom, we must remain resolute. We must keep pressing forward. We \ncannot let that headline of the day dictate our overall policy.\n  Our President and our troops are out protecting the security of our \nNation, and we are leading at the same time another nation in a \nsystematically planned, strategic, organized way to freedom. In so \ndoing, we are making ourselves and future generations more secure.\n  We will succeed. It will take patience. It will take determination. \nIt will take resolve. It takes all of that to bring our enemies to \njustice. It takes all of that to free the Iraqi people. It takes all of \nthat to help protect the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9743-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as the majority leader noted, yesterday \nwas a remarkable day. I had a chance to listen to Ambassador Bremer. As \na former mayor, I understand how difficult it is to have cities \nfunction--electricity, water, and other challenges, kind of the basics. \nI marvel at the challenge that Ambassador Bremer is facing.\n  The good news is that we are making tremendous progress in Iraq. \nYesterday was a good day because two of Saddam's diabolical offspring, \nas the majority leader said, are dead. It is kind of strange to say \nthat the death of any individual is a great thing. But here we are \ntalking about the most brutish, thuggish, reprehensible individuals who \nterrorized those with whom they came into contact. There were \ncelebrations in the streets of Baghdad yesterday with news of the death \nof Saddam's sons.\n  So in this time of good news, yet at the same time that American \nlives are being lost, that the path to liberation of Iraq and \nultimately freedom and democracy and greater stability in that region \nis a difficult one, I think it is important to come to the floor of the \nSenate to reaffirm the justice and purpose of American and coalition \nefforts in Iraq. My only regret is that it is necessary to do so.\n  We have a great tradition of dissent in America, and we need people \nto ask the tough questions. But just because we value dissent doesn't \nmake that dissent right or just. At a time when lives are being risked \nand lost, when America and her friends are trying to do something which \nis both very difficult and supremely important, this is a moment where \nunity should be at a premium.\n  Yet out on the campaign trail we are observing a mixture of Monday \nmorning quarterbacking, political opportunism, and media exaggeration \nwhich threaten to deprive us of perspective and resolve when we need it \nmost.\n\n  America came into its own as a major player on the world stage at the \nbeginning of the 20th century, in part because of the leadership of a \ngreat American President, Theodore Roosevelt. As we consider our role \nin our new century, I think it is important to reflect on some words \nfrom Theodore Roosevelt. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S9744]]\n\n\n       It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out \n     how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could \n     have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is \n     actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweet \n     and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short \n     again and again, because there is no effort without error or \n     shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great \n     devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause. . . .\n\n  Let me reiterate the worthiness of the cause we have undertaken. We \nlive in a world where we are more connected than we ever imagined we \ncould be. The benefits of globalization to consumers and impoverished \nmillions are clear. But so are the risks. September 11 showed us how \nvulnerable we are and reduced our acceptable tolerance level for brutal \nleaders who wish to harm our people.\n  Saddam Hussein's danger to his neighbors, the Middle East region, and \nthe world has been an unquestioned assumption of American foreign \npolicy for more than a decade. He flaunted the authority of the world \ncommunity and the United Nations, ignoring 17 solemn resolutions \ndirected against his regime. He failed to account for 30,000 liters of \nbiological toxins, 3.9 tons of nerve agents, and tens of thousands of \nmunitions capable of delivering them against targets. He aggressively \npursued nuclear weapons. The Israelis wiped out an Iraqi nuclear \nfunction in 1981.\n  In 1991 and after the gulf war, we found solid evidence of him \nattempting to pursue nuclear weapons. He harbored and supported \nterrorists. He destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands of his own \npeople. He ruthlessly cannibalized the assets and resources of the \nIraqi people to support his tyranny and lavish lifestyle.\n  Some people shy away from the term ``evil,'' but I would ask them: Is \nthere any form of evil that is not part of the confirmed record of \nSaddam Hussein?\n  To rid the world of a person such as this and a regime such as this--\nan evil regime, an evil person--is ultimately just and wise and the \nright thing to do.\n  Do the critics dispute this? Not directly. They criticize the means \nto that end. They support our troops but not the military leaders or \ntheir stated mission. They support protecting American interests but \nnot in this particular way on this timetable or at this cost. They want \nresults, but they want them more quickly and at lesser or no cost. But \nat some point, endlessly criticizing the means calls the ends into \nquestion.\n  The flow of the argument has been interesting. Before the war began, \nthis was an impossible, protracted war against devoted Iraqi forces. \nWhen there was early success, the argument shifted to criticize that \nthe war would take months rather than days, and now with the hard work \nof rebuilding the country--not from American war damage but from \ndecades of Saddam's economic devastation--the focus is on what was said \nand understood and communicated before the war began. It reflects an \nattention span and a degree of patience measured out in new cycles.\n  Part of Saddam's evil is deception and the desire to humiliate us. To \ngive him credibility--``maybe he didn't have weapons of mass \ndestruction''--and then question our own leaders is ludicrous. Can we \nactually question the justification of this war because we have not yet \nfound weapons of mass destruction in a matter of months that a master \nof deception had years to hide in an area the size of California?\n  My question to the critics is simple: What is your alternative? We \nlive in the real world, not a Hollywood stage. There are evil people \nwho want nothing more than to destroy us, and they understand only the \nlanguage of force. They will not rest while we sit around saying: If \nonly . . . if only . . . if only . . . if only.\n  Last night I had a wonderful conversation with Mayor Kevin Finnegan \nof West St. Paul, MN. He has a son and a daughter-in-law serving in \nIraq. His message to me was simple: We need, Senator, to stay the \ncourse, to keep our eye on the ball. We have rid the world of Saddam's \nleadership. Let's work for democracy and stability in Iraq.\n  The more we talk about weapons of mass destruction, the harder it is \nto achieve our ultimate underlying objective: the liberation of Iraq.\n  In the real world, there are choices to be made, challenges to be \ndealt with, and burdens to be carried. This is not a game with a reset \nbutton. America must stay the course. To pull out now would be a \nvictory for terrorists of unimagined proportions. We must stay the \ncourse to show our resolve. And yet every loss of life for an American \nservice person is a tragedy, but we should not fail to recognize those \nlives are not being lost in vain.\n  From the devastation and corruption of Saddam's reign, freedom and \norder are being restored. When we understand the depths to which he \ntook that society, we recognize the time it will take to bring it back. \nMurderers, thugs, and terrorists owned the streets of a whole nation. \nSlowly but surely, we are prying them loose from their bloody hands.\n\n  There is a city council now in Baghdad, and yet as a former mayor, I \nask the question: Haven't they suffered enough? But there is democracy \ncoming back to Iraq. Winning the peace will take longer than winning \nthe war, but victory will be ours. The great victors will not only be \nthe Iraqi people but children of the whole world who will grow up in a \nmore peaceful century because we saw our duty and stuck to it until we \nfinished the job.\n  Prime Minister Blair gave us a rare and beautiful insight on our role \nat this time. It was an honor for me to be in that Chamber. It is a \nmoment as a freshman Senator that I will never forget. It is important \nto reflect. He said:\n\n       And I know it's hard on America, and in some corner in this \n     vast country, out in Nevada or Idaho--\n\n  He could have inserted Minnesota or New Hampshire--\n\n     or these places I've never been to, but always wanted to go, \n     I know out there there's a guy getting on with his life, \n     perfectly happily, minding his own business, saying to you, \n     the political leaders of this country: Why me? And why us? \n     And why America? And the only answer is: Because destiny put \n     you in this place in history, in this moment in time and the \n     task is yours to do.\n\n  Let's pull together, recognize the realities we face, commit for the \nlong and difficult haul ahead, and move forward. Nothing worthwhile is \neasy, but it never has been for America.\n  I applaud our young men and women who are on the front lines, who are \ndoing the hard work for all of us, but we will all benefit from their \nefforts.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, it has been 48 days since the Senate \npassed the Lincoln-Snowe bill to provide child tax credit to the \nfamilies of 12 million children. Twelve million, Mr. President, is not \na small number of children in America. The House then passed a \ndifferent child tax credit bill.\n  Thirty-five days ago, the Senate appointed conferees to work out the \ndifferences between the two bills--35 days--and the conference has yet \nto hold its first meeting.\n  On July 25, just 2 business days from today, many families will begin \nreceiving checks for the increased child tax credit, but millions of \nfamilies will find their mailboxes empty. Why? Millions who hoped for \nsuch a credit will not receive it. Why? Because the conference has not \nmet and the House has not agreed to the Senate provision. The Lincoln-\nSnowe bill, however, would ensure that these families are not left \nbehind. In 2 working days, the House plans to adjourn for the remainder \nof the summer, not addressing this important question. We must, rather, \nsend a bill to the President before that time so that millions of \nchildren can receive the benefit.\n\n  Just a few years ago, in 2001, the President brought a tax reduction \nproposal to Congress. The proposal was based upon the premise that \ntaxpayers across the board were paying too much of their income in \ntaxes. The President included the working poor, citing extremely high \nmarginal rates. At the\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\ntime, the working poor faced marginal rates above 50 percent, among the \nhighest marginal rates faced by any taxpayer.\n  What does that really mean? That means that for the working poor, \nwith their marginal rates above 50 percent, for every extra dollar that \na person in that category earned, more than half of that would be \ntaxed, and less than half would then be kept by the taxpayer. That is \nthe effect of the high marginal rate of the working poor.\n  The President's economic advisers called this an ``egregious \nproblem'' in our Tax Code. On the campaign trail, candidate George Bush \npledged that, ``lowering these barriers to the middle class'' was one \nof his top priorities.\n  I worked with the President in 2001 to reduce the marginal rates for \nworking Americans. I think he was right. The bill we enacted included \nmarginal rate cuts for taxpayers across the board. It also included two \nprovisions specifically targeted at reducing the marginal rate for low-\nincome workers. First, it reduced the lowest marginal rate; that is, \nthe tax paid on the first dollar of taxable income from 15 percent to \n10 percent. Second, it made the child tax credit partially refundable \nfor working families. Currently, the child credit is refundable up to \n10 percent for a family's income above $10,500. In 2005, this amount is \nset to increase to 15 percent, up from 10 percent.\n  The marginal rates for working taxpayers are less than they were \nbefore the 2001 bill was passed, and they will be less in 2005. I \nbelieve, frankly, we should do more.\n  Under current law, taxpayers in the lower income brackets face \nmarginal rates as high as 46 percent, as represented by this chart. \nThat is, under current law taxpayers in the lower income brackets face \nmarginal rates as high as 46 percent. This chart shows that for a \nmarried couple with two children, with an income of $27,000, the \nmarginal rate is 46 percent. Compare that with the marginal rate of \nhigher income Americans. For a family with two children, a family of \nfour, with $100,000 of income, the marginal rate is only 28 percent. \nThat is, the Government takes 28 cents of the next dollar earned by a \nfamily in the $100,000 income bracket.\n  Correspondingly, it rises as the income rises but not much, and still \nnot nearly as high as a working family with $27,000 total income. Their \nmarginal rate is 46 percent. It is much higher than the marginal rate \nis for higher income Americans.\n  So let's take an example. A family of four making $27,000, that is \nabout 150 percent of poverty. What happens to that family? If they earn \nan additional dollar of income, they lose 21 cents of the earned-income \ntax credit they receive. They lose it because of the phaseout of the \nearned-income tax credit. They pay payroll taxes of 15 cents if \nwe include both shares of the payroll taxes, as most economists do. And \nthey pay 10 cents in Federal income tax. This adds up to a marginal \nrate of 46 percent for a family of four earning $27,000. This is how it \nis broken down: Income tax, 10 percent; payroll tax, 15 percent; and \nbecause of the way the Tax Code works, and the earned-income tax credit \nphases out, that amounts to a 21-percent marginal rate that taxpayer \nhas to pay. So for every additional dollar this family makes, they keep \nonly 54 cents. Forty-six cents on every additional dollar made goes to \nthe Federal Government. We are not even talking about State taxes. We \nare just talking about Federal taxes. So State taxes could be a lot \nmore.\n\n  How does this compare with other taxpayers? This family making \n$27,000 faces a higher marginal rate today than a similar family making \n$100,000, $150,000, or $200,000 as shown by the same chart shown \nearlier. It is very clear that lower income persons pay higher marginal \ntax rates. In fact, this family has a marginal rate that is higher than \nthe wealthiest taxpayers in America, if my colleagues can believe that.\n  If we are supposed to be encouraging people to work, logically lower \nincome Americans would have a lower marginal rate because we want to \nencourage people, particularly in that category, to earn an extra \ndollar. But our Tax Code is so perverse it causes the reverse result. \nIt is far higher than the corporate rate of 35 percent.\n  Just think of that. I do not think many people know that. That is, \nlower income working families, families with a $27,000 income, pay a \nhigher marginal rate than corporations do. I do not think most \nAmericans know that, and if most Americans did, they would think that \nis not right. Hence, many of us are today urging the Congress, urging \nthe other side of the aisle in particular, to work with the House and \npass a child tax credit in the remaining 2 days before the House \nadjourns for the summer recess.\n  Senators Lincoln and Snowe deserve a lot of credit. They have led the \neffort to reduce the marginal rates for working families. They began in \n2001 when they fought to ensure that low-income working families would \nbe able to receive a refundable child credit, and they are now fighting \nto ensure that these families receive the full child tax credit today.\n  I will explain how the refundable child credit reduces the marginal \nrate for working families. Let's take a family of four making $22,000. \nWithout the refundable child credit, their marginal rate would be 36 \npercent. The current credit, which is 10 percent refundable, brings \ntheir marginal rate down to 26 percent. In 2005, the refundability of \nthe child credit will increase to 15 percent. This family's marginal \nrate will then go down to 21 percent, from 26 percent.\n  We have all heard the argument for immediate tax relief: If tax \nrelief is good enough in a few years, it is good enough today. We have \nheard it constantly. It is a constant refrain in this body. This was \nthe theory behind President Bush's jobs and growth package, which \naccelerated marginal rate reductions for millions of taxpayers, \nincluding those making $100,000, $200,000, or even $1 million. For a \nfamily making $100,000, the marginal income and payroll tax rate was \nreduced in that package from 30 percent to 28 percent. For the family \nmaking $200,000, the rate was reduced again from 38 percent to 36 \npercent, and for millionaires the rate was reduced from almost 42 \npercent to 38 percent.\n  The provision that would have reduced the marginal rate for low-\nincome working families, that is the increase in child tax credit \nrefundability, was specifically excluded from the final bill. If \nmarginal rate reductions are good enough for the wealthy today, are \nthey not good enough for the working poor? The answer from the Senate \nwas a resounding yes. The Lincoln-Snowe bill to reduce marginal rates \nfor the working poor immediately passed the Senate almost unanimously.\n  The marginal rates for the low-income working families are still too \nhigh. Passing the Lincoln-Snowe bill is an improvement. This \nimprovement will provide additional incentives to work and earn the \nextra dollar, which is basically what tax reduction is all about, and \nit would shrink what the President has called barriers to the middle \nclass.\n  We have 2 working days left, 2 days to convene this conference, work \nout our differences, send this bill to the President; 2 days to ensure \nthat low-income working families receive the same tax relief that is \npromised to the rest of America's families, and 2 days remaining to \nensure we fix this problem. Even President Bush agrees this is an \negregious problem in the Tax Code. I strenuously urge us to put \npolitics aside and do what is right and convene this conference \ncommittee. Let's get this passed in the next 2 days before the House \nadjourns for the summer.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided on both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor on a \nnumber of occasions concerning the exploding deficits being built up by \nthis administration, as well as the very poor performance of the \nnational economy since this administration took office. The recent \nOffice of Management and Budget, OMB, projections are especially \nnoteworthy.\n  We now see the White House foresees a 5-year debt increase of $1.9 \ntrillion, a record $455 billion deficit this year, a $475 billion \ndeficit next year. Each of those numbers signifies a terrible record of \nperformance and record-setting deficits. With each report the deficits \nget deeper and deeper. Next year's $475 billion deficit represents over \n$1,600 for every man, woman, and child in America. That is the \nequivalent of adding to each citizen's credit card $1,600 upon which we \nwill be required to pay interest year after year after year ad \ninfinitum.\n  In the past 3 years, we have seen the worst record of job creation \nsince the Presidency of Herbert Hoover, with over 3 million jobs lost. \nThis is the only administration in 70 years with a decline in private \nsector jobs. Long-term unemployment has tripled. We are in the slowest \neconomic growth in over 50 years. And one other item: A huge drop in \nthe value of pensions. A $100,000 pension invested in Standard & Poors \nstocks at the beginning of this administration is now worth $26,000 \nless.\n  We do not hear a lot of talk from the administration, at least \nopenly, about privatizing Social Security any longer. Just think, if \nyou are just getting ready to retire, and this administration's \nprivatization policies for Social Security had been in effect, and you \nhad $100,000 in your pension funds in something that everyone believed \nwould be very safe, it would now be worth $74,000. You would have lost \n$26,000 in 3 years. That is why I have said this administration is \ncommitting economic malpractice. It is economic malpractice at its \nworst. We keep hearing about medical malpractice, but this is economic \nmalpractice because for the long term we face millions of retiring baby \nboomers and large increases in Social Security and Medicare. We have a \ngreat need to invest in the education of our children and to protect \nour children with homeland security. But this administration has one \nanswer to all our problems: More tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\n  I think it is worth looking at history. Faced with high unemployment, \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt said to Congress on May 24, 1937:\n\n       We know that overwork and underpay do not increase the \n     national income when a large portion of our workers remain \n     unemployed. Reasonable and flexible use of the long-\n     established right of Government to set and change working \n     hours can, I hope, decrease unemployment in those groups in \n     which unemployment today principally exists.\n\n  Those are the words of President Franklin Roosevelt in 1937.\n  So what did Congress do? Congress passed time-and-a-half pay for \novertime to increase jobs. Yet, faced with rising unemployment, this \nPresident wants to take away time-and-a-half from millions of Americans \nwho receive a higher income because of it. This President, through the \npromulgation of new rules and regulations, wants to remove the \nincentive that overtime pay provides to employers to hire more workers. \nThis is an anti-job-growth policy. In fact, this President threatened \nto veto a House appropriations bill if that bill said no to cutting \ntime-and-a-half for overtime--again, economic malpractice.\n  The President's OMB Director says the projected budgets are \n``manageable.'' But when we look at the operating budget for next year, \nusing OMB's own numbers, we face a deficit equal to 5.7 percent of our \nGDP, our gross domestic product, the second largest since 1946.\n  These are the budget deficits expected just for the next few years. \nIn 2000, as we can see, we had budget surpluses. During the 1990s, we \npaid off our debts, we had wise tax-and-spend policies, and we built up \na surplus. That surplus was intended to be used to pay off our debt to \nprovide for security for those who are going to be retiring very soon.\n  Now, because of the economic malpractice of this administration, the \nforecast is for even bigger deficits than what we have had in the past, \ngoing on into the future with no end in sight. So the President's \npolicies eat up all the reserves we were going to use for Social \nSecurity and they have turned them into debt.\n  Under this President's program, these explosive deficits just keep \ngoing on and on and they keep getting worse. We tried this supply-side \neconomic tax policy in 1981, and both the deficits and unemployment \nskyrocketed, resulting in our prior deficit record.\n  In 1993, we tried to reverse supply-side policies. I just might note \nfor the record, every Republican in the Senate and every Republican in \nthe House voted no. They all predicted economic disaster. Instead, we \ngot out of the hole and we got into record surpluses. Unemployment \ndropped year after year, wealth increased all over America, average \npeople saw their incomes rise.\n  So when this President came into office in 2001, what did he do? He \npushed a huge tax cut primarily aimed at the wealthy. Deficits \nskyrocketed, jobs were lost, and the unemployed stayed that way for \nlonger and longer. In 2003, it is a repeat of what they did in 2001--\neconomic malpractice.\n\n  On February 12, Mr. Greenspan said:\n\n       There's no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy unless \n     attended.\n\n  We are not attending to it. In fact, what is happening with this \nadministration is that it is getting worse, the deficits are getting \nbigger. On July 16, Mr. Greenspan said:\n\n       There is no question that if you run substantial and \n     excessive deficits over time, you are draining savings from \n     the private sector, and other things being equal, you do \n     clearly undercut the growth rate of the economy.\n\n  That is what is happening.\n  Some on the right say they have a way to reduce the deficit that will \ngrow larger and larger. They say reform Social Security and Medicare. \nWhat they mean is, by privatizing it, cut Social Security, cut \nMedicare, cut them deeply. They see too much being spent on our \nchildren's education. They think that ought to be cut, too.\n  I have an alternative view. I think the economic malpractice of this \nadministration and supply-side economics must end and we have to return \nto economic sanity in this country. Look at those who are unemployed \nfor 3 months, 6 months, a year--hurt economically, families hurt, \nmarriages destroyed, futures lost. Look at our African-American \ncommunity and the Hispanic community, which are suffering huge \nunemployment levels. Look at teenagers who cannot find jobs and wonder \nhow they are going to be able to afford rising college tuition, which \nin many cases has doubled in the last couple of years. Look at the \ndisabled who are being fired to cut health care insurance, and they are \nnot being rehired and people are not reaching out the hand to hire \npeople with disabilities because of the rising cost of health \ninsurance, and the pressures are\n\n[[Page S9747]]\n\ngrowing to cut Social Security and Medicare as these deficits grow.\n  Only an ideologue who thinks of shrinking Government, whatever the \ncost, could possibly think we are on the right path. As Congressman \nSpratt in the House has said of the policies of this President and what \nthe Congress is now following:\n\n       There seems to be no shame, no shock, and no solution.\n\n  We must reject these policies. We must reject the economic \nmalpractice of this administration and move back to economic sanity in \nour country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.

Mr. President, normally in our country we don't \napplaud the death of anyone. We value life greatly. But today we do \nindeed applaud the death, the removal, of two of the most vicious \ncriminals who ever lived. Yesterday we heard confirmation that the \n101st Airborne--I can proudly say headquartered in Fort Campbell, KY--\nin a raid on a house in Mosul, killed Uday and Qusay Hussein, two of \nthe biggest monsters who ever walked the face of the Earth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two Associated Press \nobituaries be printed in the Record at this point, but I want to take a \nlook at those obituaries because I think they tell you a lot about what \nthis war was all about.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Odai Hussein, Oldest Son of Saddam\n\n       Baghdad, Iraq.--Odai Hussein, the murderous and erratic \n     oldest son of Saddam Hussein, controlled propaganda in Iraq \n     and allegedly oversaw the torture of athletes who failed to \n     perform.\n       The 39-year-old is No. 3 on the list of 55 most-wanted men \n     from the former Iraqi regime--only Saddam and younger brother \n     Qusai ranked higher. The three also are on a U.S. list of \n     former regime members who could be tried for war crimes.\n       As head of the paramilitary Fedayeen Saddam paramilitary \n     unit, Odai helped his father eliminate opponents and exert \n     iron-fisted control over Iraq's 25 million people. The eldest \n     of Saddam's five children, Odai was elected to parliament in \n     1999 with a reported 99 percent of the vote, but he rarely \n     attended parliament sessions.\n       Iraqi exiles say Odai murdered at will and tortured with \n     zeal, and routinely ordered his guards to snatch young women \n     off the street so he could rape them. The London-based human-\n     rights group Indict said Odai ordered prisoners to be dropped \n     into acid baths as punishment.\n       The Caligula-like Odai seemed proud of his reputation and \n     called himself Abu Sarhan, an Arabic term for ``wolf.''\n       But his tendency toward erratic brutality even exasperated \n     Saddam, who temporarily banished Odai to Switzerland after \n     the younger Hussein killed one of his father's favorite \n     bodyguards in 1988.\n       The bodyguard, a young man named Kamel Gegeo, arranged \n     trysts for the Iraqi president--notably with one woman who \n     later became Saddam's second wife. Worried that his father's \n     relationship with the woman could threaten his own position \n     as heir, Odai beat Gegeo to death with a club in full view of \n     guests at a high-society party, according to some reports. \n     Other reports said Odai killed Gegeo with an electric carving \n     knife.\n       Odai has once been a strong candidate to succeed his \n     father, but he was badly injured in 1996 in an assassination \n     attempt by gunmen who opened fire as he drove his red Porsche \n     through Baghdad. The attack left Odai with a bullet in his \n     spine that forced him to walk with a cane. Younger brother \n     Qusai was instead groomed to succeed Saddam, worsening \n     already uneasy relations between the two brothers.\n       Odai owned Iraq's most widely circulated daily newspaper, \n     Babil, which he used as a platform for regime propaganda, \n     published signed editorials full of bombastic rhetoric. He \n     also oversaw Al-Zawra, a weekly published by the journalists \n     union that he headed, and owned the popular Youth TV.\n       Much of Odai's notoriety abroad stemmed from his position \n     as head of the National Iraqi Olympic Committee, which was \n     accused of torturing and jailing athletes.\n       The London-based human rights group Indict said the \n     committee once made a group of track athletes crawl on newly \n     poured asphalt while they were beaten and threw some of them \n     off a bridge. Indict also said Odai ran a special prison for \n     athletes who offended him. The International Olympic \n     Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, said earlier this year \n     that it was investigating the allegations.\n       One defector told Indict that jailed soccer players were \n     forced to kick a concrete ball after failing to reach the \n     1994 World Cup finals. Another defector said athletes were \n     dragged through a gravel pit and then dunked in a sewage tank \n     so infection would set in.\n       Army officers also were fair game for Odai's outbursts of \n     violence. In 1983, Odai reportedly bashed an army officer \n     unconscious when the man refused to allow Odai to dance with \n     his wife. The officer later died. Odai also shot an army \n     officer who did not salute him.\n       Things were hardly better on the family front, where \n     relations between Odai and his uncles were especially bad. \n     Oadi reportedly divorced the daughter of one uncle, Barzan \n     Ibrahim Hasan, in 1995 after she complained of being beaten. \n     Odai shot and wounded another uncle, Watban Ibrahim Hasan. \n     Both uncles were captured after the war and are in the \n     custody of U.S. coalition forces.\n       While millions of Iraqis suffered dire poverty, Odai lived \n     a life of fast cars, expensive liquor and easy women. When \n     U.S. troops captured his mansion in Baghdad, they found a \n     personal zoo with lions and cheetahs, an underground parking \n     garage for his collection of luxury cars, Cuban cigars with \n     his name on the wrapper, and $1 million in fine wines, \n     liquor--and even heroin.\n       Odai's obsession with sex was evident everywhere: The house \n     was adorned with paintings of naked women and photographs of \n     prostitutes taken off the Internet, complete with handwritten \n     ratings of each.\n       There were bags and boxes of pills and medicines \n     everywhere--ginseng sexual fortifiers, heartburn medication, \n     the anti-depressant Prozac--and an Accu-Rite HIV Antibodies \n     Screening Test Kit was in Odai's office.\n       Nearby was a domed house believed to be the residence of \n     Odai's concubines, a bastion of bad taste with statuettes of \n     couples in foreplay, couches with fluffy pillows and a \n     swimming pool with a bar.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Qusai Hussein, Younger Son of Saddam\n\n       Baghdad, Iraq.--Qusai Hussein, Saddam Hussein's younger \n     son, held wide-ranging powers over the nation's ruthless \n     security apparatus that made him one of the most feared men \n     in Iraq.\n       Qusai is No. 2 on the U.S.-led coalition forces' list of \n     the 55 most wanted men from the former Iraqi regime, behind \n     only Saddam himself. He is also on a Bush administration list \n     of former Iraqi regime members who could be tried for war \n     crimes.\n       Quiet, handsome and every bit as brutal as Saddam, the 37-\n     year-old Qusai headed Iraq's intelligence and security \n     services, his father's personal security force and the \n     Republican Guard, an elite force of 80,000 soldiers \n     responsible for defending Baghdad.\n       He stayed out of the public eye and led a substantially \n     more subdued private life than his older brother Odai, who \n     collected luxury cars by the hundreds and had a habit of \n     ordering his guards to snatch young women off the street in \n     order to rape them. Iraqis nicknamed Qusai ``The Snake'' for \n     his bloodthirsty but low-profile manner.\n       Qusai was far more trusted by his father and appeared to be \n     his heir before the regime crumbled. In televised meeting \n     with top security and military men, Qusai was seated next to \n     his father, wearing well-tailored suits and dutifully noting \n     his father's every word.\n       An exiled dissident told The Associated Press that only \n     Qusai and Saddam's private secretary, Abid Hamid Mahmud al-\n     Tikriti, who was captured in June, were kept informed of \n     Saddam's whereabouts. Odai was thought to be too reckless to \n     be trusted with such information.\n       Experts do not believe Qusai played a significant role in \n     the Gulf War of 1991. But he was a leading figure of terror \n     in the conflict's aftermath, using mass executions and \n     torture to crush the Shiite Muslim uprising after that war.\n       Qusai also helped engineer the destruction of the southern \n     marshes in the 1990s, an action aimed at Shiite ``Marsh \n     Arabs'' living there.\n       The marshes--roughly 3,200 square miles--had provided the \n     necessities of life for tens of thousands of marsh dwellers \n     for at least 1,000 years. The area was destroyed through a \n     large-scale water diversion project intended to remove the \n     ability of insurgents to hide there.\n       Qusai also oversaw Iraq's notorious detention centers and \n     is believed to have initiated ``prison cleansing''--a means \n     of relieving severe overcrowding in jails with arbitrary \n     killings.\n       Citing testimony from former Iraqi intelligence officers \n     and other state employees, New York-based Human Rights Watch \n     said several thousand inmates were executed at Iraq's prisons \n     over the past several years.\n       Prisoners were often eliminated with a bullet to the head, \n     but one witness told the London-based human rights group \n     Indict that inmates were sometimes murdered by being dropped \n     into shredding machines. Some prisoners went in head first \n     and died quickly, while others were put in feet first and \n     died screaming. The witness said that on at least one \n     occasion, Qusai supervised shredding-machine murders.\n       On another occasion, a witness said, an inmate's foot was \n     cut off in prison torture room while Qusai was present. ``The \n     amputation had been carried out with a power saw during his \n     torture under the direct supervision of Qusai,'' the witness \n     told Indict.\n       Qusai was made chief of the army branch for the ruling \n     Baath party in 2000, meaning virtually all the army's \n     movements were under his supervision. Just before this year's\n\n[[Page S9748]]\n\n     war began, he was put in charge of defending the nation's \n     capital and heartland.\n       Qusai was spared any real combat during the 1980-88 Iran-\n     Iraq war, although state television showed him conferring \n     with commanders. He did not do any of the compulsory military \n     service required of most Iraqi men.\n       Qusai wed the daughter of a respected senior military \n     commander. The couple, who later separated, had two \n     daughters.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. First, let's take a look at Qusay Hussein. Qusay was \nNo. 2 on our list of 55 most wanted men from the former Iraqi regime, \nbehind only his father Saddam. He is also on the Bush administration \nlist of former Iraqi regime members who could have been tried for war \ncrimes. Let's take a look at what he did, not only to help control the \nregime but apparently also for his own personal amusement. The AP says:\n\n       Quiet, handsome, and every bit as brutal as Saddam, the 37-\n     year-old Qusai headed Iraq's intelligence and security \n     services, his father's personal security force and the \n     Republican Guard, [which we all know was supposedly] an elite \n     group of 80,000 soldiers responsible for defending Baghdad.\n\n  That was his portfolio in the regime.\n\n       Iraqis nicknamed Qusay ``The Snake'' for his bloodthirsty \n     but low-profile manner. He was a leading figure of terror in \n     the conflict aftermath of the gulf war in 1991, using mass \n     executions and torture to crush the Shiite Muslim uprising \n     after the Persian Gulf war.\n\n  The AP says Qusay also helped engineer the destruction of the \nsouthern marshes in the 1990s aimed at Shiite Marsh Arabs who had lived \nthere for over 1,000 years.\n\n       Qusay also oversaw Iraq's notorious detention centers and \n     was believed to have initiated ``prison cleansing''--a means \n     of relieving severe overcrowding in jails.\n\n  That is a unique way to deal with jail overcrowding--the way they did \nit in Iraq--by eliminating the prisoners.\n\n       Citing testimony from former Iraqi intelligence officers \n     and other state employees, New York-based Human Rights Watch \n     said several thousand inmates were executed at Iraq's prisons \n     over the past several years.\n\n  One of the things Qusay liked to do in overseeing these prison \nexecutions was to feed the prisoners into shredders. The lucky \nprisoners were the ones who got fed into the shredders head first \nbecause they died quickly. The unlucky prisoners were the ones who were \nfed into shredders feet first.\n  This was Qusay Hussein--eliminated by the 101st Airborne yesterday, \nNo. 2 on our list of most wanted from the Saddam Hussein regime.\n\n       Qusay was made chief of the army branch for the ruling \n     Baath Party in 2000, meaning virtually all of the movements \n     were under his supervision.\n\n  This man was a complete monster. Thanks to the 101st Airborne, he is \nno longer able to terrorize Iraqi citizens.\n\n       Let's take a look at Uday, No. 3 on the list, the murderous \n     and erratic oldest son of Saddam Hussein.\n\n  He controlled the propaganda in Iraq and allegedly oversaw the \ntorture of athletes who failed to perform. Talk about an incentive. In \nIraq, if you were an athlete and you didn't measure up, you got to meet \nUday Hussein, No. 3 on the most wanted list, only eclipsed by his \nyounger brother, whose activities I just described, and his father, who \nis No. 1 on the list.\n\n       Uday was head of the paramilitary Fedayeen Saddam unit. \n     Uday helped his father eliminate opponents and exert iron-\n     fisted control over the 25 million people in Iraq. Iraqi \n     exiles tell us that Uday murdered at will and tortured with \n     zeal--\n\n  Murdered at will and tortured with zeal, and routinely ordered his \nguards to snatch young women off the streets--routinely ordered his \nguards to attack young women on the streets--to bring them in for his \npersonal pleasure. So he was raping them.\n  Uday was fascinated with prisoners as well. Like his younger brother, \nhe would order the prisoners to be dropped into acid baths as \npunishment. His tendency toward erratic brutality even eclipsed his \nfather's. That is pretty hard to imagine--that you could be so \noutrageous and so brutal that you could outrate Saddam Hussein. But \napparently that is what happened. He was temporarily banished after he \nkilled one of his father's favorite bodyguards in 1988.\n\n       Much of Uday's notoriety abroad stemmed from his position \n     as head of the National Iraqi Olympic Committee, which was \n     accused of torturing and jailing athletes. The London-based \n     human rights group Indict said the committee once made a \n     group of track athletes crawl on newly poured asphalt while \n     they were beaten, and he also threw some of them off a \n     bridge. Indict also said Uday ran a special prison for \n     athletes who offended him.\n\n  This was Uday Hussein.\n\n       One defector told Indict that jailed soccer players were \n     forced to kick a concrete ball after failing to reach the \n     1994 World Cup finals. Another defector said athletes were \n     dragged through a gravel pit and then dunked in a sewage tank \n     so that infection would set in.\n       While millions of Iraqis suffered dire poverty, Uday lived \n     a life of fast cars and expensive liquor. When U.S. troops \n     captured his mansion in Baghdad, they found a personal zoo.\n\n  The man had his own personal zoo with lions and cheetahs--\n\n     and an underground parking garage for his collection of \n     luxury cars, Cuban cigars with his name on the wrapper, and \n     $1 million in fine wines, liquor, and even heroin.\n\n  This was Uday Hussein.\n  In this country, we rarely applaud the deaths of anyone. But these \ntwo monsters--No. 2 and No. 3 on the list of the regime that we are \ntracking in Iraq--will no longer be able to prey on the citizens of \nIraq for their own amusement. No longer will Iraqis live in fear of \nnight-time visits from the Fedayeen and the secret police. No longer \nwill Iraqi athletes fear being tortured for failure to win a soccer \ngame. No longer will young Iraqi brides be forcibly taken from their \nfamilies on their wedding day to be exploited by Uday Hussein.\n  Knowing what we now know about the Saddam Hussein regime and its \npenchant for brutality, it is abundantly clear that as a result of \nridding Iraq of this evil Iraqi, the world is a better place.\n  Are we finished with the job in Iraq? Not yet. But yesterday was a \nday of great progress. No. 2 and No. 3 are no longer available to prey \non the citizens of Iraq. We believe No. 1--Saddam Hussein--is still \nalive. And we are on his trail. And he will been brought to justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 1328.\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Report.--Not later than March 1, 2004, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to Congress a \n     report that--\n       (1) details that progress made in developing \n     countermeasures for commercial aircraft against shoulder-\n     fired missile systems, including cost and time schedules for \n     developing and deploying such countermeasures, and\n       (2) in classified form and in conjunction with airports in \n     category X and category one, an assessment of the \n     vulnerability of such airports from the threat of shoulder-\n     fired missile systems and the interim measures being taken to \n     address the threat.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think this amendment is very important \nin making sure we stay ahead of the threat that the FBI has identified \nas being very real to our people. I am going to show you what the FBI \nsaid about the threat of shoulder-fired missiles.\n  The FBI said that:\n\n       . . . given al-Qaeda's demonstrated objective to target the \n     U.S. airline industry, its access to U.S. and Russian-made \n     MANPAD systems, and recent apparent targeting of U.S.-led \n     military forces in Saudi Arabia, law enforcement agencies in \n     the United States should remain alert to potential use of \n     MANPADS--\n\n  Those are shoulder-fired missiles--\n\n     against U.S. aircraft.\n\n  First, I want to say how grateful I am to the committee, both Senator \nCochran and Senator Byrd, for really taking the first stand in favor of \nmoving forward on missile defense systems that could be placed on our \ncommercial aircraft to protect them from these shoulder-fired missiles. \nThis is a major breakthrough.\n  When I stood on this Senate floor several months ago, I lost a couple \nof very close votes on this issue, and then won a vote, but this is the \nfirst substantial amount of money we are going to have. I think it is \ncrucial.\n  Senator Schumer and I have led the fight on this issue in the Senate, \nand Congressman Israel and Congressman Mica, in a bipartisan way, over \non the House side. So the first thing I want to say is thank you very \nmuch to the committee for getting us started.\n  I hope we will see the technology now blossom forth because we \nalready have this technology on our military aircraft. We have this \ntechnology on Air Force One. And I think the American traveling public \ndeserves no less protection.\n  What this amendment does--while applauding the fact that we have the \nmoney--is to make sure we are given a report by March 1, 2004, on the \nprogress of developing and deploying such countermeasures so we stay on \ntop of this issue.\n  We also ask--and this is very important because it is going to take \ntime for our aircraft to be retrofitted with these systems--for a \nreport, which would be classified and available to colleagues, on what \nour major airports are doing in the interim before we have these \nsystems placed on aircraft.\n  I also thank Secretary Ridge because at the point in time when I \ntalked to him about this matter--again, it was just after we had lost a \nvery close vote here--I have to say, he recognizes this threat and he \ntook the position that we should move forward. So I want to make sure \nthat thank you is in the Record.\n  I will never forget having a press conference, a bipartisan press \nconference, on this issue with Congressman Mica, who said after he had \na classified briefing on this matter, he had a hard time sleeping at \nnight.\n  Now, here is the reason: Shoulder-fired missiles--such as the SA-7 \nand Stinger missile--are available on the black market for as little as \na few thousand dollars.\n  I want to go to a picture showing, first of all, the way these \nshoulder-fired missiles look. You can see from the picture they are \nvery small. They weigh 30 pounds. It does not take a very strong person \nto be able to lift 30 pounds, and to put that 30 pounds on their \nshoulder. Most can be used with very little training. And they just \ntake minutes to fire. They can go up about 12,000 feet into the air. \nThey basically are heat-seeking missiles and are terribly destructive. \nWe know that for sure.\n\n  We know that more than 20 terrorist groups are in possession of these \nweapons, including al-Qaida. And we know that al-Qaida has shown a \nwillingness to use these weapons as weapons of terror.\n  Al-Qaida is suspected of targeting U.S. military aircraft in Saudi \nArabia last May with an SA-7 missile. Saudi authorities found an empty \nlaunch tube near an air base used by American aircraft.\n  We also know there was an apparent attack on one of our military \naircraft over in Iraq. The good news there is that our C-130s are \nequipped with defense measures. We also know this was an unsuccessful \nattack.\n  So putting it all together, and putting it together with the fact \nthat al-Qaida attempted to bring down an Israeli airliner in Kenya--and \nwe also believe that Israeli airliners are protected with defense \nsystems--it was not successful--but putting all the pieces together, \nthe attack on an Israeli commercial aircraft, the successful attacks \nwhich killed about several hundred people--I will go through that. \nSince 1978, 35 attempts to shoot down civilian aircraft by shoulder-\nfired missiles and a catastrophic loss of 24 planes and 640 deaths.\n  We are not talking about some remote threat. We are talking about a \nreal threat, a real threat that has been played out. The FBI is telling \nus it is a real threat. Today I am happy to say this committee has \nrecognized that, and for the first time. That is the good news. But we \nwant to stay on top of this and make sure these funds are well spent \nand well used and that the proper systems are developed.\n  I want to mention that military transport and refueling aircraft, in \naddition to the C-130 I mentioned, the C-17, KC-135, and KC-10 are some \nof the models that employ countermeasures that could be used for \ncommercial aircraft. The military has conducted thousands of hours of \nflight testing on countermeasure technology, including live fire \ntesting. We know the systems work. We need to start putting these \nsystems on our commercial planes as soon as possible.\n  We all know we have to stay ahead of this terrorist threat. We all \nknow there are cells of terrorists in our country. We all know that \nhomeland security is crucial. Many of us believe it does not have a \nhigh enough priority in this administration, and we will have many \namendments.\n  This amendment, I am pleased to say, has been signed off on both \nsides of the aisle because I think everyone agrees that the $60 million \nhas to be spent well and we need to move forward.\n  I would like to read part of a letter from Ed Adams, chairman of \nNavigant, one of the leading travel management companies in the United \nStates. He says:\n\n       The travel industry is painfully aware of what a successful \n     attack of using a shoulder-fired missile on a commercial \n     airliner could do to the confidence of the traveling public. \n     It is a situation we would prefer not even to imagine, but we \n     must understand the reality of such an event if we intend to \n     prevent it.\n       The blow to the economy in general, and the travel and \n     tourism sector, in particular, combined with the loss of \n     human lives would be staggering. These costs would certainly \n     outweigh the expense of the precautionary measures you are \n     recommending today to make sure that our commercial planes \n     are safe from such a terrorist act.\n\n  We clearly see that what we are doing here is not only the right \nthing to do to protect the lives of our people but also to protect, \nfrankly, the life of our economy, which is not in good shape, which is \nvery rocky, which cannot sustain such an incident.\n  I, again, thank Senators Cochran and Byrd for including these funds, \nand I know that they both signed off on this amendment, which again \nwill simply say, we want a report that lets us know how we are moving \nforward to be able to retrofit these planes with the appropriate kinds \nof measures and also a report--and this is very important--on the \ninterim steps that major airports are taking.\n\n[[Page S9750]]\n\n  I went to one airport. I won't name it. I stood on the top of a roof \nof a garage there. There was no security anywhere around. I looked up. \nThe planes were landing. Honest to God, I could have almost touched \nthose planes. And this is an example of a roof area, A, that should \nhave been patrolled or, B, should be closed. It only makes sense. How \ncan we protect every inch of our airports and everybody? It is very \ndifficult. But we certainly could take steps that make sense, \nprecautionary steps that are really commonsense steps.\n  My thanks again. I wonder if I could ask Senator Cochran if he would \nbe willing to have a voice vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Has the Senator completed her remarks?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have completed my remarks. I wonder if we could just \naccept the amendment. Then I have one more amendment I would like to \nspeak about 6 or 7 minutes on, and then we could lay that one aside.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would like to make some remarks in connection with \nthis amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Wonderful.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from New Hampshire would also like to make \nsome remarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sure, wonderful.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. But not if the Senator has not completed her statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have completed my statement. I didn't know if the \nSenator wanted to move along. I would be happy to yield the floor at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on the subject of antimissile devices for \ncommercial aircraft, the Senate should be advised that the statement of \nmanagers on the supplemental that was passed earlier this year directed \nthe Under Secretary for Science and Technology of the Department of \nHomeland Security to prepare a program plan for the development of an \nantimissile device for commercial aircraft. In response to that \ndirective, the Department of Homeland Security has developed a program \nplan.\n  On May 22, 2003, this plan was submitted by the Under Secretary for \nScience and Technology of the Department of Homeland Security to the \nCongress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that plan be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Program Plan for the Development of an Antimissile Device for \n                          Commercial Aircraft\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       The House Report accompanying Public Law 108-11, which was \n     signed by the President on April 16th, 2003, directed the \n     Undersecretary for Science and Technology of the Department \n     of Homeland Security to prepare a program plan for the \n     development of an antimissile device for commercial aircraft. \n     The plan should identify the process for delivery and \n     certification of a prototype and the proposed cost and \n     schedule for such an activity. The report should be provided \n     to the Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       A review of available technologies conducted by the White \n     House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in \n     coordination with the Homeland Security Council, identified \n     an on-board jammer (directed infrared countermeasure, or \n     DIRCM), as the most promising of the technologies they had \n     reviewed. It is the intention of the Department of Homeland \n     Security to explore this option while being open to other \n     potential concepts that may not have surfaced or been fully \n     explored by the OSTP study.\n       The DIRCM concept has been under development for some time \n     by the Department of Defense for protection of military and \n     other government aircraft. In addition, there is a small \n     market for business jets. There are currently two known \n     contractors engaged in DIRCM development: Northrop-Grumman, \n     and BAE.\n       There are several issues associated with the DIRCM concept, \n     as well as with other potential antimissile concepts, that \n     the Department of Homeland Security proposes to explore in \n     the program plan described below; these include:\n       System cost, including component, integration, and \n     certification;\n       Airframe & avionics integration and FAA certification \n     issues;\n       Performance against the current and emerging threat;\n       Reliability and failure rate;\n       Maintenance, including built-in testing, handling, and \n     special ground support equipment needs;\n       Operating and support costs;\n       Concept of operations, including air crew involvement, go/\n     no-go doctrine, and airport operational procedures.\n       In addition, a Broad Agency Announcement released May 16 by \n     the Department of Homeland Security under the auspices of the \n     Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) explicitly requests \n     proposals for options for protection of aircraft from the \n     man-portable missile threat. Given the program plan described \n     below, it is envisioned that the TSWG solicitation will \n     likely lead to awards for concept development, thereby \n     requiring significant research and development.\n\n\n                              program plan\n\n     Strategy\n       The strategy for research, development, test and evaluation \n     of an antimissile device for commercial aircraft is to issue \n     a solicitation for a Systems Development and Demonstration \n     program, with potential awards to one or more contractors. \n     Prior study has indicated that the DIRCM concept is the most \n     likely path for providing good performance against the \n     current and emerging threats while potentially satisfying \n     operational constraints. One or two contracts will be awarded \n     for system development and demonstration of a DIRCM. However, \n     the solicitation would also allow responses for concepts \n     other than DIRCM, with a single award contemplated should an \n     alternative likely to meet performance, operational, and cost \n     constraints be offered.\n       Each contractor would have to design, develop, demonstrate, \n     and deliver 2 units for demonstrating system performance \n     (with emphasis on operational suitability and cost). For the \n     DIRCM concept, system design and fabrication for both the \n     countermeasure system (common for all aircraft types) and the \n     canoe (an aerodynamic conformal pod peculiar to the aircraft \n     type) would have to be completed. Other concepts would be \n     required to complete similar activities. Integration onto \n     only one aircraft type would be required in the SD phase. \n     To understand the potential operating and support (O) \n     procedures and costs, a detailed O plan would be a major \n     part of the contract deliverables. Various Test & Evaluation \n     (T) activities will also be required to include as \n     appropriate wind tunnel, reliability, tracking accuracy, \n     hardware-in-the-loop and live fire testing and operational \n     suitability (e.g. environmental testing and maintainability \n     to include built-in testing, handling, and special ground \n     support equipment). A parallel FAA certification effort, \n     coinciding with the SD phase would also occur.\n       The program would be developed and managed in consultation \n     with the airline industry, pilots, airport operators, \n     aircraft developers, and relevant Federal agencies.\n     Program cost/schedule\n       Fiscal year 2003 plans are to create a special government \n     staff office to manage the effort, with an initial task of \n     preparing a solicitation to industry for research, \n     development, test and evaluation of an antimissile device; \n     this effort will be managed within the Science and Technology \n     Directorate (S) of the Department.\n       Fiscal year 2004 activities will be to award contracts to \n     develop system costs; analyze aircraft integration issues; \n     and through modeling and simulation assess performance \n     against the current and emerging MANPAD threat. Contractors \n     will be asked to develop an operations and support plan that \n     details the maintenance and logistical support requirements \n     for the system they are developing, and an analysis of the \n     recurring operating and support costs. Contractors and the \n     government will work with the community to develop viable \n     operational concepts for the use of the system. Finally, if \n     analyses indicate cost effectiveness and operational \n     suitability, development of a prototype for each viable \n     concept may be initiated to prove out the analyses. S would \n     not seek additional or supplemental funding for this effort.\n       Contingent on the analytic, design and developmental \n     efforts conducted in fiscal year 2004, fiscal year 2005 \n     activities could include the completion of the test articles \n     and their integration onto a single airframe type, along with \n     hardware in the loop and live fire testing to validate \n     performance assumptions.\n       Costs quoted below are informed by contractor estimates for \n     the DIRCM RDT phase, along with estimates provided by \n     Department of Defense representatives to the OSTP study. \n     Further development of program RDT costs will be conducted \n     by the system program office during FY03.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. What the Department has agreed to undertake is to bring \ntogether the best information from the private sector, our experience \nin the defense area for military defense against anti-aircraft \nmissiles, and to come up with a rational approach to making such \nantimissile devices available to the commercial airline industry.\n  We have provided in the committee report $72 million for critical \ninfrastructure protection to utilize information and scientific \nadvances that have been made to deal with evolving threats to protect \ninfrastructure security. Of this amount, $60 million is allocated for \nsystems development of antimissile devices for commercial aircraft. \nThis is provided and printed on page 62 of our committee report.\n\n[[Page S9751]]\n\n  These funds will be available to carry out the work contemplated in \nthe amendment of the distinguished Senator from California. In her \namendment, she asks for another report to be submitted to the Congress \nby the Secretary of Homeland Security not later than March 1, 2004, to \nreport on the progress made in developing these countermeasures for \ncommercial aircraft. We have no objection to including this provision \nin the bill. We expect that we are going to have reports made \nperiodically. We have hearings to review the activities of the \nDepartment, and this is certainly going to be a subject that we are \ngoing to follow closely.\n  It is because the Congress has made a strong point of emphasizing the \nimportance of deploying these defensive measures as soon as possible \nthat the Department has now undertaken a specific plan and approach to \ndoing this in a rational way. The Senate may remember that some wanted \nto require the Department to make available immediately missile defense \nsystems to be put on commercial airlines. We found that was not \nworkable. The Congress did not insist on that point. In fact, \namendments on that were defeated when they were offered earlier in this \nbody.\n  But this is a program now--and the Senator from California has been a \nleader in bringing attention, keeping the pressure on--to see that we \ndo this in a rational and an immediate way, with some sense of urgency. \nWe have also noticed in the amendment, which we appreciate, that the \nSenator calls on a classified report to be made available to the \nCongress as well, assessing the vulnerability of certain airports, the \nlargest airports in our country, from the threat of shoulder-fired \nmissile systems and the measures being taken to address that threat. We \nlikewise have no quarrel with that part of the amendment and are \nprepared to recommend the Senate accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I believe one of the most challenging \ntasks put before the Department of Homeland Security, and before the \nappropriators were allocating funds for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, is to understand evolving technologies and to take steps to \nuse those technologies to keep the public safe. I think that is a \ndifficult task because, whether we are looking at homeland security, or \ninformation technology, or any other area, we are never sure exactly \nwhere technological developments are going to take us. It is always \ndifficult to understand the best and most cost-effective ways to use \ntechnologies--in this case, to keep the public safe.\n  I commend the members of the subcommittee and Chairman Cochran for \nthe work they have done throughout the process on their bill but in \nthis area in particular--to take the steps necessary to bring \ntechnologies into place in a way that will keep the public safer. The \nprocess that they used, as well, I think is commendable. They worked \nwith the Department of Homeland Security, with the Under Secretary for \nScience and Technology, to develop a program plan for looking at the \ncurrent state of technology to deal with the potential threat of \nsurface-to-air missiles, and then to allocate funds to further study \nand evaluate, develop systems and adapt the technology for the \npotential use on commercial aircraft. They have appropriated a \nsignificant amount of funding, up to $60 million. Again, for that I \ncommend the committee.\n  They have really taken the steps necessary that will allow us to best \nunderstand how this technology might be deployed. It is very difficult \nto predict what the nature of all the threats to our commercial \naircraft industry might be. There is no question, perimeter security at \nour Nation's airports has improved dramatically since September 11, and \nthat has helped reduce any potential threat from shoulder-fired \nmissiles. But we want our Department of Homeland Security to be \nresponsive, to take the steps necessary to adapt and to use this \ntechnology, if possible, to protect commercial aircraft. I think that \nis exactly what they have done.\n  I appreciate the work by the Senator from California to highlight \nthis issue in the amendment she has offered, which will be accepted by \nthe subcommittee to make sure Congress is well informed as to the \nprogress of this development effort and this research effort.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the committee on this \nissue. I thank them for their funding, and I am happy to support the \namendment of the Senator from California.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, to complete the record on this issue, I \nam going to read into the Record the statement of managers from the \nconference report, dated April 12, 2003, making emergency supplemental \nappropriations for the fiscal year 2003. In that statement of managers, \nthe conferees said:\n\n       The conferees direct the Under Secretary for Science and \n     Technology to prepare a program plan for the development of \n     an antimissile device for commercial aircraft. The plan \n     should identify the process for delivery and certification of \n     a prototype and the proposed cost and schedule for such an \n     activity. The report should be provided to the Committees on \n     Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of this Act.\n\n  As I mentioned in my earlier statement, we are pleased that the \nreport was made available. We have now submitted that for printing in \nthe Record to complete the statement that should be made in the Record \nto accompany this amendment.\n  I know of no one who objects to this amendment. I think we can adopt \nit on a voice vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we are ready to proceed to a \nvoice vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California.\n  The amendment (No. 1328) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the committee very much. I cannot \ntell you how much I look forward to the day that the Department has \nagreed on a particular system, and that we can begin the installation \nof the system I think will send a very good message to the flying \npublic. We will stay on top of this until we see it through.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1331\n\n    (Purpose: To investigate the expenses caused by Secret Service \n                              activities)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send a second amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1331:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  .\n\n       Not later than March 1, 2004, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security shall issue a classified report to Congress on the \n     security costs incurred by State and local government law \n     enforcement personnel in each state in complying with \n     requests and requirements of the United States Secret Service \n     to provide protective services and transportation for foreign \n     and domestic officials.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know that each of us wants to do \neverything we can to help our first responders--the men and women who \nare called to duty as a result of a Federal action. Well, one of the \nareas where our local people have just been left out to dry all through \nof the years--this is not a partisan issue, whether in a Democratic \nadministration or a Republican one--is that they have to pay the costs \nof security details when a leader comes into the State, be it a \ndomestic leader like the President, a Presidential candidate, the Vice \nPresident, or their families, or a foreign dignitary.\n  It is really critical, it seems to me, particularly in light of the \nrough economic times that our States are seeing,\n\n[[Page S9752]]\n\nthat we begin to address this issue. I was a little stunned when I got \ninto this after a constituent talked to me about this. I was stunned to \nlearn that there is really no place in the Federal Government where we \nhave this information.\n  The Secret Service does its job brilliantly. They don't worry about \nthe cost to the local people. They call up the local people and say \nthat a Cabinet Secretary is coming, or a foreign dignitary, or the \nPresident, or a candidate, and this is what they need. They need A to Z \nand they lay it out. Guess what. The cost is borne by our local \nagencies at home.\n  So simply, my amendment requests a report from the Department of \nHomeland Security on expenses incurred by local police as a result of \nSecret Service requirements.\n  We all know, when there is an orange alert, what happens in our \nhometowns, because we also know when there is an orange alert--that \nmeans a heightened state of alert--if there is a problem, people don't \ncall the President or the Senate or the House; they call 911. We know \nthat is what happens.\n  Right now, even in this bill, as far as it goes, I don't think it \ngoes far enough to help our people. Here is a whole other matter that \nwe have never really looked at. As we see that our police departments \nand fire departments are facing layoffs, it seems to me that we need to \ndo something to help them. As a first step to do that in an area that \nhas never been looked at, I think we ought to look at what happens to \nthe various agencies.\n  I have a very detailed letter from the California Highway Patrol. \nThey detailed all the expenses that they had from 2002 to 2003. I am \nnot going to go into every detail of every hour, and I am not going to \nput that in the Record because Senator Cochran informed me, through his \nstaff, that the Secret Service doesn't want this to be public \ninformation. I find it very odd, frankly. I don't think it should be a \nclassified issue. But if the Secret Service says they need it \nclassified, so it shall be. However, I will tell you that the aggregate \ncost in that 1 year just for the California Highway Patrol, in 69 \ndifferent details they were ordered to do, was $700,000. That may not \nseem like a lot by the standards we face here, but I can assure my \ncolleagues, in my State, every dollar now makes a difference. Sometimes \nthese agencies may get reimbursed, but they usually do not, and the \nburdens of these requests are adding up. They add up in additional \novertime and transportation costs that these agencies cannot afford.\n\n  We want to know: How big is this number? I think it would be very \nimportant for every one of our States because every one of our States \nhosts these dignitaries and we want to do what is right, and we will do \nwhat is right, but let's find out because we do care about these \nunfunded mandates, what it is costing our people.\n  I am not in any way being critical of the Secret Service. They are \ndoing their job, and they do it extremely well, but they are not acting \nalone in these cases. They are calling local police. Simply put, we \nwant to find out the costs and the burdens on our States. I have no \nidea what it would be. I just have this one letter that details one \narea of costs, and, I might say, it is an off election year. In this \nelection year coming up, we are not only going to have the President, \nhis entourage, his family, and the Vice President, but we are going to \nhave the Democratic nominee and his or her entourage, I have to say, \nand family. These are major costs. It is not fair to our people not to \ntry to reimburse them for these costs.\n  Again, this amendment will start the ball rolling. In some ways, I \nwanted to write an amendment that just said our local people should be \nreimbursed right now for all the expenses they face when Secret Service \nsays to them: You must provide these many cars and these many police \nand this much protection. But I wanted to lay the groundwork for \neveryone because, as I say, I think when we get the report back, every \none of us will be impacted because at least most of the States are \nreceiving these calls from Secret Service all the time. In my case, for \njust one agency, it is $700,000 for 1 year, 69 details.\n  I am very pleased both Senators Cochran and Byrd have agreed to have \nthis amendment. We made a couple of changes at the request of Senator \nCochran to keep these numbers classified. Again, I have problems with \nunderstanding why the aggregate number has to be kept classified. I do \nnot see what anyone learns if they find out an aggregate number. We \nhave an aggregate number for the Secret Service, so I do not know why \nwe cannot have an aggregate number of what the costs are to our States. \nBut that is a fight for another day. We do not have to pursue that at \nall today. Today, I am very pleased we will take the first steps toward \ngetting this information.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment and ask that the \namendment be laid aside. At the time Senator Cochran thinks is \nappropriate, I will be happy to have a vote on it at that time. Is it \nappropriate, Mr. President, that I ask for the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I, frankly, think this amendment is \nunnecessary and unnecessarily burdensome on the Secret Service, but I \nam not going to vote against it and the Senator insists on a vote on \nthe amendment. I am going to vote for it and suggest all Senators vote \nfor it. We have suggested, and the Senator has agreed, to modify her \namendment to require the Secret Service to issue a classified report to \nCongress on security costs incurred by State and local government law \nenforcement personnel in complying with requests and requirements of \nthe U.S. Secret Service to provide protective services and \ntransportation for foreign and domestic officials.\n  The amendment, first off, is to have a report, a public report in the \naggregate of all of these expenses. There were concerns--and I share \nthose concerns--about the fact that potential terrorists or those who \nmight be planning to do harm to the public officials who are protected \nby the Secret Service and the families of public officials, such as the \nPresident of the United States and his family, and visiting foreign \ngovernment officials who come to our country on official business, are \nafforded protection, and those who are accompanying them.\n  The Secret Service is the primary Federal agency that has this \nresponsibility. What this amendment first sought to do was to require a \nreport of the aggregate costs associated with protection of officials, \nincluding State and local law enforcement officials who cooperate with \nthe Secret Service to help ensure the success of the protection \nmission.\n  I am not sure how the Secret Service is going to compile all of this \ninformation, but they, I am sure, will undertake to do it if we adopt \nthis amendment and say they ought to do it. All they can do is ask for \nState and local governments to submit to them the information that is \nrequested in this amendment and then compile it, give it in a \nclassified report to the Congress, and it would be made available in \nthat form to all Senators.\n  I am hopeful the Senate can proceed to a vote on the amendment. I \nhave not checked with the leadership to see whether or not there is any \nobjection to proceeding to a vote right now. I have no objection to it. \nI do not know of any objection, but we will check with the leadership \nto be sure we can proceed. If not, we can set, by agreement, a time for \na vote later in the day. Until we get that advice, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I withdraw my suggestion for the quorum \ncall if the Senator wants to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I wanted to thank Senator Cochran for \nhis support, although not enormous support, but support for this \namendment. Senator Cochran, I want to address your comments, and I \nthank you for your support, although I say not the most enthusiastic, \nbut nonetheless I am very appreciative.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is not enthusiastic at all. I said I disagree with \nthe amendment, and I think it is unnecessary. But I am willing to go \nahead and adopt\n\n[[Page S9753]]\n\nit and urge the Secret Service to try to comply with it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What I said was your support was not enthusiastic, but I \nappreciate it nonetheless. I wanted to answer your point that you were \nworried about how to collect this information. I want to tell you that \nour States have very clearly documented----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order. The Senator \nshould direct her comments to the Chair, not to other Senators. I think \nthat is the procedure in the Senate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to do that, Mr. President. I wanted to mention \nto Senator Cochran, because he made some criticism of how we would get \nthese numbers, that it was very easy for the highway patrol in my State \nto compile the numbers because all of our States are in a budget crunch \nand they all have to document the numbers in their States.\n  So all the Secret Service has to do, or Department of Homeland \nDefense, is to simply ask our States for these numbers. I can assure \nthe Senator from Mississippi that our States are reeling, they are \nhurting, and it would be very simple for them to do this.\n  I have not placed this letter into the Record because of the concerns \nof the Senator that these numbers should be classified. I do not agree \nwith that, but I respect it. So I am not going to place this in the \nRecord.\n  The bottom line is it would be very simple for our States to document \nthese numbers, and I hope I am proven right. I will discuss this with \nthe Department of Homeland Security because clearly the purpose of my \namendment is not to cause anybody any extra trouble. It is simply to be \nfair to our States, our police departments, and our first responders.\n  Again, I want to thank Senators Byrd and Cochran for agreeing to this \namendment. The reason I want to have a record vote on it is clear. This \nis the first time we will ever be asking that this be documented. So I \nwanted to have a solid vote on it so it would not get lost in the \nshuffle. I have no need to speak any further. I am most appreciative \nthat both of these amendments appear likely to be agreed to.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Boxer \namendment be set aside. We are advised that there is a ceremony that \nwill be taking place momentarily in the Rotunda. The leadership of the \nSenate will be involved in that and maybe other Senators as well. The \nSenator from Washington has an amendment she would like to offer, and I \nthink we could entertain her amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1327\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1327.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for emergency management performance \n                                grants)\n\n       On page 65, line 9, strike ``$165,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$265,000,000''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, first, I commend the managers of the \nhomeland security appropriations bill for doing an excellent job of \ntrying to put together a bill under very difficult circumstances where \nwe have a budget resolution that really does limit our ability, I \nbelieve, to make sure we have in place good security for all of our \nconstituents, no matter where they live in this country.\n  Everywhere I travel, people have different concerns, whether it is \ntheir seaports, trains, borders, infrastructure that easily could be a \ntarget of terror. The managers of this budget have worked hard to put \ntogether a package, but today I offer an amendment because I believe \neverything we are trying to do in this bill to improve homeland \nsecurity will be undermined if our local communities do not have solid \nemergency response plans.\n  Let me say that again because it is so important. Everything we are \ntrying to do in this bill to improve homeland security will be \nundermined if our local communities do not have solid emergency \nresponse plans.\n  When a disaster strikes in one of our communities, we know the phone \nwill ring at the desk of some local emergency manager, and when that \nphone call comes in, if there is not a plan that is ready to go to deal \nwith that emergency, we are in trouble. Even if we are able to provide \nall of the equipment and training that our first responders need, if \nthere is not an effective plan at the local level to coordinate a \ndisaster response, then we have all failed to protect our citizens.\n  I introduce an amendment to ensure that the emergency planners in \nvirtually every county and every community in America will have the \ntools they need to lead our response to a terrorist attack or other \ndisaster. My amendment will provide $100 million for emergency \nmanagement planning grants, and it has broad support. My amendment has \nbeen endorsed by the Council of State Governments, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National League of Cities, the National \nEmergency Management Association, and the International Association of \nEmergency Managers. Those endorsements say a lot. Those endorsements \nmean our leaders at the city, county, and State levels all recognize \nthe need for this amendment.\n  Those endorsements say the emergency managers who work to protect all \nof our communities are asking support for this amendment.\n  One of the least talked about but most important parts of our \nresponse to a disaster takes place outside of the public view. In every \ncounty and major city in this country, there is an emergency response \ncoordinator who works behind the scenes preparing for the worst. They \ndetermine what the needs are in our local communities. They develop \nplans so if there is a tornado or a natural disaster, there is a game \nplan for everyone to follow. Those plans coordinate the work of many \ndifferent agencies and organizations and they really are the backbone \nof our emergency response.\n  In one community, the emergency coordinator might be the fire chief. \nIt might be the sheriff. In another community there might be a \ndedicated person who handles emergency planning exclusively. No matter \nwhat their title is, they perform a very critical job. They make sure \nwe have an effective coordinated plan to prepare for and respond to in \nan emergency.\n  For decades, they worked hard to prepare for natural disasters, \ndeveloping plans to respond to tornados, earthquakes, floods, and \nwinter storms. Today, they have a massive new responsibility to deal \nwith. Today, they have to develop plans to respond to manmade disasters \nand plans to respond to terrorist attacks. They have to come up with \nstrategies for handling scenarios that we would never have imagined \njust a few years ago.\n\n  Our local emergency planners have a massive new responsibility, but \nthey do not have the funding to carry it out. This is not an area where \nwe can afford to skimp or to cut corners. If, God forbid, there is a \nsmallpox outbreak somewhere in our country, the phone is going to ring \nat the desk of the local emergency coordinator. When he or she picks up \nthe phone, either they have a plan to respond to smallpox or they do \nnot. There are no two ways about it.\n  If, Heaven forbid, a dirty bomb goes off somewhere in our country, \neither there is a game plan to follow on the shelf, tested, ready to \ngo, or there is not. I want to make sure when that phone call comes, we \nare prepared, wherever we live in this country. Right now, we have a \nvery long way to go. Trust me, my colleagues do not want\n\n[[Page S9754]]\n\ntheir emergency planner in their community to have to choose between \npreparing for a natural disaster or preparing and planning for a \nterrorist attack. They need to plan for both.\n  My amendment would give them the resources they need to meet these \nnew homeland security threats. Simply put, our communities have to \nbuild a brand new capability from scratch and they need Federal help.\n  Turning to the specifics of my amendment, my amendment would provide \nan additional $100 million to the existing emergency management \nperformance grants. These are the grants that allow our emergency \nmanagers to meet the needs in their local communities. I want to note \nthat funding for these grants has been stagnant for about a decade. The \nunderlying bill does provide some funding for these grants, but it is \ncertainly not enough to allow our communities to create this new \ncapability from scratch. In fact, in March of 2002, a survey conducted \nby the National Emergency Management Association identified a $200 \nmillion shortfall for the EMPG Program that has continued to grow.\n  Emergency planning grants have been around for about 10 years, and \nthey are now the backbone of our emergency response system. They are \nfunded on a 50/50 formula. Half the funding comes from our local level \nand half the funding comes from us at the Federal level. These grants \nfund the local emergency management offices that build our State and \nlocal emergency capability, and they provide the foundation for our \nfirst responders.\n  In Washington State, without these grants many of our smaller and \nrural communities would not have had the resources to develop their \nemergency response plans. So these grants have been critical in helping \nour communities prepare over the years. Today, these grants are the \nbest vehicle to meet the new challenges because they are flexible.\n  Emergency management planning grants are flexible, allowing local \ncoordinators, those people on the ground, to use them where they will \ndo the most good for their community.\n  Emergency managers can use these grants for local planning, first \nresponder training, emergency preparedness exercises, personnel, \noperational activities, equipment, early warning systems, public \ninformation education, mutual aid, and other preparedness response and \nrecovery activities. All of these options are available to local people \non the ground, local emergency managers under this grant program.\n  Some people may claim we can combine this grant program with others \nand that dedicated funding does not really matter. But that is not \ntrue. If we combine this with other grant programs, we will force \nemergency planning and coordination to compete with equipment and other \nimportant priorities. We should be helping communities meet all of \nthese needs, not pitting one against another so communities come up \nshort. Our local communities need both equipment and planning, and we \nneed to fund both. The emergency management planning grant is the right \ntool to empower the emergency planners in your community to meet their \nlocal needs.\n  Since September 11, we have asked the local emergency managers in \nevery county in America to develop new coordinated plans to respond to \nterrorist attacks. We have asked them to take on this critical \nresponsibility, but we have not provided the funding they need. My \namendment will provide an additional $100 million in flexible grants to \nmeet the needs from coast to coast.\n  If our communities do not have solid emergency response plans, then \nthey are really not prepared for a disaster. That is a price we cannot \nafford to pay. Our ability to respond to a terrorist attack or other \ndisaster is only as good as the emergency response plans in our local \ncommunities. If we buy all the equipment but never develop the plans, \nwe are not safe. If we send our firefighters to training but we never \ncoordinate our response to an attack, we are not safe. We do not want \nour communities to have to choose between preparing for tornadoes or \npreparing for a smallpox attack. We are asking them to prepare for \neverything. They need the funding to do that.\n  This amendment has been endorsed by the Council of State Governments, \nthe National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, \nthe National Emergency Management Association, and the International \nAssociation of Emergency Managers.\n  If there is a terrorist attack on our country again, the phone is \ngoing to ring at the desk of some local emergency manager. One of two \nthings will happen: Either they will have a solid emergency plan for \nthat disaster, know what to do, know what decisions to make; or they \nwill not and Americans will pay the price.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment so one day when that \ndesperate phone call comes, the person who answers that phone, wherever \nthey are, will be ready to lead an effective response. Each of us has \nthe power to make sure our communities in our States are ready.\n  I urge all colleagues to support the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in connection with the Senator's \namendment, the President's budget as submitted to the Congress proposed \neliminating the emergency management performance grants program. This \nwas a program that had been administered by the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. It is a program that provides funds to States to \nhelp prepare to deal with responses that have to be made at the local \nlevel to disasters that occur.\n  The reorganization of the Department of Homeland Security folded into \nthis new Department the agency previously referred to as the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. It is now part of Homeland Security.\n  This emergency performance grants program was recommended for \ncancellation by the administration's budget. They recommended combining \nit with a State and local grant program within the Office of Domestic \nPreparedness. Our committee looked at that and decided this program was \nan important program to the States and it should be continued in \neffect. So we have funded it as a program that is administered by the \nEmergency Preparedness and Response Directorate.\n  The amendment the Senator is offering does not complain about what \nthe committee has done with respect to their recognition of this \nprogram as an important program for assistance. The only thing her \namendment complains about is the level of funding. Since it was \ndisestablished, in effect, in the budget, there was no funding for that \nactivity. We put $165 million in it to continue the assistance program \nand improve the level of support that the Federal Government gives to \nStates for this purpose.\n  Her amendment basically says: That is not enough money; we should \nhave added $100 million more. Her suggestion is, instead of $165 \nmillion, this program ought to be funded at $265 million.\n  The problem is, there is no offset recommended in the Senator's \namendment. Therefore, the amendment would violate the Budget Act. It \nwould put us over the allocation that the committee has under the \nBudget Act. Therefore, at the appropriate time it will be my intention \nto make a point of order against the amendment for that purpose and for \nthat reason.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWashington for offering this amendment.\n  First, I compliment the able Senator for the great work she does on \nthe Appropriations Committee. She has been a stalwart in the \nAppropriations Committee from the beginning of her career. In so doing, \nshe follows in the steps of two great Senators from Washington with \nwhom I served many years ago: Scoop Jackson and Warren Magnuson. \nMagnuson served on the Appropriations Committee just as Patty Murray \nserves on that committee. Those were very forceful Senators, very \nactive Senators.\n  I knew Magnuson well, he being on the Appropriations Committee, as I \nsay. But I knew Scoop Jackson even better. He was my supporter from the \nbeginning of my career as a Senator who was involved in the leadership, \nfirst as Secretary of the Democratic Conference and then as Democratic \nwhip and then as the leader. Scoop Jackson was always there. I should \nsay in passing that the best whip the Senate ever had was the Senator \nwho exceeds Robert Byrd, and that Senator\n\n[[Page S9755]]\n\nis Harry Reid. He and I were alike in this respect: He is always on the \nfloor. So was I, always on the floor.\n  But Patty Murray is a supporter on the Appropriations Committee. She \nworks hard. She is a Senator who certainly attends to her \nresponsibilities with respect to her State, and she is also a Senator \nwho has a national viewpoint. I think she exceeds all of us on my side \nof the aisle with respect to our work on the transportation matters, \nand I compliment her for that. She is following in that train of \nactivity when she supports this amendment which she has brought to the \nattention of the Senate. I thank her for offering the amendment.\n\n  The administration proposed to consolidate the Emergency Management \nGrant Program into a single first responder program. She has spoken to \nthis already. So has the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee who \nmanages this bill today from that side of the aisle. He, likewise, \nmentioned this in opposing the amendment. So the proposal of the \nadministration is a result of a fundamental misunderstanding of the \nEmergency Management Grant Program.\n  I am not saying that the distinguished Senator from Mississippi \nmisunderstands it. He understands it well and he provided for it in the \ncommittee. I compliment him for that. But the Emergency Management \nGrant Program is the one Federal program that gives States resources to \nplan for what is called ``all hazards'' emergency management planning. \nThat is exceedingly important. We must plan for responding to a \nterrorist attack but that does not mean we should lose the capability \nto plan for floods, tornadoes, and other natural disasters.\n  I am very keenly aware of this, being from the Mountain State of West \nVirginia, where those clouds hover over the high mountains and where \nthe steep hills enable storms to flow rapidly down those sharp \nmountainsides into the valleys, often narrow valleys, and create \nextremely dangerous hazards for the people who have to live in those \nvalleys and others who have to travel through those valleys and into \nthose valleys to work.\n  I strongly support the amendment by the distinguished Senator from \nWashington. This is a proven program and I thank Chairman Cochran for \nagreeing to keep this as a separate program in the committee bill. This \namendment would provide $100 million in addition to the funding in the \ncommittee bill.\n  I, again, compliment the distinguished Senator from Washington for \nher excellent work on the committee on behalf of her State and on \nbehalf of the Nation, and I compliment her on offering this amendment \ntoday. I strongly support it. As I say, it means a great deal to the \npeople of my State, to their safety and their welfare. I hope all \nSenators will support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are prepared to suggest to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, if we could get consent, we would \nask that votes on the Boxer amendment or in relation to the Murray \namendment occur at 12 noon today. We are hoping we can get consent. I \nthink it would be good for us to do that. We could vote on one \namendment and then I think a motion to waive the point of order that I \nmade would be the vote that we would have on the Murray amendment.\n  If the Senator would consider this: I ask unanimous consent that at \n12 noon today the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Boxer \namendment, No. 1331, to be followed by an immediate vote in relation to \nthe Murray amendment, No. 1327, provided further that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided for debate prior to each vote and that no \nsecond degrees be in order to the amendments prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have checked this with Senator Byrd. He \nhas no objection. Therefore we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator and I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1331\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nevenly divided prior to a vote on the Boxer amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I start by thanking the chairman and \nranking member for their support of this amendment.\n  Basically, we have a wonderful Secret Service unit in our Federal \nGovernment. They are very professional and they do a wonderful job in \nprotecting our dignitaries, both foreign and domestic--whether it is a \nPresident, Vice President, a Presidential candidate, the Vice \nPresident, their families, or the head of a foreign power. It is \nabsolutely a fact that they are the best there is.\n  A lesser known fact is that when those dignitaries visit our States--\nArkansas, California, Missouri--our law enforcement personnel are asked \nto help the Secret Service and, of course, they do it. But they don't \nget reimbursed for the cost of doing that. This is beginning to sting \nour people at home.\n  My amendment will simply let us know the extent of the problem. I \nhave a letter from the California Highway Patrol, and they tell me that \nlast year they spent over $700,000.\n  I hope we will have a unanimous vote on this. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, as I said when the amendment was \nproffered by the Senator from California, we were pleased that she had \nagreed to make some changes in the amendment and that we would accept \nthe amendment if those changes were included. She asked for the yeas \nand nays on the amendment.\n  I have further said that I thought the amendment was unnecessary and \nI don't know how the Secret Service is going to comply with the terms \nof the directive in the amendment. That is up to them. It seems to me \nthey can make an effort to obtain the information sought by this \namendment, which is the operating costs of the State and local law \nenforcement officials who are asked to cooperate with the Secret \nService when they provide protection for visiting foreign government \nofficials, or the President and his family, or for others whom they are \nobligated under the law to protect.\n  They were worried that if they made this available in an unclassified \nform, it might put in jeopardy some of the very people they were trying \nto protect because they would disclose the steps they were taking to \nassure their protection. I am sympathetic with that observation. That \nis why we urged the Senator to make this a classified report. But it \nwould be available to Senators.\n  I have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 79, nays 19, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 292 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--79\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n\n[[Page S9756]]\n\n\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--19\n\n     Allard\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Hatch\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Thomas\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n       \n  The amendment (No. 1331) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1327\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes evenly divided prior to \nthe vote on the Murray amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the amendment before the Senate simply \nadds $100 million for emergency management planning grants. The \nPresident's proposal under homeland security combined these grants with \nother programs. The Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the \ncommittee, rightfully separated this back out to where it was.\n  Unfortunately, the funding for this has remained static for the last \ndecade. Since September 11, every county, every city across this \ncountry has had an additional responsibility in planning not just for a \ntornado or earthquake or national disaster but to have an emergency \nplan in case of a terrorist attack--very different planning, very \ndifferent understanding, very different concerns. It is critical we \nhelp our local communities have a plan in place so when a call goes to \na desk after a terrorist attack, people have a plan in front of them \nand know what to do and there is not pandemonium.\n  This amendment simply adds $100 million. By the way, the people \nacross the country in emergency management say they are $200 million \nshort in this area. We simply add $100 million for our planners across \nthis country to be prepared for a terrorist attack.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I make a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the Murray amendment \nprovides spending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the pertinent sections of \nthat Act for the purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to waive the \nBudget Act on the Murray amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Maine wishes to speak for \n10 minutes on the bill. Following her statement, Senator Dayton will be \nready to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Democratic assistant leader \nfor his assistance in this matter.\n  Madam President, I rise today to express my strong support for the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Act, which will help us to better \nprotect communities across America.\n  I congratulate Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran for putting together \na bill that fairly balances the many responsibilities of the Department \nof Homeland Security. I also thank Senator Stevens for his leadership \nin bringing this legislation to the Senate floor.\n  This legislation, I believe, will give Secretary Ridge, State and \nlocal officials, and first responders the tools they need to build a \nmore effective homeland security structure.\n  Protecting this vast and diverse Nation is an enormous task, but our \npeople--from Washington, DC, to the small border communities in \nnorthern Maine--have the skills, ingenuity, and the spirit to get the \njob done.\n  On March 1 of this year, the foundation for this new structure was \nlaid as 22 separate Federal agencies and Departments were merged into \nthe new Department of Homeland Security.\n  Creating a new Department is, however, just a start. Each State has \nits own security challenges, and every community has its own needs. My \nhome State of Maine must protect a long and remote stretch of our \nnorthern border. Our enormous coastline is lined with small harbors, \nthree deep-water cargo ports--one of which is the largest tonnage port \nin all of New England--and two ports that regularly welcome passengers \nfrom around the world. We have two international airports in Maine, one \nof which played a most unwelcome role in the events of September 11.\n  This legislation will provide more than $29 billion in fiscal year \n2004 to fund the Federal Government security efforts and to help each \nof our States meet its particular needs. It includes $8.2 billion to \nprotect our Nation's borders, including funding for an additional 600 \nborder agents and the development of innovative new security \ntechnologies.\n  I am pleased that under the leadership of Senator Cochran the \nAppropriations Committee has provided more than $60 million for the \nContainer Security Initiative. I know from a hearing held by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which I chair, that this partnership \nbetween the Department of Homeland Security and our shipping industry \nto target high-risk containers will help to better protect our ports \nfrom terrorist attacks.\n  The legislation also provides more than $5 billion for the \nTransportation\n\n[[Page S9757]]\n\nSecurity Administration, including $1.8 billion for passenger screening \nand $150 million for port security grants. These grants provide \nimportant security upgrades to help protect an industry that is \nabsolutely vital for our economic prosperity.\n  I am pleased that Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd have \nagreed to many of the suggestions I have forwarded to them for \nupgrading our Nation's Coast Guard. This legislation provides $6.8 \nbillion for Coast Guard operations, including $702 million for the \nIntegrated Deepwater Systems Program, which is vital to helping the \nCoast Guard carry out its traditional missions even as it meets its new \nand enhanced responsibilities for homeland security.\n\n  This legislation also maintains our commitment to America's first \nresponders--our police officers, our firefighters, our emergency \nmedical personnel--who are on the front lines of the war against \nterrorism.\n  As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have made \nhelping first responders a top priority. The needs of our first \nresponders are as varied as the communities they protect. If there is a \nlocal emergency, citizens do not call Washington, they call 911. It is \nour first responders who are truly on the front lines in protecting our \ncommunities and in responding to any sort of terrorist attack.\n  The $3.6 billion for the Office for Domestic Preparedness, including \n$1.75 billion for State and local homeland security grants and $750 \nmillion for fire grants, is vital to the success of our first \nresponders. These programs will provide them with better communications \nequipment, more firetrucks, and more exercises in training to do what \nthey do best--prevent and respond to terrorist attacks and other \nemergencies.\n  But appropriating the funds, while essential, does not complete the \njob. We must also get these funds where they are needed quickly and \nefficiently. I have spoken to officials from communities around the \nState of Maine, to the mayor of Baltimore, and to officials throughout \nthe Nation about the existing grant programs to assist our first \nresponders. They are grateful for the grants, but frustrated by the \nbureaucracy, the time-consuming, complicated, and rigid application \nprocess, and the mountain of paperwork.\n  After holding several hearings on this topic in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I introduced, with a number of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of \n2003. This legislation would provide a steady ongoing stream of funding \nto each and every State. It will simplify the grant process. It will \npromote flexibility in the use of homeland security funds so they can \nbe targeted to the greatest need. I urge the Senate to pass this \nlegislation which has been reported unanimously by the committee. This \nwill help us streamline and strengthen the way we provide assistance to \nthose on the front lines.\n  Finally, I add my strong support for the $3.6 billion included in \nthis legislation for the Emergency Preparedness and Response \nDirectorate, including $2 billion for disaster relief and $153 million \nfor the Emergency Food and Shelter Program.\n  As with any appropriations bill, one can argue about funding levels \nor that a certain program deserves more money than another. That is \nalso true with this legislation. For example, I would like to have seen \nmore funding for first responders and port security. But given the \nconstraints on the Federal budget, I believe the managers of this bill, \nthe chairman and ranking member, have done an extraordinary job. This \nlegislation spends homeland security dollars in an effective, efficient \nmanner. By providing more training and equipment to our first \nresponders, more equipment and funding to secure our ports, and \nadditional resources to protect our borders, this legislation gets the \nmaximum benefit out of the Federal budget, out of the Federal resources \navailable with the constraints under which we are operating.\n  Again, I congratulate the chairman, Senator Cochran, and the ranking \nmember for putting together an excellent piece of legislation that \nfairly addresses the diverse needs of our States and communities. I \nurge quick passage of the legislation so that the Department of \nHomeland Security and those throughout our homeland can continue to \nwork together more effectively on the crucial tasks that lie ahead as \nwe seek to better secure our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine for her leadership as chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in helping shape the legislation that created this new \nDepartment and in monitoring its activities and keeping up with how \nthey are going about managing their responsibilities.\n  Legislation has already been reported out of that committee, for \nexample, that deals with such issues as formulas for dividing money \namong agencies and sharing money with State and local governments. \nThese are very important challenges the committee faces because they \nare the committee of jurisdiction of homeland security. We are just \nsimply providing the funds and trying to allocate it within the terms \nof a budget resolution, trying to maintain an awareness of the \nimportance of holding down the deficit, being responsible, making sure \nthe funds we invest in these activities are used wisely and efficiently \nand effectively. We want them to really count. We want to be sure we \nare upgrading the quality of our capability of responding to national \nemergencies, manmade and natural disasters as well.\n  It is a big challenge. There is no end to the list of ways we could \nspend more money in trying to do that. We are guided by the legal \nauthorities laid out by the Committee on Governmental Affairs. We \nappreciate so much the guidance and leadership of the distinguished \nSenator from Maine in this effort. I commend her very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations subcommittee for his generous and kind comments. He has \nbeen wonderful to work with on this issue, as every other. We are very \nfortunate to have him leading this essential subcommittee.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1336\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I send to the desk amendment No. 1336.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1336.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for procurements in \n                 contravention of the Buy American Act)\n\n       On page 75, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. 616. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be obligated or expended for the \n     procurement of any articles, materials, or supplies in \n     contravention of the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a et \n     seq.).\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment reaffirms that all money \nappropriated under this bill will be spent in conformity with the Buy \nAmerican Act. It is an amendment which passed the House and will be \nincluded in that bill.\n  As my colleagues know, the Buy American Act was established in 1933 \nand has been in force since then, with only two substantive amendments \nduring that entire 70 years. It is an economic stimulus legislation. It \nis meant to encourage the purchase of goods made by Americans in \nAmerica, using American materials and labor.\n  I cannot think of a more suitable time for this to be honored than \nnow, with over 3.1 million jobs lost in the private sector of the U.S. \neconomy since this administration took office. I will repeat that \nstaggering number.\n\n[[Page S9758]]\n\nOver 3.1 million Americans have lost their jobs in the private sector \nof our economy since January 2001.\n  So it is entirely appropriate that we use public dollars that are \nbeing appropriated for essential public purposes such as homeland \nsecurity but that we also add a perfectly legitimate public purpose, \nwhich is to generate as many jobs as possible through the expenditure \nof those funds in the United States of America.\n  There are exceptions in the existing Buy American Act to permit the \npurchase of goods or services if these conditions apply. The head of \nthe procuring agency, in this case Secretary Ridge, could waive these \nrequirements if he determines they are inconsistent with the public \ninterest, which means he has broad latitude and discretion to determine \nthat, for any legitimate reason, this act should not apply to a \nparticular purchase.\n  Second, if it is unreasonable in cost. If the domestic product is of \nan unreasonable cost, then a foreign product can be purchased.\n  Articles that are purchased for use outside of the United States, or \narticles that are procured for military bases, leased from foreign \ngovernments, are not covered under the act, or if they are not produced \nor manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably \navailable commercial quantities or of satisfactory quality.\n  There is latitude to assure that none of the intent of this \nappropriation, which the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, \nthe Senator from Mississippi, and his colleagues have assured, that \nwould require any compromise with the intent of providing the maximum \npossible protection to our fellow citizens. But it does say that, when \npossible, we will be consistent with that intent if we are also trying \nto provide American jobs.\n  Why is this necessary if it is already in law? This administration \nhas demonstrated that it is not particularly a fan of this particular \nact. The Secretary of Defense in the Defense authorization bill--the \nArmed Services Committee, of which I am a member--was successful in \ngetting the application of that act significantly weakened as it \napplies to the Department of Defense and the military branches. I do \nnot want to see that happen with the Department of Homeland Security. \nThis is an opportunity for Congress to make it very clear that this act \nwill be enforced; that we expect it to be followed; that we want it to \nbe utilized wherever possible because we want to put Americans back to \nwork.\n  I know in my home State of Minnesota, the greatest imperative for the \nwell-being of our citizens, as well as the recovery of the Minnesota \neconomy and the budget crisis our State is going through, comes down to \njobs--jobs, jobs, and jobs; American jobs; good paying, hopefully \nbenefit-providing, pension-providing American jobs. That is what this \namendment reinforces. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this provision is carried in the Treasury \nappropriations bill in the section on general provisions. Even though \nthis amendment is not necessary to be on the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, I have no objection to it being carried \non this bill as well. So we are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his acceptance of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1336.\n  The amendment (No. 1336) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1341\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1341.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To provide funds to increase maritime security)\n\n       On page 49, line 2, strike ``$150,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$450,000,000''.\n       On page 66, line 9, strike ``$823,700,000,'' and insert \n     ``$523,700,000,''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be delighted to read the amendment: On page 49, \nline 2, strike ``$150 million'' and insert ``$450 million''; and on \npage 66, line 9, strike ``$823,700,000'' and insert ``$523,700,000.''\n  What happens on page 49? We add $300 million to the port security \nprovision to which everyone has attested that they support. When we \nasked Secretary Ridge about more money, in that they had not proposed \nanything in this particular Homeland Security bill, he said, well, that \nis in the critical infrastructure section. So that is where we take it \nfrom as an offset on page 66, line 9, strike the $823,700,000 and \nreduce it by $300 million.\n  This ought to be an easy amendment for everyone to support in that, \nNo. 1, we all voted for way more money when we passed the authorization \nfor port security the year before last. We had 100 votes, all \nRepublicans and all Democrats. And then we had the urgent \nsupplemental--incidentally, that authorized $4.2 billion. We are not \ntalking in those terms at all.\n  Actually, the Coast Guard surveyed 47-some major ports--there are 362 \nports and 5,000 facilities--but there are 47 port areas with which we \nreally are concerned. In those port areas are some 500 different \nfacilities. So at that particular time, we said to the Commandant of \nthe Coast Guard, give us a study and find out exactly what is needed. \nHe came up with a $7 billion figure at that particular time.\n  So we are not at the $7 billion that has already been requested and \nfound needed by the Commandant of the Coast Guard, not the $4.2 billion \nauthorized at the time we passed port security legislation and we \nactually provided $1.2 billion. We had an amendment for $1.2 billion. \nIt was defeated in the urgent supplemental, but when we looked at the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, the administration did not \nrequest anything under port security. When asked about it, they said \nthat is in the critical facilities section, and that is why we take \nfrom the $823 million this necessary $300 million.\n  Why do I say it is necessary? Right to the point, the interim rule \nrequires the submission of security plans by December of this year. I \nwill limit my comments to the 47 port areas and not the 5,000. This is \nrequired by all 5,000, but like first responders I think we will all be \naround for quite some time before we get the first responders outfitted \nas they should be. But here we know of the threat, and of the 47 port \nareas, they are without any approved plan within 1 year from July 1. \nAnd they must have the plans submitted in 6 months' time because by \nnext July 1, if they have not been approved, under the bill the Coast \nGuard has the authority to close the port.\n  What has happened is the ports have all gotten together. The captain \nof the port under the Coast Guard is the responsible official. He has \nhad to get the Immigration Service. He has had to get the Customs \nService. He has had to get the Drug Enforcement Service. He has had to \nget local law enforcement. He has had to get the local public \nfacilities, port facilities. He has had to get the private port \nfacilities. This young officer out of the Coast Guard has had to \ncorrelate it all, working together to get a master plan for the \nsecurity of that port area, and submit it by the end of this year--\nwithin 6 months time.\n\n  When he submits it, of course, the Coast Guard itself has to approve \nor disapprove the plans coming in from all over, from 362, but \nparticularly these 47 ports, and they have to begin to implement them.\n  In terms of a major port in Houston, TX, Long Beach, CA, Seattle, WA,\n\n[[Page S9759]]\n\nPhiladelphia, PA, we are talking sense now, we are not talking \npolitics, if we think we need a little bit more in our area for port \nfacilities. I am in pretty good shape where I am in Charleston, SC. \nSince they closed the Navy yard there, I suspect al-Qaida would be \nlooking for a more ripe target. They would be looking at Philadelphia, \nfor instance.\n  What could happen? We know Osama bin Laden, according to Lloyd's of \nLondon, has control of some 20 vessels. He actually owns some 10 \nvessels and he has control of an additional 10. So he has control of \nsome 20 regular vessels, what you might call rust buckets. It was one \nof these that went into a port in Kenya 3 years.\n  What happened was that particular ship docked at the port in Kenya. \nThe terrorist crews jumped off, went and blew up the American Embassy \nin Nairobi, and went over into Tanzania and Dar Es Salaam and blew up \nthat embassy, got back on the ship and boarded, and we have not been \nable to find them since.\n  That tells me--and I used to represent the ports in South Carolina--\nwhat we have is not just the ship but we have ship crews available to \nal-Qaida. Osama bin Laden can easily get three to four. He does not \nhave to send them to flight school in Arizona or send them down to \nFlorida. He has them. They are experienced tanker crews. These three or \nfour experienced tanker crews could work their way into a good Exxon or \nTexaco or Unocol or other oil company, a Chevron tanker, come with that \nShell tanker into the port of Philadelphia, up the Delaware River, and \njust before they reach port, the three or four could throw the captain \nover, take control of the ship, and ram it right into the tank farm, \nand blow it up.\n  Booz Allen Hamilton did a study; and if there was a major terrorist \nact at the ports, we would have to close down the eastern seaboard. The \nstock market would have to close. We are talking serious business. And \nhere it is that we, as a public body, have set the responsibility with \nthe Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, and the \nHomeland Security Department. We have said come up with plans and have \nthem ready and approved by this time next year, but at least submit \nthem and have them gone over with, starting in December of this year. \nThat money is needed--not the $4.2 billion authorized. I don't know of \nany more critical thing.\n  I worked on Homeland Security with our distinguished chairman, \nSenator Cochran. Actually, I had the U.S. entry and exit program. That \nwas under my Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State. I am totally \nfamiliar with the FBI, the Immigration Service, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, and many of these particular customs. But this \nparticular port thing is real because it is mammoth and it is a way to \nclose down the economy for a year to 2 years on the east coast. There \nis no question. Go into Houston, TX, and you have ruined the south. We \nwould have to start rationing. Go into Long Beach, CA, and you have \nclosed down the west coast area.\n\n  I worked with all the committee members as best I could. I said there \nis no other place to find funds, other than what Secretary Ridge \nhimself indicated when we asked why they didn't submit an amount for \nport security itself. He said it already is in the critical \ninfrastructure facilities program. So we take that money out of there, \nand we get it an offset. Of course, working on the committee, that \nreally takes us to some need that is denied in any other area. We can \nincrease that amount. We will be working with an increased amount, \nhopefully, when we get to conference on Homeland Security.\n  As the distinguished chairman and ranking member know, we must have \nmore money in Homeland Security. We must have more money in our little \nCommerce, Justice, State bill that has been cut $910 million, way below \nlast year. We could not go into conference with our House friends and \nformulate a bill and take care of the FBI and all of the other \nagencies. Just yesterday, the FBI was increased in this year, $410 \nmillion on the House side. I believe if you proposed that amendment in \nthe next 10 minutes on the floor of the Senate, it would receive an \nalmost unanimous vote. We do not want to cut from the FBI that is \nenforcing laws against crime.\n  FBI Director Mueller is doing an excellent job fashioning domestic \nintelligence efforts. We never wanted to have that in America, \nparticularly after the McCarthy days and the House un-American \nActivities Committee. We said, learn and study and make absolutely \ncertain that we are not spying on each other and having a domestic \nintelligence service. Now, with the war on terrorism, we need it. That \nhas to be funded.\n  This is for just a modest request of the billions and billions \nincluded for fighting the war on terror. The former Commandant of the \nCoast Guard and now the head of the Transportation Security \nAdministration, Admiral Loy, is doing an outstanding job.\n  We had a debate within the committee to try to get a sufficient \namount just for the transponder tower. An airplane cannot approach the \ncoastline of the United States of America without us identifying it. We \ncannot do that with respect to shipping. We are trying our best to use \nsome overhead satellites, but we need to put up the towers.\n  Once the towers are there, then we can require the vessels themselves \nto install the transponders.\n  As of this moment, we have to get these plans and we have to get them \nmoving. The communities are moving. They are ready, willing, and able. \nThey are submitting some of these plans already at the Coast Guard \noffice in the Transportation Security Administration. But we do not \nhave the money to follow through. This is an unfunded mandate of our \nown that we want to at least set aside this particular amount, not to \nsolve all of the ports problems by any manner or means, not to solve \nall the docking facilities' problems. That would be impossible. You \ncould not spend that amount of money in 1 year's time. But at least we \nwill need these funds in fiscal year 2004 to follow through to get port \nsecurity in America. The fiscal year begins in a couple of months time, \non October 1. It is critical.\n  I yield the floor and I am glad to respond to any questions or \ncomments anyone has.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina has raised an interesting question with the amendment that he \nhas offered. He proposes to add $300 million for the Port Security \nGrant Program administered by the Transportation Security \nAdministration and to take that money from another part of the bill--\n$300 million from the Information Analysis and Infrastructure \nProtection Directorate. This is the Directorate that has the \nresponsibility to conduct assessments of critical infrastructure to \nprotect cyber-security in that structure, and to provide the ability to \ndeal with the Threat Alert Advisory System.\n  The total provided in the bill for Information Analysis and \nInfrastructure Protection would be reduced from $823.7 million to \n$523.7 million. I am advised that this would deal a severe blow to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security efforts to provide the assets needed to \nprotect our Nation's critical infrastructure.\n  Let me also observe that this was an amount that was included in the \namendment we dealt with yesterday offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, although in the amendment offered by the \nSenator from West Virginia, he would have increased port security \ngrants by $460 million.\n  The amendment of the Senator from South Carolina proposes to increase \nit by only $300 million.\n  But let me put in context what a substantial increase that is and \nwhat a difficult time the Transportation Security Administration would \nhave in wisely and thoughtfully disbursing those grants to ports \nthroughout the United States.\n  Let me illustrate that by suggesting that we already have $100 \nmillion in the bill for next year's spending. But we already \nappropriated $365 million in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Of the $365 \nmillion already provided by Congress to the administration for these \npurposes, only $260 million has been obligated by the administration.\n  So we have a proposal to add $300 million on top of an account where \nwe have $105 million that is unobligated.\n\n[[Page S9760]]\n\nHow much we can spend is a question we can ask, but we must also ask \nhow much we can spend wisely in a coherent and thoughtful way.\n  If you are a port director out there and the word goes out that the \nTransportation Security Administration now has over $400 million to \nspend for these grants, you better get a grant application in. If you \nget it in quickly, you will probably get it approved whether you need \nit or not, or whether it is a good request or a thoughtful request.\n  I am not suggesting anyone would send in something like that, but the \nwhole point is if we create an atmosphere where there is a rush to \nWashington for the money and there is more money up there than they can \nspend and the word goes out across the country to that effect, we are \nnot contributing to national security or to homeland security; we are \ncontributing to the disarray that this agency would be in in trying to \ndeal with the applications in a thoughtful and careful way.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will look very carefully at this proposal. I \nsuggest it should be rejected. I don't think we are going to measure \nthe success of this bill with whether or not we spend as much as we \npossibly can but whether we have spent what we need to spend this next \nfiscal year. Of course, more money is going to be needed later. You \ncan't do it all in 1 year. They haven't been able to spend the money we \nappropriated last year.\n\n  Think about that. Now we are going to add $300 million more to a $150 \nmillion account.\n  I just think this is piling money. It is going to create a big pile \nof money and maybe create a false impression of security. Appropriating \nthe money is not going to improve our security. It is the things we do \nwith the money and how it is spent according to a national plan.\n  I am hopeful we can monitor as we go along how the administration is \nspending the money. It would be good to know from the Transportation \nSecurity Administration why they haven't been able to get the money out \nthat we previously appropriated. What is the reason for that? It would \nbe good for us to be able to describe that now. Maybe somebody from the \nTransportation Security Administration can call us and tell us why they \nhaven't spent it. That may help us put this amendment in context.\n  But I am hopeful we will help ensure before we appropriate an amount \nlike this that the Transportation Security Administration is able to \nmake the assessments and judge the quality of the grant applications \nthat it receives to be sure the money is being disbursed where it needs \nto be disbursed as a matter of national security priority.\n  I don't think we have the capacity in the Congress to decide the \npriorities among the different ports. Obviously, some port directors \nhave suggested they need more money than they are getting--that the \nmoney that is available is not enough.\n  I am sure the reason behind this amendment is the impression somebody \ncreated.\n  But I am not sure we have the information available to us right now \nthat is convincing enough to take $300 million away from infrastructure \nassessment and analysis and shift it from one Directorate to another \nDirectorate. We may be undermining a very essential part of the effort \nof planning and assessing priorities and establishing priorities if we \nmove $300 million from one account to the one suggested.\n  I am not sure we can say or we have the evidence that we are now \nretargeting the money in a way that is consistent with our overall \nnational plan. The administration says they don't want this amendment \napproved. They do not want the $300 million shifted in the way that the \nSenator from South Carolina suggests.\n  I think we should give them the benefit of the doubt. I am not the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. I don't spend all day every day working \nto discharge the responsibilities that Secretary Ridge has, that those \nwho work with him have, and the heads of the Directorates who have been \ngiven the power and the responsibility to manage the authorized \nactivities that we put into law when we created this new Department. We \nhave a lot of other things to do.\n  I am on five subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee. We have \nto deal with the Interior Department's funding. We have the Department \nof Agriculture.\n  My friend from South Carolina has served as chairman of the State, \nJustice, and Commerce Appropriations Subcommittee. There are a lot of \nother areas that you have to become familiar with and concentrate your \nattention on to discharge your own responsibilities as a member of this \ncommittee. The Homeland Security Subcommittee is just one of 14 \ndifferent subcommittees that we have in the Appropriations Committee.\n  The point I am making is that we have to give credit to the \nadministration and those people who have been appointed by the \nPresident and selected by Secretary Ridge to help them carry out these \nresponsibilities in developing a national plan, assigning priorities in \nsubmitting a budget request, and defending it in hearings before our \ncommittee.\n  I think we have done a reasonably good job of trying to assess how we \ndivide the money that has been allocated to our subcommittee. Everybody \nwants more money. There is no doubt about that. I haven't had a single \nrequest saying don't give us the amount of money we asked for in the \nbudget resolution. The impression you get from everybody is that they \ncould use more money. But how much more?\n\n  Mr. President, $300 million is a lot more for this one agency, this \none administration entity, the Transportation Security Administration, \nover and above what we put in the bill, and more than they have been \nable to spend in the last fiscal year. The fiscal year is almost up. We \nare well into the year 2003 and they have over $100 million they have \nnot obligated.\n  Let's give them $150 million for this next year. We will monitor \ncarefully the use of those funds. We will monitor the needs that are \nsubmitted in the form of grant applications from around the country. We \nwill ask them to give us a report as to why they are choosing some \napplications for approval and funding over others, what are the \ncriteria.\n  But to come in now and say, we know better than what they are doing, \nwe know better than what they are suggesting, we know better than what \nthe administration is asking for, to the tune of $300 million for this \none agency, I think is too much, is going to hurt one agency to try to \nhelp another. And we just do not have the facts to support it.\n  So with great reluctance, I urge the Senate to vote against this \namendment. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina. He is one of my best friends. I have \nadmired him a long time. I know he has approached this in a thoughtful \nway, and it hurts me to say I just think he is wrong and I believe we \nought to defeat the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I appreciate the complimentary remarks \nbut you can't any better describe the Senator's resistance and \nobjection to the amendment other than as fanciful. He goes off into all \nof the committees. It is very interesting to hear him in opposition to \nthis amendment say that we have five subcommittees. Each of us have \nfive subcommittees on the Appropriations Committee. There is nothing \nnew about that. Yes, that is what it is, the appropriations for the \nentire Government.\n  Here is some $29 to $30 billion we are expending for homeland \nsecurity. I am talking about one particular section where they have \nfacilities-based critical infrastructure. When asked, Secretary Ridge \nsaid: Well, that's the way it is. We are going to take care of it. We \nare going to take care of it. But when we received the budget, it was \nnot taken care of.\n  I am not guessing with figures. The $300 million is just a minuscule \npart of the $1.7 billion request sitting on Admiral Loy's desk. I wish \nhe would call up and get his staff to work and find out the facts.\n  We started off with $1.2 billion, and the ports came in reuqesting \n$1.7 billion. Well, it takes the Coast Guard and it takes the \nTransportation Security Administration some time to look over, in \ndetail, these particular submissions of $1.7 billion. This amendment is \njust to get it started with $300 million.\n\n[[Page S9761]]\n\n  To say that we would create an atmosphere of waste, that we would \ncontribute to disarray, that we may be undermining the process--come \non. What nonsense is that? Here we worked on this thing in a bipartisan \nfashion. We had 100 Senators--all Republicans and all Democrats--\napprove $1.2 billion. The Coast Guard itself comes in and says, in \norder to meet the request, the needs for port security, it is going to \nbe at least $7 billion.\n\n  They have on their desk, as I speak, $1.7 billion in requests. And he \nsays, we don't have the information and that this might contribute to \ndisarray. Come on. Disarray? It contributes to security. He said it \nwould be undermining the process and contribute to insecurity. I never \nhave heard such an argument in my life, when we have the actual facts \nand we minimized the request that we know is absolutely needed.\n  They can vote it down. We are not the Mother Superior Security around \nhere. But I do have a conscience about this issue because I worked with \nall sides of the aisle. I worked intimately with Admiral Loy. I work \nnow with Admiral Collins of the Coast Guard. I have been to the ports. \nWe have had, under the leadership of Senator Breaux of Louisiana, field \nhearings to all of these particular ports and everything else.\n  We don't really begin to get true security but this is just the \nminimal requirement to get the process out and working. He says they \nare wisely, thoughtfully disbursing. That is exactly what we are doing, \ntrying to get the disbursement of the funds there. They are hanging \nback because they can't get the studies made, and everything else, and \ncan't go out and examine the ports, and what have you. They don't have \nall of the personnel. They don't even have the towers up for the \ntransponders.\n  You could talk for the rest of the afternoon about the needs of the \nCoast Guard. They are the best agency we have in the Government for the \nmoney we spend. I can tell you that right now. The Coast Guard is \noutstanding. They have said: Our appraisal now is for at least $7 \nbillion. And that was last year at this time. They have requests on \ntheir desks for $1.7 billion and all we are asking for is $300 million.\n  We hear how we all have five subcommittees and every subcommittee \nwants more money, and this is just asking for more money because we \nhave a subcommittee. Come on. That is not responsive at all.\n  I hope the Members will act in the security of the ports of the \nUnited States and approve this particular amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Mr. Hollings.\n  The Coast Guard estimate on the first year cost of implementing the \nport security standards was $1.1 billion. That was the Coast Guard \nestimate: $1.1 billion. Let me say again, that was the Coast Guard \nestimate.\n  Let's see how much we provided.\n  Previously appropriated: $365 million; the committee bill, $150 \nmillion; the Hollings amendment, $300 million--making a total of $815 \nmillion. So $815 million, even including the amount in the \ndistinguished Senator's amendment, is still well short of the $1.1 \nbillion that the Coast Guard estimated would be the first year cost.\n  I note that the Department received over $1 billion of applications. \nSo the Department can spend this money. It can spend this money well. \nThe only reason that the Department has not spent all of the money that \nwas approved by Congress last year is that the administration refused \nto spend the money. They did not get their act together and agree to \nspend the money until Congress directed them to do so in the April \nsupplemental.\n  We are talking about national defense here. We are talking about \ndefense of the homeland. We are talking about homeland security. That \nis the most important part of national defense: defense of the \nhomeland. Oh, we spend $1 billion a day for national defense, not \nincluding homeland security--$1 billion a day, a total of $368 billion \nfor this next fiscal year. That is $1 for every minute--I am looking at \nmy watch--that is $1 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. I \nhave already been speaking for a minute. It takes me 5 minutes to say, \n``Good morning, how do you do?'' But $1 per minute for every minute \nsince Jesus Christ was born.\n\n  We spend $1 billion a week in Iraq. We invaded a sovereign state \nwithout being provoked to do so. That sovereign state did not attack \nus. But under the preemption doctrine of the Bush administration, we \nattacked, we invaded a sovereign state that had not provoked us, that \nhad not attacked us and was not and never has been, never has \nconstituted an imminent threat to the security of the United States.\n  I voted against that resolution on October 11 of last year. I am \nproud I did so. I don't back up one centimeter in the statements I made \nat that time when I said that contrary to what the Bush administration \nwas saying, contrary to what the President of the United States was \nsaying, Iraq did not constitute an imminent threat to the security of \nthe United States. It didn't then. It doesn't now. And it hasn't at any \npoint in between. I said it then. I say it again. Yet we are spending \n$1 billion a week in Iraq. We ought not to have been there. We ought \nnot to have sent our people over there. But we can save that for \nanother day.\n  I am a minuteman when it comes to discussing that subject. If I had \nbeen living in 1775, I would have been one of the members of Captain \nParker's minutemen who assembled on the green of Lexington. No, we had \nno business sending half of the combat-ready brigades in our Army, half \nof the total number of brigades. We have 33 brigades; half of them, 16, \nare in Iraq. And then we talk about spending money here to protect our \nports, and it is too much money to spend? No.\n  I compliment the Senator from South Carolina on his amendment. We are \ngetting men killed over there daily, on the average of one a day in \nIraq. How long, how long are we going to continue to spend $1 billion a \nweek in Iraq? How long are we going to see the body bags of American \nmen and women coming back from Iraq, a war that we should not have \nfought? There was no reason to fight that war.\n  Now, with respect to the amendment, the Coast Guard has estimated \nthat it will cost the ports $5.4 billion during the next decade to \nimplement Maritime Transportation Security Act standards, including \n$1.1 billion this year. Yet the President did not request one dime for \nport security. This amendment would increase port security grant \nfunding from the $150 million contained in the bill by $300 million. \nThis would provide a total of $450 million for this program.\n  As I noted yesterday on my amendment, the Commandant of the Coast \nGuard testified before the House authorizing committee, on June 3, \n2003, about the implementation of the Maritime Transportation Security \nAct legislation. He said:\n\n       The regulatory impact on the Maritime industry will be \n     significant, and the time line for implementing the new \n     robust maritime security requirements is exceptionally short.\n\n  However, the administration, while aggressively supporting Federal \nsecurity funding for the aviation industry, has failed in four straight \nspending requests to include a single penny for port security grants, \neven though 95 percent of all non-North American U.S. trade enters our \n361 ports around the Nation. This year, the Transportation Security \nAdministration received over $1 billion of applications from the ports \nfor limited funding that was approved by Congress last year. There \nclearly is a demand from the ports for help to harden physical security \nto reduce the Nation's well-documented seaport vulnerability.\n  The Hollings amendment addresses what many experts view as the \ngreatest vulnerability in the Nation's defenses here at home. During \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security hearings last \nyear, one witness, Stephen Flynn, noted that the Nation's seaports are \nthe only part of an international boundary in which the Federal \nGovernment invests no money in terms of security.\n  ``Most ports,'' said Stephen Flynn, ``the best you can get is a \nchain-link fence with maybe, maybe some barbed wire.'' That was Stephen \nFlynn testifying before our Appropriations Committee in April a year \nago.\n\n[[Page S9762]]\n\n  Who is Stephen Flynn? Well, let's see. Stephen Flynn was testifying \nbefore the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations. Stephen Flynn is a \nsenior fellow, a Ph.D. senior fellow, national security studies, \nCouncil on Foreign Relations. He said he had just retired from the \nCoast Guard after 20 years of service the previous March 15. And he had \nassumed the position as the Jeane Kirkpatrick Senior Fellow for \nNational Security with the Council on Foreign Relations.\n  He concluded his testimony by saying this, calling attention to the \nneed for security at our ports:\n  This is a problem of the very first order. This is not a low politics \nissue. This is a problem that should not just be keeping me awake at \nnight. This should be one that the Secretary of the Treasury, the \nSecretary of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative, and certainly the \nPresident of the United States should be deeply concerned about because \nwhat we are talking about is the sustainability of global commerce and \nthose on-ramps and off-ramps at our ports, and they do not have \nsecurity right now.\n  So there you are. It should not only be keeping these eminent \npersonages awake at night, it should be keeping us Senators awake at \nnight. And it may do so at some point. I hope not.\n  Madam President, I laud the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \non his amendment and on his statement in support of the amendment. He \nis not a Johnny-come-lately on this matter. He is the ranking Member of \nthe Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and on \nour Appropriations Committee he is a man of great seniority and \nexperience. He has been chairman and is now ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State. So he lacks nothing when it \ncomes to experience. He is from a State that has great seaports. He has \nbeen talking about this particular matter for many months. So I salute \nhim and I again compliment and thank him. I support his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I want to express my strong support for \nSenator Hollings's amendment to strengthen security at the Nation's \nseaports.\n  Improved seaport security is an absolutely essential part of homeland \nsecurity. Many of the Nation's ports are woefully insecure and are \nlocated in or near densely populated urban areas. A weapon of mass \ndestruction could be delivered by a cargo ship and unleashed on tens of \nthousands of Americans before authorities could react.\n  Such an attack would also be trouble for the economy. A major \nincident at one of the Nation's largest seaports could have a dramatic \nimpact on the flow of goods in and out of the country, which could in \nturn weaken the already soft economy.\n  Florida's 14 deepwater seaports handle roughly $47.6 billion of \nwater-borne commerce each year. That figure represents almost two-\nthirds of the State's international trade in 2002. Florida's seaports \nhandle roughly 115 million tons of international and domestic \ncommodities as different as cars, apparel, steel, bananas, petroleum, \nand computer products.\n  Most of these goods pass into the country uninspected, because the \nNation's ports lack the manpower and technology needed to inspect every \ncontainer. In fact, only 1 to 2 percent of all cargo coming into this \ncountry is inspected. That is unacceptable.\n  What can we do to solve this problem?\n  The Coast Guard estimates the total costs of implementing security at \nstate-owned and private seaport facilities will exceed $7 billion over \nthe next 10 years. We should acknowledge the Coast Guard's expertise by \nallocating a significant portion of the $7 billion they recommend is \nnecessary to tackle this problem. And we need to commit to providing \nthe remainder in a timely manner.\n  In short, we can't address the port security problem soon enough. The \n$262 million already allocated by DHS is a modest start, but the \ncommittee's fiscal year 2004 commitment is not sufficient. \nShortchanging our ports this year will only slow the process of \nupgrading the Nation's port security enhancements over the long term.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement appear in the Record prior \nto the vote on the Hollings port security amendment to H.R. 2555.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the statement has been made by the \nchairman that the administration opposes this. I wonder. I will go \nright to the text of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on \nIraq. A few comments are necessary when you say the administration was \nsaying various things to get us into the war in Iraq. Now we find out \nnot just one swallow makes a spring, but one 13-word sentence got us \ninto the war. We heard that in 45 minutes Iraq could launch a chemical \nattack. We heard about the aluminum tubes.\n  We had the distinguished Secretary of State at the U.N. with photos \npointing out that there they are, can't you see? You knew he was a \njudicious and careful witness up there. You had--well, of all things, \nnot just the yellowcake from Niger in Africa, you had the Vice \nPresident of the United States, Dick Cheney, say just days before the \nattack in Iraq that they had indeed reconstituted nuclear. And I worked \nwith the Presiding Officer in Transportation, which I will get to in a \nminute, when she was Secretary of Transportation.\n  But getting right to this particular point, I didn't have any fear \nabout any imminent attack on the United States or maybe an imminent \nattack in the Mideast, on our friend Israel. Israel doesn't have time \nto play games. If you have ever been there--the numerous times I have \nbeen there, with an air alert, within minutes the planes alerted in \nIsrael are found over Jordan, or over the Mediterranean, or over Syria. \nThey are gone. They have left the country. The country is in a sense, a \nsort of aircraft carrier. So they cannot play around with conferences.\n  There isn't any question on the credibility of the so-called \nstatements that the administration said, the administration requested, \nthe administration demanded, the administration vetoed. I think the \npoor President has a hard time getting along with his staff on the \ninformation he gets. First he said the Director of the CIA was \nresponsible; he had him apologize. Now he says a White House national \nsecurity staffer is responsible; he had him apologize. We will pick up \nthe morning paper and find it was somebody else. But he put the picture \non his own White House Internet site of him going over every line, word \nfor word, in the State of the Union, with his own hands. I wish I had \nthat in my pocket. I would submit it for the Record so everyone could \nsee it.\n  So don't give me this about the administration. The best of the \nadministration wants this. The head of the Transportation Security \nAdministration cleaned that agency up, frankly, after we instituted it. \nWe had a rather inept administrator there at first, and I speak in \npraise of Admiral Loy, because he came over from retirement as \ncommandant of the Coast Guard. I have been with him on hearings and on \nfield trips. As the distinguished Senator from West Virginia pointed \nout, there is over a billion-some in requests by him. This would only \nget us a little of what he needs.\n  Who speaks for the administration on homeland security? Not those \namateurs in the White House who, in tomorrow's paper, will apologize \nfor whatever they said, or whatever they forgot, or whatever they \ndidn't know. We know. We have studied this thing. We tried and we got, \nin a bipartisan fashion, 100 senatorial votes, Republican and Democrat, \n$4.2 billion. Since that time, Admiral Loy said the need is going to \nexceed $7 billion. Since that time, on his desk are requests for $1.7 \nbillion. Obviously, he is not going to respond to every one of the \nrequests. He requested $1.2 billion. These are facts.\n  So when the distinguished chairman says you have to wisely, \nthoughtfully disburse, that is exactly what we are doing--wisely, \nthoughtfully, and in a minimal fashion, as we are not getting what \nfactually has been requested. So I dissent from the expression that we \ndon't have the information. I resist the idea that this particular \namendment may undermine the process and contribute to the insecurity, \nwhen we backed up with needs and everything else around here. I have \nbeen working since 9/11 on trying to provide for the\n\n[[Page S9763]]\n\nparticular needs of the ports--and these are the major needs of the \nmajor ports.\n  When you talk about a member of a subcommittee and every member wants \nmore money for their subcommittee, this is not that at all. This is \nsomething we worked on in the Transportation Committee.\n  As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, when she was the \nSecretary of Transportation, we worked in a bipartisan fashion on the \nReagan National Airport. We did a lot of good things.\n  I have worked in a bipartisan fashion. I have not worked around here \non port security because we just think, since I am a member of a \nsubcommittee, I want to put in an amendment and get a little bit more \nmoney. We are behind the curve on port security in this country, and I \nam worried about it, in all candor.\n  This is a minimal amendment. I know the staff, and everyone else, \nincluding the Department, want more. They have said so and have \nrequested more. I have requested $300 million to be added to the \namounts.\n  I hope folks will in a bipartisan fashion support this amendment so \nwe can get the Transportation Security Administration and Admiral Loy \nand the Coast Guard some financial support to get these funds \nadministered and disbursed and get security in the ports of America. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, there has been much made about the \nsuggestion from the Coast Guard that we should have over $1 billion \navailable for port security activity. Let me point out that in fiscal \nyears 2003 and 2004, several other agencies of the Department of \nHomeland Security, other than the Transportation Security \nAdministration, have been provided funds that are to be used for port \nsecurity activities. The Coast Guard itself has been provided up to \n$888 million in 2003, and it is provided $1.201 billion in this bill.\n  The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has been provided $170 \nmillion for increased personnel at maritime points of entry, and $33 \nmillion is available in this bill for all ports of entry, including \nseaports, for the container security initiative. All have been funded \nin a total amount, if we add it up over 2003 and 2004, of $3.29 billion \navailable for the security of our Nation's ports.\n  We are doing our best to allocate the funds to those agencies within \nthe Department that can help us secure our maritime ports. I hope the \nSenate will agree with us, but it is now time for the Senate to work \nits will.\n  I move to table the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am flattered. Although I love New York, I have never \nbeen told I come from anywhere south of Washington, DC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I apologize to North Carolina.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I was trying to be nice, Mr. President, but I guess that \ndoes not pay around here these days.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1343\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1343.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the funds for research and development related to \n            transportation security, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 49, beginning on line 14, strike all through line \n     19 and insert the following:\n       For necessary expenses for research and development related \n     to transportation security, $200,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended: Provided, That of the total amount provided \n     under this heading, $45,000,000 shall be available for the \n     research and development of explosive detection devices: \n     Provided further, That of the total amount provided under \n     this heading $70,000,000 shall be available for the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security to award grants under section 70107(i) \n     of title 46, United States Code, to national laboratories, \n     private nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher \n     education, and other entities for the support of research and \n     development of technologies that can be used to secure the \n     ports of the United States.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will listen to this \nbecause maybe we can get this accepted without a vote. As many in the \nChamber know, as does certainly the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, \nto me one of the greatest holes, one of the greatest weaknesses we face \nas we try to defend our homeland is we are not doing enough to prevent \nthe smuggling of a nuclear weapon into this country. Our greatest \nnightmare would be that some evil group of people get ahold of a \nnuclear weapon and put it in a container in a ship and send it to our \nshores. The devastation that would ensue would be enormous. \nUnfortunately, there is very little to prevent that from happening now.\n  We are trying to tighten our general cargo system, but it is not \nenough in terms of preventing a nuclear weapon from coming into this \ncountry.\n  I sought experts shortly after 9/11 and said, How do we prevent this \nfrom happening? They said, There is good news and bad news. The good \nnews is nuclear devices are detectable because they emit something \ncalled gamma rays, which pass through everything. The bad news is the \nonly practical detection devices right now are Geiger counters and the \nGeiger counter has to be held 2 or 3 feet from the object.\n  You can't go on every container and put a Geiger counter near each \ncrate. It will bring commerce to a standstill. But, they said, the \ncyclotrons at Brookhaven National Lab and Argonne, our national energy \nlabs, detect radiation 60, 70, 80 feet away. The trouble is, the \ndevices are not practical. They are delicate, they cannot be bounced \naround, and they are large. But, they said, it should not be too \ndifficult to practicalize these devices and then place them on every \ncrane that loads or unloads a container. It would emit a noise if, God \nforbid, a nuclear weapon were on board that container, and we could \nstop it.\n  Everyone agrees this is a good thing to do. The problem is finding \nthe resources to get it done. So last year the Senate voted for $150 \nmillion to do this.\n\n[[Page S9764]]\n\nBut when we got back from the conference, I think $10 million was left \nin, which was not close to enough.\n  I have proposed in this amendment that we add another $70 million to \ngeneral homeland security research, solely for the purpose of \ndeveloping these nuclear detection devices. But if my good friend from \nMississippi thinks we do not want to add any money into the bill, I \nwould be satisfied with earmarking $70 million of the existing research \nfunds for this very purpose. Although it would take money away from \nother research, it would not increase the overall amount.\n  I cannot imagine research that is more needed. As I mentioned, I \nwould be happy to substitute the second amendment which does not raise \nthe overall price and earmarks the money.\n  All I can say is. God forbid a nuclear device is smuggled into this \ncountry; it would be our worst nightmare. The fact we can do something \nabout it and the fact we are not doing enough about it to me is a \ndereliction of our duty, of our responsibility to make our citizens \nsafe. I want to be able to say to my constituents--I think every Member \nhere does--that every container entering this country has no nuclear \nweapon in it. By developing technologies like passive detectors, we can \nmake sure that happens. There is not a question as to whether this is \nfeasible. It is not just spending the money and putting it down a black \nhole. The $10 million that was allocated last year, even though this \nHouse voted for $150 million, is too little. The $70 million--I would \nrather have it be higher, but the bottom line is this. Terrorists know \nour weaknesses. Right now, let's hope none of them has a nuclear \nweapon. But, if, God forbid, they did--if, God forbid, they did, they \ncould bring it into this country through one of our ports and have a \ndarn good chance, an all-too-high chance of succeeding.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues, there may be no amendment to this bill \nmore important than this one to the future safety of our citizens, our \nbeautiful and wonderful 280 million Americans; maybe no amendment that \nwe vote on this year. This is a quiet issue. It has not garnered that \nmuch attention. But it is a vital issue. This should show whether \nGovernment can work. Because this is what we should be doing.\n  I hope my friend from Mississippi will accept this amendment. I would \nrather not call a vote on it. As I said, I would be willing to \nsubstitute for this the offset. But we cannot delay any further. Every \nyear we delay makes it more likely that this horrible situation could \noccur.\n  I do not want to be in a ``what if'' mode. What if, God forbid--God \nforbid--a nuclear weapon were exploded in this country? And what if the \nnext morning we said to ourselves: Why didn't we do something about it \nwhen we knew we could?\n  With that, I will relinquish the floor and hope my colleague from \nMississippi and others could work something out here so we could come \nto a compromise and get this amendment accepted in the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from New \nYork to be sure I understood what he was suggesting. He said if I \ndidn't agree to one thing he would offer another thing and I am not \nsure what he sent to the desk and that is why I decided to go look. \nFrom what I understand, the Senator has offered an amendment that \nwould--well, the reading of this seems to add $70 million, or earmark \n$70 million from the amount made available for research and development \nto the Secretary of Homeland Security, to award grants to national \nlaboratories, private and nonprivate organizations, institutions of \nhigher education, and other entities for the support of research and \ndevelopment of technologies that can be used to secure the ports of the \nUnited States.\n  What he then talked about was a technology he would require to be \ndeveloped with funds in this amendment to detect nuclear explosive \ndevices that were attempted to be brought into ports or brought into \nthe United States.\n  The point is, we already have in the bill $55.2 million for a \ntechnology center which conducts the research and engages in the work \nthat leads to the development of such protective devices.\n  I am confused by what the Senator said he is trying to do and what he \nsent to the desk. I have to be honest.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. They are not all the same thing. That is my point.\n  I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have taken the first amendment and added $70 million \nin general homeland security research. But it requires the research to \ngo into port security. The language is not specific. I can make it \nspecific. It was intended to be for the research into these devices. We \ncan get together and make it specific. I don't know why we didn't. We \nprobably should have. But it just earmarks it for port security as \nopposed to general security.\n  The second amendment, which I haven't sent to the desk, doesn't \nincrease the overall amount for research and development. But this one \ndoes. This would increase it by $70 million. It is not taken from the \nrest. But the other one earmarks $70 million of the existing $130 \nmillion for this very purpose.\n  If the problem is making the language more specific, I am willing to \ndo that.\n  I am not familiar. I ask my colleague a question: Where does the $55 \nmillion that he is refers to go? As I understand it, there is $10 \nmillion we passed last year. But I would be happy to look at that. I \nhave no pride of authorship. I just want to get these devices done.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator has completed his \nstatement, I would be happy to continue. The committee is recommending \nin the appropriations bill $130.2 million for research and development. \nThe way that is broken down even further as explained in our committee \nreport on page 31, $55.2 million goes to a Technological Center for \nResearch and Development. That is where the kind of work the Senator is \ntalking about is done. An additional $45 million goes to the next \ngeneration of explosive device systems. The third category of funding \nis $30 million which goes to an air cargo pilot program.\n  The point is the Senator is coming in and adding $70 million to this \naccount without an offset. That is going to violate the Budget Act. \nBecause we have been unable to accept any amendments that are drafted \nlike that, I would be constrained to make a point of order because the \namendment would violate the Budget Act. That would be my intention if \nthe Senator insisted on this amendment. If the motion to waive the \nBudget Act fails, the Senator can offer his alternative.\n  I do not know how else to proceed to consider the other amendment \nunless we deal with this one first. I just wanted to make that point.\n  Work is being done now. I am advised that work is being done now on \nthe kind of research that would lead to, we hope, eventual deployment \nof the kind of system about which the Senator is talking. But we are \nunable to earmark that kind of money in this bill without eliminating \nfunding for other research activities which are also underway.\n  We can't do everything at once. There is just not enough money. That \nis the rationale for having to make some choices and to allocate the \nfunds as the committee has chosen to do in this bill.\n  If the amendment the Senator is offering does violate the Budget Act, \nI am going to have to make a point of order. And the Senator can move \nto waive it. The Senator can move to waive it, if he so chooses. He has \nthat right.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I first make a point. Yes, there is $55 \nmillion for this, but none of that has to be used for nuclear security \ndevices. There is no allocation for any research to be done for this \nvery important part of research.\n  I have to say, with all due respect, that there are lots of different \nkinds of research which will be done that don't guarantee any. Last \nyear, we put $10 million in for this, but the Senate voted for $150 \nmillion.\n  But I ask my colleague a question: First, where is this institute? I \nam not even familiar with it.\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the \ntechnological center is in Atlantic City, NJ.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Second, I ask my colleague if we were not to violate the \nBudget Act but, say, allocate $70 million or some sum within the $130 \nmillion for research that should specifically go for nuclear detection \ndevices, would my friend from Mississippi be willing to support \nsomething like that?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would not. I am not going to tell an \nagency of this Homeland Security Department how to do research or where \nto put the priorities for research. Some of the information about \ndetection of these devices I am sure is classified. I am not going to \nget into the business of having a public debate over exactly how much \nis being spent on that. We have asked the directorate if funds are \nbeing used to conduct this research, and they say that the research is \nbeing done. But, frankly, I don't have a dollar figure that I can tell \nyou as to the exact amount which would be spent in this next calendar \nyear on this subject. But it is less than $5.2 million. We know that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. There is $10 million we allocated last year for this. \nThe Senate voted for $150 million. There was no subcommittee at that \npoint on homeland security. Senator Stevens supported it. But when it \ncame back from conference, it only had $10 million in it.\n  I think my colleague would understand that this kind of research \nshould not be done in some new institute. There are experts who have \ndone this already at our national energy research laboratories. They \ncan detect radiation. It is just that the device has to be practical, \nand it is not right now. That is why we need this specific quick \nallocation.\n  But if my colleague from Mississippi doesn't want to allocate any \nspecific money for this purpose, whether we violate the Budget Act or \nnot, I guess there is no compromise we can reach.\n  I would be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. First, I commend the Senator for this very thoughtful \nand very important amendment. I wondered whether the Senator was aware \nthat though we have a research facility in Atlantic City in my State, \nit is primarily focused on aviation. While they do explosive research, \nI believe the Senator would agree that this is more intent on examining \nthe result of nuclear explosives--the kind of detonation that would \nreally wipe out a whole port or a major facility.\n  Is that what the Senator wants to establish--that it is port specific \nand maritime specific and that we ought to get on with it to protect \nour ports?\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for that point.\n  I say to my friend from Mississippi that it is probably likely that \nnone of the $55 million of this specific institute, which I am sure is \ndoing a very good job on air research, will do this. Then I say to my \ncolleague--I say to everybody here--to not put any money into this when \nthis is the greatest danger we face is a dereliction of our \nresponsibility. I am willing to offset. I am willing to work. But the \n$55 million that is in this institute is not going to go to the kind of \nresearch we are talking about. Even if they were to give the money to \nthis institute to do it, it would have to reinvent the wheel when our \nexisting research laboratories can do this.\n  Last year, we had sort of a consensus that we had to do something, \nbut in conference we lost the dollars. We are taking a step backward \nhere. This is what everyone worried about after 9/11--that we would \nbecome complacent. From all of the moneys in the budget, we can't find \n$70 million to do research to deal with perhaps the greatest danger \nthat faces us. That is wrong. That is something we, hopefully, will \nnever regret. But we may.\n  I say to my colleague from Mississippi that this Atlantic City \nresearch center, as my friend Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey said, \nis part of the FAA. That has nothing to do with the research we are \ntalking about. It does a good job.\n  I ask my colleague, where is this research going to be done?\n  I say to all of my colleagues, if we don't do this amendment, and we \nsay it is because of the Budget Act, my goodness, we just passed $350 \nbillion in tax cuts without even talking about the Budget Act. And we \ncan't spend $70 million to make our homeland secure from the greatest \ndanger that would face us--greater than biological weapons, greater \nthan chemical weapons? What is the matter with us?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If there was a manifest that said ``nuclear weapon on \nits way,'' could you imagine something like that? We have all these \ncontainers. These are hidden boxes. You don't know what kind of cargo \nis in them. To me, it is one of the more susceptible areas for a \nterrorist attack of major magnitude. Thus, I ask the Senator, do you \nknow from what part of the budget the $70 million you are proposing be \nused, which is out of $29 billion and is a very small fraction when you \nconsider the risks that might ensue?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I understand that is where the Senator is going with \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for the question. Obviously, this \nis a real problem. Obviously, we should be doing something about it. \nAnd somehow, because the committee, in its wisdom, said $55 million for \nthis and $40 million for this and $10 million for this, and we can't \nbreak the Budget Act, we should ignore this problem. Why the heck do we \nhave amendments on the floor? No one objects to the substance, it is \njust finding room for it.\n  I would just, once again, say to my colleagues, I plead with you; \nthis is not a political issue for me at all; this is about the safety \nof America. Let us find some way to find some money.\n  I am not saying the committee should be omniscient and should have \nthought of everything. This is one area on which I have spent a lot of \ntime. I can assure every one of my colleagues that the money could be \nwell spent. Every expert says it can be done. And every expert who \nlooks at our budget says it is not being done now or is being done at \nsuch a slow pace that we are almost inviting people to harm us.\n  So I am disappointed--I have to tell you, I am disappointed, whether \nwe violate the Budget Act or not, because I am willing to go either \nway--that we cannot find one thin dime more for this vital research.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in addition to the research account that \nthe Senator seeks to amend with the amendment he submitted and which is \nat the desk, the Department of Homeland Security is engaged in a wide \nrange of broad-based research activity under the auspices of the \nScience and Technology Directorate.\n  The Transportation Security Administration funding is affected by the \namendment at the desk. There is a lot of other research that is being \ndone relating to radiological and nuclear countermeasures. I am \nconvinced that much of what is being done in terms of developing new \nways of dealing with the problem the Senator describes is being done \nunder the auspices of the Science and Technology Directorate.\n  Here are some examples of the work that has been funded over the last \n3 years and is being funded again this year in this bill: sensor \nresearch and development. This is for radiological and nuclear \ncountermeasures. In 2003, there was $10 million appropriated and \nenacted; $40 million reprogrammed for this account in fiscal year 2003. \nMr. President, $71 million is contained in the Senate bill for sensor \nR So over that 3-year period--$10 million, $40 million, $71 \nmillion--you have $121 million that has been appropriated for sensor \nR\n  Also, there are other accounts, such as detection systems product \nimprovement, demonstrations, remediation and consequence management--a \nwide range of other activities. The total for radiological and nuclear \ncountermeasures for this year alone, in the bill we have presented, is \n$131 million. In 2003, the total was $75 million. So we have almost \ndoubled the amount for the science and technology research that is \nbeing done in this particular area. So this isn't the only account that \nis available.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am not aware, in all the research my friend from \nMississippi read off, that any is being done\n\n[[Page S9766]]\n\nfor the specific thing I talked about, which is to develop not just a \nnuclear sensor somewhere but nuclear sensors that can go on cranes when \nthey load and unload containers.\n  Every expert who looks at how they would do a nuclear device here, \nhow they would explode one going into this country--it is very hard to \ndo it on a plane; they are heavy; they can't do it on a truck very \neasily--you do it in the big containers that come through the ports.\n  I don't see anything, from what the Senator has read off, to show \nthis is being done. I would be happy to delay for a bit. We could do \nsome research and call Homeland Security and see if they are doing \nthis. Just to read off a number of accounts and say there is research \nbeing done, and maybe some of it is being done in the area I am talking \nabout--which I know everyone thinks is important--isn't good enough \nbecause this is so important.\n  So I ask the Senator, does he know of any specific funds that will \ndefinitely--not maybe but definitely--go to the research we are talking \nabout; namely, nuclear detection devices to prevent nuclear weapons \nfrom being smuggled in, in a container?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection is another agency that is involved in the research and \ndevelopment of detection and monitoring equipment and devices, \nparticularly at ports. Port radiation detection and monitoring is \nfunded in this bill that is before the Senate in the amount of $90 \nmillion. Mr. President, $119 million is provided in the bill for \ncritical equipment at ports of entry, including seaports.\n  The point is, I am happy to join the Senator in an inquiry of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to try to get an answer that is \nspecific to his question. But I am not prepared to rewrite this bill on \nthe suspicion the Senator has that not enough research is being done on \nthis particular issue.\n  I think we are doing research on this point, and not at just one \ncenter or not at just one research facility. I mentioned the \ntechnological center in Atlantic City, NJ. They are doing work in this \narea that is funded in this particular account. That is why I described \nit, because it is funded in this $55.2 million account for research and \ndevelopment. And that is what that is. That is under the auspices of \nthe Transportation Security Administration.\n  But these other agencies, these other directorates are also involved \nin research over a wide range of activities to more fully and more \ncapably protect our homeland. That is the purpose of the Department. \nThat is why we appropriated these large sums of money, and we will \ncontinue to do so.\n  So I am hopeful the Senate will trust the committee to divide the \nfunds among the competent directorates and administrators of this new \nDepartment and to maintain oversight, as we customarily have done, and \nwill do, to be sure they are spending the money wisely.\n  If the Senator would take my word for it, I would be glad to follow \nup and monitor the use of these funds to be sure we are doing research \nfor the development of the types of protective devices the Senator \ndescribed. I think we should be able to do that. I am confident we are \ndoing research in that area. But all I can do is tell you that. I am \nnot in charge of it. There are people who are competent and well \nqualified who are doing that work. So I am going to resist the \nSenator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, to save the Senator trouble, I make a \npoint of order that the amendment of the Senator violates the Budget \nAct. The amendment of the Senator from New York provides spending in \nexcess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation, and under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, I make a point of order against \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the amendment?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second on the amendment.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I move that the Budget Act be waived and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the motion?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Is there further debate on the motion to waive?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe motion to waive the Budget Act in connection with the Schumer \namendment occur at a time to be decided in consultation between the two \nleaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came to Washington in 1982 as a Member of \nCongress. That class of Democrats in the House of Representatives was \none of the largest we had in the history of the country, second or \nthird largest class ever. A number of my colleagues in that class are \nnow Members of the Senate, including the senior Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin. Senator Durbin and I have been friends now for 21 years. He \nwas an outstanding Member of the House of Representatives. He did many \nthings so well.\n  One of the means set up for Members of the House of Representatives \nto express themselves is what they call 1-minute speeches. Every \nmorning Senators can speak for up to 1 minute on any subject they want. \nSenator Durbin gave some really classic 1-minute speeches. One that \npeople will always remember was one dealing with baseball bats, \nLouisville sluggers. It was a dramatic speech and interesting, funny.\n  People may not always agree with what Senator Durbin says on the \nSenate floor but I have always believed and always will believe that he \nis a man of the highest caliber as far as integrity goes. I have served \nin government for many years. There is no one I would put above Senator \nDurbin for basic morality.\n  Having said that, what I want to do this afternoon for just a short \nperiod of time is defend not only Senator Durbin, the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, who is, in my opinion, an exemplary Senator, exemplary \nin the fact that he is someone who speaks out for issues he believes \nin, speaks out against issues he does not believe in, and he does it \nvery well. He is a hard worker. He covers his State extremely well.\n  I never believed that someone could replace the great Paul Simon, a \nperson with whom I served. He was lieutenant governor of Illinois; I \nwas lieutenant governor of Nevada. We served in the House and Senate \ntogether, a person who we all cared about a great deal, a great deal of \naffection for Paul Simon because of his tremendous abilities and his \nbeing a person of great sensitivity.\n  I have to say that as good as Paul Simon was, Dick Durbin is as good \nas Paul Simon. I rise today not only to defend the senior Senator from \nIllinois but I think to defend every Member of this body. Yesterday the \nSenator from Illinois took the floor of this Chamber to address \nallegations that have been made about him by others. Unknown people \nhave been spreading rumors and innuendos that Senator Durbin, a member \nof the very prestigious and important Intelligence Committee, No. 1, \ndisclosed classified information; that is, the name of an individual in \nthe NSC or disclosed sites in Iraq. Of course, that is simply not true. \nEveryone knows it is not true.\n  When it was shown that there was absolutely no basis to it factually, \nthen people started saying: Well, even though the matters discussed in \nthe very important Intelligence Committee are not secret, when a matter \nis discussed in the Intelligence Committee is not secret, you still \ncan't talk about it outside the Intelligence Committee hearing room. I \nthink having said that, it pretty well determines that that is an \nimpossible standard to uphold.\n  Senator Durbin didn't leak this information. There is no question \nabout\n\n[[Page S9767]]\n\nthat. I, as every Member serving in the Senate, take an oath upon \nassuming this office to uphold the Constitution. Every Senator takes \nthat responsibility very seriously. Senator Durbin takes that \nresponsibility very seriously. It is part of our job, as we represent \nthe citizens of 50 different States, 270 million people. We are \nSenators from our respective States but we are also United States \nSenators. We discuss issues and debate differences of opinion. That is \nwhat makes this country so great. But also what makes this country so \nunique is the understanding that the common good of our country is more \nimportant than the political differences, the realization that we all \nrespect one another enough to tell the truth even when we disagree on \nan issue.\n  No one should ever suggest that Senator Durbin doesn't always tell \nthe truth. I believe this very sincerely and very certainly. I again \nrepeat, underscore, and underline the integrity of this friend that I \nhave had for 21 years who has served this country extremely well as a \nMember of Congress for that entire time. So I don't want to speculate \nas to why someone would be spreading rumors to the contrary.\n  Senator Durbin has political opinions, and he is very willing to \ndiscuss them. I hope that someone who disagrees with his political \nopinions would not spread rumors that are without any fact. If anyone \nhas any evidence to the contrary, let them come forward.\n  But during the time this issue has been fermenting and people have \nbeen leaking information, it simply is without foundation. There has \nbeen no factual evidence coming forward. We cannot have sneak attacks \non the character of a Member of the Senate. They should stop \nimmediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1344\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1344.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a report to Congress on the Homeland Security \n                Advisory System, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 75, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall submit a report in unclassified form to Congress on the \n     Homeland Security Advisory System, which shall include--\n       (1) an assessment of how the system is fulfilling its \n     missions to--\n       (A) provide a national framework for Federal, State, and \n     local governments, private industry and the public to gauge \n     threat levels;\n       (B) establish the integration of factors for assignment of \n     threat conditions;\n       (C) unify the system of public announcements, allowing \n     government officials and citizens to communicate the nature \n     and degree of terrorist threats; and\n       (D) provide a tool for combating terrorism by deterring \n     terrorist activity, notifying law enforcement and State and \n     local government officials of threats, informing the public \n     about government preparations, and providing such officials \n     and the public with information necessary to respond to the \n     threat;\n       (2) the average daily cost of elevating the Homeland \n     Security Advisory System by 1 threat level;\n       (3) an evaluation by the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Homeland Security of the responses to each of \n     the suggested protective measures to be taken at each threat \n     level; and\n       (4) a review of efforts taken by the Department of Homeland \n     Security to refine the Homeland Security Advisory System, and \n     the progress of tailoring the system so that threat alerts \n     are issued on a regional basis rather than nationally.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, with this amendment to the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, I want to see if we can improve in some \nmeasure the terrorist threat warning system that we have in place and \nmake sure that it is working as it is intended.\n  I believe the current homeland security advisory system--the colorful \ntiered alert system--does little to reassure the public they are safer \nas a result of these warnings. Based on reports I get from first \nresponders in my State and experts throughout the country, I believe \nthis advisory system must be reevaluated and improved.\n  The amendment simply calls for a report from the Department of \nHomeland Security within 90 days of the passage of this bill evaluating \nhow effective the terror advisory system is in meeting its goals. We \nare all familiar with this program. There are five levels, ranging from \nlow risk to severe risk. You can see on the chart this color-\ncoordinated presentation. The Department has color coded each risk \nlevel to make it easy to understand.\n  However, I don't believe this color war against terrorists is \nworking. On four instances over the past year, Secretary Ridge has \nraised the threat level from yellow, elevated risk, to orange, high \nrisk of terror attacks, based on increased terrorist chatter or other \nintelligence information. Aside from these instances in which the \nthreat level was at orange, the system has been evaluated at the \nelevated yellow status since its inception in March 2002.\n  What I want to do now is discuss a series of concerns I have about \nthe color-coded system and its repercussions.\n  First, the system evokes confusion and fear among Americans who want \nto respond to the elevated risk levels, but the question they raise is, \nShould they be changing their daily patterns without advanced knowledge \nabout where or when they vacate their homes, offices, schools, \nfactories, et cetera? Some Americans have stopped going to malls, some \navoid public transportation, and many cancel trips. These arbitrary \nbehavioral changes can have a serious impact on our already weak \neconomy.\n  These are questions we have to ask: Does work stop? Do classrooms \nclose? Does shopping halt, no matter how essential the goods? Should \nAmericans take precautions?\n  The Department of Homeland Security doesn't tell us. I am not \nfaulting the work they are doing, honestly, at the Department of \nHomeland Security. This is all still in its formative stages. We don't \nknow quite where it is going to come to rest yet or where it is most \neffective.\n  DHS tells us to be vigilant. I don't know what that means. I am sure \nmost of the American public doesn't know exactly what being vigilant \nmeans. The system presents high costs to local communities. When the \nthreat level is elevated, local first responders are forced to respond \nby deploying already overworked police and firefighting people and by \nbolstering other first response systems without added Federal financial \nassistance.\n  When the DHS raises the alert, they provide almost no specific \nguidance to State and local governments. It requires State and local \nauthorities to make many of their own decisions, or perhaps all of \nthem, on how they should respond. In my State, like the rest of the \ncountry, when the alert is elevated to orange, or high, local officials \ntighten security on highways, railroads, bridges, bus \nterminals, Federal buildings, and densely populated areas. And this is \nan extremely expensive undertaking for State and local governments. \nCost alone, while important, is not the only factor. Disruption of \nnormal life is a victory for terrorists without any demonstrable \nbenefit to our society.\n\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors recently released new data compiled \nfrom a survey of nearly 150 cities nationwide. They estimate that \ncities throughout the country are spending, on average, nearly $70 \nmillion each and every week in additional homeland security costs due \nto the heightened threat alert level.\n  These costs come in addition to the existing homeland security \nspending since 9/11, which the mayors estimated to be around $2.6 \nbillion in the first 15 months after the tragedy. However, this only \nasks the cities about direct costs. There are also indirect economic \nramifications of code orange alerts that diminish tourism and other \nlucrative industries. The mayor of Atlanta, for example, has said the \ncity's hotel occupancy is down 8 percent and 16,000 hotel jobs have \nbeen lost.\n  There are also innumerable indirect nonfinancial costs of the current \nterror alert system. For example, when a police officer who is normally \nassigned to\n\n[[Page S9768]]\n\nantigang work, or some other assignment, is reassigned to guard a \npublic building, that is a real serious cost to a city. And also it \ndamages the law and order structure that must be contended with at the \nsame time.\n  My third concern is that the system is not tailored to give warnings \non a regional basis. Increased terrorist chatter may suggest that a \nmajor New England city is subject to a possible threat. But small towns \nin the Southwest are also now asked to respond.\n  Other nations that face terrorist threats have a more sophisticated \nlocalized system. Experts continue to recommend that the United States \nestablish a threat alert system similar to that in Israel, where \nintelligence or terrorist chatter is translated into specific warnings \nabout geographical areas that might be more susceptible to a terrorist \nattack. For example, in Israel, threat warnings are easier to \nunderstand. For example, the Israeli Government would issue a terror \nalert for an area of the country such as Galilee. If we have reference \nto a targeted region in the U.S., we ought to provide specific \ninformation. Is it New Jersey? Is it Los Angeles? Is it Des Moines, IA? \nWhere is it? Is it the port that we were discussing before? We have so \nmany port assets in our country that need to be protected against \nterrorist attack. So where do you apply the pressure? Where do you \nspend the money?\n  Four, when the threat level is issued, there is no description of the \nnature of the threat that can help those expected to respond. We are \nnot going to be naive about this. We are not saying we have information \nthat such-and-such shopping mall is going to be attacked and, \ntherefore, avoid that mall. We cannot be that specific. But we ought to \nbe able to narrow it down from just a general alert across this great \ncountry of ours to something that gives people a direction for their \nactions when they hear the call.\n  Should the Governors call out their National Guard troops to protect \nevery chemical plant in the country--and there are hundreds of those--\nor transportation centers, or do they bolster rail security in every \nplace? I do not think so. Again, this is not criticism of a system that \nis developing against a very serious threat to our society.\n\n  Finally--and I believe this is a key point--the system does not \nprovide adequate instructions for the American people or local \nauthorities. When I talk to the police in my area--and before I came to \nthe Senate, I was a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and \nNew Jersey. They may get a call about something they ought to be on the \nlookout for, but the New York State capital is in Albany and the New \nJersey State capital is in Trenton.\n  Do they call out their State troopers to cover all of those areas, \nall those police departments? In New Jersey, we have 567,000 \nmunicipalities. Some of them only have two or three policemen. What do \nthey do? We need direction from those who have the knowledge and have \nthe resources to research this.\n  The Homeland Security Department requires Federal agencies to respond \nto an elevated threat at the Department's own discretion, but does not \nissue specific guidance to Americans in State and local governments.\n  This lack of guidance can cause a lot of confusion and, in some \ncases, real panic. I have, through the process of these alerts, had \ncalls--less now than I had in months past: Should I go to New York? My \nchildren have to travel to school on the turnpike. Should they be on \nthe turnpike? Should we do this and should we do that? In many cases, \npeople want to know whether they should stay home and guard their \nhousehold and their families.\n  Lord knows we hope not, and we should take that kind of action. We \ncannot let the terrorists win by immobilizing our activities. We need \nto do better. The system has problems that at least ought to be \nreviewed, and I believe that improvements must be made.\n  I am not saying we should not spend the necessary money to deploy \nmore police officers to malls, nuclear plants, chemical manufacturing \nor distribution facilities, train stations, or Federal buildings. I am \na firm believer in spending whatever we have to spend to protect our \nsecurity at home. But I am not convinced the homeland security advisory \nsystem is the most efficient way of assessing threat and organizing \nlocal response.\n  On June 6, shortly after the threat level returned to yellow from a \nMemorial Day elevation to orange, Secretary Ridge himself acknowledged \nthe color-coded alert system needed readjustment. He said to the \nWashington Post:\n\n       We worry about the credibility of the system. We want to \n     continue to refine it because we understand it has caused a \n     kind of anxiety.\n\n  Anxiety is an understatement. The system causes financial hardships, \nfear, panic, confusion among Americans and people who want to be \nconscientious about protecting their families, sometimes exaggerating \nwhat they ought to be doing and creating a lot of tension within a \nfamily, within a household.\n  Experts warn that with the continuing volleying between orange and \nyellow alerts there will be a new threat level that we might call \nfatigue. Secretary Ridge has not offered a time line for revising the \nsystem. My amendment will make reviewing this system an important \npriority for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. It will send a message \nto the Department that the alert system needs to be enhanced to \nincrease its efficiency, its specificity, its overall usefulness to \nfirst responders, police, fire, and other emergency personnel.\n\n  I wish to point out this entails no further expense. A review is \ncommon in a situation such as this where such a big change is taking \nplace. I hope everybody will take a serious look at this and think \nabout their constituents back home who have called them, who have \nwritten them letters, who asked for advice. Let them ask the mayors in \ntheir communities or the Governors in their States what they think.\n  I want to make sure it is understood. I am not leveling broadside \ncriticism at the Department of Homeland Security or Secretary Ridge. I \nthink he is a very capable executive. We all want to do our best with \nthis issue, spend our money most efficiently, but disrupt life as \nlittle as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator has made some excellent \npoints. He has pointed out, for example, the need for a review of the \ncolor-coded warning system.\n  I am pleased to advise the Senator, it is my understanding that the \nDepartment is undertaking just such a review at this time. He makes \nsome excellent suggestions about categories of warning or targeted \nareas of warning. That should be considered as well.\n  I am willing to take this amendment to conference and urge, if we can \nconvince our colleagues in the House, that there should be a provision \nin our conference report that encourages this kind of review and \nrequires a report back to the Congress so we can know the status of it \nand what the expectations are of completing a review, giving us some of \nthe details in a report so we can better understand the progress being \nmade under such a review. That is why I did not ask for the yeas and \nnays because I am prepared to accept the amendment. I thank the Senator \nfor offering this suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi \nfor his support on this issue. I am happy to have it accepted. I wish \nto point out, in the debate we were having about port security, I have \nserved with the Senator from Mississippi for now 18\\1/2\\ years, and I \nhave never known him not to support our defense or our security needs. \nI have admired him for his balance in these issues. I continue to do \nso.\n  That debate was not intended to challenge the Senator from \nMississippi who is managing this bill, but to make sure that the \nsituation we are talking about with the ports which we feel are \nsusceptible, especially in the northeast corner of our country where so \nmuch is dependent on port activities, that it is clearly understood. I \nappreciate that. I am happy to have this amendment accepted, and I ask \nthe Senator from Mississippi to make sure it gets discussed at \nconference and presented.\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator has that assurance. We will \ntry to keep that amendment in conference. We will continue to confer \nwith our friend from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, amendment No. 1344 is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1344) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1346\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk on \nbehalf of Senators Dodd, Stabenow, Sarbanes, Clinton, and Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Mr. \n     Dodd, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. \n     Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 1346.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the amount of the appropriation for firefighter \n                   assistance grants by $150,000,000)\n\n       On page 60, line 1, strike ``$750,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$900,000,000''.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask the chair of the Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security if he has a copy of the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not have one yet.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would like to give a copy to the chairman, just as a \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment that is in support of \nour first responders. This amendment would provide an additional $150 \nmillion to the fire grant program for firefighter equipment and \nfirefighting training.\n  What would the Mikulski-Dodd amendment do? Well, first, it would \nprovide protective gear for 150,000 firefighters. It would buy 500 new \nfire trucks, 300 new rescue vehicles, and 25,000 new breathing masks. \nBut this is not about protective gear and fire trucks. It is about \nsaving lives.\n  When we talk about homeland security and when we talk about \nprotecting our firefighters so they can protect us, this money is about \nprotecting them. It is so our firefighters are prepared for any attack. \nIt offers double value for the taxpayer, whether it is a terrorist \nattack or whether we are hit by a tornado.\n  When these events occur in our community, firefighters are always the \nfirst on the scene. We all remember that horrific and melancholy day of \nSeptember 11 with planes crashing into the World Trade Center and a \nplane crashing into the Pentagon. It was the Chevy Chase Fire and \nRescue Squad, Rescue One, that rushed to the Pentagon from Maryland as \npart of a doctrine of mutual aid. It was the LaPlata Fire Department \nthat was the first to respond to a deadly tornado last year. It was the \nBaltimore Fire Department that rushed into a smoldering tunnel fire \nthat cut off train traffic on the east coast. When they went down into \nthat hell hole fuming with toxic chemicals, they did not know if a \nterrorist had caused it or it was an accident. All they knew was they \nhad to respond in the name of duty.\n  Well, it is our duty to make sure they have the right equipment and \nthe right gear to protect us. We know they have the right stuff, but \nthey need the right stuff to protect themselves.\n  This is not something Barbara Mikulski has just concluded. The \nCouncil on Foreign Relations recently issued a bipartisan, independent \nreport. It was led by Senator Rudman. Actually, it was not bipartisan. \nThe Council on Foreign Relations does not have parties.\n  What were their findings? They were absolutely chilling. The report \nfound that the United States remains dangerously ill-prepared to handle \na catastrophic attack on American soil. Specifically, it means this, \nand this is what they found: Fire departments across the country only \nhave radios to equip 50 percent of the firefighters on a shift.\n  Imagine this: People running up to the World Trade Center responding \nto a towering inferno. The firefighters will only have 50 percent of \nthe radios they need.\n  When they go into these situations where there are toxic chemicals \nlike in the Baltimore Tunnel, or whether they are running into a \nbuilding where they do not even know what is in it--asbestos burning, \nPCBs burning, the building burning--there is only breathing apparatus \nfor one-third, and only 10 percent of the fire departments in America \nhave the personnel and equipment to respond to a building collapse.\n  What do terrorists do? They blow up buildings and they blow up \npeople. We have to make sure that when our first responders are there, \nthey have what they need.\n\n  We did a survey in Maryland, working with our State fire agency. We \nneed $52 million to provide protective equipment for firefighters in my \nState. Yet my State is facing a budget deficit of over $1 billion. \nServices are being cut, tuitions are being increased, and we ask our \nState and local governments to take on more.\n  Every time our Nation goes to code orange, our communities go to code \nred. Since September 11, my city of Baltimore has spent over $16 \nmillion on homeland security, including $1.3 million for extra \npersonnel and equipment for our fire departments. In Baltimore, the \nrecent heightened alerts have cost Baltimore City $750,000 in overtime. \nMaryland cannot bear this burden alone. Because it is a national \nthreat, we have to make sure there are national resources to secure the \nhomeland to provide not only homeland security but hometown security.\n  There are over 1 million firefighters in the United States of \nAmerica; 750,000 are volunteers. They are true heroes. They save lives. \nThey save homes. They save communities. We need to make sure we save \nthem. That is what protective gear is all about.\n  Every day when they are on duty, they do not know what they will \nface. They might enter a house to save a child trapped on the second \nfloor. They might put out the flames of a building consumed by toxic \nchemicals. Many of our volunteers work three shifts: Their regular \njobs, their families, and at the fire station.\n  For the help they need, we cannot do this on tip jars, bingo, or \ncharity. They need to be able to have their Government on their side.\n  It costs over $6,000 to staff a firefighter in something they call \nbunker gear. Bunker gear means what they need in terms of the \nprotective suits they wear, the breathing apparatus, the special gloves \nthat will snatch a person out, the boots they wear that are fire \nretardant and fire resistant. That is an awful lot in resources for \nlocal communities to bear, and they have to be ready, particularly in \nhigh-risk areas, to be able to do this.\n  Last year, there were close to 20,000 applications for fire grants, \nand I compliment the Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, as well as Senator Byrd, for keeping the fire grant \nprogram as a freestanding program. My $150 million amendment that I am \noffering with Senator Dodd really goes to the fire grant program. Last \nyear, there were close to 20,000 applicants with over $2 billion worth \nof requests. The fire grant program, on a merit based, peer review, no \npork, no partisan basis could have spent $2.5 billion. What our money \ndoes is restore to the $900 million authorizing level.\n\n  After September 11 we did a lot. We said we will express our \ngratitude; a grateful nation will never forget our first responders. In \nthe first place, we should not forget it is in the Federal checkbook. I \nknow the chairman and the ranking member did everything they could to \nfully fund this program. I compliment them on their efforts. But it \nwould take another $150 million to reach the authorized level.\n  The fire grant program needs to be expanded. When we look at what we \ncould do in our State, we have a fire department in Anne Arundel \nCounty. This county includes the National Security Agency, the capital \nof the State\n\n[[Page S9770]]\n\nof Maryland, the U.S. Naval Academy, and the Baltimore-Washington \nAirport. Don't they need help for their first responders?\n  Then there is the Chevy Chase Fire Department. We think of Chevy \nChase as an affluent community but they cannot raise these funds from \nproperty taxes, fish fries, and bingo. We need help. Maryland needs \nhelp because we are in a high-risk area.\n  I rise not only for my State. I rise for the Nation. We are not \nprepared. The facts speak for themselves. Our esteemed colleague, \nSenator Rudman, said 50 percent of the fire departments do not have \nradios; only one-third have breathing apparatus equipment. They need \ntheir bunker gear. That is what it is called. The cost is $6,000 each. \nImagine what a public investment means. We give them the right gear. \nThey have the right stuff. They should be able to count on us to do \nthis. We need this amendment.\n  I welcome the fact that my colleague, Senator Dodd, is also a \ncosponsor. He authorized the fire grant program as the appropriator. We \nhave worked to keep it going. Now it is in Homeland Security.\n  This is not about process, about who did what. It is about what our \nfirst responders do. We count on them to save our lives. They should \ncount on us to make sure they have the right equipment to save their \nown while they are saving ours.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Maryland for her \nleadership on this issue and the tremendous support she has provided in \nthe Appropriations Committee for trying to fund this program.\n  I appreciate very much her typical graciousness in referring to the \nfact that Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio and I, back in 1999, authored the \nFire Act. We introduced the legislation almost 4 years ago. We thank, \nas well, Senator Warner and Senator Levin. When we had the \nauthorization bill, we were trying to get an opportunity to bring this \nmatter to the floor and we were not given any time to bring up the Fire \nAct. We were trying to make the case 2 years before September 11, 2001, \nof the importance of the volunteer combination paid departments, the \n33,000 departments across the United States, the needs they had out \nthere. It was as a result of the efforts of Senator Warner and Senator \nLevin that included the Fire Act in the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill in the year 2000 which allowed us to get the first \nauthorizations approved that led to the appropriations that came \nthereafter.\n  To give an idea of the pent-up demand existing across the country \namong fire departments, well over $3 billion worth of requests came in \nunder the grant program. We allocated something like $100 million the \nvery first year of this program. Some questioned whether there would be \nany real interest by these departments across the country in applying \nfor grants that would allow them great flexibility in improving their \nability to respond to the myriad of problems departments have.\n  As a result of the success of that first year and the tremendous \ndemand, the Appropriations Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nByrd and Senator Stevens, Senator Murkowski, obviously, Senator Cochran \nand others, over the years has added money to the program.\n  Although we are offering an amendment to add money, it would be \nnegligent not to recognize the contribution that has already been made \nto increase the funding for this program over the last several years.\n  The point the Senator from Maryland and I are trying to make today is \nthat this demand is still growing. We are not suggesting we ought to \nhave a program in a dollar-for-dollar match as in the so-called COPS \nProgram that provided assistance by the Federal Government to local \npolice agencies, local police departments. This is a far more modest \nprogram.\n  But the same principle behind the COPS Program is behind this idea. \nNo longer can we just assume local departments can sustain themselves \nby raising mill rates or, as the Senator from Maryland properly points \nout, particularly in rural America, with volunteer fire departments \nrelying on bingo sales, cake sales, and potluck dinners to raise the \ndollars to provide the equipment and training to deal with the very \nsophisticated set of problems they face.\n  The old idea of the fire department racing out to deal with a \nresidential home fire still is a job they must perform but today fire \ndepartments are being asked to deal with highly sophisticated materials \non the highways. Usually the fire department is the first responder to \nthese situations long before anyone else gets there. It is the local \nfire department that we herald and celebrate in speeches and rhetoric \naround the country during days of community celebration. These \ndepartments no longer can rely strictly on local funding to provide the \nsophisticated support they need to respond to the demands they are \nbeing asked to meet.\n\n  The Senator from Maryland and I--and we hope others, as well--will \njoin in what we think is a relatively modest request to get the funding \nlevel up to last year's funding level. Last year it was $900 million.\n  We realize there are a lot of pressures on the budget and a lot of \nother demands. However, if we are going to be serious about providing \nthe tools necessary for these young men and women who serve in our fire \ndepartments across the country to meet their challenges, we are going \nto have to do better than we are doing with this bill.\n  We would not ask our military people to go into battle less well \nequipped, less well provided for under the circumstances they face \ntoday. I don't think we could ask anything less of the men and women in \nuniform in our fire departments.\n  For those reasons, we have proposed this amendment. While this was \nnot a number we conjured up, according to the needs assessment study \nrecently released by the U.S. Fire Administration and the National Fire \nProtection Association, understaffing contributes to an enormous \nproblem. For example, the U.S. Fire Administration and the National \nFire Protection Association have found that only 11 percent of our \nNation's fire departments have the personnel and equipment they need to \nrespond to a building collapse involving 50 or more occupants.\n  The U.S. Fire Administration and the Fire Protection Association also \nfound there were routine problems that threatened the health and safety \nof our first responders. In small and medium-sized cities, firefighters \nare too often compelled to respond to emergencies without sufficient \nmanpower to protect those on the ground. More often than not, \nfirefighters in too many of our communities respond to fires with fewer \nthan four firefighters per truck. That is considered to be a minimum to \nensure the firefighters' safety.\n  As I said before, we would not send our troops into battle without \nthe equipment they need. We should not be sending firefighters to do \nbattle against natural disasters, fires, acts of terrorists, without \nthe tools they need, as well.\n  So the Rudman study as well, just released by the Council on Foreign \nRelations, makes the case. The Senator from Maryland has pointed this \nout very clearly. There are great gaps in terms of these departments' \nability to respond to the sophisticated demands we are asking of them \ntoday.\n  For all the reasons we have enumerated, we are requesting that this \nbody respond by supporting this amendment to increase the \nappropriations level for these grant programs across the country.\n  I said yesterday, in supporting the Byrd amendment, the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia to have a \nlarger increase overall, which I regret we did not approve--and I say \nthis with all the knowledge of what the implications may be, but I \nthink we have to be honest with the American public. I wish I could \nstand here and say: Look, we have done everything that needs to be done \nand you don't ever have to worry about another 9/11 happening in \nAmerica. Regretfully, that is just false. That is a false statement. \nBecause the fact is, in the world we live in today, we are going to \nface these problems again. All of us know that. There is not a single \nMember of this body who does not recognize and accept that as a \nreality. That is a fact. That is the ugly kind of world we are living \nin today, until we ultimately come up with better answers.\n\n[[Page S9771]]\n\n  We are spending $1 billion a week, $5 billion a month if you add \nAfghanistan and Iraq--$5 billion a month to deal with the problems of \nthe conflicts in those particular countries. What the Senator from \nMaryland and I are asking for is $150 million, which gets spent in a \ncouple of days--less than that now, I guess--in these two countries, in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, in order to make our fire departments better \nprepared.\n  I understand what we need to do in Iraq and Afghanistan. We will save \nthat debate for another time and discussion. We have already been \nthrough a bit of it already. But we are going to face these problems, \nand we ought to be doing everything we can within reason. Obviously--\nand I feel strongly about this--we ought to be doing a lot more than \nwhat the Mikulski-Dodd amendment is calling for. This is truly a modest \nrequest. In fact, we may be highly criticized one day for not doing \nmore when we knew better. It is not as if we are ignorant about the \nproblem we potentially face. The question is, Knowing that, what did we \ndo?\n  We will be judged by history and we will be judged by our \nconstituents as to whether or not we had the wisdom and willingness to \nmake the necessary judgment calls on these matters.\n  We are told over and over again there is not enough money to do this. \nI politely suggest to those who make that claim that there are \nresources by merely tailoring back on some of the largesse we provided \nfor some of the most affluent of our fellow citizens who, by the way, \nwould be the first to say: We don't need it. We would much rather see \nthe resources spent on something like this rather than be provided an \nunneeded tax break for those of us who are well insulated against the \neconomic hardships that millions of others are facing through \nunemployment.\n  So don't give the argument we can't afford to do it. We can't afford \nto do it because we provide too much of a tax break to those who need \nit the least. But don't tell that to a firefighter who is a one-man or \ntwo-man operation, where having a couple of more people with them could \nmake the difference in saving their lives. Don't say that to a family \nout there who may be the victim of some attack one day, that we didn't \nhave the resources to provide the necessary support they needed in \norder to respond to these situations.\n\n  I regret we even have to offer an amendment. My hope is that those \nwho supported the authorization of this bill--and we have had \noverwhelming support for it in the years past--will come to the floor \nat the appropriate time and cast a ballot, not just for this Mikulski-\nDodd amendment, or not for those who support it, but cast a ballot for \nthose who one day will say thank you for providing resources for our \nlocal departments. That is who you are really casting the vote for, not \nfor a colleague who offers the amendment but for those who are counting \non us to do a better job in protecting them.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Biden and Senator Lieberman be \nadded as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Harkin be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo letters of support, one from the International Association of Fire \nFighters strongly supporting this amendment, and then another, a joint \nletter offered by the International Association of Arson Investigators, \nthe International Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association \nof Fire Fighters, the International Fire Services Training Association, \nthe International Society of Fire Service Instructors, the National \nFire Protection Association, the National Volunteer Fire Council, and \nthe North American Fire Training Directors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                                Fire Fighters,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of the 260,000 \n     professional fire fighters and emergency medical services \n     personnel who are members of the International Association of \n     Fire Fighters (IAFF), I write to express our support for your \n     amendment to increase the FIRE Act grant funding by $150 \n     million.\n       As the recently released Council on Foreign Relations \n     report on first responders documents, the needs of fire \n     fighters and other first responders are great. Over the last \n     two years, the FIRE Act grants have steadily improved the \n     response capabilities of local fire departments. But more is \n     needed if we are to safely and effectively respond to \n     everyday emergencies as well as acts of terrorism.\n       Your amendment to the Homeland Security appropriations bill \n     will increase the FY 04 FIRE Act appropriations to $900 \n     million, the authorized level.\n       The IAFF thanks you for your years of service to fire \n     fighters and enthusiastically supports your amendment. If we \n     can be of additional service, please contact Barry Kasinitz, \n     IAFF Governmental Affairs Director, at 202-824-1581.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Harold A. Schaitberger,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: We are writing in support of your \n     amendment to the FY04 Homeland Security Appropriations Act \n     that will add $150 million to the Assistance to Firefighters \n     Grant Program (FIRE Act). Your amendment will bring the total \n     funding for the FIRE Act in FY04 to $900 million, the full \n     amount authorized by Congress.\n       The FIRE Act grant program benefits our nation as a whole \n     by providing local fire departments with much-needed \n     resources to respond both within and beyond the borders of \n     their individual jurisdictions to protect interstate \n     commerce, federal lands, and the critical infrastructure of \n     the United States. Local fire departments throughout the \n     nation respond to 17 million calls annually ranging from \n     structural fire suppression, emergency medical response, \n     hazardous materials incidents, technical rescues, wildland \n     fire protection, natural disasters and events of terrorism. \n     They are also the principle delivery mechanism for fire and \n     life safety prevention and education programs. Often, local \n     governments are unable to afford the extensive training and \n     specialized equipment that these challenges require. The FIRE \n     Act grant program would assist local fire departments in many \n     jurisdictions by providing the needed funds to pay for these \n     items.\n       As part of the authorizing legislation that created the \n     FIRE Grant Program, language was inserted to request the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct a needs \n     assessment of the fire service. FEMA and the National Fire \n     Protection Association (NFPA) surveyed the nation's fire \n     departments, and in December 2002, NFPA and FEMA released the \n     needs assessment, which revealed that: An estimated 73,000 \n     firefighters serve in fire departments that protect \n     communities of at least 50,000 population and have fewer than \n     4 career firefighters assigned to first-due engine companies. \n     (The National Fire Protection Association standard calls for \n     at least four firefighters per engine.); in communities with \n     less than 2,500 population, 21% of fire departments, nearly \n     all of them all- or mostly-volunteer departments, deliver an \n     average of 4 or fewer volunteer firefighters to a mid-day \n     house fire; half of all fire engines are at least 15 years \n     old; overall, fire departments do not have enough portable \n     radios to equip more than about half of the emergency \n     responders on a shift; an estimated one-third of firefighters \n     per shift are not equipped with self-contained breathing \n     apparatus; an estimated 57,000 firefighters lack personal \n     protective clothing; an estimated 120.1 million people are \n     protected by fire departments that do not have a program for \n     free distribution of home smoke detectors; and we must \n     continue to emphasize the importance of prevention and public \n     safety education to the fire and life safety infrastructure \n     of our Nation.\n       Nearly 4,000 civilians, including more than 600 children, \n     die in fires each year. Despite all our breakthrough \n     technologies in fire prevention and suppression, the United \n     States has one of the highest rates of fire deaths among \n     industrialized nations. By passing the FIRE Act, Congress \n     unequivocally asserted that it is the policy of the United \n     States to help reduce fire deaths by partnering with local \n     governments to provide all necessary and appropriate training \n     and equipment to our firefighters.\n       In the three years this program has been in existence, it \n     has become one of the most effective programs conducted by \n     the federal government. In January of this year, officials \n     from the U.S. Department of Agriculture selected the Fire \n     Grant Program for a study they were conducting as part of a \n     management training course. Summarizing the program, they \n     said that the grant program has been ``highly effective in \n     increasing the safety and effectiveness of grant \n     recipients.'' Their study found: 97 percent of program \n     participants reported positive impact on their ability to \n     handle fire and fire-related incidents; of those recipients \n     receiving firefighting equipment, 99 percent indicated \n     improvements in the safety of firefighters and 98 percent \n     indicated improvements in operation capacity; 90 percent of \n     the participants indicated that their department operated \n     more efficiently and safely as\n\n[[Page S9772]]\n\n     a result of the training provided by the grant program; and \n     over 88 percent of the participants who were able to measure \n     change at the time the survey was distributed reported \n     improvement in the fitness and health of their firefighters \n     as a result of the program and 86 percent indicated reduced \n     injuries.\n       The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is critical in \n     addressing the needs of over 30,000 fire departments and one \n     million fire and rescue personnel. We thank you for your \n     commitment to our nation's firefighters and this important \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n         Congressional Fire Services Institute; International \n           Association of Arson Investigators; International \n           Association of Fire Chiefs; Internationaal Association \n           of Fire Fighters; International Fire Service Training \n           Association; International Society of Fire Service \n           Instructors; National Fire Protection Association; \n           National Volunteer Fire Council; North American Fire \n           Training Directors.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1434\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tomorrow the President will travel to \nPhiladelphia to hold a press conference to say that the Treasury \nDepartment will start mailing the child tax credit checks tomorrow to \nmillions of Americans families. We, of course, are glad these checks \nare going out.\n  Everyone on this side of the aisle feels that way because in this \neconomy working families need all the help they can get. Unemployment \nrates are at a staggering number. They have gone up, now, in successive \nmonths. Unemployment rates around the country are the highest they have \nbeen in many years--13 years, I believe, is the number.\n  Not only are working families in need of help, but there are 12 \nmillion children who are still being left behind. Mr. President, 49 \ndays ago this body passed a bill to correct this problem. The bill \npassed by an overwhelming 94-to-2 vote. The administration said they \nsupported the Senate bill and urged the House to pass it quickly. The \nHouse passed its own bill but then turned around and voted to instruct \nthe House conferees to accept the Senate bill.\n  It sounds simple: The House, the Senate, White House, have all \nsignaled support for the Senate bill. This is a conference, then, that \nshould have taken 5 minutes. Instead, it has been more than 40 days and \nthe conferees have not even met yet.\n  The day before yesterday, Senator Lincoln proposed a new bill to \nbreak the logjam. It includes the original Senate bill that passed, 94 \nSenators for, only 2 against--a bill that helps 12 million children \nwithout adding a dime to the national debt. In addition, in a bow to \nthe House, Senator Lincoln even included the military tax bill that \npassed the Senate previously 98 to nothing. It includes many important \nprovisions, including a new deduction for expenses paid by members of \nthe National Guard and the Reserves. Every provision of the Lincoln \nbill has passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  We need to pass it today, again, to send a strong message to the \nHouse, again, before they leave for their recess in a couple of days \nfor the entire month of August plus what is left of July.\n  This legislation will help 12 million children whose parents work \nhard and are struggling to provide for their families. It also delivers \ntax reductions to our men and women in uniform who are serving and \ndefending our country. It sounds like a good combination to me.\n  As a result of that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of S. 1434, a bill to accelerate the increase in \nrefundability of the child tax credit, that the bill be read three \ntimes, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1346\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments that \nhave been made by the distinguished Senators from Maryland and \nConnecticut about the Firefighters Assistance Grants Program. It \ncertainly is a program that is very popular and it is a program that \nhas been recognized as well run. It is a program that is managed by the \nfirefighters themselves in determining which grants should be made in \ntheir regions, which items of equipment ought to be included in the \narsenal of protection for communities.\n  The only problem is, we don't have enough money in the allocation to \nthis committee to make as much of an appropriation for many of these \nprograms as we would like. We have to make choices. We had to allocate \nthe total allocation among a large number of very worthwhile, very \npopular programs.\n  I hate to put the Senate in the position of having to make choices \nhere on the floor that we labored with for weeks and months, through \nhearings with administration witnesses, through discussions among our \nstaffs and Members of the Senate, to try to identify the priorities and \nthen come to some final decision about the exact amounts to include in \nthe bill for all of these programs and activities.\n  We have just so much money to appropriate. We kept the grant program \nfor firefighter assistance at the same level as last fiscal year. In \nfact, we have included $200 million more than the President had \nrequested in his budget which was submitted to the Congress. But this \namendment would add funds that would cause the allocation to this \nsubcommittee to be exceeded in violation of the Budget Act. As I have \ndone with other amendments that have that same characteristic, I am \nconstrained to make a point of order that the amendment violates the \nBudget Act.\n  I make a point of order under subsection 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act that the amendment provides in excess of the subcommittee's \n302(b) allocation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for consideration of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Byrd, \nLevin, and Clinton be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nthe vote on the motion to waive be decided by the two leaders after \nconsultation with the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to waive.\n  With the realities of today's world, communities--both large and \nsmall--need to be prepared for the possibility of a terrorist attack. \nThe frontline counterterrorism effort is composed of what we call first \nresponders. These are the people who are first on the scene--the police \nofficers, the firefighters, the emergency medical personnel, and so on.\n  As they have always been, the men and women who serve in these \ndepartments are constantly on the job. They are always ready to fulfill \ntheir duty when their neighbors call for help. But the new threats of \nterrorism have forced these departments to refocus their training and \nrestructure their budgets to respond to these threats.\n  In many cases, the departments rely on small fundraisers to pay for \nequipment and training. However, expanded missions and continuing \nthreats are pushing the price of security too high for many rural \ncommunities to afford. Grants through the Fire Act provide funds to \nhelp offset those costs for local firefighters. Unfortunately, the \ndemand for funding has far outpaced the available dollars.\n  According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Fire \nProtection Association, only 13 percent of the fire departments have \nthe equipment and training to handle an incident involving chemical or \nbiological agents. Forty percent of fire department personnel involved \nin hazardous materials lack formal training in those duties. Only 10 \npercent of the fire departments in the United States have the personnel \nand the equipment to respond to a building collapse.\n\n[[Page S9773]]\n\n  The amendment by the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Ms. \nMikulski, and by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, \nwould infuse critical dollars into local fire departments to help meet \nthat demand.\n  The administration proposed to fold this program into a single first \nresponder grant account. I commend the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Cochran, for deciding to retain this effective program as a \nseparate account. Unfortunately, because the budget resolution resulted \nin inadequate funding for homeland security, the committee bill \nprovides only $750 million--only $5 million more than the level for the \ncurrent fiscal year. The program is authorized at a level of $900 \nmillion. The amendment would fund the program at the authorized level \nof $900 million.\n  Terrorist incidents are primarily local events. The immediate \nresponse to the attacks at the World Trade Center came from the police \nand firefighters in New York City. The immediate response to the attack \non the Pentagon came from the first responders in the neighboring \ncommunities.\n  These events bear out the critical need for well-prepared and well-\nequipped local emergency response teams. The ramifications of an ill-\nprepared local community in today's world are too large.\n  First responders will likely act alone in the initial critical \nmoments of any emergency, no matter how large or small the emergency. \nIn those moments, lives will be saved or lives will be lost. But these \nfirst responders cannot be expected to fund the fight against terrorism \nwith bake sales, ice cream suppers, and bingo nights. That is why the \nsupport of the Federal Government--both in terms of funding and \ntraining--is so important for local police, firefighters, and emergency \nmedical personnel.\n  I commend my colleagues for offering this amendment. It is a \nnecessary amendment. The cause is great. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment and infuse critical dollars into our Nation's \nfire departments.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want everyone to understand what this \namendment is. It is $150 million. That is what it is.\n  We want to acknowledge, first, our appreciation to the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Homeland Security and the ranking member for \nkeeping the fire grant program separate so that whatever funds come \nforth don't get meshed into one group called homeland security.\n  The second thing we appreciate, given the frugal allocation of the \nsubcommittee, is they did fund it at $750 million. That was very much \nappreciated. At the same time, we note that the authorization is for \n$900 million. The Mikulski-Dodd-Byrd amendment says $150 million more \nover what the committee has allocated.\n  What is $150 million worth? What would we have said on September 12? \nWould we have hung our heads in shame because we didn't add $150 \nmillion?\n  I think about the Baltimore tunnel fire when we didn't know what \ncaused it. We knew firefighters had to go down in the dark 6 feet \nthrough a manhole cover, then over a 4-foot platform, then down another \n8 or 10 feet in the total darkness with toxicity and fire.\n  Was that worth $150 million, not for them alone, but that they would \nhave the breathing apparatus, the telecommunications if they got into \ntrouble while they were figuring out the situation? We didn't know if \nBaltimore was going to explode. We didn't know if a toxic cloud was \ngoing to go over my city. But I know a group of very gallant, very \nbrave, very selfless people were willing to go down into that dark \ninferno. I don't want to ever say to somebody: We couldn't come up with \nanother $150 million to help you out.\n  Then let's go to the Rudman report. Now, we remember our dear \ncolleague from New Hampshire. He is a very frugal guy. I remember \nGramm-Rudman, Mr. Balanced Budget. So if he says we need money, we \nreally must need it because he is a tight-fisted, somewhat penny-\npinching, very conservative on the fiscal spending kind of person. So \nif Warren Rudman says America needs more resources for homeland \nsecurity, and he particularly places emphasis on the emergency \nresponders, then I think we ought to listen. What he is saying is, it \nis an emergency to provide emergency help to the emergency responders.\n  He starts his report by saying: If we knew that there was going to be \nanother terrorist attack sometime in the next 5 years but didn't know \nwhat type it would be, who would carry it out, or where it would occur, \nwhat actions would we take to prepare, and how would we allocate our \nhuman and financial resources?\n  This is not philosophy. This is a practical approach for the United \nStates of America.\n  So I appreciate everything the chairman has done, and the ranking \nmember, who himself is now supporting this amendment. We are now \nshackled by our own allocation. But we do not have to be shackled. We \nhave the parliamentary authority to waive that Budget Act that has us \nso constrained. And here is Warren Rudman, Mr. Balanced Budget, saying \nwe need more resources.\n  So I think the Congress and this Senate can vote to waive the Budget \nAct for $150 million to protect the protectors. The emergency \nresponders are drastically underfunded. They are dangerously unprepared \nnot because they want to be unprepared but because there needs to be \nthe resources. I think we need to put the resources in the Federal \ncheckbook.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, with respect to the time for the votes on \nthe two motions that are pending, motions to waive the Budget Act, I \nask unanimous consent that the votes proceed in the order in which the \nmotions were made and that the votes commence at 5 o'clock. It is my \nunderstanding that both leaders' offices have indicated that is \npermissible, and that is authorized and approved by the leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Councilman James Davis\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I come to the floor on behalf of an \namendment with regard to the homeland security funding. But I would \nlike first to recognize that a tragic shooting has occurred at city \nhall in New York City this afternoon. Councilman James Davis from \nBrooklyn, a man devoted to public service and an energetic and \noutspoken advocate for New York and the community he represented, was \nmurdered.\n  Prior to Councilman Davis's service, he served in other capacities: \nas a New York City detective, as an instructor at the police academy. \nIn 1991, he started a nonprofit organization called ``Love Yourself-\nStop the Violence'' in an effort to address growing urban violence. It \nis a tragic, terrible irony that a man who first devoted himself to \npolice work and law enforcement and then to trying his best to stem \nurban violence by giving people something to say yes to would himself \nfall victim to such violence.\n  I know the thoughts and prayers of New Yorkers go out to Councilman \nDavis's family and friends and colleagues at this difficult time. \nCertainly today's tragic event reminds us of the fragility as well as \nthe preciousness of life. Certainly it gives us pause as we confront \nthe need for us to do everything within our power on behalf of ensuring \nthe safety and security of all of our citizens.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S9774]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1348\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that homeland security block grant \nfunds should be allocated to the States using a threat-based formula \nrather than simply a per-capita formula.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I wish to inform Senators about the \nschedule. Since they pertain to amendments on our side, I will announce \nthat the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, has an amendment. She \nindicates she will need about 15 minutes. Senator Corzine has an \namendment which will require approximately the same amount of time. \nThen Senator Baucus has an amendment as well. We have about 45 minutes \nof time on our side. I assume there will be some time required on the \nmanagers' side. We expect that there will be three votes stacked at \napproximately 7:15 this evening. That may be the last business of the \nevening. But at least between now and then we will have debate on those \nthree amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I appreciate very much the advice of \nthe Senator from South Dakota, the distinguished leader. This side is \nnot going to require as much as 15 minutes per amendment. I can assure \nyou of that. We probably will not need that much time to discuss our \nviews on the amendments. We are glad the Senators are here and ready to \noffer them. We appreciate their cooperation in getting the bill moving \nalong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1348\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment which \nis at the desk numbered 1348.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator call up the amendment?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  This is an amendment that expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nhomeland security block grant fund allocated to the States be done \nusing primarily a threat-based formula rather than solely a per-capita \nformula.\n  The Homeland Security appropriations bill before us seeks to provide \ncritical homeland security resources to our first responders--our \nStates and our local communities--to help them improve our homeland \ndefense.\n  I offer this amendment to support the effort to ensure that those \nfunds are disbursed effectively. After setting forth a number of \nfindings, this amendment states that it is the sense of the Senate that \nhomeland security grants to State and local governments that contain \nthe small State minimums in the PATRIOT Act and that are disbursed by \nthe Office for Domestic Preparedness should be allocated to the States \nthrough a threat-based formula rather than a per capita formula after--\nand I stress this--after the small State minimum provision is applied.\n  I am offering this amendment because the Senate committee report \naccompanying the bill requires Secretary Ridge to distribute the State \nand local grants, other than the high-threat formula grants, on a per \ncapita basis.\n  This is obviously a bit confusing and arcane because it has to do \nwith formulas and percentages, but it is a very important issue with \nwhich we have to come to grips.\n  The last wartime supplemental that we considered, thanks to the \nefforts of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, included language in \nthe final supplemental conference report that directed Secretary Ridge \nto develop a threat-based formula for the distribution of State and \nlocal homeland security funds for fiscal year 2004.\n  This amendment is wholly consistent with that language which the \nentire Congress approved. I have said for months that we need to have a \nbetter formula for the distribution of State and local homeland \nsecurity grants based not solely on the population of a State but on a \nvariety of threat and vulnerability factors. I am sure these factors \nare ones on which we can all agree. But we are having some difficulty \nputting them into a formula that can then be used to direct the \nexpenditure of the homeland security funds.\n  I have written Secretary Ridge. I have met with him. We have talked \nabout this issue. He agrees that a better formula is needed. He has \nsaid it many times, including in testimony in April before the Senate \nCommerce Committee. At that time, Secretary Ridge told the committee he \nwants to overhaul the entire grant process to include a threat \nassessment. He has asked for guidance from Congress in designing a \nformula for distributing homeland security grant money to reflect the \nthreats and vulnerabilities of different regions within the United \nStates.\n  Here is what he specifically has to say:\n\n       The Office of Domestic Preparedness . . . had a formula \n     that we don't believe is the appropriate distribution for \n     counter terrorism [funding].\n       The formula as it exists now does not take into \n     consideration critical infrastructure, whether it's private, \n     whether they're federal, whether they're national icons.\n       The Formula doesn't really take in threat or \n     vulnerabilities.\n\n  And finally:\n\n       I suspect that reconstituting the Office for Domestic \n     Preparedness formula or coming up with something new is \n     something that we hope to achieve some bipartisan support \n     [on] and get it done and then attached to the 2004 \n     appropriations.\n\n  On this issue, I absolutely agree with Secretary Ridge. The last \nthing we should do is tie the Secretary's hands by saying he cannot use \nany formula other than a per capita formula.\n  That is not just my view but, more importantly, it is the view of \nnational experts, such as the Homeland Security Independent Task Force \nof the Council on Foreign Relations, chaired by former Senator Warren \nRudman. The task force makes it unequivocally clear that for the sake \nof our homeland defense we must employ a better formula.\n\n  The report of the task force states that they:\n\n     . . . found existing systems for determining the distribution \n     of appropriated funds [to States] to be badly in need of \n     reform.\n       The state and population-driven approach has led to highly \n     uneven funding outcomes. . . .\n       While this approach may have political appeal, it \n     unnecessarily diverts funding from areas of highest priority.\n       In addition, decisions by state officials regarding the \n     allocation of funds in their states have not sufficiently \n     taken into account the multitude of necessary factors.\n\n  Now, you see, we have a two-tiered problem. We have a problem here in \nWashington distributing the funds based on assessments of threats and \nvulnerabilities, and we have a problem in State capitals distributing \nthe funds that the States get on the same basis.\n  Based upon their assessment, the task force, under former Senator \nRudman, said:\n\n       Congress should establish a system for allocating scarce \n     resources based less on dividing the spoils and more on \n     addressing identified threats and vulnerabilities.\n       To do this, the federal government should consider such \n     factors as population, population density, vulnerability \n     assessment, and presence of critical infrastructure within \n     each state.\n\n  My amendment, expressing the sense of the Senate, sets forth those \nsame factors that I believe Secretary Ridge\n\n[[Page S9776]]\n\ncan choose to consider in developing a threat-based formula.\n  Let me make clear, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment; it is not \nauthorizing language. Let me further underscore that the small State \nminimums in the underlying bill are not affected.\n  But what then do we do with the threat assessment formula? How do we \nfigure out what factors should be considered?\n  Here are some I would recommend--obviously, starting with population. \nThat has to be the No. 1 consideration. But I would go a step further \nbecause it is not just what the census says about the population as to \nwho lives permanently in a particular city or county or region. There \nare parts of our country that have a very high tourism industry, that \nmight have a military base, that have other factors that should be \ntaken into account when we look at population.\n  As Senator Reid said yesterday, in talking about Las Vegas, the \npopulation in Nevada peaks on the weekend when thousands of people from \nall over the country and the world come to Las Vegas.\n  So in addition to population, we should consider population density, \nagain, taking into account not just who lives there every day but the \nebbs and flows in the density of the population--whether it is Orlando, \nFL, or Las Vegas, NV, or Manhattan. We should look at the proximity to \nnuclear and chemical facilities, ports, and international borders.\n  Yesterday, I referred to a GAO report when I was standing here in \nsupport of the very commonsense approach that the Byrd amendment \nrepresented. I referred to a GAO report that shows there are hundreds \nof chemical facilities in our country that contain toxic chemicals that \ncould harm thousands, if not millions, of people within the \nnear proximity. That is an issue we need to take seriously.\n\n  Similarly, nuclear powerplants--particularly the one in the county \nwhere I live, which is in a heavily populated area, in an area with \nvery narrow, winding roads--they, too, should be taken into account.\n  We should look at the location of national icons, whether it is the \nGateway Arch in St. Louis or the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco or \nany other national icon.\n  We should also begin to assess the presence and vulnerability of \nother critical infrastructure. I consider agriculture a critical \nindustry to our country. Food supplies, water, public health, emergency \nservices, the kinds of things that, if they were targeted, would \ndisrupt commerce, would dramatically impede the kind of response needed \nbecause of the potential for destruction.\n  Finally, we should be taking into account intelligence and threat \ninformation, and any other information or any other factor that the \nSecretary deems appropriate.\n  Now, reasonable people can, of course, disagree as to which factors \nshould be included and what weight should be provided to each factor. \nBut there is an absolutely clear consensus among security experts that \na better formula must be devised and used. And I have heard not just \nfrom homeland security experts on this point but from our front line \ndefenders, our first responders, or, as some of our police officers \nlike to refer to themselves, our first preventers.\n  Hopefully we can prevent tragedies, not just respond to them. It is \nnot only our police and our firefighters but our public health \nofficials and our EMTs, our mayors, our county executives who are there \non the front lines. I said the other day if we were to determine our \ndefense posture, our projection of force around the world on some kind \nof per capita basis, we would be placing soldiers in Canada and Sweden \nbecause, after all, they are there. Obviously, that is nonsensical. We \ndon't do that. We look at the threats. We try to design our weaponry \nand our other responses to take account of all the threats that \nAmerican military forces might encounter. And we should be doing the \nsame for homeland security.\n  This is a two-front war. It is not only what we are doing in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and other places, it is what we are doing to \ndefend ourselves here at home that we have to be very concerned about. \nAt the national level, if we don't take these various factors into \naccount and establish a formula, we also fail to give guidance to our \nStates. We also fail to recognize in a thorough, comprehensive way all \nof the potential vulnerabilities and targets we have.\n  For example, if one were discussing the homeland security needs of \nLouisiana, you might look at population and density, but you would also \nlook at the fact that there is a major port. There are offshore \npetroleum platforms. We have part of the strategic petroleum reserve. \nWe have river railroad crossings and facilities that are pumping \nnatural gas to the rest of the country. That would be part of the kind \nof formula I am proposing that would certainly be justifiable and give \nthe Secretary the discretion he needs.\n  There are many other places in the country that at first glance you \ndon't think of as being perhaps vulnerable or strategically located, \nbut take Lancaster County, PA. It has two nuclear powerplants on its \nborders. There are only five counties in the entire country in that \nsame position. So I would argue that kind of consideration about \ncritical infrastructure, proximity to nuclear and chemical facilities, \nshould be considered.\n  I know many of my colleagues who represent less populated States \nworry about a threat-based formula versus a per capita formula. I have \nto say I understand that. I have lived in big States and I have lived \nin small States. I have been in every State. I believe every State has \nvulnerabilities and is potentially subject to threats that need to be \nconsidered. I think it is important we look at this effort as an \nongoing one, but we have to untie the Secretary's hands. Right now he \nhas no discretion. He has no ability to deal with the grants to State \nand local communities other than on a per capita basis.\n  What that leads to is articles like we have seen recently in national \nnewspapers where money goes out in a huge amount on a per capita basis \nto less populated States, while States and cities such as New York and \nLA are trying desperately to figure out how they are going to protect \nmajor airports, all the other ports and facilities that they have, how \nthey are going to do it with the amount of money they have, given the \nbudgetary constraints that every State and city is confronting.\n  I tried in this resolution to recognize the political reality that \nexists. It retains the small State minimum. I can count and I know that \nwe are not yet at a point where we can eliminate the small State \nminimum, so it retains that. That is about 40 percent of the money \nright off the top to be distributed on a per capita basis. But that \nleaves 60 percent to begin to implement a formula that does what the \nexperts say we must do.\n\n  In closing, I believe whether we go through direct funding, which I \nstill believe is the best way to disburse money--I am hearing from a \nlot of my mayors; they still haven't gotten any of the money that has \ngone to the State capital. Again, I understand that. I know a little \nbit about the pressures on Governors. But the fact is, the money is not \ngetting down to a lot of the cities and counties that really bear the \nbrunt of homeland defense. So I still believe we should do it directly.\n  But if it is passed to the States, then we need a formula, and we \nneed a formula that gives guidance at the State level so we can get the \nmoney where it is most needed.\n  I hope we can begin to move down this road and start giving the kind \nof discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security who, after all, is \nreally on the hot seat. He is the person who gets the threat \ninformation and the intelligence. He knows exactly what is happening \nbecause he has to be briefed on it all the time. To provide him this \ndiscretion would give him the opportunity to begin to implement a \nformula which I am sure is going to be revised. The factors will \nchange. The weight will change. But we must start now; otherwise, we \nlose another year. I don't think we can afford to do that.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this resolution, give the \nauthority to the Secretary, preserve the small State minimum, but begin \nto give us some factors to gauge the threats and vulnerabilities that \nwe know the experts know, but mostly our police and firefighters know \nthey are facing every single day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator makes a point that certainly \nought to be considered by the Senate, but it ought to be considered \nfirst by the Governmental Affairs Committee which has jurisdiction over \nthe law that created the Department and the grant programs under which \nthe Department administers the programs and distributes funds to the \nStates.\n  There was a per State minimum provided in the law that established \nthe Department of Homeland Security. Just recently, the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs undertook a review of that basic law, and they \nreported out a bill, S. 1245. It deals with the issue of formulas under \nwhich funds are allocated to the States. As a matter of fact, it \nspecifically provides for the continuation of the State minimum funding \ngrant to each State based on population. But it also takes into account \nhigh threat areas, large State and large city problems that exist, and \nprovides for special grants to be made to those areas of the country. \nWe already have, for example, the high threat urban area \nclassification, and funds are allocated to those States and those areas \nthat are under higher threats or have higher vulnerability in addition \nto the funds they get on a per capita basis.\n  My point in mentioning this and stating these facts is to say that \nthis is not the time or the place for the Senate to deal with this \nissue. The time will be when this bill, S. 1245, is taken up by the \nSenate. It was just reported out of the committee on June 12, 2003. The \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, is chairman of that \ncommittee. She has indicated to me, with a note yesterday, that this \nbill had been reported out. So if any issue came up about formula \ngrants and how funds were being distributed, it had already been \nconsidered by her committee and legislation had been reported on that \nsubject.\n  What the Senator from New York is asking us to do tonight, even \nthough this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, is to go on record \nsaying the formulas under which the funds are being appropriated by \nthis bill are inappropriately distributed. They are being distributed \nunder the auspices of current law, and so she is asking us to disagree \nwith the content of current law and suggests that some different \ndistribution be made by this bill.\n  We can't do that. We can't accommodate that. The time for changing \nthe formulas and changing the way the distributions are made will be \nwhen the Senate turns to the consideration of this reported \nlegislation.\n  It is for those reasons and not to argue that there are needs in \nStates that have cities such as New York City and others. New York City \nalready gets way beyond what any other city gets because it is a high \nthreat urban area. We have charts. Everybody can have access to see how \nmuch each State gets. The Senator has already pointed out how some \nStates appear to get more per capita than the big States, and they \ndo. But what happens is, this is made up for in other programs that \nprovide funds to those high-threat urban areas, and it is dealt with in \nthis other legislation.\n\n  So it will be my intention to respond to any questions that I can \nanswer. I wish the distinguished Senator from Maine were here because \nshe knows more about the details than I do. But I will try to respond \nto any questions the Senator from New York has. Then it is my intention \nto move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in response to the Senator, the \nchairman, I only point out that the Senate committee report \naccompanying the bill requires the Secretary to distribute the State \nand local grants, other than the high-stress grants, on a per-capita \nbasis. I applaud the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee for \nthe work she has done because, under her leadership, there has been a \ntremendous effort undertaken to begin the process to authorize the \nchanges in formula.\n  This authorizing legislation will come before the Congress, I hope, \nthis year. I hope it is passed this year. But it will not influence the \nappropriations we are considering today, and, therefore, the \nSecretary--even if he were to pick up the legislation from the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, read it, and say he agrees 100 \npercent--would not be able to do anything about it.\n  What this sense-of-the-Senate amendment tries to do is to give at \nleast some encouragement, and hopefully it could become more specific \nin the conference report to the Secretary, that based on factors such \nas those in the Governmental Affairs legislation and the work of the \ncommittee under Senator Rudman, there would be an opportunity to begin \nto actually do this, instead of waiting for another year and a half to \nfigure out what the appropriations would be.\n  So I certainly understand the chairman's perspective that this is not \nauthorizing legislation. That is why what I have is a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment. The work the Senator from Maine has done is extremely \nimportant work, but I worry about the time lag because since the Senate \ncommittee report says that Secretary Ridge cannot distribute on any \nbasis other than per capita, the good work of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and the recommendations of experts is going to be once again \nin suspended animation. The Secretary will find himself once again \nhaving to follow what is, by all accounts, an outdated formula in the \nface of the most pressing homeland security challenges that we \nconfront.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will at least give a little bit of wiggle \nroom, some discretion to Secretary Ridge, especially based on the good \nwork done by the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New York \ntoday. The Senator's amendment is on a subject of great importance to \neach and every Senator, and that is how best to divide up the homeland \nsecurity funds to ensure we get the most from the resources we are \ninvesting. It is a subject that falls within the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee, which I am privileged to chair.\n  The committee held three hearings on this topic. We have heard from \nfirefighters, police officers, mayors, Governors, State emergency \nmanagement directors, county officials, and from Secretary Ridge. As a \nresult of these hearings, I developed bipartisan legislation, which the \ncommittee has unanimously approved. That legislation is cosponsored by \nSenators Carper, Rockefeller, Voinovich, Feingold, Sununu, Coleman, \nPryor, Allard, Akaka, Hagel, Burns, Chafee, Roberts, Dorgan, Chambliss, \nand Ben Nelson. In other words, it has widespread support.\n  Dealing with formula issues is very difficult. They are not easy. \nThey affect us all and we want to make sure we get it right.\n  The legislation we reported last month addresses the very issues the \nSenator from New York has brought up and is seeking to address on the \nappropriations bill. There is much I agree with in the amendment of the \nSenator from New York. I don't agree with her treatment of small \nStates, because although she keeps the small-State minimum, as I read \nthe language, she would treat the current .75 allocation as a ceiling. \nThat is not the way it would be done under the legislation I have \nauthored, nor is that the way that small States are handled under \ncurrent law.\n  But there is much I agree with in the Senator's approach. We need to \nidentify high-threat areas and we need to do vulnerability assessments. \nThat means looking at military installations, ports, and looking at \nwhether the State is a border State. There are many issues that need to \nbe considered.\n  Our legislation carefully crafts a formula and fills out the outlines \nof the homeland security grants, which were treated only in a single \nparagraph in the original legislation creating the Department of \nHomeland Security. We have made sure the money is passed on quickly, \nfor example, from States to local governments and to the first \nresponders. We have simplified the application process from 12 steps to \n2. We have done away with a mountain of the paperwork and bureaucracy \nthat has frustrated our State and local governments. And, yes, we call \nfor an allocation right off the top for high-threat\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\nareas and for vulnerability assessments.\n  Any modifications to the formulas for homeland security grants should \nbe considered in a comprehensive, careful manner, as the committee has \ndone. If the committee had not acted on this important issue, I would \nbe more sympathetic to the arguments made by the Senator from New York. \nBut, in fact, the committee has acted. We have held several hearings. \nWe have reported legislation, which is pending for consideration by the \nfull Senate.\n  If we attempt to change the formula on an ad hoc basis, we may end up \nwith unintended consequences and a State may end up with insufficient \nhomeland security resources. We obviously are very stressed because of \nbudget constraints. We need to make sure the formula is carefully done. \nI believe the appropriations bill is not the right vehicle to pass \nimportant authorizing legislation affecting the allocation of funds. \nFor this reason, I have not sought to attach my own bill to the \nappropriations vehicle, nor pieces of it, tempted though I am. Nor do I \nthink the well-intentioned amendment of the Senator from New York, \nwhich calls for a change in the funding formula, which is directly in \nthe jurisdiction of my committee, should be adopted on this \nappropriations bill.\n\n  I want to make an offer to the Senator from New York to work closely \nwith her. New York obviously has challenges that are enormous when it \ncomes to homeland security. I am very sympathetic to what a high-risk, \nhigh-vulnerability State the Senator so ably represents. So I want to \nwork with her further on this as we bring our legislation to the floor. \nBut I am reluctantly going to oppose the sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nof the Senator from New York because, frankly, it doesn't belong on \nthis bill, particularly when the committee of jurisdiction has acted to \nbring forth carefully crafted, bipartisan legislation to deal with this \nvery issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nleadership and her very obvious concern about these issues. I \nparticularly appreciate her concern about New York and what we are \ncontending with in New York, not just in New York City but throughout \nour State.\n  I would very much appreciate the opportunity to work with the Senator \nfrom Maine on this issue. I worry a little bit, and perhaps there is \nsome way, working with the able chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee--and I hope her legislation will pass very soon because it \nis a long overdue revamping of how to deal with this issue--that we \nwould be able to give some discretion to the Secretary going forward \nand not have to wait until the next appropriations process.\n  It is, from my perspective, based particularly on the insights and \nrecommendations of many of the security experts, an issue we are \nurgently facing. With the Senator's very able stewardship of this \nlegislation and getting it through on the authorizing committee, I look \nforward to working with her and doing everything I can to help move \nthat legislation forward. I hope there is some way we can figure out \nhow to give the Secretary some discretion in the meantime, especially \nbased on the work the committee has done, the factors the Senator has \ntaken into account so we do not lose another year. That is my main \nconcern as I stand here today.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Maine for her extraordinary work \nand leadership, and I look forward to working with her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe disposition of the Clinton amendment, the amendments that will next \nbe offered will be the Corzine amendment on chemical security for 20 \nminutes for Senator Corzine and 10 minutes for Senator Cochran, then \nthe Schumer-Baucus northern security amendment with 25 minutes total \nfor both Senators and Senator Cochran 10 minutes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the debate in relation \nto the amendments, the Senate vote, if necessary, in relation to the \nClinton amendment No. 1348, to be followed by a vote in relation to the \nCorzine amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Schumer-\nBaucus amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate for each amendment in the stacked sequence and, \nfurther, that no second-degree amendments be in order to the amendments \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object--and Senator Clinton is \nstanding next to me--based on the colloquy on the amendment that has \ntaken place in the last 40 minutes, Senator Clinton has indicated she \nwill withdraw her amendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1348 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Clinton, I ask \nunanimous consent to withdraw her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nClinton amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest propounded by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished assistant \nleader from Nevada, and I thank the distinguished Senator from New York \nand the distinguished Senator from Maine, as well, for the discussion \nwe have had on the issue of formulas. I look forward to joining them in \na careful consideration of the issues that have been discussed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1350\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I send an amendment to \nthe desk on behalf of myself, Senator Edwards, Senator Lautenberg, and \nothers, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine], for himself, Mr. \n     Edwards, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1350.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To appropriate $80,000,000 for the Office of the Under \n  Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection to \n            conduct chemical facility security assessments)\n\n       On page 66, strike lines 9 and 10, and insert the \n     following:\n     $903,700,000, to remain available until September 30, 2005; \n     of which $80,000,000 shall be for chemical facility security \n     assessments.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this amendment \naddresses one of the most serious security threats facing the American \npeople. As I will indicate later, this is not an assertion I make alone \nbut an assertion made by a broad range of security experts, including \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security: the threat of a terrorist attack on \nour Nation's chemical facilities.\n  There are literally thousands of chemical producers, refineries, and \nsimilar facilities throughout the United States where the release of \nchemicals can kill or injure literally tens of thousands and, in many \ninstances, millions of Americans through exposure to highly toxic \ngases. That is why these facilities are potentially so attractive to \nterrorists. That is why security officials indicate that point.\n  From a practical viewpoint, often these facilities are located in the \nmost densely populated communities across our Nation. The legacies of \nthe great era of American manufacturing were practiced in our urban \ncommunities and continue to be in many instances today. New Jersey \nhappens to be one of those communities that is densely populated--it is \nthe most densely populated State in the Nation, and many of these \nfacilities with exposures to over 1 million people are located in my \nState.\n  Unfortunately, there are currently no Federal security standards for \nchemical facilities, none. So the private sector has been left to do as \nit sees appropriate on a completely voluntary basis. There are some \nvery positive actions by some in the industry to make sure that \nsecurity and safety at\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\nthe plants is attended to. There are good standards being promoted by \ntrade associations. But far too many of the facilities across this \ncountry have not stepped up to meet their responsibilities. Far too \nmany continue to be vulnerable to attack.\n  Time after time we have seen press reports and other indications that \nour chemical facilities are not properly secure, and there has been \nvery little effort to improve the safety of the processing in many \nplants. Put literally, millions of Americans are at risk.\n  A recent report by the conference board, by the way, that confirms \nthis shows there has been a very limited increase in expenditures at \npublicly held companies in this country. Less than 4 percent at the \nmedian, and very little, according to many of the anecdotal pieces of \ninformation we have been able to find with regard to chemical plants.\n  According to the EPA, there are 123 facilities in 24 States where a \nchemical release could expose more than 1 million people to highly \ntoxic chemicals. There are about 750 facilities in 39 States where a \nchemical release could expose more than 100,000 people to these \nchemicals. Thirty-nine States have that kind of exposure.\n  I have with me a map that shows how many of these facilities are \nlocated in each State. This really is a broad-based national issue. \nThere are nearly 3,000 facilities spread across 49 States where a \nchemical release could expose more than 10,000 people. These are \nstaggering numbers representing a broad vulnerability across America.\n  The consequences of an attack on a chemical plant are potentially \nhorrific, and it is hard for any of us to even imagine. Think back to \n1983 in Bhopal, India, where over 3,000 people died and innumerable \ninjuries and problems in health still linger today. I would argue that \nour Nation appears to be in denial about this problem. If anything, \nSeptember 11 taught us that we cannot avoid thinking about the \nunthinkable. We have to face up to the Nation's most serious \nvulnerabilities. We have to focus on them and confront them head on. If \nwe look at what has been identified by security experts and the people \nat the Department of Homeland Security, we will draw that conclusion.\n  I repeat one of the statistics I mentioned: There are 123 chemical \nfacilities around our Nation that could threaten more than 1 million \nAmerican lives in their immediate vicinity. To bring this home, there \nare eight of these facilities in my home State of New Jersey, one that \nhas the potential to expose over 8 million people in the Greater New \nJersey-New York region with a toxic cloud. Think about that, 8 million \npeople located smack dab in the middle of one of the most densely \npopulated areas in our country.\n  These facilities pose a severe threat to public safety. They have \nserious weapons that could be used against the American people and \ncause massive injuries and death. Loaded with chemicals such as \nchlorine, ammonia, and hydrogen fluoride, chemicals that serve an \nimportant industrial function, they could be instantly transformed into \na weapon of mass destruction at the hands of a terrorist.\n  I am not arguing that many are not doing what they are supposed to be \ndoing. I see great activity about security and safety in many of the \npharmaceutical plants in New Jersey.\n  There are many who are not stepping up to the plate to make sure the \npublic is protected, and this is not just my opinion. Again, it has \nbeen documented by experts in the administration and the like. On March \n18, the General Accounting Office issued a new report on this matter. \nGAO found that chemical facilities may be attractive targets for \nterrorists because of the extent of harm they could inflict.\n  If one is trying to find a way to seriously impact broad numbers of \nthe population, this is how GAO says terrorists might actually \naccomplish that. GAO goes on to say: There are no Federal laws \nrequiring chemical facilities to assess vulnerabilities, to take \naction, to safeguard against these attacks. GAO recommended that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the EPA jointly develop a strategy, \nincluding legislative proposal, to address the threats of attacks on \nchemical facilities.\n  The GAO report was released on March 18 of this year, but only one \nmonth earlier the Department of Homeland Security itself sounded the \nalarm about the threat facing chemical facilities. In the bulletin \nissued on February 12 of this year, when we moved to code orange, the \nDepartment stated:\n\n       Al-Qaida operatives also may attempt to launch conventional \n     attacks against U.S. nuclear/chemical-industrial \n     infrastructure to cause contamination, disruption and terror.\n\n  In our releases to our own people across this country, we identify \nthis as a vulnerability. We ask our local law enforcement to protect \nthe American people.\n\n       Based on information, nuclear power plants and industrial \n     chemical plants remain viable targets.\n\n  Now I go back to October 6 of last year. On that day, Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Ridge and EPA Administrator Whitman had a letter of \ntheirs published in the Washington Post. In that letter they stated:\n\n       The Bush administration is committed to reducing the \n     vulnerability of America's chemical facilities to terrorist \n     attack and is working to enact bipartisan legislation that \n     would require such facilities to address their \n     vulnerabilities.\n\n  That was on October 6 last year. I think this is July 23.\n  The letter goes on to state:\n\n       We applaud the voluntary efforts some in the industry have \n     undertaken--\n\n  By the way, I do as well--\n\n       but we believe that every one of the 15,000 chemical \n     facilities nationwide that contain large quantities of \n     hazardous chemicals must be required to take the steps the \n     industry leaders are taking at their facilities: performing \n     comprehensive vulnerability assessments and then acting to \n     reduce those vulnerabilities.\n\n  Yet in spite of all of these public acknowledgments, comments and \nstatements, we still have not been able to enact chemical security \nlegislation. I introduced a bill back in October of 2001, and did a lot \nof compromising with a lot of folks on the EPW committee, addressing \nindustry concerns. We reported out a bill 19 to 0. I reintroduced that \nlegislation in this Congress. In April, I offered the bill with further \nmodifications as an amendment to the Defense supplemental \nappropriations bill. The amendment was defeated on a point of order. In \nthat bill, I actually included additional funds to help facilitate \nputting in security elements to make sure industry believed we were \nworking as partners to accomplish it.\n  I will not be offering that legislation on this appropriations bill. \nI know it would be subject to a point of order. But I simply cannot let \nthis legislation go through without drawing attention to an issue that \njust lingers and lingers. For the people of the State of New Jersey, \nand I know in all of these other States that I just talked about, this \nis a serious risk as we go forward.\n  In that regard, I want to commend Senator Byrd for recognizing the \nimportance of this issue and including chemical security as a priority \nin his amendment yesterday. More than any other Senator, the senior \nSenator from West Virginia has consistently demanded that we do more on \nhomeland security than talk about it. So I thank him for his leadership \non homeland security in general, and more specifically for his \nattention to chemical plant security.\n  The amendment Senator Edwards and I are offering today is the \nchemical security portion of Senator Byrd's amendment. It appropriates \n$80 million for the Department to conduct vulnerability assessments at \nchemical facilities--simple, with none of the other stuff that is such \nan onerous problem for the industry. Just get an assessment of what the \nrisks are.\n  We would not tolerate this with our nuclear plants in this country. \nWe check them out all the time. We have a whole infrastructure to do \nit. We have these plants located--again, 123 right in the middle of our \nmost vulnerable areas, our most densely populated areas. This $80 \nmillion is the amount the Congressional Budget Office has estimated it \nwill cost to conduct vulnerability assessments nationwide.\n  Some have questioned whether we should legislate this as a priority. \nThey argue that we have funds in the bill that could be used for this \npurpose and that we should let the Department identify infrastructure \npriorities as they see fit. That certainly does not jibe with the \nlanguage I have heard Secretary Ridge, EPA Director Whitman, the GAO, \nand others talk about,\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\nand I would respond that chemical plants have consistently been \nidentified by every security expert and leader as a top priority. They \nmust be addressed.\n  Last week, Rand Beers, who until recently was a senior director for \ncombating terrorism on the Bush administration National Security \nCouncil, was asked the following question:\n\n       When we think about homeland security, what specifically \n     concerns you?\n\n  To which Mr. Beers replied:\n\n       We have looked at the chemical industries around the \n     country and have a very serious concern. There are a number \n     of these plants in locations around the country where an \n     explosion would create a catastrophic result which could \n     approximate the World Trade Center. These are areas where we \n     need the Federal Government to give the chemical industry the \n     guidelines that are necessary in order to protect those \n     plants, because for the plants to simply do it on their own \n     is going to create a great disadvantage to those who do and \n     an advantage to those who don't because it will cost money. \n     So it ought to be evened out across the industry.\n\n  I wish I had been as articulate as Mr. Beers. That is exactly what we \nneed to be doing. By the way, it is unfair for those who are actually \ndealing with the problem relative to those who walk away from their \nresponsibility in their communities.\n  Chemical plants were the first thing on Mr. Beers' list, and we have \ndone nothing to address this threat. I think it is appropriate that we \ndeal with it and give direction to the Department in this regard. This \namendment, which would fund vulnerability assessments, is a positive \nstep. It is one that we ought to take today. I also want to make it \nclear it is a first step, and we need to do more.\n\n  After we appropriate these funds, we will still have the task of \npassing authorizing legislation to assure appropriate security \nstandards and accountability mechanisms are put in place, as Mr. Beers \nalluded to in his comments. We just have to get moving on this issue.\n  Earlier in the year, Senator Inhofe introduced his own bill on \nchemical plant security. There is much in that bill that I find \npositive. It does not go far enough, in my view, but it is a good first \nstep. It is a great place to start. We need to get moving on this \nissue. We have people exposed to vulnerability that almost everyone \nrecognizes and identifies. I think we need to get moving in the \nCongress, and I think the administration needs to step forward also.\n  Despite consistent statements in support of the concept of the \nlegislation, it has not been pushed as a priority on the agenda. So I \nam calling on the President and Secretary Ridge to move on this issue. \nMy goal is to truly develop bipartisan legislation, an effective \napproach that deals with the real vulnerability that we have; one that \ncan move through this body and the House and be signed into law. For \nnow, as a first step toward securing chemical plants, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this simple amendment which will provide $80 \nmillion to the Department of Homeland Security to conduct vulnerability \nassessments at chemical plants. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment will add $80 \nmillion to the appropriations for the Office of Under Secretary for \nInformation Analysis and Infrastructure Protection, and it is earmarked \nspecifically to conduct chemical facilities security assessments. Our \nbill provides a total of $823,700,000 for the information, analysis, \nand infrastructure protection operating expenses.\n  The Senator adds his $80 million to that account and earmarks it for \nchemical facilities. There is no offset for this amendment. Therefore, \nit violates the Budget Act inasmuch as it surpasses the allocation \navailable to the subcommittee to use in writing this bill. At the \nappropriate time I will make a point of order that it violates the \nBudget Act in that it is spending in excess of the subcommittee's \nallocation. I assume the Senator will move to waive the Budget Act and \nget the yeas and nays and the vote will occur on the motion to waive \nthe Budget Act. That is my expectation. I am hopeful the Senate will \nrefuse to waive the Budget Act.\n  What we are doing if we start down this path is not only adding money \nthat is not available to the subcommittee, but we are earmarking \nspecific, critical infrastructure facilities and telling the Department \nhow much money they should spend on each one, or selected ones. It \ndeprives them of the flexibility they need to use the funds they are \ngiven under this legislation to assign priorities as they understand \nthe threats. Changing threats could mean a change in the areas where \nthey are concentrating their activities and assessing the security of \nspecific facilities in addition to chemical facilities.\n  Chemical facilities, incidentally, are considered critical \ninfrastructure and they are defined as such in the bill. So there is no \nrestriction for this agency to use the funds appropriated in this act \nfor the purposes of assessing the security needs of chemical \nfacilities.\n  I don't know how much time remains for the Senator, but I don't \nintend to debate this any further. When the time of the Senator is \nyielded back or used, I will make the point of order.\n  I make the point of order under section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act that the amendment provides spending in excess of the \nsubcommittee 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \n74, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for the \npurposes of the pending amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, every department head, including the \nDirector of Homeland Security, Secretary Ridge, has identified this as \na priority. They have earmarked it, but we have yet to see the actual \ndollars flowing to meet the challenge that occurs in this area. Each \nday that goes by is another day of exposure to literally millions of \nAmericans.\n  Given it is identified over and over again in the rhetoric and the \nmemoranda to first responders across the country, in times of high \ntension and vulnerability, it seems to me we ought to single this out \nin a context that makes this a vulnerability that we will address. That \nis what my amendment is trying to do.\n  We have procrastinated long enough on an issue that is very important \nto the entire Nation with regard to these very serious \nvulnerabilities--100,000 Americans or more are at risk in 39 States. \nThere are 123 facilities that expose more than 1 million people. That \nis why I make a point of bringing this up.\n  I appreciate the comments. I hope, with the dialog we are having, we \nwill encourage the Homeland Security Department to be cognizant of the \nneed to make these vulnerability assessments.\n  I yield back the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1351\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is the Schumer-Baucus \namendment. Under the previous order the Senator from Montana or the \nSenator from New York is to be recognized.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am awaiting the arrival of my colleague \nfrom New York to offer the amendment. It is his amendment and I am a \ncosponsor. Pending his arrival, I will make a couple of statements. I \ndo not have the amendment with me.\n  I am pleased to join with the Senator from New York, essentially \noffering an amendment that provides additional funds to increase the \nnumber of border personnel protecting the more than 5,000 miles of \nborder we share with Canada.\n  It goes without saying that protecting this great Nation is the most \nimportant responsibility facing the Congress and the administration. \nCertainly enhancing border security is critically important in the wake \nof September 11, 2001. The need for increased security against threats \nfrom outside and within our country is evident.\n  Over the years our borders have seen a rise in the number of illegal \naliens trying to gain entry into our country.\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\nThese individuals are using whatever means possible to get into this \ncountry, some to seek a better life, others to traffic in illegal and \nharmful activities, and some with even more nefarious goals.\n  Clearly, we must do more to control and prevent illegal entry into \nthe United States. How do we do that? What is the best way? One, \nclearly, is to invest in advanced surveillance technology and \ncommunication systems that allow enforcement personnel to monitor the \nflow of individuals entering this country. All personnel involved with \nborder security and law enforcement need to be able to communicate with \neach other effectively. Currently, it is very difficult for them to do \nso.\n  Illegal entry is usually gained somewhere along the vast 5,000-mile \nborder between border stations. Sometimes it is at the border stations, \nbut often it is in between them, in the mountains, in the plains, and \nthe unobserved areas. In the mountains of northern Montana, for \nexample, electronic sensors have recently picked up 1,000 crossings \nbetween Canada and the United States. Not one arrest was made from any \nof those sensor signals. What were those crossings? Who were they? What \nwere they? Could it be wild animals, backpackers, illegal aliens? No \none knows. Why? Because of the lack of personnel and proper equipment, \nwe can only guess. We do not know what type of activity the sensors are \npicking up and what is crossing our borders.\n  The security of our Nation affects everyone. My example points out \nthat the State of Montana faces unique issues regarding homeland \nsecurity. Montana has the longest border with Canada in the lower 48 \nStates. We border three Canadian provinces with a northern border of \nroughly 600 miles. Controlling the traffic of people coming in and out \nof the country through Montana is difficult, to say the least. People \nworking at the border stations or near the border stations are \nextremely frustrated because of inadequate personnel, because of the \ninability of personnel to communicate with each other--regardless of \nwhat agency it might be. It might be DEA; it might be Immigration; it \nmight be Customs. There are lots of agencies and each has different \ncommunications facilities. They have a hard time talking with each \nother.\n  In addition, there are very few personnel along that entire border.\n  Along with the sheer length of the border, the topography of the \nregion makes patrolling it a terrific challenge. A lot of my colleagues \nhave spoken to me and said how much they like visiting Montana because \nof the beauty of the State, particularly Glacier Park. It takes a lot \nof work to hike over those mountains and it is very difficult to \nprotect that border with Canada. Then in eastern Montana, as far as the \neye can see, are vast plains and it is very easy to cross the border \nfrom the United States through Montana.\n  Glacier National Park is located in the northwestern corner of our \nState. It crosses over to the Province of Alberta and the Province of \nBritish Columbia. It has sharp mountains and rugged peaks; it is \nwilderness but also an area that requires increased resources to \nmonitor because it is so difficult to monitor that part of the border.\n  The U.S. Park Service is responsible for the security of our national \nparks. The National Park Rangers patrol the 40 miles of the \ninternational border that lies within Glacier Park with little \nincreases in funding for park security.\n  Park services are already strained, our national parks are already \nstrained for resources, and we need a vast increase in them, in my \njudgment. With the additional terrorism threat that faces our country, \nwe have additional pressure for more resources to protect our borders.\n  I believe homeland security is of the utmost importance and our \nborder agencies, law enforcement, and the National Park Service need a \nlot of help. If we do not increase the technology, if we do not \nincrease the personnel needed for border security, we will certainly \ncontinue to see more individuals who will enter our country through the \nremote areas of the border, particularly in my State of Montana. We \ndon't like it. We are very concerned.\n  There are also drugs coming down because of the inadequate number of \npersonnel and inadequate equipment the current personnel have. Our \ncountry must do more to increase the number of border personnel to \nprevent this unwanted traffic.\n  Finally, we need to continue working with our neighbor to the north, \ncontinue working with Canada to secure our Nation's northern border, \ntheir southern border. We can do this with coordinated law enforcement \noperations, through intelligence sharing and infrastructure \nimprovements but, again, this cannot be done just on the basis of \nwords. It can only be done with effective manpower, with proper \ntechnology, and with good communication systems. It is clearly \ninadequate today.\n  I am pleased today to join with Senator Schumer to offer an amendment \nthat will provide an additional $200 million to increase the number of \nborder personnel. This will enhance our ability to conduct inspections \nof people and goods entering our country. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  This is not an idle statement; this is very important. If the \nPresiding Officer, who comes from a State which also borders with \nCanada, were joined with me in explaining to our colleagues just how \nimportant it is to protect that border and how easy it is to cross that \nborder undetected--I am certain in the home State of the Presiding \nOfficer it is almost as easy as in my State of Montana let alone other \nWestern States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I guess it will be \nopposed, but, frankly, $200 million for additional border security I \nthink is an investment very well worth it. It is an investment we must \nmake.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Baucus, spoke on this amendment but I believe it has not been \nsent to the desk yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself and \n     Mr. Baucus, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Leahy, and Ms. Stabenow, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1351.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make available an additional $200,000,000 to increase the \nnumber of border personnel at the northern border of the United States \n                    by the end of fiscal year 2004)\n\n       In title III under the heading ``salaries and expenses'' \n     under the heading ``Customs and Border Protection'', strike \n     ``$4,366,000,000,'' and insert ``$4,566,000,000, of which not \n     to exceed $200,000,000 shall be available to assist the \n     Department of Homeland Security in increasing the number of \n     border personnel at the northern border of the United States \n     by the end of fiscal year 2004 as authorized by section 402 \n     of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \n     Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct \n     Terrorism (USA PATRIOT Act) of 2001 (115 Stat. 342), and may \n     be transferred by the Secretary of Homeland Security to the \n     salaries and expenses account of the Bureau of Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement;''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, my good colleague from Montana is from a \nState that is quite different from mine. He has summed up this bill \nwell. We are from different States but we face the same problem, and \nthat is our northern border is not guarded as well as it should be.\n  Frankly, I think our country has done a very good job on the southern \nborder. We have had lots of problems there in the past. The various \ngovernmental agencies, prodded in part by this body and the other body, \ndid a good job tightening things up.\n  There was really no need to tighten up the northern border until 9/\n11. But what we have learned is that the terrorists know what we are \ndoing. They can log onto the Internet, even if they are in a cave in \nAfghanistan, as long as they have a wireless connection, and can learn \nwhat we are doing. So they know what we all know: The southern border \nis pretty well guarded but the northern border is not.\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\n  As a result, we have seen that various terrorists and others who seek \nto do damage to our country, evil acts in our country, perhaps, have \nstarted crossing at the northern border. It is a massive border. It has \n128 ports of entry. It is 5,500 miles long. Large parts of it are \ntotally unguarded. Some of it is water. The Canadian border that New \nYork State shares with Canada is bounded by Lake Ontario and by the \nNiagara River and by the St. Lawrence River. It is a beautiful border, \nit is a peaceful border, but unfortunately it can be used by bad people \nfor evil purpose.\n  The challenge we face is we have trade with Canada. Western New York, \nthe north country in New York State depend on that trade. Yet we need \nto be more secure. Can we have security and commerce? Is there a \ntradeoff between one and the other? Only if we do not provide the \nresources. If we provide the resources for personnel, for equipment, \nfor technology, we can have the best of both worlds--a northern border \nthat is secure and a northern border where a free flow of commerce \noccurs. It is extremely important. Canada is my State's biggest trading \npartner. Last year we exported $9 billion worth of merchandise to the \nnorth.\n  In order to do what we do, we need a three-pronged approach. We must \nfirst have the technological programs such as FAST, NEXUS, and US \nVISIT. We need the VACIS radiological detection program. And, most \nimportant, we need sufficient staffing at the border.\n  We recognized this in the PATRIOT Act, where we authorized a tripling \nof Immigration, Customs, and Border Patrol. I have to be honest; it is \nnot that this country has done nothing. There are now more people \nguarding northern borders than there were in September 2001. There were \n2,300 in September 2001; there are now about 5,000. That is a \nsignificant advance and I am not critical of that advance; I think it \nis a good one.\n  But my motto in the post-9/11 world is a simple one: You can't be too \ncareful. This is a greater expense but we need it. We need it both so \ncommerce continues--I know your State, Mr. President, depends on that \ncommerce as well--and we need it so our people can be more secure.\n  There should be, according to the PATRIOT Act, not just 5,000 men and \nwomen guarding that border, which there will be in September of 2004, \nbut 6,900. That is a shortfall of 27 percent. We will basically have \nonly three-quarters of the men and women at the northern border we \npublicly promised to station there.\n  That is less than one person per mile of the border.\n  The amendment of my good friend from Montana and I--again, from \ncompletely different States but who share the same problem of a border \nthat is guarded better than before but still not well enough--allocates \n$200 million to the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection for the \nexpress purpose of adding new personnel to the northern border. We give \nthe Department of Homeland Security flexibility to transfer these funds \nto the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement if needed to meet \nthe PATRIOT Act goals.\n  I urge that we support it.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for \nthe purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is not in order at this time.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the amendment offered by Senators Schumer \nand Baucus increases the funding available for personnel along the \nnorthern border by $200 million to meet a level of personnel authorized \nby the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  This amendment is identical to the portion of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, yesterday on which a point \nof order was made and the motion to waive failed. So the amendment was \nnot agreed to.\n  I will make the same statements I made yesterday but in a different \nway--it won't be exactly the same--to explain why the funding made \navailable in the bill has gone a long way toward achieving the goal. In \nfact, before the end of this fiscal year of 2004, there will be the \nnumber of agents anticipated and contemplated by the USA PATRIOT Act, \nand they are funded in the legislation that is before the Senate now.\n  Since fiscal year 2002, more than 5,000 additional inspectors, \nspecial acts, and Border Patrol agents have been funded by the \nCongress. The supplemental included $75 million for additional staffing \nfor the northern border and maritime ports of entry. It also included \n$25 million to transfer 285 Border Patrol agents to the northern \nborder.\n  The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection reports that over 4,000 \ninspectors have been added since September 11, 2001. Over 1,000 \ninspectors have been added to the northern border since 9/11; 613 \nBorder Patrol agents are assigned to the northern border compared to \n368 before September 11, 2001.\n  Commissioner Bonner plans to have 1,000 agents on the northern border \nby October of this year. When the new agents funded in the bill are \ncounted, there will be over 11,600 Border Patrol agents in fiscal year \n2004. This bill includes the maximum number of new border agents that \ncan be absorbed in 1 year.\n  But for the purpose of our discussion on this specific amendment, I \nam constrained to point out that the amendment provides spending in \nexcess of our allocation under the Budget Act and, therefore, I am \nconstrained to make a point of order, and do hereby make a point of \norder, under section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the \namendment provides spending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purpose of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLevin be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back all time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield all of the time available to me \nunder the order.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1350\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to the vote in relation to the Corzine amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the 2 minutes \navailable to me, if the other side will yield back its time. I think \nthe amendment has been fully debated. It was simply put in order of \nreservation to protect the Senators who wanted to speak in addition to \nthose 20 minutes that were provided to Senator Corzine and 10 minutes \nto me under the order. I have no need of expressing myself again on \nthis subject. I yield back the 2 minutes available to me under the \norder.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I will reiterate the strong feeling that \nwe need to address chemical plant security in this Nation. There has \nnot been the attention that is due to the millions and millions of \nAmericans who are exposed to the potential for toxic fumes from a \npotential terrorist attack.\n  These plants are identified as one of most vulnerable elements by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. They are cited in each of the notices \nto move to code orange as requiring the attention of local law \nenforcement and the providers of safety for communities. I think it is \ntime for Congress to take action to assess these vulnerabilities on a \ncomplete basis. I hope we will come back and have some stricter \nrequirements that will also deal with it. But that is the first step.\n  I appreciate the help of my colleagues and urge support of the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act in relation to the Corzine amendment No. 1350. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes evenly divided prior to the vote in relation to the Schumer \namendment.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will soon yield a minute to my \ncolleague from Montana. The amendment is very simple. It brings up what \nwe promised in the PATRIOT Act--funding for northern border personnel.\n  Right now, we have increased the personnel on the northern border, \nbut we have not increased them to a level even close to the level we \nmentioned in the PATRIOT Act. The northern border has become the border \nof choice for those who want to infiltrate into this country and do \nreal harm. It makes eminent sense to spend a relatively small amount of \nmoney--$200 million--to fulfill our promise and bring the Border Patrol \nand others, including Customs, to that border so we can have both \ncommerce and security. We can have both if we provide the dollars.\n  I yield the remaining time to my friend from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a great amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment would exceed by a \nsubstantial amount the 302(b) allocation, if it were agreed to, that \nthe subcommittee had to appropriate. In addition to that, the northern \nborder will be fully staffed under the target provided in the USA \nPATRIOT Act with the funding that is already in this bill that has been \npreviously appropriated.\n  This motion to waive the Budget Act should be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment I have offered on behalf of \nSenator Dodd does two things:\n  One, it ensures that funding to operate and maintain the Coast \nGuard's research and development, R, center in Connecticut is funded \nat levels provided in fiscal year 2003, which was $9 million supporting \na staffing level of 107 employees. The Senate bill, as reported by the \ncommittee, denied the President's request for Coast Guard R and \ninstead added $15 million to the Department's science and technology \naccount to carry out the Coast Guard's R priorities. However, the \ncommittee intended for the operational costs of the Coast Guard's R \ncenter in fiscal year 2004 to be funded from the Coast Guard's \noperations and expenses budget.\n  Two, the amendment directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to \nconduct a study on the R priorities for the Coast Guard and to \nexamine the existing R organizational structure of the Coast Guard. \nThe amendment allows up to $350,000 to be spent on such a study.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1355\n\n       On page 75, line 5 delete all beginning with ``after'' down \n     through and including ``Act'', and insert: ``the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security has published in the Federal Register the \n     Department's privacy notice for CAPPS II or no later than 60 \n     days after enactment of this Act, which is later''\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this technical amendment requires the \nGeneral Accounting Office to report to the Committees on Appropriations \non the privacy protections in the Transportation Security \nAdministration's program known as, CAPPS II.\n  This report will be delivered either 60 days after the Secretary of \nHomeland Security has published in the Federal Register the \nDepartment's privacy notice for CAPPS II, or no later than 60 days \nafter enactment of this act, whichever is later.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1356\n\n         (Purpose: To provide funding for oil spill prevention)\n\n       On page 51, line 24, after the word ``equipment'', insert: \n     ``including $3,500,000 for defense message system \n     implementation and $1,000,000 for oil spill prevention \n     efforts under the Ports and Waterways Safety Systems (PAWSS) \n     program''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Murray amendment included in the \nmanager's package provides $1 million for the Ports and Waterways \nSafety Systems, PAWSS, which is the Coast Guard's program to improve \nwaterway safety. The $1 million would continue efforts of the Coast \nGuard to upgrade technology at their Vessel Traffic Systems, VTS, which \nare located at nine U.S. ports.\n  The amendment includes an offset of $1 million from the Coast Guard's \nDefense Messaging System Implementation.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1357\n\n       On page 75, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. 616 (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) emergency responders are the first line of defense in \n     protecting our Nation against terrorist attacks;\n       (2) the Department of Homeland Security uses population as \n     a factor when allocating grant funding to States and local \n     governments for emergency responders;\n       (3) population plays an important role in both formula and \n     discretionary grants, which are administered by the \n     Department of Homeland Security;\n       (4) the number of people in any city or State often differs \n     from estimates by the Census Bureau;\n       (5) large groups of tourists regularly visit many American \n     cities and states, but are not included in the resident \n     population of these cities and states; and\n       (6) the monetary needs of emergency responders are directly \n     related to the amount of people they are responsible to \n     protect.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security should take into account tourist population \n     as a factor when determining resource needs and potential \n     vulnerabilities for the purpose of allocating funds for \n     discretionary and formula grants.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment offered on behalf of Senator \nReid, expresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity should take into account tourist population as a factor when \ndetermining resource needs and potential vulnerabilities for the \npurpose of allocating funds for discretionary and formula grants.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment has been cleared by the \nmajority and has been adopted.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1358\n\n(Purpose: To require the Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and \n Response to review any outstanding claims by the University of North \n  Dakota relating to damages and costs associated with the April 1997 \n   flooding in North Dakota and report to Congress on the efforts to \n                          resolve such claims)\n\n       On page 75, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. 616. Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for Emergency \n     Preparedness and Response shall--\n       (1) review the damage survey reports and project worksheets \n     relating to the damages and costs incurred by the University \n     of North Dakota as a result of the April 1997 flooding in \n     North Dakota, which is classified by Emergency Preparedness \n     and Response as DR-1174-ND; and\n       (2) submit a report on the efforts of the Directorate of \n     Emergency Preparedness and Response to resolve any \n     outstanding claims by the University of North Dakota relating \n     to the reports described in paragraph (1) to--the Committees \n     on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the amendment of Senator Conrad \nand Senator Dorgan. I understand the amendment also has the support of \nthe majority.\n  The amendment would direct the Under Secretary of emergency \nPreparedness and Response to review and report back to the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations Subcommittee on efforts to resolve the \noutstanding disaster claims from the University of North Dakota.\n  Only $718,675 is in dispute between the University and the Emergency \nPreparedness and Response Directorate related to damages the university \nsustained during the 1997 flood.\n  These claims have been pending for 6 years.\n  Senator Conrad and Senator Dorgan have been working to resolve them, \nbut the Department has been less than cooperative.\n  I support the efforts of my colleagues to bring this matter to \nclosure.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1359\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on the vulnerability of large sports and \n                       entertainment facilities)\n\n       On page 66, line 3, after ``Center'', insert:\n       Provided, That no later than 120 days after enactment the \n     Under Secretary of Infrastructure Analysis and Infrastructure \n     Protection shall submit a report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives on \n     the vulnerability of the 250 largest sports and entertainment \n     facilities (based on seating capacity).''\n\n  Mr. Byrd. Mr. President, this amendment will require that no later \nthan 120\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\ndays after enactment of this bill the Under Secretary of Information \nAnalysis and Infrastructure Protection will report to the House and \nSenate Appropriations Committees on the vulnerability of our Nation's \nlargest sports and entertainment facilities.\n\n\n                        high-threat urban areas\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I express my support for the allocation \nof funds from the discretionary grants program to high-threat urban \nareas, including the city of Atlanta. Atlanta was not recognized by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security as a high-threat urban area in the \ndepartment's last round of funding grants based on the department's \ngrant criteria.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, if my colleague from Georgia would yield \nfor a moment, Atlanta is the largest city in the south, with one of the \nbusiest airports in the country, as well as being home to the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention. Therefore, I find it shocking that \nAtlanta was not considered a high-threat urban area.\n  Mr. BAYH. I have been listening with great interest to my friends \nfrom the State of Georgia discuss their concerns with the high-threat \nurban grant program. I, too, was surprised to hear that a city as large \nas Atlanta did not receive any of these funds. I would ask my \ndistinguished colleague from the State of Georgia if he was aware that \nIndianapolis, or any other city in the State of Indiana for that \nmatter, did not receive any funds from the high density, high-threat \nurban areas grant program.\n  Mr. MILLER. I was unaware that Indianapolis did not receive funds \nunder this vitally important program. As both Senators realize, it is \nessential that all our large cities obtain adequate funding for \nhomeland security. It seems remarkable that two cities with such a \nlarge quantity of critical infrastructure did not receive any funds \nunder the program.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I was disappointed to learn that not one \ncity in my home state received any of the $700 million allocated in the \nfiscal year 2003 Supplemental for high-threat urban areas. After all, \nIndianapolis is the 12th largest city in the United States and hosts \ntwo of the three largest sporting events in the world each year. Every \nyear, over one million race fans visit the great State of Indiana to \nattend the Indianapolis 500, the Brickyard 400 and the U.S. Grand Prix. \nI believe it is imperative that Indianapolis receive funds through the \nhigh-threat urban areas grant program to ensure a sufficient level of \nsecurity is provided to all Hoosiers in central Indiana. I thank my \ndistinguished colleagues from Georgia for their attention to this \nmatter.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank my distinguished colleagues from Georgia and \nIndiana for their questions and concerns pertaining to this matter. In \nresponse to my colleague from Georgia; not only is it true that Atlanta \nis the largest city in the South, with the busiest airport in the \nnation as defined by the largest volume of air carriers in the industry \nand home of the CDC and the U.S. Army Forces Command headquarters, it \nis also true that Georgia is the tenth largest state in the nation \nbased on population and plays host to numerous high profile events. It \nis extremely important to Atlanta and the state of Georgia that Atlanta \nreceive adequate consideration for funding from the DHS via the high-\nthreat urban area grant program in the future to better ensure a secure \ncity of Atlanta and the state of Georgia. I thank my distinguished \ncolleagues from Georgia and Indiana.\n\n\n                           emergency warnings\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I applaud the Appropriations Committee's \nefforts to improve our public warning system in the event of a \nterrorist attack. Right now, we depend almost exclusively on television \nand radio, which most of us wouldn't hear should a disaster occur in \nthe middle of the night. I support the Committee's efforts to include \nthe full range of communications technologies in our alert system. \nPublic warnings save lives, and we must ensure that warnings reach \nevery American in times of danger.\n  While terrorism warnings are vitally important, we must not forget \nthat more than 95 percent of all public warnings deal with weather \nhazards like hurricanes and floods. I am concerned that creating a new \npublic warning system to alert Americans in the events of a terrorist \nattack, rather than building upon an existing warnings network, like \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, weather radio, \ncould further confuse and frustrate the public.\n  During consideration of the supplemental earlier this year, the \nSenate passed an amendment I introduced to incorporate terrorism \nwarnings and updated technologies within National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, weather radio. The House \nAppropriations Committee Report also includes language about \nincorporating terrorism alerts within NOAA weather radio. I believe \nvery strongly that the Senate must also be on record supporting an \nintegrated alert system. Such a system must make use of all existing \ncommunication technologies, including traditional telephones, wireless \ntechnology, including cellular telephones and pagers, and the Internet. \nThis can only be achieved if the Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission, the Secretary of Commerce, representatives of State and \nlocal govermments, and representatives of the private sector, media, \nand academia are all involved.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Committee supports the creation of a national, all \nhazards warning network, and will work in conference to achieve this \ngoal.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank my distinguished colleague for the \nclarification.\n\n\n                    u.s.-mexico border vulnerability\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I engage in a colloquy with the chairman \nand ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senators Cochran and Byrd for \ntheir leadership on this legislation. They have crafted a very good \nbill, which will go a long way toward improving security along our \nNation's borders.\n  For many years now, I have been concerned about the vulnerability of \nthe U.S.-Mexico border in my home state of New Mexico. I think a lot of \npeople would be surprised to learn that there are still miles of border \nland where there is nothing separating my state from Mexico. To correct \nthis problem, I requested and the Appropriations Committee approved \n$967,000 in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for the Border Patrol to \nconstruct vehicle barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border in New Mexico.\n  The original appropriations are now nearly exhausted and this \nimportant project will have to come to a halt in the near future if \nmore funding is not allocated to this effort. I have been informed by \nthe New Mexico Border Authority that an additional 76 miles of vehicle \nbarriers need to be constructed at an estimated cost of approximately \n$2.4 million.\n  I understand that the bill we are now considering includes $90.3 \nmillion for construction for the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection. Is it the expectation of the chairman and ranking member \nthat the funds in this account could be used for continuing the \nconstruction of additional barriers?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is my expectation.\n  Mr. BYRD. I concur that this funding could be used as the Senator \nfrom New Mexico describes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me also ask whether it is the opinion of the \nchairman and ranking member that this project is worthwhile and that \nthe Department of Homeland Security should be encouraged to continue it \nin fiscal year 2004?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Let me assure the Senator from New Mexico that I \nrecognize the need for continuation of this project in his State, and \nthat the funding provided to the Department of Homeland Security by \nthis bill would be available for this purpose.\n  Mr. BYRD. I also agree that the Department of Homeland Security \nshould continue the efforts that have been initiated by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. There are serious needs that ought to be met along the \nborder in his State, and it is my belief that the Department should \ncontinue to construct vehicle barriers using the funding we have \nprovided in this bill.\n\n\n         National infrastructure simulation and analysis center\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I engage the distinguished Senator from\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\nMississippi and chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee in a discussion about the National Infrastructure \nSimulation and Analysis Center--or NISAC--and its importance to the \noverall mission of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I understand the desire of the chairman to give the Department of \nHomeland Security the maximum flexibility to identify potential \nterrorist threats and to appropriately respond to them. However, there \nare ongoing programs that I believe deserve the Senate's support and \nthat need to be put in place to assist with this important \nresponsibility.\n  The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center was \nestablished in fiscal year 2000 by Department of Energy national \nlaboratories at Sandia and Los Alamos in New Mexico to model critical \ninfrastructure in the nation to identify vulnerabilities to potential \nterrorist attacks, prepare for such attacks, and to mitigate and \nrespond to such attacks if necessary.\n  Following the terrible events of September 11, NISAC was specifically \nauthorized in the Patriot Act and received appropriations of $20 \nmillion in fiscal year 2002 to continue to implement the program.\n  The Patriot Act established NISAC ``to serve as a source of national \ncompetence to address critical infrastructure protection and continuity \nthrough support for activities related to counter terrorism, threat \nassessment, and risk mitigation.'' The Act defines the need for this \nmodeling and simulation to evaluate ``appropriate mechanisms to ensure \nthe stability of these complex and interdependent systems. . . .'' \nNISAC is being designed to understand the full consequences of \ndisruptions of the nation's infrastructure, including direct \nconsequences, lives lost, property destruction, contamination, \nsecondary consequences, economic disruptions and national defense \nthreats, and cascading consequences, infrastructure interdependencies \nand regional interdependencies.\n  For the current year, fiscal year 2003, $27.5 million has been \napproved for NISAC--$20 million in program funding and $7.5 million for \na NISAC facility at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. These funds \nwere provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted this past \nFebruary.\n  NISAC has now been transferred to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. First, I call on the Department of Homeland Security to \nrelease the fiscal year 2003 funding immediately so the NISAC program \nis not delayed. The Department is sitting on $15 million in program \nfunding and $7.5 million for the NISAC facility in New Mexico, and \nSandia and Los Alamos need these funds to continue to develop NISAC.\n  It is my understanding that the President's fiscal year 2004 budget \nrequest includes $23 million in the Information Analysis and \nInfrastructure Protection Directorate for continued development of \nNISAC, and that the President's request for NISAC funding is approved \nin this bill. May I inquire of the chairman if this is indeed the case?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. Although the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is newly constituted and its budget \nsubmission is not completely detailed, I have confirmed with the \nAdministration that the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis \nCenter, or NISAC, receives $23 million in the budget request for the \nInformation Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. Those \nfunds are approved in the Committee-reported bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for clarification on this point.\n  Mr. President, NISAC fills a critical need in our work to secure the \nUnited States against terrorist attacks. By utilizing the modeling and \nsimulation analysis capabilities at the DOE labs, NISAC is providing \nthe Department of Homeland Security with science-based information and \nanalysis to understand the full consequences of disruptions to the \nNation's critical infrastructure. NISAC can assess infrastructure \nvulnerabilities, interdependencies, and complexities to help the \ndepartment, industry and other government agencies protect and secure \ncritical infrastructure against terrorist attacks.\n  NISAC is already at work to help protect the critical infrastructure \nof our Nation against terrorist attack. NISAC has looked at port \nsecurity with specific demonstrations in the Pacific Northwest in \nSeattle and Portland. NISAC has supported the TOPOFF II exercise to \nhelp evaluate the impact of decisions made during an exercise \nsimulating a biological attack. NISAC is being tasked to model critical \nindustries and critical links in the nation's transportation network.\n  NISAC has developed an initial suite of modeling, simulation and \nanalysis capabilities that address urban, regional, and national \ninterdependent infrastructures that only the Federal Government has the \nresources to accomplish. This package can be adapted for new issues, \nnew regions, and new infrastructures to help secure the Nation against \nfuture terrorist events.\n  Mr. President, I am excited at the work already performed by NISAC, \nand the development that is underway on NISAC to help the Department of \nHomeland Security address potential terrorist threats against the \nNation's critical infrastructure. I encourage the Department to embrace \nthe NISAC program and to fully utilize the talents and expertise of \nSandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories who have developed NISAC. \nWould the Chairman join me in that message to the Department of \nHomeland Security?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I join the senior Senator from New Mexico in urging the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to utilize the National Infrastructure \nSimulation and Analysis Center and to support partnerships with the DOE \nnational laboratories in New Mexico. I concur that the Nation's \ncritical infrastructure is a potential target for future terrorist \nattack and that the Department must move swiftly to assess the nature \nof those threats and secure our critical infrastructure against such \nattack.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee for his recognition of this \nimportant component of the Federal homeland security effort.\n\n\n              national center for disaster decision making\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the fiscal year \n2004 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, I want to bring to the \nSenate's attention a national program operating in my home State of \nOregon that promises to provide important training for our Nation's \nState and local civilian officials who oversee first responders.\n  The National Center for Disaster Decision Making, or NCDDM, is a \nstrong partnership of public and private entities seeking to provide \nleaders with the skills necessary to combat terrorism.\n  Although Congress and the administration have provided significant \nfunds for first responder training, we have not emphasized the \nimportance of preparing our State and local leaders who oversee and \ncoordinate first responders. When a crisis occurs, the people who \ncommand first responders will be required to make critical decisions \nthat we hope will mitigate loss of life and property. These leaders \nneed to have comprehensive training and education that best prepares \nthem to respond to any crisis or disaster that may occur in their local \ncommunities.\n  I want to confirm that it is the committee's intent that entities, \nsuch as the NCDDM, are eligible for funding from the Department of \nHomeland Security now, and that under the fiscal year 2004 Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill, the NCDDM will also be eligible to apply \nfor competitive grant funding for ``emerging'' training available from \nthe Office for Domestic Preparedness.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The senior Senator from Oregon is correct; that is the \ncommittee's intent.\n  Mr. SMITH. I join my distinguished colleague from Oregon in \napplauding the NCDDM program. This program will prepare civic and \nbusiness leaders to face the challenges presented by domestic \nemergencies. NCDDM will enhance the decision-making abilities of first \nresponder management, health managers, and appointed and elected \nofficials.\n  As our Nation continues to fight terrorism, programs like NCDDM will \nbe an important component of our homeland security strategy. I thank my \ncolleagues--the chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee Cochran and Ranking\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\nMember Byrd for their support of this program and for their \nclarification of the committee's intent in assuring that the NCDDM \nprogram is eligible for funding today and may apply for competitive \ngrant funding under the Office of Domestic Preparedness national \nprograms in fiscal year 2004.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with my colleagues and I encourage the NCDDM to \napply for the grants under this office. As a training center for those \nwho oversee our State and local first responders, this program should \nbe in good standing for Office for Domestic Preparedness grant \nprograms.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree with the senior Senator from West Virginia and \nthe ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n\n\n      the multi-state anti-terrorism information exchange program\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I ask Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd are you \naware of the Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange Program, \nor the MATRIX program, which is a powerful new tool used by our law \nenforcement officers to combat terrorism and domestic crime?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, I am aware of the MATRIX program and the promise it \nhas shown in providing State and local first responders with the \ninformation they need in their fight against terrorism.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I am also aware of this program and understand that, \nfor the first time, Florida's local and State law enforcement officials \nhave access to an integrated law enforcement database that can provide \nthem with the needed law enforcement information.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. We are faced with a changed world following \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It is imperative that our \nNation's first responders be given the necessary tools they need to \nfight this war. From our Nation's busiest ports and key border \ncrossings, to local law enforcement in rural America charged with \nsafeguarding critical infrastructure, there is a great and growing need \nfor timely and accurate information. That capability is now possible \nwith the MATRIX system.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I can attest to the success the MATRIX program \nhas had in our home State of Florida. Time is critical in preventing \nacts of terrorism. Our law enforcement officials in Florida tell me \nthat, with the advantages of the MATRIX system, they have seen \nsignificant improvements in cases involving kidnapping, identity theft, \ndrug trafficking and terrorism, just to name a few. MATRIX has been a \nresounding success, with the program set to expand to 12 additional \nStates in the near future, including Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would like to remind Senators Cochran and \nByrd that the MATRIX program has received $10 million in grant funding \nfrom the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Yes, for the first time, States will be able \nto share information through this integrated database system, providing \nlaw enforcement officers with the information they need to investigate \nthreatened acts of terrorism or domestic crimes. The same results would \nhave required many hours to accomplish. Those hours can now be \ncompressed, freeing up limited law enforcement resources to focus on \ncritical priorities, such as responding to terrorist threats.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Senator Byrd, do you believe that the MATRIX \nsystem would qualify for continued funding from the Department of \nHomeland Security?\n  Mr. BYRD. The committee is aware of the benefits of this program to \nStates in winning the war against terrorism. I believe it qualifies for \ncontinued funding from the Department.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. My colleague from the State of Florida and I \nencourage the Department of Homeland Security to identify additional \nfunds for the MATRIX program, as it is clear the existing information \nsystems and networks upon which our first responders rely need to be \nupgraded to fight the global war on terror. And I thank the chairman \nand ranking member for their comments.\n\n\n                          fort gordon, georgia\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \na Homeland Security mission at Ford Gordon. Fort Gordon has been \nrecognized as possessing a number of homeland security resources.\n  Mr. MILLER. If my colleague from Georgia would yield for a question, \nwould you expand on any ongoing training missions in disaster \npreparedness at Fort Gordon at this time and how these missions \nincorporate other agencies?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank my distinguished colleague from Georgia for \nhis question and concern about this matter. It is true, that training \nmissions pertaining to disaster preparedness are currently taking place \nat Fort Gordon. I would also like to point out to my colleague from \nGeorgia that numerous other local State and Federal agencies including \npartnerships between the Eisenhower Army Medical Center, the Medical \nCollege of Georgia, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have \nall played an active role in this training.\n  Mr. MILLER. If the Senator from Georgia would yield for another \nquestion, it is my understanding that implementing a training mission \nat Fort Gordon would greatly contribute to the national security of \nthis country. For the benefit of our colleagues, would you expand on \nthat point?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senior Senator from Georgia for his \nquestion. Implementing a training mission at Fort Gordon would provide \nour country with the necessary combination of diverse military and \ncivilian assets to better prepare us in the future from any threats to \nour national security. It is extremely important that we establish a \nhomeland security mission, and for the record I would like to make it \nknown that the committee has noted that this bill makes available $60 \nmillion for a competitive training grant program and I would encourage \nFort Gordon to put in for an application for these available funds. I \nthank my distinguished colleague from Georgia.\n\n\n                  corrections to senate report 108-86\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like to note for the record the \nfollowing corrections to Senate Report 108-86 accompanying H.R. 2555 as \nreported by the Senate, the Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act, 2004.\n\n       On page 5, line 3, the dollar amount should read \n     ``$40,000,000.''\n       On page 47, the second paragraph, the description of local \n     government should reflect that the Subcommittee amended the \n     report to include ``borough.''\n\n\n                             PLAYAS PROJECT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to discuss a very important \nhomeland security project being developed in New Mexico.\n  Responding to our Nation's need for more sophisticated security, the \nNew Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, NM Tech, and New Mexico \nState University, NMSU, are collaborating to create and operate the \nNational Emergency Response Training, Research, and Development Center. \nThis center would be located in Playas, NM.\n  Playas is a small town in Hidalgo County, NM, that was built in the \nlate 1970s by the Phelps Dodge Mining Company to provide housing for \n1,000 workers employed at its nearby copper smelting operation. The \ntown includes 259 modern homes and 25 apartment units, a community \ncenter, restaurant, bank, gas station, post office, fire station, \nmedical center and airstrip. It also has recreational facilities \nincluding a bowling alley, fitness center, rodeo arena, basketball \ncourts, tennis courts, and swimming pool. Smelting operations were \nsuspended in 1999 and currently the town is almost completely \nuninhabited.\n  NM Tech, a member of the Department of Homeland Security's, DHS, \nOffice for Domestic Preparedness, ODP, National Domestic Preparedness \nConsortium, is currently in the process of purchasing Playas. If bought \nusing ODP funds and properly developed by New Mexico Tech and then \ntransferred to DHS, Playas could become a critical national facility \nfor securing our Nation against future terrorist attacks. NM Tech and \nNMSU see it playing two critical roles, as an advanced training \nfacility where our Nation's first responders can practice real world \ntraining scenarios and a place where biological, agricultural and \nenvironmental terrorism can be studied.\n  First, the center will provide standardized emergency operations \ntraining for our Nation's First Responders. Specifically, it will \nprovide advanced\n\n[[Page S9788]]\n\ntraining for emergency operations personnel, emergency medical \npersonnel, and physicians. This training would focus on teaching \nadvanced skills that will dramatically increase the technical capacity \nof emergency response organizations to manage incidents involving \nchemical, biological, radiological, explosive, and environmental \nagents. Training participants would also learn how to increase public \nconfidence and foster organizational cooperation among local, State, \nFederal, and private sector emergency responders. Relationships \nfostered by this training will help to increase communications among \nlocal, regional and national emergency response organizations regarding \nmutual aid, information sharing, emergency credentialing, equipment \ninteroperability, security clearances, and secure communication \nsystems.\n\n  Second, the center will focus on ensuring the biological security of \nour Nation's agricultural assets and natural resources. Playas will \nprovide a secure environment where university researchers can work \ncollaboratively with private sector companies to study our homeland \nsecurity challenges and develop new tools for fighting terrorist \nactivities. The center will allow our researchers to network with other \nscientists throughout the world to develop and maintain constantly \nevolving strategies for dealing with biological security threats or \nbreaches. Initially, these research efforts will focus on food supply \nsecurity including crops and livestock, pipeline security, and \ntransportation system security.\n  New Mexico Tech will be the lead organization for this project and \nwill provide the administrative, maintenance, and operations \ninfrastructure needed to support this project. New Mexico Tech will \nconduct extensive research and training programs at this location. Its \nresearch efforts will be coordinated closely with programs currently \noffered on its Socorro campus and will include research initiatives \nregarding dirty bomb detection; suicide bomb detection; and oil and gas \ninfrastructure protection. New Mexico Tech's training efforts will \nfocus on providing advanced skills training for emergency personnel and \nwill build on the first responder training currently offered by the \nuniversity.\n  New Mexico State University will focus its efforts on conducting \nresearch and developing complementary programming that will protect our \nNation's natural and agricultural resources from biological security \nbreaches. Though significant natural biological security breaches have \noccurred in the past decade, current security trends indicate that in \nthe near term even greater risks may be associated with breaches \nmaliciously perpetrated by terrorist organizations. NMSU's research \nefforts would focus on securing our Nation's agricultural and \nbiological environments that would include developing a state-of-the-\nart rural border crossing facility with testing and engineering \nfacilities. This would include assessing our Nation's agricultural \nsecurity infrastructure, preventative activities, training programs, \nand response protocols.\n  The Playas purchase would add significantly to the DHS infrastructure \narsenal by providing a working town for real world training scenarios \nlike those carried out at Hogan's Alley, a mock town used to train \nagents at the FBI's training academy in Quantico, VA. I believe that \nthis could prove to be a very useful piece of property for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. There are undoubtedly a number of \npossibilities as to potential uses for this land, including an \ninfrastructure protection and training center. We all recognize that \nreal world training for first responders and anti-terrorist \norganizations within our government will be of vital importance to \naccomplishing our mission. Because the entire necessary infrastructure \nis in place, this town could be used for training personnel charged \nwith protecting our homeland. Furthermore, our Nation must be able to \nhandle agricultural and biological outbreaks that could significantly \nharm our citizens and crate chaos in our agricultural sector. Playas is \nthe perfect location to study and train against these problems.\n  I suggest that the Department of Homeland Security work with NM Tech \nto purchase this town. I am certain it could be a great training and \nresearch asset for the new Department.\n\n\n                        first responder training\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I express my concern about the Committee \nrecommendation for the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, which \nis provided $140 million in the Senate version of the FY 2004 \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations bill.\n  I understand the desire of the Committee to give the Department of \nHomeland Security the maximum flexibility to identify threats and \nappropriately respond to them. However, there are ongoing programs that \nI believe deserve the Committee's support and that need to be put in \nplace to assist with this important responsibility.\n  The National Domestic Preparedness Consortium is one of those \nprograms. I believe the consortium needs about double the amount in the \ncurrent bill to meet the need to train our first responders--our \nfirefighters, police officers, and emergency medical personnel.\n  The National Domestic Preparedness consortium was created with the \nable guidance and support of Senator Gregg following the 1998 Oklahoma \nCity bombing tragedy. Senator Gregg has been the leader in the Senate \nin recognizing the potential threat of terrorism and providing \ndirection and funding to prepare the nation to respond to this threat \nin his position as Chairman of the Committee, Justice, State, and the \nJudiciary Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  The consortium, which includes the New Mexico Institute of Mining and \nTechnology as one of its training partners, has the expertise to train \nour first responders in conventional explosives.\n  New Mexico Tech alone has trained more than 6,000 first responders at \nits one-week advanced course, and more than 40,000 first responders in \nits general course.\n  The other consortium training partners--Texas A University, \nLouisiana State University, and the Nevada Test Site--have unique \nfacilities and expertise to give our first responders the best \ntraining, and coordinated training that is so important during an \nemergency situation. The consortium is led by the National Preparedness \nCenter at Fort McClellan, AL.\n  I firmly believe we need to support the National Domestic \nPreparedness Consortium with the funding needed to fully utilize its \ncapacity and to train as quickly as possible the additional thousands \nof first responders who need training in a comprehensive and \ncoordinated fashion.\n  The $20 million provided to each of the four training partners in the \nconsortium is below the $30 million they each received in FY 2001 and \nFY 2002. It is an artificial level developed with the delay in enacting \nthe FY 2003 appropriations bills that eventually passed as a \nconsolidated bill this past February, nearly five full months into the \nfiscal year.\n  I hope as this bill moves forward that we will recognize this \nextremely valuable homeland security asset and will provide \nsignificantly more funding for the National Domestic Preparedness \nConsortium in the final bill so that we can train our first responders \nwithout delay.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, after discussing the plan for further \nconsideration of this bill, we understand there are a few more \namendments that are going to be offered. We have the expectation we can \ncomplete action tomorrow on this bill after we consider the amendments \nthat remain to be offered.\n  I know of no Senators who plan to offer amendments at this time to \nthe bill. If there are any Senators who want to offer amendments, I am \nprepared to stay as long as Senators want to discuss their amendments. \nI await the pleasure of the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, shortly before Senator Thurmond retired \nfrom the Senate, I included a tribute in the Congressional Record on \nhis long career. As the Senate notes his passing so soon after his \nretirement, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my \nearlier remarks from September 24, 2002.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a colleague \n     who has a career of public service that may never be matched \n     again in the history of our country.\n       Strom Thurmond sits on the other side of the aisle in the \n     Senate chamber but I consider him a friend with whom I have \n     worked closely. I will miss him.\n       We often worked together in the field of antitrust laws. We \n     worked together on the National Cooperative Production \n     Amendments of 1993, the very first high technology bill \n     signed by President Clinton, and to improve the protections \n     against anticompetitive conduct in the Digital Performance \n     Rights in Sound Recordings Act.\n       Senator Thurmond has been a legislator. I must admit that \n     when Senator Thurmond and I have worked together, it has \n     raised some eyebrows. Whenever we introduced legislation \n     together, he and I fondly remarked that the bill was either a \n     brilliant piece of drafting or one of us had not read it.\n       Needless to say, there have been many occasions when Strom \n     and I sat on opposite sides of an issue. Even though there \n     were issues about which we felt deeply, Senator Thurmond \n     always conducted himself with the utmost integrity. Strom has \n     always told the Senate how he felt and did so with the people \n     of South Carolina first and foremost in his mind.\n       Senator Thurmond has always been a gentleman. His warmth \n     and kindness one afternoon in the Senate Dining Room framed \n     what has to be one of the strangest meetings of all times in \n     that venue. In 1994, I invited Jerry Garcia and the Grateful \n     Dead to join me for lunch in the dining room. As we sat down \n     for lunch, Senator Thurmond entered the room and came over to \n     say hello. I took the opportunity to introduce him to Jerry. \n     It was quite a meeting of cultures.\n       Besides our devotion to the Senate, I share with Senator \n     Thurmond the distinction of being from a State that has \n     provided the Senate Judiciary Committee with three Chairmen \n     over the history of the Committee. South Carolina and Vermont \n     each have had three Senators who have chaired the Committee.\n       I have learned much from the senior Senator from South \n     Carolina. Let me share with you one additional aspect of \n     Senator Thurmond's legacy to the Senate as he completes this \n     term and retires from office. In addition to all his \n     longevity records and legislative achievements and buildings \n     named for him, there is something else about him I will \n     always remember.\n       When we hold hearings for Federal judges--and we have held \n     a number this year--I am always careful to carry on a \n     tradition that Senator Thurmond started. Senator Thurmond \n     always reminded nominees for high office that it is essential \n     to treat others with courtesy and respect. He always reminded \n     nominees that the people and lawyers who appeared before \n     them, whatever their position in the case, whether rich or \n     poor, white or black, man or woman, whatever their religious \n     or political affiliation, they are each and every one \n     deserving of respect and fairness.\n       Senator Thurmond was right to remind judges--and even \n     Senators--of that simple rule. It is another contribution he \n     has made to all of us that will continue to serve us well.\n       Mr. President, as I said earlier, I will miss Strom \n     Thurmond. He has been named President-Pro-Tempore Emeritus \n     for good reason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9789-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9789-S9790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the 50th anniversary \nof the American Political Science Association's congressional \nfellowship program. It is the oldest program on Capitol Hill designed \nto place professionals from a variety of backgrounds in Congress for 1 \nyear. Since its modest beginning in 1953, APSA's congressional \nfellowship program has grown into the established and respected program \nthat it is today.\n  The intent of the program is to immerse professionals in the \nlegislative process of the U.S. Congress. These midcareer professionals \nare chosen by way of a careful selection process, go through a \ncongressional orientation program, and participate in biweekly \neducation seminars throughout their fellowships. These individuals come \nfrom academia, journalism, foreign countries, the health care field, \nand Federal Government. Each year, the selected fellows serve on \ncongressional staffs and acquire ``hands on'' experience while gaining \ninsight into the legislative process, politics, and public service. \nThis unique opportunity enhances APSA fellows' knowledge of, and \nscholarship on, Congress and policy-making, which can only help improve \npublic understanding of our Government. In turn, our constituents \nbenefit by the expertise the fellows bring to Congress. More than 1,800 \nindividuals have participated in the program since its inception; today \nthe average annual class consists of 40 to 45 fellows.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that the Robert Wood \nJohnson Health Policy Fellowship program became affiliated with APSA in \n1974. This prestigious fellowship program, which is funded by the \nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation and is administered by the Institute of \nMedicine, enables midcareer health care professionals to experience the \nintersection of policy and politics first hand. It is an invaluable \ninteraction from which we all benefit; my office benefits from the \nexpertise these professionals bring to Congress, while the fellows \nreturn to their professions and their communities with a better \nunderstanding of the policy process.\n  Over the years, I have been pleased to host a number of APSA and RWJ \nfellows who have provided unique insights and capabilities and have \nhelped me in making important differences in the lives of Utahns in \nareas such as health care, tax, economic, and natural resource policy. \nI am grateful to have had the opportunity to share in this program, and \nI commend APSA for initiating the program 50 years ago. I hope it will \ncontinue for many years to come.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the American Political Science Association, APSA, \nCongressional Fellowship Program.\n  The APSA Fellowship Program is a highly selective, nonpartisan \nlegislative working experience that provides fellows with ``hands-on'' \nexperience as legislative assistants on personal or committee staff. \nFounded in 1953, the APSA Congressional Fellowship Program helps to \nexpand the knowledge and awareness of Congress to professionals from \nacademia, journalism, health care, foreign countries, and government \nagencies. It enables fellows to observe and participate in the inner \nworkings of Congress and the policymaking process. In doing so, fellows \ngain a greater appreciation for and knowledge of the policymaking \nprocess. Overall, the APSA Congressional Fellowship Program offers an \nenriching experience for its participants by providing a 3-week \norientation program, allowing fellows to select their own placements, \nand conducting ongoing seminars throughout the fellowship period.\n  I have been fortunate to host four APSA fellows. In 2000, Hanna \nMarter, a Federal fellow from the Central Intelligence Agency joined my \nstaff to work on health issues. In 2002, Joyce Iutcovitch, an American \nSociological Association fellow, worked in my office on education \nissues, and Deborah Wolf, a Federal agency fellow from the Food and \nDrug Administration, worked on health care issues. Currently, Susan \nDimock, an American Sociological Association fellow, is serving on my \nstaff working on health care issues. APSA\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\nfellows have contributed to my office by applying their expertise and \nanalytical skills to policy issues, and have functioned as full members \nof my staff.\n  Let us recognize the APSA Congressional Fellowship Program and its \n1,800 alumni for their contributions to the legislative work of \nCongress and to furthering participation in the democratic process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9790-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crime legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Grand \nRapids, MI. Justin Bogdanik, 18, was seen June 25, 2003, getting into a \nwhite tractor-trailer cab. The next day, he was found unconscious in a \nditch at a Livingston County rest stop, 80 miles to the east. He had \nbeen beaten unconscious, his eyes were glued shut, there was adhesive \non his genitals, and there were signs of sexual torture. Justin was \ntaken to a hospital, where he survived on life support for almost 2 \nweeks. He died on July 8, 2003. Police in Grand Rapids are \ninvestigating this brutal attack as a homicide and a hate crime-related \ndeath.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9790-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVE THOMAS\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dave \nThomas--a man who was known by many and loved by all. Dave was a great \nAmerican, who launched an extremely successful career by opening his \nfirst Wendy's restaurant in my home State of Ohio in Columbus. He \npassed away in January 2002, at the age of 69.\n  Earlier this year, along with several of our colleagues, Senator \nLevin and I introduced--and the Senate accepted by unanimous consent--a \nresolution to honor Dave Thomas. And today, President George W. Bush is \nawarding Dave Thomas the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime \nof philanthropy and service to his fellow man. While this award is \nbeing given to Dave posthumously, his tremendous spirit continues to be \nfelt in Ohio and across our Nation.\n  Although he faced incredible challenges as a child, Dave committed \nhimself to success through a simple life philosophy: ``work hard and be \nhonest.'' Dave grew up in a family that was constantly on the move, his \nfather always looking for steady work. Getting a start in the \nrestaurant business at the young age of 12, Dave worked hard to help \nhis struggling family while going to school at the same time. However, \nschool wasn't easy for Dave Thomas. The constant moving landed him in \n12 schools in 10 years. Dave dropped out of the 10th grade because it \ninterfered with his work. He did, however, eventually earn his GED as \nan adult in 1993, a GED from Coconut Creek High School in Fort \nLauderdale, FL.\n  In 1953, Dave had a job working for Phil Clauss at one of his Hobby \nHouse restaurants in Fort Wayne, IN, but Dave's father decided to move \nthe family again. Dave refused to leave his job and stayed at a YMCA, \nwithout the comforts of home or his loved ones. Soon after, Thomas \nserved in the Korean war as a cook. When he came back, Phil Clauss \npromoted him to be an assistant manager of his newest Hobby House \nrestaurant. It was then that Dave met COL Harland Sanders, who had \nstopped by the restaurant one day to promote his Kentucky Fried Chicken \nfranchise.\n  Clauss acquired four in Columbus, but they didn't fare well, so he \nrecruited Thomas to turn them around in exchange for 45 percent \nownership. Not surprisingly, Dave succeeded. By 1968, Dave sold his \ninterest back to KFC for $1 million. The capital that Dave collected \nfrom the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants allowed him to open up his \nown hamburger restaurant in Columbus--and the rest is history.\n  Dave Thomas built his successful restaurant dynasty upon his sound \nand strong moral beliefs. However, his corporate achievements take a \ndistant second place to his philanthropic contributions--especially to \nthe cause of adopted children. He was given up for adoption as an \ninfant, and his adoptive mother died when he was only 5 years old. But \nit was a sense of family--of belonging to a group of people who cared \nfor him--that got Dave through his early life adversity. Dave Thomas \nnever forgot the benefits his adopted life gave him. And so later, he \ncommitted his life to provide the same opportunities for others.\n  Dave contributed millions of dollars to hospitals and charitable \norganizations. He founded the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption in \n1992 and the profits from his books go directly to the Foundation. Dave \nalso established the Dave and Lorraine Thomas Clinical Laboratories at \nColumbus' Children's Hospital.\n  He believed in philanthropy with a personal touch, whether it be his \nown letter-writing campaign to CEOs of the Fortune 1000 companies to \nask them to make adoption benefits available to employees, or meeting \nwith lawmakers to push for important adoption legislation. Dave truly \nbelieved that giving back to his community was of paramount importance, \nand I commend him for that.\n  We shared our interest in finding safe, loving, and permanent homes \nfor thousands of at-risk children in this country. I remember Dave to \nbe a kind and genuine person who remarked that his greatest heroes were \nthe children and parents who had come together as families. I had the \nopportunity to work with Dave Thomas in the development of the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act. As a national advocate for adoption rights, he \nplayed a key role in helping us get the bill passed and signed into \nlaw. At the bill's signing ceremony in 1997, then-President and First \nLady Clinton praised Dave's work and his tireless commitment to \nchildren.\n  In January 2002, President Bush praised Dave's adoption work at the \nsigning ceremony of the Promoting Safe and Stable Families law, which \nSenator Rockefeller and I introduced in the fall of 2001. President \nBush was quite right when he said: ``Dave's vision of America was one \nin which all children would be a part of a loving family, so they could \ngrow into healthy and happy and successful adults. The bill I'm \n[signing] will bring us closer to his vision.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  Indeed, Dave Thomas was a successful businessman who used his good \nfortune to help those in need. By helping so many children at risk, he \ntestified to his true compassion and dedication to humanity. As \nChesterton once said: ``Great men take up great space even when they \nare gone.'' Dave Thomas will continue to take up great space on this \nEarth--not just in buildings or foundations but in lives touched and \nlives changed. He will continue to live on through his great work and \nhis deep compassion and commitment to bringing families together. We \nwill remember Dave Thomas always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9790-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9790-S9791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMENDING MAYOR JAMES DOYLE AND THE CITY OF PAWTUCKET\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Mayor James Doyle and the \ncity of Pawtucket, RI for being recognized by the United States \nConference of Mayors Best Small Business Practices 2003. This public-\nprivate partnership between the Conference of Mayors and American \nManagement Services identifies outstanding programs and initiatives \nthat successfully promote business development.\n  Over the past few years, as Rhode Island has witnessed a decline in \nmanufacturing, cities throughout the State have increasingly been left \nwith unused plants and mills. This trend has been especially apparent \nin Pawtucket, a city that had been a symbol of manufacturing and \nindustrial innovation ever since Samuel Slater successfully built \ncotton spinning machines at Slater Mill in 1793. For the next 200 \nyears, Pawtucket was home to a thriving textile industry and machines \nand\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\nironworking shops, but from 1991 to 2001, over 3,000 manufacturing jobs \nwere lost.\n  Drawing on Pawtucket's rich history as a home to artists, Mayor Doyle \nreached out to the artist community and embraced an innovative solution \nto these emptied mills that once were the engines of growth for \nPawtucket. City leaders and Mayor Doyle worked to create the largest \narts and entertainment district in Rhode Island, and, although it \ntypically takes a decade or more for cities to see tangible results \nfrom these districts, Pawtucket is already enjoying its benefits. Five \nmill properties have been sold to artists for commercial and live-work \nlofts, and 122 artists rent eight mill properties, filling 117,000 \nsquare feet of previously empty space.\n  The burgeoning arts district is also expected to improve quality of \nlife and raise property values. Indeed, according to Department of \nCommerce models of economic multipliers, the city of Pawtucket has \nestimated that two new jobs will be generated for every three new \nartists who move into the district.\n  The United States Conference of Mayors' recognition of this \ninitiative establishes in name what was already becoming known about \nPawtucket. Through visionary leadership, the city is a leader in \nchanging with the times and setting itself up for future success.\n  Mayor Doyle has always been a strong advocate for the arts, and his \ndetermination and belief in this initiative is perhaps best \nencapsulated when he stated: ``Some say a picture is worth a thousand \nwords. But here in our city we know that it's worth a lot more. Combine \nthis picture with pieces of one-of-a-kind artwork sold citywide from \nlocal studios and galleries--small businesses--and you create a \npowerful economic engine that can totally transform a City.'' I agree \nwholeheartedly with Mayor Doyle, and commend him and the people of \nPawtucket for their forward thinking and commitment to innovation and \nthe arts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9791-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am proud to recognize the Toyota \nMotor Manufacturing Company in Georgetown, KY on being recognized as a \nproducer of quality automobiles by J.D. Power & Associates.\n  According to a major quality survey by J.D. Power & Associates, \nToyota cars received the highest rankings in over nine vehicle \ncategories measured this year, significantly higher than other leading \nmanufacturers. Reliability weighs heavily on a customer's purchase \ndecision, as does initial quality and technological innovativeness. It \nis clear that Toyota makes every effort to ensure customer satisfaction \nand dependability with every vehicle they send down the line.\n  More importantly, I would like to recognize the people who make these \nexceptional reviews possible: the employees. Toyota's accomplishments \nare largely attributed to its dedicated workforce. The Georgetown plant \nemploys over 7,000 workers to produce 500,000 vehicles annually. On a \nlarger scale, the company has generated 34,544 jobs in the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky and 99,610 jobs across the United States.\n  Based on overall results and customer satisfaction, it is evident \nthat Toyota employees work as a team. I applaud those workers at the \nGeorgetown, Kentucky Toyota plant that helped make this accomplishment \npossible. I thank the Senate in allowing me to congratulate them on \nthis special recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9791-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 3:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1280.

A bill to provide criminal penalties for false personation \nof a military officer for purposes of harassing military families and \nto clarify the false personation statute with respect to officers and \nemployees of the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an important \nmeasure that Senators Graham, Schumer, Cornyn, and I have introduced \nentitled The Military Family Hoax Prevention Act. As our country \nconcludes major combat activities in Operation Iraqi Freedom, we all \nstand tall with pride over the dedication, courage, and valor displayed \nby the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  We all are grateful to the men and women of the U.S. military who \nselflessly serve our country. They have answered the call of our \nCommander in Chief to go abroad and defend the freedoms and values we \ncherish here at home. While carrying out their mission, they have acted \nadmirably during the liberation of an enslaved nation, and continue to \nserve our country honorably. These men and women deserve our profound \ngratitude.\n  As we watch the soldiers returning home from deployment, some from \nextended tours of duty, I am reminded of the personal sacrifice these \nmen and women make while they are gone. These men and women leave \nbehind family and friends who undoubtedly worry constantly about their \nloved ones on deployment. In many instances, family members are not \nable to know of the day-to-day safety of their loved ones during \ndeployment. This feeling of helplessness was aptly described by the \nbrother of Jessica Lynch upon her return to West Virginia when he \ndiscussed her family's desire to learn any bit of information following \nher capture.\n  It has come to my attention that during Operation Iraqi Freedom some \nmilitary families received cruel hoaxes concerning their deployed \nfamily members in Iraq. On three separate occasions that I am aware of, \nfamilies of service men and women here in the United States received \ntelephone calls from sick pranksters telling them that their family \nmembers serving in Iraq had either been killed in battle or taken \nprisoner of war.\n  You can imagine the devastation and agony of the families who \nreceived these malicious telephone calls. These families were forced \ninto a desperate scramble to learn information about the fate of their \nloved ones. These hoaxes require the military to dedicate resources to \nprovide information to military family members.\n  Let me talk briefly about one specific hoax and the potentially \ndevastating consequences that can flow from it. A family in Arizona \nreceived a telephone call that a family member had been killed in Iraq. \nAfter contacting the military, the family was told that only the \nmilitary notifies families in these instances, and that they do so in \nperson, not over the telephone. The military told the family that they \nhad no information that their family member, the soldier, was killed \nand that they would try to learn more.\n  The military discovered that this telephone call was a cruel hoax and \narranged for the soldier to call home from a satellite telephone to \nreassure his family. Unfortunately, the soldier later wrote to his \nfamily and told them that another soldier who was transporting a \nsatellite telephone to him so that he could call home had been killed \nwhile trying to deliver the telephone.\n  This type of action cannot go unpunished. The current false \nimpersonation statute does not punish someone who falsely impersonates \na military employee engaging in this type of conduct. This legislation \nthe Military Family Hoax Prevention Act, would remedy this loophole in \nthe current law. It would prohibit those who derive some perverted \npleasure terrorizing family members who intensely wait for word from \nabroad from their military family members.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Cornyn):\n  S. 1447. A bill to establish grant programs to improve the health of \nborder area residents and for bioterrorism preparedness in the border \narea, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill with \nSenators McCain, Feinstein, and Cornyn entitled the Border Health \nSecurity Act of 2003. This bill addresses the tremendous health \nproblems confronting our Nation's southwestern border.\n  The United States-Mexico border region is defined in the U.S.-Mexico \nBorder Health Commission authorizing legislation as the area of land \n100 kilometers, or 62.5 miles, north and south of the international \nboundary. It stretches 2,000 miles from California, through Arizona and \nNew Mexico to the southern tip of Texas and is estimated to have a \npopulation of 12 million residents.\n  The border region comprises two sovereign nations, 25 Native American \ntribes, and four States in the United States and six States in Mexico.\n  Why should we provide some focus to this geographic region? The \nsituation along the border is among the most dire in the country. In \nthe past, we have recognized problems with other regions, through the \nDenali, Delta, and Appalachian commissions, and have provided targeted \nfunding to those areas. The U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission, \nlegislation I sponsored with Senators McCain, Simon and Hutchison, was \ncreated for the same reasons and annually receives about $4 million in \nfunding that is matched by $1 million from the Mexican government for \nadministrative purposes to improve international cooperation and \nagreements to tackle health problems in the region. However, we need to \ntake the next step and provide resources to address the problems.\n  In the border region, three of the ten poorest counties in the United \nStates are located in the border area, 21 of the counties have been \ndesignated as economically distressed, approximately 430,000 people \nlive in 1,200 colonias in Texas and New Mexico, which are \nunincorporated communities that are characterized by substandard \nhousing, unsafe public drinking water, and wastewater systems, very \nhigh unemployment, and the lower per capita income as a region in the \nNation.\n  The result is a health system that confronts tremendous health \nproblems with little or no resources. Although it is difficult to \naccess the health needs along the border since data is more often \ncollected on a statewide basis, we do know that diabetes, cancer, \ninfectious disease such as tuberculosis, and health disease rates are \nfar greater than the national average but the residents in the area \nhave the highest uninsured rates in the country.\n  In fact, the States of Texas, New Mexico, and California rank as the \nStates with the three worst uninsured rates in the country to begin \nwith. Arizona is not much better and ranks 46th in the Nation, just \nahead of Louisiana and Oklahoma. The uninsured rates of these States \nare: 23.5 percent in Texas, 20.7 percent in New Mexico, 19.5 percent in \nCalifornia, and 18.3 percent in Arizona.\n  However, the figures along the border are even worse, as the rates of \nuninsured are higher still than that in the four States overall. \nUninsured rates in many border counties are estimated to be above 30 \npercent and as high as 50 percent in certain communities.\n  As the U.S.-Mexico Border Commission notes, ``The border is \ncharacterized by weaknesses in the border health\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\nsystems and infrastructure, lack of public financial resources, poor \ndistribution of physicians and other health professionals and \nhospitals. Moreover, the low rates of health insurance coverage and low \nincomes puts access to health services out of reach for many border \nresidents and thus keeps the border communities at risk.''\n  The U.S.-Mexico Border Commission has identified and approved of an \nagenda through its ``Health Border 2010'' initiative, which seeks to, \namong other things: reduce by 25 percent the population lacking access \nto a primary provider; reduce the female breast cancer death rate by 20 \npercent; reduce the cervical cancer death rate by 30 percent; reduce \ndeaths due to diabetes by 10 percent; reduce hospitalizations due to \ndiabetes by 25 percent; reduce the incidence of HIV cases by 50 \npercent; reduce the incidence of tuberculosis cases by 50 percent; \nreduce the incidence of hepatitis A and B cases by 50 percent; reduce \nthe infant mortality rate by 15 percent; and increase initiation of \nprenatal care in the first trimester by 85 percent.\n  However, the U.S.-Mexico Border Commission lacks the resources that \nare needed to address those important goals. The bipartisan legislation \nI am introducing today with Senators McCain, Feinstein, and Cornyn \nwould address that problem by reauthorizing the U.S.-Mexico Border \nHealth Commission at $10 million and authorizing another $200 million \nin funding to improve the infrastructure, access, and the delivery of \nhealth care services along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.\n  These grants would be flexible and allow the individual communities \nto establish their own priorities with which to spend these funds for \nthe following range of purposes: maternal and child health, primary \ncare and preventative health, public health and public health \ninfrastructure, health promotion, oral health, behavioral and mental \nhealth, substance abuse, health conditions that have a high prevalence \nin the border region, medical and health services research, community \nhealth worker or promotoras, health care infrastructure, including \nplanning and construction grants, health disparities, environmental \nhealth, health education, and outreach and enrollment services with \nrespect to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nCHIP.\n\n  We would certainly expect those grants would be used for the purpose \nof striving to achieve the measurable goals established by the ``Health \nBorder 2010'' initiative.\n  In addition, the bill contains authorization for $25 million for \nfunding to border communities to improve the infrastructure, \npreparedness, and education of health professionals along the U.S.-\nMexico border with respect to bioterrorism. This includes the \nestablishment of a health alert network to identify and communicate \ninformation quickly to health providers about emerging health care \nthreats.\n  On October 15, 2001, just one month after the September 11, 2001, \nattack on our Nation, Secretary Thompson spoke to the U.S.-Mexico \nBorder Health Commission and urged them to put together an application \nfor $25 million for bioterrorism and preparedness. The Commission has \ndone so but has not seen targeted funding despite the vulnerability \nthat border communities have with respect to a bioterrorism attack. Our \nlegislation addresses the vulnerability of communities along the border \nand targets funding to those communities specifically to improve \ninfrastructure, training, and preparedness.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include articles from the El Paso Times \nand the Los Angeles Times from October 2001 with respect to those \nmeetings and hope the Secretary will be an advocate with us in the \npassage of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the El Paso Times, Oct. 16, 2001]\n\n               Health Secretary To Fight for Border Funds\n\n                        (By Tammy Fonce-Olivas)\n\n       U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson \n     wants to arm the border with $25 million to combat illnesses.\n       ``Diseases don't stop at the border,'' said Thompson, who \n     was in El Paso on Monday. ``We need to work in a \n     collaborative fashion to improve the health of the border \n     neighborhood. It's our neighborhood.''\n       He talked about the additional funds he is seeking for \n     border health initiatives while chairing the fourth \n     binational meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health \n     Commission.\n       Thompson was joined by Julio Frenk Mora, Mexico's Secretary \n     of Health.\n       Thompson said he didn't know if he would get the $25 \n     million from Congress but vowed to make a strong effort to \n     get more funding for programs to improve access to public \n     health for those living along the border and bolstering \n     border health research.\n       Frenk Mora also said he will be fighting for more money to \n     support border health programs. Frenk is a co-chairman of the \n     commission.\n       The group is composed of 26 public-health leaders from both \n     sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, who are devoted to fighting \n     health problems, such as tuberculosis, AIDS and diabetes.\n       Dr. Laurence Nickey, El Paso's former city-county health \n     director and member of the commission, said he wants to see \n     more funding concentrated on diabetes.\n       He said diabetes is diagnosed in one of five Hispanics on \n     the border by the age of 45. He expects this statistic to \n     become worse unless more work is done in this area.\n       Frenk Mora said Mexico understands the importance of public \n     health and will do its share to improve the health and \n     wellness of people residing along the border.\n       Mayor Ray Caballero, who attended the meeting, said one of \n     El Paso's biggest problem is a lack of health-care providers.\n       ``We are not able to attract or retain enough physicians,'' \n     he said.\n       Thompson announced after the meeting that the University of \n     Texas Health Sciences Center in San Antonio has been awarded \n     a $250,000 grant to establish a Regional Center for Health \n     Workforce Studies.\n\n\n                                workshop\n\n       Today will be the final session of the U.S.-Mexico \n     Binational Tuberculosis Workshop at the Hilton Camino Real.\n       Among today's discussions will be a binational information \n     system, as well as talks on consensus building.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 17, 2001]\n\n                  U.S., Mexico Team Up on Health Care\n\n                          (By James F. Smith)\n\n       The United States and Mexico took some imaginative steps \n     this week to combat health problems that plague border \n     communities and migrant workers, including tuberculosis, \n     diabetes and AIDS.\n       Meeting in El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, \n     health experts from the two nations agreed on a 10-year \n     agenda for improving care for the 11.5 million people living \n     along the nearly 2,000-mile border.\n       Mexico also launched a program that promises a new approach \n     to treating migrants' health problems. Formally unveiled in \n     Ciudad Juarez on Sunday, the ``Go Healthy, Return Healthy'' \n     initiative seeks to help Mexico migrants in their hometowns, \n     along the routes they travel and during their stays in the \n     United States.\n       Elsewhere, California and Mexico kicked off the program by \n     staging their first joint ``health week.'' California is \n     conducting a flurry of activities through Friday for migrants \n     in the state, including vaccinations, checkups and \n     information campaigns. The California Endowment is devoting \n     part of a $50-million agricultural health grant to the \n     initiative.\n       The mere fact that U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary \n     Tommy G. Thompson showed up for the U.S.-Mexico Border health \n     Commission meeting here Monday--despite an international \n     anthrax scare--delighted the Mexicans, who have worried that \n     U.S. relations with their nation would become a low priority \n     for the Bush administration following the Sept. 11 terrorist \n     attacks.\n       Officials from both nations emphasized that the border \n     health problems are real and immediate threats, killing many \n     thousands of people each year.\n       ``We should not let the anthrax scare kidnap our entire \n     health agenda,'' said Mexican Health Secretary Julio Frenk. \n     ``There are a lot of other very important issues of much \n     higher risk to our populations.''\n       Thompson, meanwhile, offered a challenge to the U.S. \n     delegation to the year-old Border Health Commission: He'll \n     try to come up with an additional $25 million for health \n     projects along the frontier if they can come up with \n     specific, effective ways to spend the money.\n       A commission study issued Monday detailed the serious \n     health challenges on the border, compounded by population \n     growth of 28% on the U.S. side and 39% on the Mexican side \n     during the 1990s, about twice the national growth rate in \n     each country.\n       The study found that rates of communicable diseases such as \n     tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and hepatitis A are higher in the \n     border region than nationally for both countries. Cancer, \n     asthma and diabetes rates also are higher along the border.\n       ``The high level of border crossings between the U.S. and \n     Mexico complicates the development of strategies to address \n     the spread of infectious diseases,'' the report says, \n     heightening the need for coordinated policies.\n       While the commission debated overall strategies, a workshop \n     of about 100 experts on tuberculosis met to map out \n     innovative cross-border approaches to tracking and caring for \n     patients. The interruption of tuberculosis treatment is \n     highly dangerous for patients because it can lead to \n     resistance to\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\n     medication. Yet such breaks in treatment occur frequently \n     when ailing migrants cross illegally into the United States.\n       The workshop focused on development of a binational \n     tuberculosis card that would allow patients to continue \n     treatment on either side of the border with confidentiality. \n     The cared would not only ensure continuity in treatment but \n     allow both countries to improve their database of \n     tuberculosis cases.\n       Dr. Lincoln Chen, a public health expert from the \n     Rockefeller Foundation, said such initiatives make the border \n     region ``the cutting edge of health in the 21st century . . . \n     This is the front line of global health.''\n       Thompson and Frenk visited sites that symbolize the \n     emerging cooperation, from the La Fe health clinic in south \n     El Paso, which treats many Latino AIDS patients, to a U.S. \n     Food and Drug Administration inspection operation. In \n     September, the two governments agreed to expand efforts to \n     ensure the safety of meat, poultry and egg products that are \n     shipped across the border in immense volumes.\n       In California, meanwhile, seven counties that are home to \n     large numbers of migrant workers took part in the health week \n     with Mexico. Jose Ignacio Santos, head of child health in \n     Mexico and director of the ``Go Health, Return Healthy'' \n     program, said the initiative brings to the U.S. some of the \n     techniques that have made Mexico's public health system \n     highly regarded. Those included very public community \n     outreach activities, which have helped achieve a 98% \n     immunization rate.\n       In Mexico, the thrice-yearly National Public Health Weeks--\n     such as one that began Sunday--bring vaccinations to the \n     homes of millions of people. More than 11 million injections \n     will be given in Mexico this week for childhood diseases, in \n     programs supported by nearly 180,000 volunteers.\n       Similar efforts are being carried out this week in the \n     seven California counties, with a focus on messages about \n     cervical and breast cancer, immunizations and diabetes. The \n     goal is to reach some of the more than 3 million Mexicans \n     living and working in the state, especially the 1 million \n     agricultural laborers.\n       Frenk, the health secretary, said that in the past, Mexico \n     did not clearly understand the differences between treating \n     stable and migrant populations. The new program acknowledges \n     that migrants carry health problems with them as they leave \n     home--and bring back ailments such as AIDS when they return \n     from the United States.\n       Now officials are developing preventive programs in 502 \n     towns in the 10 Mexican states that produce the most \n     migrants, including Jalisco and Guanajuato.\n       The effort will also respond to the seasonal moves of the \n     workers. For example, it calls for information and \n     immunization campaigns in August and September, when migrants \n     often leave home to work during the harvest season. It \n     prepares for treating the workers when they return home at \n     year's end or Easter.\n       Frenk said the new model demands a high level of \n     coordination with U.S. authorities. And it will require new \n     levels of trust from illegal migrants that the health \n     information won't be used against them, he said.\n       ``The ideal would be a well-coordinated system in which we \n     could say to the U.S. authorities: `There goes a migrant who \n     has tuberculosis. Care for him,''' he said. ``Some day not \n     too far in the future, there will be electronic clinical \n     histories on a card with an intelligent chip, and the person \n     will carry it. But this will require much trust on the part \n     of illegal migrants.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, our relationship with Mexico, like that \nwith Canada, is a special one. Those countries are our closest \nneighbors, and yet, we often and wrongly neglect our neighbor to the \nSouth and the much needed economic development needed in the region. \nMexico is the United States' second largest trading partner and the \nborder is recognized as one of the busiest ports of entry in the world. \nAnd yet, the region is often neglected.\n  As the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission points out, ``Without \nincreases and sustained federal, state and local governmental and \nprivate funding for health programs, infrastructure and education, the \nborder populations will continue to lag behind the United States in \nthese areas.'' If the border were its own state, according to data from \nthe Heath Resources and Services Administration, it would: rank last in \naccess to health care; second in death rates due to hepatitis; third in \ndeaths related to diabetes; last in per capita income; first in the \nnumber of school children living in poverty; and, first in the numbers \nof the uninsured.\n  I would like to thank Senator McCain, who was the original cosponsor \nof the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission legislation, Public Law \n103-400, that we passed in 1994 and is the lead cosponsor of this \nlegislation as well, for his outstanding leadership on border issues \nthroughout his career. I would also thank Senators Feinstein and Cornyn \nfor working with us on this important legislation and Senator Hutchison \nfor her constant support for the appropriations of the U.S.-Mexico \nBorder Commission upon the signed agreement between the United States \nand Mexico, which was signed by President Clinton on July 14, 2000.\n  I urge the adoption of this bipartisan legislation by this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a fact sheet and the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Fact Sheet--Border Health Security Act of 2003\n\n       Senators Jeff Bingaman, D-NM, John McCain, R-AZ, Dianne \n     Feinstein, D-CA, and John Cornyn, R-TX, are preparing to \n     introduce the ``Border Health Security Act of 2003.'' The \n     legislation seeks to improve the infrastructure, access, and \n     delivery of health care services to residents along the U.S.-\n     Mexico border.\n       The legislation would achieve these goals by:\n       Improving Border Health Services: Provides for $200 million \n     in funding to States, local governments, tribal governments, \n     institutions of higher education, nonprofit health \n     organizations, or community health centers along the U.S.-\n     Mexico border to improve infrastructure, access, and the \n     delivery of health care services.\n       These grants are flexible and would allow the community to \n     establish its own priorities with which to spend these funds \n     for the following range of purposes: maternal and child \n     health, primary care and preventative health, public health \n     and public health infrastructure, health promotion, oral \n     health, behavioral and mental health, substance abuse, health \n     conditions that have a high prevalence in the border region, \n     medical and health services research, community health \n     workers or promotoras, health care infrastructure, including \n     planning and construction grants, health disparities, \n     environmental health, health education, and outreach and \n     enrollment services with respect to Medicaid and the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP.\n       Providing Border Bioterrorism Preparedness Grants: Provides \n     for $25 million in funding to States and local governments or \n     public health departments to improve the infrastructure, \n     preparedness, and education of health professionals along the \n     U.S.-Mexico border with respect to bioterrorism. This \n     includes the establishment of a health alert network to \n     identify and communicate information quickly to health \n     providers about emerging health care threats.\n       Reauthorizing the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission: \n     Provides for the reauthorization of the U.S.-Mexico Border \n     Health Commission at $10 million annually.\n\n                                S. 1447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, recognizing that the communities along our \nNation's border are literally our front line of defense, it is in the \ninterest of our national security to ensure that these areas are well \nequipped to respond to health emergencies and potential bioterror \nattacks. To address the critical needs of this vulnerable region, I am \npleased to once again join my good friends from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman, along with Senator Feinstein and Senator Cornyn, in \nintroducing the Border Health Security Act of 2003.\n  Ten years ago, Senator Bingaman and I introduced a bill which we \nbelieved represented a first step toward addressing the many health \nchallenges confronting the U.S.-Mexico border region as it faced \ngrowing population and an expanding industrial base. The United States-\nMexico Border Health Commission Act authorized the President to enter \ninto a bilateral agreement with Mexico and establish a binational \ncommission on border health, and was signed into law in the fall of \n1994.\n  Six years later the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and \nthe Secretary of Health of Mexico signed an agreement creating the \nUnited States-Mexico Border Health Commission. Although still in its \ninfancy, the Commission serves to draw attention to the unique needs of \nthe border region, while improving and protecting the health and well-\nbeing of the residents on both sides of the border.\n  The bill we are introducing today builds upon the effort we began 10 \nyears ago. This legislation authorizes two new grant programs targeting \nhealth care and bioterror preparedness in the border area in addition \nto funding for the Commission.\n  The first grant program we establish, the Border Health Grants, will \nbe competitively awarded to programs that improve health care \ninfrastructure or address the unique health care needs of the border \nregion. Eligible programs could address health disparities, public \nhealth, maternal and child health, and conditions with a high \nprevalence in the border area. Acknowledging our national vulnerability \nin the wake of September 11 attacks and the need to ensure that \nbioterror efforts are specifically focused on the border region, our \nbill establishes bioterror preparedness grants for activities including \ncoordination of bioterror and emergency preparedness, improvements in \ninfrastructure, and education and training.\n  The communities along our Nation's southern border typically have \nhigh rates of uninsured and underinsured individuals, unemployment, and \npoverty. This region also has higher rates of infections and chronic \ndiseases, often exacerbated by migrant populations. Compounding these \nproblems is the lack of health care facilities and qualified health \ncare professionals. According to the U.S.-Mexico Border Health \nCommission, if the border area were a state, it would rank last in \naccess in health care, second in death rates due to hepatitis, third in \ndeaths related to diabetes, first in number of TB cases and last in per \ncapita income.\n  I have long supported legislative initiatives aimed at improving the \nsecurity and quality of life in our border area. This bill is a part of \nthat ongoing effort. As our Nation enters a new era of heightened \nnational alert, it is incumbent upon us to ensure our border area--our \nfront line of defense--is strenghtened and protected.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1448. A bill to provide for the construction of the Yupik Alaskan/\nCentral Kuskokwim Energy Project, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President today I introduce a very important piece \nof legislation, the Calista Energy and Economic Revitalization Act. \nThis legislation will create a profound and positive effect on one of \nthe most impoverished parts of my State, the Upper Kuskokwim region by \nproviding major boost to the economy of this area. It will also provide \naffordable energy to this region, which pays some of the highest energy \ncosts in the country.\n  My legislation will authorize a grant and loan guarantee program to \npermit the construction of a vitally important intertie from the Upper \nKuskokwim region to Bethel, Alaska. This project will provide low cost \nenergy to revitalize this region much as the Tennessee Valley and \nBonneville Power projects revitalized the South and Northwest, \nrespectively.\n  Alaska was just a territory when these visionary projects were \nconceived and constructed. It is now time for the State of Alaska to \njoin in the national commitment and partnership for economic vitality.\n  The Upper Kuskokwim region has been inhabited by the Yupik Eskimo for \nthousands of years and they have developed a unique lifestyle which \nallows them to thrive in a harsh and formidable climate.\n  On December 18, 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act, ANCSA, in recognition and settlement of the aboriginal \nclaims of the Yupik Eskimo people in the Upper Kuskokwim regions. \nPursuant to ANCSA the Calista Corporation was formed by the Yupik \nEskimo people to represent their needs and interests in implementation \nof ANCSA.\n  The Calista Corporation has selected as port of its land entitlement \nunder ANCSA the Donlin Creek area of the Upper Kuskokwim region. As \nowner of the Donlin Creek area, Calista has made a discovery of \ninternational significance of gold and other minerals which will aid \nthe country and the Yupik Eskimo people if that area is developed. I \ncan assure you, that there is\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\nwide spread support among the local Yupik population that their lands \nbe developed.\n  The Donlin Creek area is currently isolated and unconnected by road \nor utility services to the rest of the State of Alaska and the Nation. \nIt is fair and equitable that the Congress enacts legislation to aid \nand assist the Yupik Eskimo people, through the Calista Corporation, in \ndeveloping this energy project referenced in my bill. The goal of this \nproject is to provide reasonable and adequate utility service to the \nlocal people and to serve to the development of the minerals in the \nDonlin Creek area.\n  The Upper Kuskokwim region contains numerous Yupik Eskimo villages \nwhich are also isolated from the rest of the State and the Nation. \nAccording to government reports, the unemployment rate in the region is \nabout 25 percent but the actual joblessness rate is much higher. The \ngovernment reports stop counting people as unemployed after that have \nnot had a job after several years. There is currently little or no \nopportunity for year round nongovernmental employment in this region.\n  For example, one of the few opportunities to participate in the cash \neconomy available in the region comes from fishing, but fishing income \nhas plunged by about 50 percent from nearly $12,000 to about $5,000 \nannually. Because of this drastic decline in fishing income and a \ngeneral lack of available private sector jobs, Federal and State \ntransfer payments make up 33 percent of income in the Bethel U.S. \nCensus District area and nearly 45 percent of the Wade Hampton U.S. \nCensus District in the Upper Kuskokwim region near the Donlin Creek \nsite.\n  Passage of this legislation will provide a sound economic opportunity \nfor the Yupik Eskimo and other residents of the region and give them an \nopportunity to enjoy a better quality of life. Calista is committed to \nturning this project into the private sector engine for this part of \nAlaska. If successful, Federal transfer payments will be reduced and \nlocal residents will have the ability to support themselves and their \nfamilies with solid, well paying private sector jobs.\n  Utility costs are now more than 10 times the national average. By \nproviding a year round employment base and more equitable and \naffordable access to utility services, this project will improve the \nlives of all residents of the region.\n  I am excited about this bill and will work hard to achieve its \npassage. It is my hope to have a hearing on this bill very soon and \nseek its passage in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the \nfull Senate before the end of the year. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Calista Energy and Economic \n     Revitalization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Yupik Eskimo people have--\n       (A) inhabited the Upper Kuskokwim region for thousands of \n     years; and\n       (B) developed a unique lifestyle that allows the people to \n     thrive in a harsh and formidable climate;\n       (2) on December 18, 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska \n     Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) in \n     recognition and settlement of the aboriginal claims of the \n     Yupik Eskimo people in the Upper Kuskokwim regions;\n       (3) under that Act--\n       (A) the Calista Regional Corporation was formed by the \n     Yupik Eskimo people to represent the needs and interests of \n     the Yupik Eskimo people in implementing the Act; and\n       (B) the Corporation has selected as part of the land \n     entitlement the Donlin Creek area of the Upper Kuskokwim \n     region;\n       (4) as owner of the Donlin Creek area, Calista Regional \n     Corporation has made a discovery of international \n     significance of gold and other minerals that would aid the \n     Yupik Eskimo people if developed;\n       (5) there is widespread support among the local Yupik \n     population for development of the Donlin Creek area;\n       (6) the Donlin Creek area is currently isolated and \n     unconnected by road or utility services to the rest of the \n     State of Alaska;\n       (7) the Upper Kuskokwim region contains many Yupik Eskimo \n     villages that are not connected to the rest of the State of \n     Alaska;\n       (8) the unemployment rate in the region is almost 25 \n     percent, and there is currently little or no opportunity for \n     year-round nongovernmental employment;\n       (9) it is fair and equitable that Congress enact \n     legislation to aid and assist the Yupik Eskimo people, \n     through the Calista Regional Corporation, in providing \n     reasonable and adequate utility services to the area; and\n       (10) Congress should act to provide a sound economic \n     opportunity for the Yupik Eskimo and other residents of the \n     region to enjoy an improved quality of life by providing a \n     year round employment base.\n\n     SEC. 3. CALISTA ENERGY PROJECT AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) Financial Assistance.--The Secretary of Energy shall, \n     subject to any terms and conditions that the Secretary \n     determines to be appropriate, provide the Calista Regional \n     Corporation grants and loan guarantees to assist in the \n     construction of the Calista Energy Project as generally \n     identified in the document entitled ``Calista Region Energy \n     Needs Study'' and dated July 1, 2002.\n       (b) Federal Share.--The Federal share of the cost of \n     construction of the Calista Energy Project shall be not more \n     than 80 percent.\n       (c) Limitation.--The total amount of financial assistance \n     that the Secretary may provide under subsection (a) is--\n       (1) $100,000,000 for grants; and\n       (2) $50,000,000 for loan guarantees.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1449. A bill to improve the capacity of the Secretary of \nAgriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and conduct \nhazardous fuels reduction projects on National Forest System land and \nBureau of Land Management land that are aimed at protecting \ncommunities, watersheds, and certain other at-risk land from \ncatastrophic wildfire, to enhance efforts to protect watersheds and \naddress threats to forest and rangeland health on public and private \nland, including catastrophic wildfire, to increase research on forest \nhealth and forest-damaging agents, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, Idaho faces grim news this morning as the \ndeaths of two young wildland firefighters are reported. They were \nkilled late Tuesday afternoon while fighting the Cramer fire in the \nSalmon-Challis National Forest west of the town of Salmon near the \nconfluence of the middle fork of the Salmon River and the main Salmon. \nThese men are heroes of battle, just as the men and women fighting \noverseas. They fought a faceless, terrifying enemy with bravery, \nheroism, and selfless dedication to the families and communities of \ncentral Idaho. Their sacrifice will be remembered for years to come as \ntheir names are added to the list of those fallen in service to their \ncountry in the capacity of wildland firefighters. I pray that those who \ncontinue to fight fires in Idaho and across the West this summer remain \nout of harm's way as they perform their valiant and critical work to \npreserve homes, property, and life.\n  The tragedy is that two more people have died. We hope it is not \nfollowed by more as we enter another fire season. The truth is that our \nforests are overgrown, dead and dying, and this kind of tragedy was \ninevitable. Legislation that I supported in the past would have made a \ndifference. Had it been enacted last year or the year before, these \nsenseless deaths could very well have been avoided. Idaho's wildfire \nseason is just getting into its full swing, and we are asking our \nwildland firefighters in Idaho and throughout the rest of the Nation to \ndo a dangerous job. We in Congress owe it to them and to the family \nmembers of those who didn't make it to provide them with the tools \nnecessary to get the job done as safely and quickly as possible. These \ndeaths are a tragic reminder of the sacrifices and risks wildland \nfirefighters make to ensure the safety of our communities. Congress \nmust act to reduce this threat to our communities and improve the \nsafety of our firefighters. Today, Senator Lincoln and I are \nintroducing bipartisan legislation to address the forest health crisis \nfacing our nation.\n  As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee's \nSubcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and Rural Revitalization, \nSenator Lincoln and I have learned of the similarities between the \nproblems facing\n\n[[Page S9800]]\n\nthe ecosystems of eastern and western forests. We know that when \nCongress acts to address the health of forests in the West--forests \nthat have been devastated by fires that garner national attention--we \nmust also reduce the risks to our forests across the country. The \nthreat is not just to our property and lives, but clean air, clean \nwater, and wildlife habitat. We must take a comprehensive approach to \nprotecting our resources, and Senator Lincoln and I attempt to do that \nin this bill.\n  The America's Healthy Forests Restoration and Research Act builds on \nthe bipartisan legislation that passed the House of Representatives and \nis now under consideration in the Senate.\n  Like the House proposal, our bill addresses the ``analysis \nparalysis'' that prevents us from taking actions to protect our lands. \nFor lands that are at risk of catastrophic fire or that have been \nseverely damaged by insect or disease infestations or the aftermath of \nsevere weather events, such as windthrow or ice storms, the bill \ncreates an expedited process to allow for treatment. For these specific \nprojects on Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management lands--with the \nexception of lands that are wilderness areas or Wilderness Study \nAreas--the bill provides for time limits on appeals, reforms the \nappeals process, and provides guidance to the courts.\n  The per-acre costs of fuel reduction projects is higher and the \namount of time to consider a project is longer with each alternative \nthe agencies are required to consider. Each of these alternatives \nrequires a complete and thorough environmental analysis. By selecting \nprojects through the collaborative process and requiring an in-depth \nanalysis of the environmental impacts of the specific project, we can \nensure that the impacts of the project are addressed, without the \nanalysis paralysis caused by the examination of additional \nalternatives--especially when projects are most often appealed based on \nfailure to complete adequate analysis on alternatives rather than the \nsubstance of the project.\n  The time for action is now, we should not let fuels reduction \nprojects be delayed or lose their effectiveness through frivolous \nappeals. By requiring the Forest Service to develop a new process that \nallows for public collaboration, by requiring substantive comments to \nthe project, and by requiring participation in the process before \nallowing litigation, the bill ensures that public comment is meaningful \nand constructive. No longer will these important projects be stopped \nsimply by 33 cents on a postcard.\n  Our bill also requires that the courts balance the long term effects \nwith the short term effects of a project. This balance of harm should \nbe common sense, but that has not been the case. The courts are \nreminded they should balance the impact of inaction in their decision \nmaking.\n  This streamlining of the appeals and judicial review process will \ncounter the growing use of appeals and litigation as delaying and \nfrustrating techniques rather than the constructive recourse they were \nintended for. Cutting through the bureaucratic red tape and ensuring \nfor robust public participation--as outlined in the widely-supported \nWestern Governors Association's collaborative strategy--is a win-win \nfor our forests and our communities. In addition, by streamlining the \nprocess, we get more money on the ground and in action to protect our \nforests. Appeals, litigation, and extensive analysis of unneeded \nalternatives mean less money for projects. Some estimate that only \nsixty percent of funds allocated for fuels reduction actually makes it \nto the ground. Streamlining the process should result in significantly \nmore resources to address forest health.\n  I have long been an advocate of better utilization of biomass and \nsmall diameter materials. This bill addresses the need for more \nresearch and more markets. Our bi-partisan bill provides grants to \nthose who would use biomass for fuel or other beneficial purposes. \nInstead of leaving fuels in our forests to burn or tossing them in \nlandfills, we can reduce the risks to our environment and create an \nincentive to use what has traditionally not been cost effective to use. \nUnlike the house bill, we expand eligible uses beyond just useful \nfuels. In Idaho, we have companies that can use this material for \nenvironmental restoration. We need to do more to create incentives to \nuse this material.\n\n  To that end, our bill also includes expanded research into \nutilization and harvesting of small diameter materials. Light on the \nland techniques that find more and better uses of biomass and small \ndiameter materials can revitalize our rural communities. Research into \nthe costs and obstacles to using these materials will go a long way \ntoward expanded markets and rural development. The bill also provides \ndirection for technology transfer to get this information from the \nuniversities and scientists to the communities and small businesses in \nrural parts of America.\n  Our bipartisan bill makes research a central tenet. From research \ninto biomass, forests conditions, upland hardwoods, the measure brings \na new focus to forest threats. Our legislation expands the research to \nallow for landscape level research on forest-damaging agents. Fire, \ninsects and disease, and weather events pose a significant threat to \nour forest ecosystems. The bill provides for cooperation with colleges \nand universities in applied research to combat these threats.\n  The bill also focuses research on preserving upland hardwoods. Not \nenough is known about preserving and restoring the upland hardwood \nforests of the South. The creation of an upland hardwood forest \nresearch center will go a long way toward finding ways to better \nprotect, rehabilitate, restore, and utilize these important resources.\n  The proposal includes a watershed program that will help foresters \nenhance water quality in our forests. As many know, our forests serve \nas critical watersheds that provide drinking water to our communities. \nThis bill provides for grants to allow for technical assistance, \neducation, and financial assistance to enhance our efforts to ensure \nclean waters for our communities and wildlife.\n  A program to maintain forested habitat for threatened and endangered \nspecies is also an important part of this legislation. By providing for \nshort and long-term restoration agreements the program offers \nincentives to maintain and utilize efforts that protect species and \nprevent others from being listed.\n  The legislation provides assistance to address the problem of \nnonnative invasive plants, trees, shrubs, and vines. Across the \ncountry, the expansion of nonnative invasive plants has changed \necosystems making them more susceptible to threats that could result in \ncatastrophic fires. Our proposal provides assistance to landowners in \naddressing these invasives.\n  Finally, the bill declares that the enhanced community fire \nprotection program is an important program in reducing risks to \ncommunities. This program, which we enacted as part of the 2002 Farm \nBill, provides assistance to communities in reducing fire threats. \nProviding funding for this program, coupled with the savings from \nstreamlining the process, will provide for meaningful progress in \nreducing the wildfire threat.\n  I agree with Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth, who says we need to \nmove the focus from what we take to what we leave. As he has \nidentified, too many are looking at this as a zero-sum game. They seek \nsomeone to blame for forest health problems or argue that logging is \ninherently bad. We need to get beyond that fallacious argument and \nrealize that what is important is restoring a healthy ecosystem: an \necosystem that allows for a natural fire regime to exist without \nthreatening our communities and lives.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me moving beyond the narrow focus that \ncurrently passes for forest policy, this zero-sum game, and look at the \nneeds of our forest ecosystems. This bill is a bipartisan effort that \nenhances the House-passed legislation. It sets a mark that the majority \nof the Senate can and should support.\n  The skies over Idaho's capitol city, Boise, are smoke-filled this \nafternoon, and another tiny town on the edge of Idaho's Frank Church \nRiver of No Return Wilderness, Atlanta, is threatened as fire \nencroaches on the homes there. Firefighting resources are stretched to \nthe limit as wildland fires are burning throughout Idaho and the West. \nWildfires this year have charred some 1.46 million acres nationwide. \nThe National Interagency Fire Center said there were 49 large fires \nburning in the West, with more than 350 thousand\n\n[[Page S9801]]\n\nareas of active wildfires. Let us in Congress take a stand now to help \nprotect our forests and keep them from going up in smoke every year.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to garner their support \nfor this much-needed, bipartisan legislation, and know that they join \nme in sending condolences to the families of the two young men who died \nfighting a fire that may very well have been preventable.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend \nSenator Crapo of Idaho in introducing legislation aimed at \nrehabilitating this Nation's public and private forestlands. Senator \nCrapo and I serve as the Chair and Ranking Member of the Agriculture \nSubcommittee on Forestry, and we have worked together extensively in \nwatching over our Nation's forestlands.\n  Our bipartisan legislation builds upon the Healthy Forest Restoration \nAct, which passed the House of Representatives earlier this year. Our \nbill will ensure that we can address the many problems affecting all of \nour Nation's forests--both on public and private forestlands, in \nsouthern and western forests, and throughout both hardwood and pine \necosystems. Our legislation is intended to be a marker for the \ndirection we believe forest legislation should move in this country.\n  Both Senator Crapo and I have been working closely with the Senate \nAgriculture Committee to ensure that the goals of our legislation are \nincorporated into the chairman's mark of the Senate's Healthy Forest \nlegislation.\n  Our legislation is intended to accomplish a few, very specific goals.\n  First and foremost, we must provide the Forest Service with the tools \nnecessary to immediately address the epidemic of oak decline and \nmortality in the Ozark highlands of Arkansas and Missouri.\n  Oak decline is a natural occurrence in older forests or in areas \nwhere trees are stressed by conditions such as old age, over population \nof the forest, poor soil conditions, and the effects of several years \nof severe drought. And under normal conditions, oak decline is not \nnecessarily fatal to the tree.\n  However, these conditions have allowed insects such as the red oak \nborer to flourish throughout the forest and has led to an epidemic of \noak mortality throughout our forests.\n  In fact, many estimates now suggest that potentially up to one \nmillion acres of red oaks have been affected in Ozark highlands. And it \nis important to note that this epidemic has not been long in coming--it \nwas only first discovered in the late 1990s. I am concerned that this \nepidemic will lead to a complete loss of red oak from the Ozark \nhighlands and cause long-term changes to the health of the forest \necosystem.\n  It is also important to remember that the epidemic has not been \nlimited to public lands. Private forest landowners and homeowners \nthroughout the Ozarks face the same problem. The past several years of \nextremely dry summer conditions have weakened trees throughout the \nregion.\n  The legislation also contains provisions that are intended to \nstreamline and improve the environmental, administrative, and judicial \nreview process for hazardous fuel reduction projects under this \nlegislation. I join Senator Crapo in believing that the review process \nfor hazardous fuel reduction projects, while necessary and beneficial, \noften consumes more time, effort, and resources than the initial intent \nof the project.\n  I am also aware that there are ongoing discussions regarding these \nenvironmental, administrative, and judicial review issues. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee and \nin the entire Senate to modify and improve the environmental, \nadministrative, and judicial review provisions of this legislation in \norder to address my colleagues' concerns.\n  As we have seen with the epidemic of oak mortality in Arkansas, the \nForest Service must have the ability to quickly respond to insect \ninfestation in order to protect, preserve, and rehabilitate the entire \nforest. Streamlining of the environmental, administrative, and judicial \nreview process for hazardous fuel reduction projects will ensure that \nwe can quickly address what ails our forests.\n  Secondly, our legislation also provides increased funding and \ndirection for forestland research in this country. Our legislation will \nensure that our Nation's colleges and universities are able to devote \nmore research into the insects and diseases affecting our forests. We \nalso require that any forestland research be conducted at a scale \nappropriate to the forest damage, and that it be conducted within the \nrequirements of each individual forest management plan. Our legislation \nalso includes requirements to ensure this research has clearly stated \nforest restoration objectives and is peer reviewed by scientific \nexperts in forestland health.\n  Our legislation includes authorization for a new upland hardwood \nresearch center designed to study the myriad of insects, disease, and \nproblems affecting our ability to rehabilitate, restore, and utilize \nour upland hardwood forests. As we have seen, Arkansas was caught \nalmost flatfooted as the epidemic of oak mortality swept through the \nOzarks and severely endangered the health of our forests. Establishing \nthis new research center will help ensure that this does not happen \nagain.\n\n  The new research center will specifically research the effects of \npests and pathogens on upland hardwoods, hardwood stand regeneration \nand reproductive biology, upland hardwood stand management and forest \nhealth, threatened, endangered and sensitive aquatic and terrestrial \nfauna, ecological processes and hardwood ecosystem restoration, and \neducation and outreach to nonindustrial private forest landowners and \nassociations.\n  The establishment of this new research center is necessary to ensure \nwe can quickly identify and respond to the multitude of pests, disease, \nand other damaging agents that can dramatically affect our beloved \nforests.\n  Third, our legislation also includes funding for emergency grants to \nimmediately remove the invasive plants that have become so pervasive \nthroughout this Nation's forests. And when we talk about invasive plant \nspecies in the South, we are talking about one thing--Kudzu. Some call \nit the vine that ate the South. Kudzu was brought into this country \nseveral decades ago to be used as cover for bare hillsides and has \nsince spread to cover everything including shrubs, bushes, and entire \ntrees. The grant program included in our legislation will provide the \nmeans for landowners to immediately remove kudzu and the myriad other \ninvasive plants that are choking out our forests.\n  Finally, our legislation also includes widely agreed upon language \nthat would provide for grants to remove non-commercial biomass from our \nprivate forested watersheds, and provide for grants to establish \nprivate, healthy forest reserves throughout the nation. Many of these \nimportant provisions were included in the Senate-passed farm bill last \nyear, but they were not included in the final legislation, \nunfortunately. Providing grants to remove noncommercial biomass will \nimmediately reduce the amount of fuel on the forest floor and directly \nreduce the fire danger in our forests and around our communities. \nSimilarly, providing grants to protect our forest watersheds will \nensure that we can address our water quality concerns with a voluntary, \nincentive based approach. And finally, providing funding to establish \nnew healthy forest reserves from willing private landowners will \nencourage the preservation and rehabilitation of this Nation's \nforestlands.\n  Mr. President, I believe that our bipartisan legislation will focus \nneeded attention on a number of extremely critical goals for our \nnational forest policy. One lesson that we have learned over the years \nis that if we value our forests, if want to conserve our woodland and \nresources, if we want to preserve their natural beauty, if we want to \nensure that the natural bounty of our forestlands is available to \nfuture generations, then it is important that we manage those lands and \nresources with a careful eye toward their long-term health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9801-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9801-S9802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1327.

Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of the \npassage of this bill, the pediatric rule. Passage of this bill will be \na very important step in protecting the health of our children. This \nbill will help keep the pediatric rule in place to help ensure the \ndrugs we give our children when they are sick are actually tested for \nuse by our children. The tragic reality is there are medicines on the \nmarket today that are being used by and prescribed for our Nation's \nchildren that are oftentimes not being tested for their use. It has \nbeen that way for years and years.\n  For many years, doctors have had to take a chance when prescribing \nmedicines for our kids. Doctors have literally had to tell parents to \ncut the pill in half or in quarters to be given to a child. The doctors \nhave used the best information they have to literally guess how much \nmedicine to give a child. That is all they could do with the medicines; \nthey have had to guess.\n  Quite frankly, these medicines have been overprescribed, \nunderprescribed, or maybe not prescribed at all when they should have \nbeen prescribed. For example, recently the drug Paxil, which is an \nantidepressant, has been prescribed without being tested in children at \nall. Many people have heard of this drug. Many people have heard of the \nbeneficial effects for adults with anxiety and panic disorders. What \npeople did not know, what doctors did not know, was what we have \nrecently found out. Recently the British Government has warned doctors \nto stop prescribing this drug for children, warning that the medicine \nincreased the risk of suicide or suicidal thinking among children with \ndepression. This action, in turn, spurred the FDA to conduct its own \ninvestigation into the safety of this drug for younger patients, \nresulting in a similar warning to physicians here in the United States: \nDon't prescribe this drug for children.\n\n  That is just one example. We have page after page of examples of \ndrugs that have been prescribed to children in the past and once we \nthen tested them, once the protocols were done, the testing was done, \nlo and behold, we found they were more effective for children than we \nthought. Sometimes they were not effective, sometimes the \nprescriptions, the amount, the dosage that had been used was too much, \nsometimes not enough.\n  The facts are these. As we all know, children are not just miniature \nadults. You can't just take the weight and just reduce the dosage. Kids \nreact differently. That is why it is so important to have the testing \ndone. Yet when Senator Chris Dodd and I first started on this cause, 5 \nor 6 years ago, 80 percent of the drugs that came on the market had \nnever been tested for children at all.\n  It has been over a year now since this Senate passed and the \nPresident signed into law the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. \nThe Best Act was a bill that followed the Better Pharmaceuticals for \nChildren Act, which we passed a few years before that. That law, the \nBest Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, was part of the solution, just \npart of the solution to address the problem of getting medicines tested \nfor use by children.\n  That law provides, as its predecessor bill did, a 6-month patent \nextension to pharmaceutical companies in exchange for the testing of \nmedicines in children. That was a voluntary law and it has worked \npretty well. For as long as the bill has been law--its predecessor was \nlaw--the Food and Drug Administration reported success in ensuring that \nmore medicines are tested for use in children. With this economic \nincentive by this Best Pharmaceutical and Better Pharmaceutical bill in \nplace, companies are seeing the value of studying their drugs in \nchildren and are applying for the patent extension, and children are \nbenefiting.\n  But the Best Pharmaceuticals incentive cannot work alone. It was \nnever intended to work alone to ensure that medicines for children are \nproperly tested for their use. In order to ensure that no medicines \nneeded to treat children, including vaccines or other biologics, would \ngo untested, the FDA, in 1997, proposed what is known as the Pediatric \nRule, a companion rule. The Pediatric Rule allowed the FDA to require \nthat drugs deemed important for children be tested for their safety, \nfor their effectiveness, and that they be properly, then, labeled for \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately--and this is what brings us to the Senate floor tonight \nto consider this bill--the Pediatric Rule came under legal challenge \nand was, in fact, overturned in court in October 2002, last year, by a \ndistrict court. That court ruled that the FDA lacked the statutory \nauthority to require pediatric studies.\n  What the court said was it was incumbent upon Congress to fix it. \nThat is why we are here tonight. This was a troubling step backward for \nchildren's health, considering that today 75 percent of the medicines \non the market still, even with the Better Pharmaceutical bill and the \nBest Pharmaceutical bill, still 75 percent of the medicines on the \nmarket today are not tested and labeled for pediatric use.\n\n  Without the Pediatric Rule in place, without the necessary authority \nprovided to the FDA, new medicines and biologics coming onto the market \nare not required to be tested for use in kids. Since that court \ndecision on October 17, 2002, the FDA has indicated that over 300 \nmedicines either have applications pending or incomplete studies \npending, and that unless the Pediatric Rule stays in place these will \nall be lost. Many more, hundreds more will be lost in the future. \nPediatricians will not know how to prescribe these drugs in the future \nor whether to prescribe them at all.\n  That is why Senator Clinton, Senator Dodd, and myself introduced the \nbill that we hope to pass tonight. It is a bill that would codify a \nsignificant piece of the Pediatric Rule to assure that it stays in \nplace and ensures that children will remain on safe footing when it \ncomes to the testing of the medications that they use.\n  Furthermore, we need to keep the Pediatric Rule in place right now \nbecause the Pediatric Rule and incentives work together to ensure that \ndrugs are tested for use in children.\n  The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, as I said already, was \nnever intended to be a substitute for the rule but, rather, to \nreinforce and work with the rule. For example, the Pediatric Rule may \nbe invoked in instances where pediatric information is essential but \nthe patent exclusivity incentive is no longer available.\n  The Pediatric Rule also applies to biologics, whereas the Best \nPharmaceutical bill does not. A significant portion of therapeutics \nused in children, including many cancer treatments or biological \nproducts--by that, of course, we mean products that include a live \nagent. Because the Best Pharmaceutical law does not apply to biologics, \nthe Pediatric Rule is the only way to ensure proper and effective \npediatric labeling.\n  Finally, the Best Pharmaceutical Act is voluntary. For any number of \nreasons, including insufficient sales, a manufacturer simply may choose \nto\n\n[[Page S9814]]\n\nnot conduct the necessary testing to receive additional exclusivity \nunder the ``Best'' law, and when that happens and the drug is not \ntested for kids, children are the losers. But just because a drug \nmanufacturer chooses not to study the drug in children does not mean \nthat the drug is not critical to the proper care of your children and \nmy children or grandchildren. Without the Pediatric Rule that is in \nfront of us today, there is no way to guarantee that a drug that is \nused in the pediatric population is tested for children's use.\n  With the establishment of the Pediatric Rule and the financial \nincentives of the Best Pharmaceutical law, which will go with this, \nthere has been a dramatic increase in the number of studies that have \nbeen undertaken. Let me quote from the Government's Response to \nPlaintiff's Notice of Reauthorization of FDA Modernization Act. This is \nthe document the Government filed to defend the lawsuit against the \nrule.\n\n       These two options--Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act \n     and the Pediatric Rule--have resulted in a number of drugs \n     being labeled for use in pediatric applications. As of March \n     31, 2001, 94 applications containing complete or partial \n     pediatric use and information have been submitted to the \n     agency. Of these 94 applications, 45 are attributable to the \n     statutory exclusivity provision. FDA attributes 48 of the 94 \n     applications to the authority of the pediatric rule alone.\n\n  So you can see how the two must work together, how important the rule \nis. Our legislation is a step toward assuring this progress that we \nhave made so far will not erode. Our bill, as amended, provides that \nthe FDA may only impose the pediatric study requirement for already-\nmarketed drugs when the pediatric exclusivity incentive provisions fail \nto yield necessary pediatric information. This means that for already-\nmarketed drugs, drugs that the FDA has already approved and are already \non the drugstore shelf, before FDA can require a company to study the \ndrug for use in children, the incentive provisions of the Best \nPharmaceuticals law have to be used first. So the drug manufacturer has \nto choose to use the incentive provisions first, before FDA can invoke \nthe pediatric study requirement.\n  Our bill also preserves the waiver and deferral process so that drug \ncompanies can get waivers or deferrals for a range of legitimate \nreasons. Waivers are a simple concept.\n  Drugs, such as those used to treat Alzheimer's disease--those drugs \nthat would not be used in children at all--obviously should not be \ntested for use in children. Those drug manufacturers would be allowed \nto waive the pediatric drug study requirement.\n  Deferrals are similar. For drug manufacturers who require additional \ntime to complete the drug study or need to get additional information \nin the adult population before beginning to study the drug in children \ncan, in consultation with the FDA, defer the pediatric drug studies \nuntil a later date.\n  Again, I am very pleased that my colleagues have agreed to pass our \nbill. It is a vital step toward ensuring that children are no longer a \ntherapeutic afterthought.\n  Our bill puts children on a level playing field with adults for the \nfirst time.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank the many people who have worked diligently to draft this bill and \nto help get it passed. I would like to thank Majority Leader Frist and \nSenators Clinton, Dodd, Gregg, Kennedy, and Murray for their leadership \non this issue. Without their support, this bill would not be a reality.\n  I would also like to thank Abby Kral of my staff for her dedication \nand hard work on this issue--she spent an unbelievable amount of time \non it--as well as Christina Ho from Senator Clinton's Staff, Ben \nBerwick with Senator Dodd, Vince Ventimiglia with Senator Gregg's \nStaff, and David Dorsey with Senator Kennedy.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize two groups that provided my staff \nand the staff of the HELP Committee with invaluable comments and \ninsights--the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Elizabeth Glaser \nPediatric AIDS Foundation.\n  Thank you all for your efforts and commitment to protecting our \nchildren's health and safety.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this important bill guarantees that drugs \nand biological products used for children are tested and labeled for \nchildren. It helps assure that the miracle cures of today can be \nadministered to our children in safe and effective ways.\n  I commend Senators Gregg, Clinton, DeWine, and Dodd for their \neffective and tireless leadership to see this important legislation \nthrough the Senate. And it is endorsed by the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the March \nof Dimes, and many other organizations dedicated to children's health.\n  Under this legislation, drug companies will be required to prove that \ntheir drugs and biological products are safe and effective for their \nintended use in children. For too long, drug companies have tested \ntheir products only in adults. For years, companies only rarely tested \ntheir drugs in children, unless the drug's use was for a juvenile \ndisease. For other drugs, the label simply said that the product had \nnot been shown to be safe and effective in children. To use such drugs \non our children was a medical gamble.\n  Fortunately, that practice began to change 6 years ago. In 1997, \nCongress authorized 6 months of ``pediatric exclusivity''--6 months of \nadditional life of a drug patent if the company had studied the drug in \nchildren. The extra patent protection was a valuable economic incentive \nfor drug companies to study their drugs on children, and it has been \nvery successful in achieving that goal.\n  In 1998, FDA issued its Pediatric Rule, which allowed the agency to \nrequire a drug company to test and label certain drugs for children.\n  The patent exclusivity can be used once to study a drug. But the FDA \nrule can be used more than once, if needed, such as when the studies \nrequested under exclusivity do not include studies in infants or \nnewborns. In some cases, studies in older children are needed before \nstudies can even be designed for younger children and newborn infants.\n  The rule can be used to require testing for biological products, \nwhich are not eligible for the extra patent exclusivity. The rule can \nalso be used when a drug company decides not to seek extra patent \nexclusivity and does not study a drug in children.\n  Unfortunately, a Federal district court held that FDA does not have \nthe statutory authority to issue the Pediatric Rule. Although the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS \nFoundation are appealing this decision, and we hope for their quick \nsuccess, the Senate has now passed this legislation to correct the \nsituation.\n  With this legislation, the essential protections of the rule will be \ncodified in law: There will be a presumption that newly approved \napplications for new active ingredients, new indications, new dosage \nforms, new dosing regimens, or new routes of administration for drugs \nand biological products will include assessments of safety and \neffectiveness for all relevant pediatric subpopulations. These \nassessments will support dosing and administration using a pediatric \nformulation for all pediatric subpopulations in which the product is \nsafe and effective. This will be a huge step forward for children, and \nwill put them on an equal footing with adults.\n  In addition, many products already on the market have meaningful \ntherapeutic benefit to children or may be used for a substantial number \nof children. However, the absence of adequate labeling in these \nproducts poses significant risks to pediatric patients. This \nlegislation will allow FDA to require such products to be studied in \nchildren for its approved indication. The bill requires that FDA must \nfirst provide an opportunity for these studies to be conducted under \nthe provisions of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. However, \nif a product's manufacturer does not agree promptly to perform such \nstudies voluntarily, and if funds are not sufficient so that the NIH or \nthe Foundation for the NIH does not contract or issue a grant for \nconduct of the studies within a set period of time, FDA may invoke the \nauthority in this legislation to require the studies. Although FDA \nnever used this authority under its Pediatric Rule, we expect FDA to \nuse it as necessary to ensure that drugs and biological products that \nare already approved are studied in children when other mechanisms to \nget them studied fail.\n\n[[Page S9815]]\n\n  This legislation, with the managers' amendment, provides FDA with \nclear enforcement authority to bring a seizure or injunction action \nwhen a company fails to submit a required pediatric assessment. That \nfailure alone will make the drug or biological product misbranded.\n  This legislation, with the managers' amendment, clarifies that \nassessments required under FDA's Pediatric Rule that have not yet been \nsubmitted to FDA, whether deferred until after approval or not, are \nassessments required under this legislation. The legislation therefore \nensures that hundreds of assessments that FDA required under its rule \nwill be completed for the benefit of the Nation's children.\n  Although this legislation is a giant step forward for children, I \ncan't help but express my disappointment that its requirements are tied \nto the pediatric exclusivity provision that sunsets in 2007. Adults are \nguaranteed that new drugs will be reviewed for safety and effectiveness \nfor them before they are approved by the FDA. Our Nation's children \ndeserve no less. They should not have to come back in 4 years to plead \nfor the right to safe and effective medicines.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues for reaching bipartisan agreement on \nthis important initiative for children.

Mr. President, I rise to speak to a managers' amendment to \nS. 650, the Pediatric Research Equity Act. This amendment makes \nimprovements to the legislation as reported out of the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions in June. Because these \nimprovements were made after the committee report was filed, this \nstatement is intended to serve as the committee's views on the amended \nlegislation. This statement was shared with the other committee members \nand has their concurrence.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Democratic sponsors of the bill and I \nconcur with this statement.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the purpose of this legislation is to \nprovide FDA with statutory authority to require pediatric studies in \nspecified circumstances. In October 2002, a Federal district court held \nthat existing law did not provide FDA the authority to issue a \nregulation requiring pediatric studies for drugs marketed to adults but \nimportant to children. Although this decision is being appealed, this \nlegislation will provide the agency with definitive statutory authority \nto require pediatric studies of new and already marketed drugs and \nbiologics in the circumstances specified in the legislation and to \nenforce any violations of those requirements in Federal court. This has \nalways been the intent of S. 650. After the legislation was marked up \nin committee, the managers of the bill agreed to amend the language in \nsection 505B(d) to make this intent even clearer.\n  The enforcement mechanism in section 505B(d) provides that if a \nperson fails to submit an assessment described in subsection (a)(2) or \na request for approval of a pediatric formulation described in \nsubsection (a) or (b) under the new law, ``the drug or biological \nproduct that is the subject of the assessment or request may be \nconsidered misbranded solely because of such failure.'' This language \nconfers on the Secretary authority to bring a misbranding action where \na violation has occurred.\n  The committee has used the language ``may be considered'' \n(misbranded) rather than the traditional ``shall be deemed to be'' \n(misbranded) that is used in other provisions of the Federal Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act in order to emphasized that the Secretary may exercise \ntraditional enforcement discretion in deciding whether to bring such an \naction. The Committee recognizes that the Secretary retains that \ndiscretion under other provisions of current law that use the ``shall'' \nformulation. Nevertheless, the Committee intends for this authority to \nbe interpreted by the courts and to be implemented by FDA in a manner \nconsistent with the agency's enforcement authorities in current law \nthat use the ``shall'' formulation.\n  As is true with other provisions of current law, once the Secretary \ndecides to initiate an enforcement action under section 505B(d), no \nformal finding or other proceeding is required. Moreover, it is not \nnecessary for the Secretary to identify any other misbranding authority \nin the act. The new authority conferred by section 505B(d) \nis sufficient. For example, the failure of a sponsor to submit \npediatric studies in accordance with the requirements of the \nlegislation alone would be a sufficient basis to prosecute an action in \nfederal district court.\n\n  The managers of the bill have agreed to the extraordinary retroactive \napplication of the provisions of the new research authority in order to \navoid even greater potential harm to children through the loss of \nresearch and agency resources should assessments, waivers, and \ndeferrals under the Pediatric Rule be considered invalid following the \nrecent district court decision invalidating the rule. This application \nshould not be considered approval of the agency's interpretation of its \nauthority nor disagreement of the court's ruling. In the extraordinary \nsituation at hand, the managers' amendment modifies the effective date \nprovision of the legislation to ensure a seamless transition of the \npediatric study requirement from the Pediatric rule to this \nlegislation. The intent is that waivers and deferrals of the study \nrequirement previously granted under the rule be deemed to be in effect \nunder the legislation. A sponsor that received a deferral under the \nrule would have the original deferral date extended by the number of \ndays between October 17, 2002, and the date of enactment of this \nlegislation.\n  A sponsor that submitted an application in the time period between \nApril 1, 1999, and the date of enactment of this legislation that was \nnot granted a waiver or deferral under the rule would be required to \nsubmit pediatric assessments unless granted a waiver by FDA. However, \nno submission by a sponsor would be due until 12 months after the date \nof enactment of this legislation or until a date specified by FDA under \nsection 505B(a)(3), whichever is later.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Although I and the Democratic sponsors\n\n[[Page S9816]]\n\nof the bill disagree with the chairman's view that the agency lacked \nthe authority to promulgate the Pediatric Rule and his view that the \nFederal district court ruling invalidating the rule was correct, we do \nagree with the chairman's statements regarding the need to apply the \nrequirements of this legislation retroactively to ensure that no \npediatric studies are lost in the transition from the rule to this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, S. 650 provides FDA the statutory authority \nto require that new and already marketed drugs and biological products \nbe studied in children in specified circumstances. This authority is \nintended to work in a complementary fashion with pediatric exclusivity. \nWith regard to already marketed products, S. 650 provides that FDA \nrequire pediatric testing only after pediatric exclusivity and the \nNational Institutes of Health grant and contract provisions contained \nin sections 409I and 499 of the Public Health service Act have failed \nto produce the necessary studies. However, nothing in S. 650 requires \nFDA to wait until the voluntary mechanisms have failed or been \nexhausted before invoking the pediatric studies requirement for new \ndrug applications under section 505 of the Federal Food, drug and \nCosmetic Act or biological license applications under section 351 of \nthe Public Health service Act. On the contrary, S. 650 creates the \npresumption that new drugs and biologics will be studied before \napproval unless a waiver or deferral is granted.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. Does he agree \nas well, that, in accordance with the plain language of the \nlegislation, FDA shall grant a waiver of the requirement to submit \npediatric assessments only if the applicant certifies and the Secretary \nfinds that the conditions specified in 505B(a)(4) and 505B(b)(2) exist? \nBy using the word ``including'' before listing the circumstances under \nwhich FDA shall grant a full or partial waiver in the committee report \nfor S. 650, the committee does not intend that any conditions or \ncircumstances other than those specifically stated in 505B(a)(4) and \n505B(b)(2) serve as the basis for FDA granting a full or partial waiver \nof the requirements of the legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I do, and I thank the Senator for his work \non this bill and the report.\n  The bill (S. 650), as amended, was read the third time and passed as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to applaud my colleagues for \npassing the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, and to thank all of \nthose who have worked so hard on this issue. This legislation \nrepresents a truly bipartisan compromise, and I deeply appreciate the \ncommitment to this issue shown by Senators DeWine, Clinton, Gregg, and \nKennedy. I also acknowledge the invaluable role played by the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS \nFoundation.\n  Quite simply, this legislation will make our children safer. It will \nensure that they have access to prescription drugs that have been \nproperly evaluated for their use. It will remove the guesswork often \ndone by pediatricians about what drugs are appropriate for a child, and \nin what dosages. And it will accomplish all of this by codifying into \nstatutory language a tool that has already been shown to be effective: \nthe Pediatric Rule.\n  The Pediatric Rule went into effect in April of 1999 and was intended \nto work in conjunction with a voluntary incentives program that \nCongress passed in 1997 and was reauthorized last year. Both the \nincentives program and the rule were put into place to address an unmet \nneed that had potentially serious consequences to the health of \nchildren.\n  Children are not just small versions of adults when it comes to \ndrugs. Some drugs that are completely safe for adults may be very \nharmful to children. In addition, some needed drugs are not available \nin a formulation that a child can take, such as a liquid or chewable \ntablet. Finally, the appropriate dosage for a child cannot be \ndetermined simply by extrapolating from adults. Yet, until the rule and \nthe incentives program were enacted, this is exactly what pediatricians \nwere forced to do. Roughly 75 percent of all prescription drugs on the \nmarket today have never been properly tested for safe use by children.\n  As a result, children have suffered needlessly. For example, new \ntests on the epilepsy drug Neurontin have shown that higher dosages \nthan expected are needed for children under 5. For years, pediatricians \nsimply believed that Neurontin was a drug that was ineffective for \nchildren.\n  In 1997, Congress enacted legislation, introduced by Senator DeWine \nand myself, to provide drug companies with an economic incentive to \ntest their products to ensure their safety in children. This was \nfollowed by enactment of the Pediatric Rule in 1999, which worked with \nthe incentive by giving the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the \nauthority to require that drugs and biologics important to children be \ntested and formulated for their use.\n  Working as complements to each other, the rule and the incentive \nprovided tremendous results. Between April 1999 and March 2002, \nresearch was completed on the safety and effectiveness in children of \nroughly 100 days. These medicines were for the treatment of, among \nother things, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, asthma pain and arthritis. In \naddition, studies of hundreds more drugs are in the pipeline.\n  But continued success of this magnitude is dependent on the existence \nof both the rule and the incentive program. FDA has stated that \napproximately half of the completed studies were due to the authority \nprovided by the Pediatric Rule.\n  Unfortunately, in October of last year, the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Columbia ruled that FDA does not have the authority to \nenforce the rule. This decision represented a step backwards for \nchildren's health. We can hardly afford to do without the rule when we \nstill do not have necessary information for kids for a majority of the \nmedicines on the market.\n  The legislation that we passed today will give the FDA clear \nauthority to require that drugs be tested and formulated for children. \nCompanies should continue to have access to voluntary incentives, but \nthe rule must be in place to ensure that as many products as possible \nare studied for use in children.\n  For example, the rule captures a class of products, specifically \nbiologics, for which market exclusivity incentives do not apply. There \nare a number of biologic products used to treat cancer in children for \nwhich information about their specific use--safety and efficacy--in \nkids would be vital. Only the rule would apply here.\n  The rule can also be applied as needed during the life of a drug as \nmore information is required. For example, if a new use of a drug is \ndiscovered and safety or dosing information for that new use is needed. \nExclusivity can only be applied once, even if an important new use for \na product is found. Also, because the incentives are voluntary, for any \nnumber of reasons a manufacturer may choose not to conduct the \nnecessary testing. Without the rule there is no way to guarantee that a \ndrug that may be critically important to children's health is tested.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention one provision in this \nlegislation with which I disagree. As a result of this provision, the \nauthority that we clearly provide to FDA with this bill will sunset in \n2007. While I believe that FDA has the authority to enforce the rule \neven without this legislation, that has clearly been called into \nquestion given the District Court ruling. Therefore, it is imperative \nthat we unequivocally and permanently provide the FDA with statutory \nauthority to require pediatric testing. Unfortunately, as it now stands \nthat critical authority will expire in 2007 unless reauthorized.\n  It is my view that such a reauthorization should not be necessary. We \ntake it for granted that studies will be done to assure that the drugs \nthat adults use are safe and effective. Why should the assumption be \nany different for children? FDA should always have the authority to \nmake sure that the drugs that kids use have been tested for their use. \nThis is not something that Congress should have to reauthorize every 5 \nyears. Kids should not have to come back to Congress every 5 years to \nfight for the basic right to safe drugs.\n  Despite my concern with the sunset provision, I strongly support this \nbill. The voluntary program has been a huge success, but its \nlimitations can be addressed by passage of this legislation. Simply \nput, taking any tool off the table that promotes pediatric testing is \nat odds with our overarching goal of ensuring that medicines are safe \nand available for our children. That is why we must protect the rule \nand ensure that our efforts for kids will not be diminished. The \nPediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 will do exactly that.\n  I sincerely hope that the House will pass this bill as soon as \npossible, preferably without any changes so that we can send it to the \nPresident to be signed into law without delay.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to mark the passage on the Senate \nfloor of a bill, S. 650, that will assure the safety and efficacy of \nmedicines for children, and address a problem that pediatricians, \nparents, and children's advocates have worked on for decades. A great \ndeal of work went into this bill. So many hardworking, dedicated \nSenators made the effort on a bipartisan basis to come together around \nthis important issue. In particular I want to thank Senators DeWine, \nDodd, Gregg, and Kennedy. Senators DeWine and Dodd and I now have \nworked on pediatric research for many years, and we\n\n[[Page S9819]]\n\nwill continue to be around to work on behalf of children, who, without \ndedicated advocates like Senators DeWine and Dodd, would not have a \npolitical voice.\n  Last year this bill was passed out of committee but held up on the \nfloor toward the end of session. Unfortunately, that meant no backstop \nwas in place to assure the continuation of a minimum baseline \nprotection for children when last October, a District Court judge \nstruck down the 1998 FDA Pediatric Rule, based on his view that \nCongress did not intend to charge FDA with making sure our children are \nprotected. Today, we pass legislation to clarify that FDA authority to \nassure safe, effective medicines for children is exactly what we \nintend.\n  This bill was the product of compromise. We all worked hard and made \nconcessions on all sides to craft the language the Senate was able to \npass today. Some of us would have preferred a strong, permanent \nassurance for children, and not a sunset of these crucial protections \nin 2007. Indeed, because the purpose of this legislation was to address \nthe uncertainty caused by the court-triggered lapse of pediatric \nstudies, not codify such a lapse into statute, I cannot support the \nsunset provision.\n  But others may have wished to change other aspects of the bill. So we \nwere able to give on each side for the sake of moving forward on a \ncentral accomplishment providing FDA with undisputed, unencumbered \nauthority to require and enforce studies of whether medicines important \nfor children are also safe and effective for children. Our managers' \namendment and the colloquy we submitted today reinforce that as the \ngoal we all share here today in passing this language.\n  I want to take a moment to bring special attention to the amount of \nwork and cooperation that the chair and ranking member of Senate Health \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee have dedicated to this bill, \nboth last Congress and this Congress. Senator Gregg and Senator \nKennedy, and both their staffs, Vince Ventimiglia, and David Dorsey \nhave lent their expertise and their time to this issue. Senator \nDeWine's staff, Abby Kral, and Senator Dodd's staff, Ben Berwick this \nyear, Debra Barrett last year, have been more dedicated than anyone on \nthis issue.\n  I particularly want to acknowledge the outside experts who have \ndevoted so much time to advocating on behalf of children and making \nthis proposal a reality. The American Academy of Pediatricians, Elaine \nVining here in DC and all the pediatricians across the country, have \nbeen championing this issue for so long. Also, Mark Isaac and Jeanne \nIreland at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation have been \ntireless in their efforts. The children's hospitals, and so many others \ncannot be thanked enough. We would not be here today without their \npassionate advocacy. I also appreciate working with Phrma to get to \nthis point and hope to continue to work with them in order to move this \nbill quickly into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9819-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9819-S9823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NATIVE AMERICAN ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM CONSOLIDATION ACT \n                                OF 2003\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment this evening \nto pay tribute to our dear friend and former colleague, Strom Thurmond, \na man who gave of himself personally to his constituents and to his \ncolleagues here in the Senate.\n  All of us will always remember Strom. We will remember him seated \nright in front of the Presiding Officer at his desk. We will remember \nhim for his smile. We will remember him for his greeting. Frankly, I \ndon't think any of us will ever walk into this Chamber again without \nalmost seeing him down there at his desk.\n  He was a man who gave so much of himself to his constituents. We will \nremember him for the way he treated each one of us, the way he treated \nhis constituents, and the individual attention he gave to us and his \nconstituents.\n  I saw the way he personally dealt with his constituents. I also saw \nthe personal attention he paid to me and the personal interest he took \nin my family. In particular, I am grateful to him for the hospitality \nand attention he showed to my son Brian, who just recently graduated \nfrom his beloved Clemson University.\n  A few years ago, when I told Strom that my son Brian was going to \nClemson, I remember the big smile on his face. Of course, I knew he was \na graduate of Clemson. I could tell how delighted and eager he was to \nshare stories about his experience at Clemson. And I remember a lot of \nthose stories.\n  Of course, the first thing he told me was: ``You know, I went to \nClemson''--which, of course, I did know. And I then asked him: ``Strom, \nwhat year did you graduate from Clemson?'' He said: ``1923.'' I said: \n``Strom, that was the year my dad was born''--which it was.\n\n  During the 4 years that Brian was at Clemson, almost every time I saw \nStrom on the floor, Strom would say: ``How's your boy? How is that boy \nof yours doing down at Clemson? Does he like it?'' Of course, I told \nhim he did, which Brian certainly did.\n  After Brian graduated, Strom invited Brian and myself up to his \noffice. Strom showed him all the pictures on the wall. Strom invited \nhim over and\n\n[[Page S9824]]\n\nhad his picture taken with Brian, a picture that Brian now has, and a \ncopy of another picture that I have of Brian and myself and Strom that \nis in a prominent place in my office today in the Russell Building.\n  Strom Thurmond paid this same level of attention, which he paid to \nhis colleague in the Senate and to his colleague's son, to all his \nconstituents. And we know that. We have all heard the stories. It did \nnot matter whether you were a U.S. Senator or whether you worked in a \nfilling station or who you were in his home State of South Carolina; it \ndid not matter. That was Strom Thurmond. It did not matter who you \nwere, Strom paid attention to you.\n  We have all heard the stories about the birthdays and the \nanniversaries, constituent problems. It did not matter, Strom was \nthere.\n  Strom Thurmond has left a mark on his State and our country through \nhis kindness and his personal attention to others--a mark that surely \nwill not be forgotten or held in anything less than the highest regard.\n  We thank Strom for his service to our country, to South Carolina, and \nto the people who will miss his kindness and his friendship. We thank \nStrom for his extra efforts to help those in need, those he loved, and \nthose he came to the Senate to represent.\n  We will remember this man, our friend, fondly. He was a man of \ncourage, a man of integrity, a man of passion, a man who loved this \ncountry dearly.\n  We thank you, Strom. We miss you. We respect you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9824-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 24, 2003\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

DAYTON\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of \nMinnesota's leading citizens who passed away last Saturday, a man who \nalso happens to be my uncle, Kenneth N. Dayton.\n  Kenneth Dayton was one of five brothers who returned from their \nservice in World War II, and when their father died in 1950, took \nownership and operating control of a single department store in \nMinneapolis which was then known as the Dayton Company. Ken was \ninstrumental, along with my father, Bruce Dayton, in building that \nsmall family-owned business into what is now Target Corporation, the \nsecond largest retail company in America.\n  Last year, Target Corporation owned and operated some 1,500 stores in \n48 States under the names Target, Marshall Fields, and Mervyn's. The \nweek I took office in January 2001, the company announced that it was \nchanging the name of its upper midwest Dayton's department stores to \nMarshall Fields. I have always suspected they did so because they were \nconcerned I was going to generate so much bad publicity for the Dayton \nname that they better make that change while they could.\n  Kenneth Dayton, however, added only stature and respect to our family \nname. He was a brilliant retailer who understood merchandise, \nmarketing, and consumers. He served as president, chief executive \nofficer, and chairman of the board during two decades of expansions and \nacquisitions in the 1960s and 1970s, which transformed the company into \na publicly owned corporation and a national retailer.\n  Early on, the five brothers established a practice of contributing 5 \npercent of pretax profits to charitable organizations. It was one of \ntheir ways to give back to and enhance the communities where the stores \nwere located.\n  Kenneth Dayton became a national spokesman for this 5 percent club, \nand he persuaded many other leaders of American corporations to adopt \nthe practice of contributing, if not 5 percent, at least some \ndesignated amount of their profits to worthwhile social causes.\n  Ken and his wife of over 50 years, Judy Dayton, practiced what he \npreached. They have been two of Minnesota's leading philanthropists \nduring the last half century, contributing, by their own account, over \n$100 million to charitable organizations. The Minneapolis symphony \norchestra, a world class symphony orchestra, which performs in a world \nclass orchestral hall, has been a principal beneficiary and great love \nof Ken and Judy Dayton. But hundreds of other organizations, large and \nsmall, engaged in all kinds of important work, have been also \nrecipients of their wonderful sense of social responsibility.\n  That wide variety of causes reflected Ken Dayton's wide breadth of \ninterests. He had enormous enthusiasm for life, and he brought that \nenthusiasm to everything he did, along with a keen intellect and a \nworld of life experience.\n  Because of his stature as a civic leader in Minnesota and the \nimportance of his many contributions to the city of Minneapolis, to the \nState of Minnesota, and to our country, I would be making this tribute \nto Kenneth N. Dayton were he not my uncle, but I am proud he was. He \ninspired, supported, and guided our family and so many others whose \nlives he touched. I am fortunate to have been one of those blessed by \nhis life and his love.\n  John Kennedy, as President in 1961, said for those to whom much is \ngiven, much is required. And when at some future date the high court of \nhistory sits in judgment of each of us, our success or failure will be \nmeasured by the answers to four questions: First, were we truly men of \ncourage? Second, were we truly men of judgment? Third, were we truly \nmen of integrity? Finally, were we truly men of dedication?\n  By those four measures, Kenneth Dayton was a success--a great \nsuccess. He was a great man and, more importantly, he was a good man.\n  Well done, good and faithful servant. May you rest in peace.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/23/senate-section/article/S9825-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9825]]\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
