Mr. President, this morning we will have a brief period of \nmorning business for up to 30 minutes, with the first 15 minutes under \nthe control of the minority and the final 15 minutes under the control \nof the majority.\n  Following that time, the Senate will resume consideration of the \npending resolution regarding Senate intelligence and Homeland Security \noversight reform. Our whips are here again today to manage that \nresolution throughout the day. They will be able to update Members \nshortly in terms of expectations over the course of the day. I hope \nMembers come forward with their amendments so we can finish this \nimportant resolution today.\n  I remind everyone that last night we filed a cloture motion on that \nresolution with the purpose of ensuring that we complete consideration \nof the reform resolution this week. That is the goal that was set out \nactually weeks ago by the Democratic leader and myself, the leadership \non both sides of the aisle. Again our purpose was not in any way to get \nSenators cut off on their ability to offer amendments, but given our \nobjective of departing tomorrow, we do need to work expeditiously on \nthis legislation which we absolutely must and will finish.\n  As my colleagues know, rule XXII requires that first-degree \namendments be filed at the desk no later than 1 o'clock today. At that \npoint in time we should have a better idea as to how to proceed with \nthe resolution over the course of the afternoon.\n  In addition to completing the pending reform resolution, we expect \nthe House to act on the FSC/ETI or JOBS conference report today. Real \nprogress was made yesterday. As we all know, the conference completed \nits action and the House will address the conference report today. Once \nthey address it, we will be able to address it. We will turn to that \nconference report later today, late today.\n  I hope we can reach an agreement for debate on that privileged \nconference report. However, similar to the current bill, if necessary, \nwe would have to file cloture. I hope that is not the case. There has \nbeen a lot of discussion over the last several days and I hope that \ndiscussion continues and that people do not force us to file cloture.\n  Again, the leadership on both sides of the aisle agrees and has set \nout the objective of finishing the FSC legislation before we close out \nour business.\n  We have a lot to do. We would also consider any other conference \nreport that does become available during this period.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                    National Intelligence Reform Act\n\n  A brief comment on action yesterday. Once again, I congratulate the \nChair and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee for a \ntremendous effort. A lot of the other committees participated directly \nthrough their chairmen and ranking members. Yesterday, we proved the \nSenate could act very deliberately but expeditiously on a very \nimportant bill, a bill that represents the most dramatic and \nsignificant reform of our intelligence community in half a century. We \ndelivered that product yesterday. It has been an effort underway for \nmonths and months, most significantly since July, the 9/11 Commission \nReport release date, but which proceeded\n\n[[Page S10616]]\n\nthrough August, September, into October, with the final Senate product \nbeing produced yesterday.\n  As mentioned again and again, what we have done the last several \nweeks is address nearly all 39 of the 41 recommendations put forth by \nthe 9/11 Commission. The business in the Senate after morning business \ntoday will be the remaining 2 of those 41 recommendations put forth by \nthe 9/11 Commission. Those two are very important, in part because they \nfocus on this body, its internal operation of oversight of the \nintelligence community, and thus we will address that.\n  Again, I congratulate everyone for their participation. There is no \nquestion that the provisions in the bill we passed yesterday will make \nour Nation safer, it will improve our intelligence community, and will \nhelp us immensely in the war on terrorism. That was reflected by the \noverwhelming support, with only two Senators voting against the bill \nyesterday.\n  This is going to be a very busy day but a productive day. Again, we \nshould be able to complete all of our business to be able to depart \ntomorrow, but if not, we would have to be here into Saturday and \nwhatever time it takes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10616-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it was a Presidential election campaign \n24 years ago when Ronald Reagan posed the defining question to the \nAmerican people in that election when he asked, Are you better off \ntoday than you were 4 years ago? That basic question has greater \nrelevance now than when Ronald Reagan asked it.\n  The defining issue today is our national security. Especially in this \npost-September 11 world, people have the right to ask Ronald Reagan's \nquestion in a very specific and all-important way: Are we safer today \nbecause of the policies of President Bush?\n  Any honest assessment can lead to only one answer and that answer is \nan emphatic no. President Bush is dead wrong and John Kerry is \nabsolutely right: We are not safer today.\n  The reason we are not safer is because of President Bush's misguided \nwar in Iraq. The President's handling of the war has been a toxic mix \nof ignorance, arrogance, and stubborn ideology. No amount of \nPresidential rhetoric or preposterous campaign spin can conceal the \ntruth about the steady downward spiral in our national security since \nPresident Bush made the decision to go to war in Iraq.\n  President Bush keeps saying that America and the world are safer and \nbetter off today because Saddam Hussein is gone. No matter how many \nrhetorical, double-twisting back flips President Bush performs, his \ndisingenuous claim that the war has made America safer is wrong--and \nmay be catastrophically wrong.\n  There were no weapons of mass destruction.\n  Across the country we see the newspapers with headlines like this \nmorning's Washington Post headline: ``U.S. `Almost All Wrong' on \nWeapons.'' There were no weapons. Here it is in the New York Times this \nmorning: ``U.S. Report Finds Iraqis Eliminated Illicit Arms in 90's.'' \n``Weapons Capability Had Eroded Before War, Inspector Says.''\n  Here is the recent report, just released yesterday, by the inspector \ngeneral, who is over there, Charles Duelfer, who followed Dr. Kay. Very \nprofessional individuals with strong teams have spent up to $900 \nmillion. This is the central conclusion on page 7:\n\n       Iraq did not possess a nuclear device, nor had it tried to \n     reconstitute a capability to produce nuclear weapons after \n     1991.\n\n  Again, in a New York Times editorial this morning entitled ``The \nVerdict Is In'':\n\n       Since any objective observer should by now have digested \n     the idea that Iraq posed no immediate threat to anyone, let \n     alone the United States, it was disturbing to hear President \n     Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney continue to try to \n     justify the invasion this week on the grounds that after \n     Sept. 11, 2001, Iraq was clearly the most likely place for \n     terrorists to get illicit weapons. Even if Mr. Hussein had \n     wanted to arm groups he could not control--a very dubious \n     notion--he had nothing to give them.\n\n  Those are the facts, Mr. President. And it is important for the \nadministration to finally admit them. Saddam had no nuclear program. He \nhad no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. The Iraq Survey Group \nbasically nailed the door shut on the administration's justification \nfor the war. But the President won't hear it. He stubbornly clings to \nhis fiction that ``there was a real risk that Saddam Hussein would pass \nweapons or materials or information to terrorist networks.''\n  President Bush says John Kerry ``would weaken America and make the \nworld more dangerous.'' In fact, it is President Bush who has weakened \nAmerica and made the world more dangerous. Let's count the ways George \nBush's war has not made America safer.\n  No. 1, Iraq has been a constant perilous distraction from the real \nwar on terrorism. There was no persuasive link between Saddam Hussein \nand al-Qaida. We should have finished the job in Afghanistan, finished \nthe job on al-Qaida, and finished the job on Osama bin Laden.\n  No. 2, the mismanagement of the war in Iraq has created a fertile, \nnew, and very dangerous breeding ground for terrorists in Iraq and a \npowerful recruiting tool for al-Qaida that did not exist before the \nwar. We cannot go a day now without hearing of attacks in Iraq by \ninsurgents and al-Qaida terrorists, and our troops are in far greater \ndanger because of it.\n  Only this week, Ambassador Paul Bremer specifically stated that the \nBush administration erred in not deploying enough troops in Iraq and \nnot containing the violence and looting immediately after the fall of \nSaddam Hussein. About the looting, he said:\n\n       We paid a big price for not stopping it because it \n     established an atmosphere of lawlessness.\n\n  He said:\n\n       We never had enough troops on the ground.\n\n  No. 3, Saddam may be behind bars, and that is a plus for America and \nthe world, as President Bush says. But the war in Iraq has clearly \ndistracted us from putting Osama bin Laden behind bars, and that is a \nhuge minus.\n  No. 4, because of the war in Iraq, the danger of terrorist attacks \nagainst America itself has become far greater. Our preoccupation with \nIraq has given al-Qaida more than 2 full years to regroup and plan \nmurderous new assaults against us. And we know that al-Qaida will try \nto attack America again and again here at home, if it possibly can. Yet \ninstead of staying focused on the real war on terror, President Bush \nrushed headlong into an unnecessary war in Iraq.\n\n  No. 5, and most ominously, the Bush administration's focus on Iraq \nhas left us needlessly more vulnerable to an al-Qaida attack with a \nnuclear weapon. The greatest threat of all to our homeland is a nuclear \nattack. A mushroom cloud over any American city is the ultimate \nnightmare, and the risk is all too great. Osama bin Laden calls the \nacquisition of a nuclear device a ``religious duty.'' Documents \ncaptured from a key al-Qaida aide 3 years ago revealed plans even then \nto smuggle high-grade radioactive materials into the United States in \nshipping containers.\n  No. 6, the war in Iraq has provided a powerful new worldwide \nrecruiting tool for al-Qaida. We know al-Qaida is getting stronger, \nbecause its attacks in other parts of the world are increasing.\n  No. 7, because of the war, Afghanistan itself is still unstable. \nTaliban and al-Qaida elements continue to attack\n\n[[Page S10617]]\n\nour forces regularly. President Hamid Karzai is frequently forced to \nnegotiate with warlords who control private armies in the tens of \nthousands. Opium production is at a record level, and is being used to \nfinance terrorism and fund private militias. Our troops there are in \ngreater danger.\n  No. 8, we have alienated long-time friends and leaders in other \nnations we heavily depend on for intelligence, for apprehending \nterrorists, for shutting off funds to al-Qaida, and for many other \ntypes of support in the ongoing war against international terrorism. \nMistrust of America has soared throughout the world. We are especially \nhated in the Muslim world. In parts of it, the bottom has fallen out.\n  Sadly, we remember the goodwill that flowed to America in the \naftermath of September 11, and we know we should never have squandered \nit.\n  No. 9, our overall military forces are stretched to the breaking \npoint because of the war in Iraq. As the Defense Science Board recently \ntold Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       Current and projected force structure will not sustain our \n     current and projected global stabilization commitments.\n\n  LTG John Riggs said it clearly:\n\n       I have been in the Army 39 years, and I've never seen the \n     Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have today.\n\n  And as our colleague Senator McCain warned last month, if we have a \nproblem in some other flash point in the world:\n\n       It's clear, at least to most observers, that we don't have \n     sufficient personnel.\n\n  No. 10, the war in Iraq has undermined the basic rule of \ninternational law that protects captured Americans. The Geneva \nConventions are supposed to protect our forces, but the brutal \ninterrogation techniques used at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq have lowered \nthe bar for treatment of POWs and endangered our soldiers throughout \nthe world.\n  No. 11, while President Bush has been preoccupied with Iraq, not just \none but two serious nuclear threats have been rising: North Korea and \nIran. Four years ago, North Korea's plutonium program was inactive. Its \nnuclear rods were under seal. Two years ago, as the Iraq debate became \nintense, North Korea expelled the international inspectors and began \nturning its fuel rods into nuclear weapons. At the beginning of the \nBush administration, North Korea was already thought to have two such \nweapons. Now they may have eight, and the danger is greater.\n  Iran too is now on a faster track that could produce nuclear weapons. \nThe international community might be more willing to act if President \nBush had not abused the U.N. resolution on Iraq 2 years ago, when he \ntook the words ``serious consequences'' as a license for launching his \nunilateral war in Iraq.\n\n  No. 12, while we focused on the nonexistent nuclear threat from \nSaddam, we have not done enough to safeguard the vast amounts of \nunsecured nuclear materials elsewhere in the world. According to a \njoint report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative and Harvard's Managing \nthe Atom Project, ``scores of nuclear terrorist opportunities lie in \nwait in countries all around the world,'' especially at sites in the \nformer Soviet Union. How loudly does the alarm bell have to ring before \nPresident Bush wakes up?\n  No. 13, the neglect of the Bush administration on all aspects of \nhomeland security because of the war is frightening. We are pouring \nnearly $5 billion a month into Iraq, yet we are grossly shortchanging \nthe urgent needs to strengthen our ability to prevent terrorist attacks \nhere at home and to strengthen our preparedness should they occur.\n  As former Republican Senator Warren Rudman, chairman of the \nIndependent Task Force on Emergency Responders, said recently:\n\n       Homeland security is terribly under-funded, and we cannot \n     allow that to continue.\n\n  You cannot pack all these reasons why America is not safer into a 30-\nsecond television response ad or a news story or an editorial. But as \nanyone who cares about the issue can quickly learn, our President has \nutterly no credibility when he keeps telling us that America and the \nworld are safer because he went to war in Iraq and rid us of Saddam.\n  President Bush's record on Iraq is clearly costing American lives and \nendangering America and the world. Our President will not change or \neven admit how wrong he has been and still is. Despite the long line of \nmistakes and blunders and outright deception, there has been no \naccountability. As election day grows closer, the buck is circling more \nand more closely over 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Only a new President \ncan right the extraordinary wrongs of the Bush administration on our \nforeign policy and national security.\n  On November 2, when we ask ourselves the fundamental question whether \nPresident Bush has made us safer, there can be only one answer: No, he \nhas not. That is why America needs new leadership. We could have been, \nand should have been, much safer than we are today.\n  We cannot afford to stay this very dangerous course. As I have said \nbefore, the only thing America has to fear is 4 more years of George \nBush.\n  I withhold the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, the \nremainder of the time is reserved.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10617-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10617-S10620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, just over 10 months ago, we passed a \nbipartisan bill called the Medicare Modernization Act dealing more with \nthe prescription drug issue than anything else. But regardless of what \nyou want to call it, it is the most sweeping improvement in Medicare \nsince its creation. The Medicare Modernization Act delivered on a \npromise, a promise to provide beneficiaries a much needed prescription \ndrug benefit and to revitalize Medicare so beneficiaries can receive \nquality care and benefits into the future with no sunset.\n  The Medicare bill passed with the support of a bipartisan coalition \nand more than 300 organizations ranging from the AARP to the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce. Advocacy groups that did not necessarily support \nthe bill then went on to form an organization called the Access to \nBenefits Coalition. They worked after passage of the MMA to ensure that \nlow-income beneficiaries enroll in the Medicare drug card and get the \nreal assistance to which every senior is entitled.\n  Still, on the floor of the Senate, we hear partisan attacks against \nthis Medicare bill, continuing yet 10 months since it was signed into \nlaw. This is much to the consternation of organizations such as the \nAccess to Benefits Coalition, which is saying that partisanship ought \nto be set aside and we ought to concentrate on getting people into the \nbenefits that are in the program, even if you don't necessarily agree \nwith the legislation.\n  Week after week, month after month, we have heard attack after attack \nagainst this Medicare bill. This is despite the fact that study after \nstudy shows the drug card program, for example--and that is only a \nsmall part of this most comprehensive improvement in Medicare in its \n38-year history--is delivering real savings to beneficiaries.\n  As I listen to these attacks, I am reminded that it is always easier \nto tear down than to build. But if you tear something down, it seems to \nme those tearing it down ought to have something to replace it. So what \nwas their plan? I haven't heard about a plan for the future, so I have \nto look back. What were they suggesting at that time when they had an \nalternative plan? And this was when the Democratic Party controlled the \nSenate. They did have a plan to offer, but the Democratic leader \nbypassed the Finance Committee, where we developed bipartisanship, to \nbring their proposal to the floor because they didn't want a bipartisan \nprogram. They wanted their own program. They knew they couldn't get \ntheir own program. They wanted an issue for the 2002 election rather \nthan a product.\n  This alternative was drafted by Senator Graham and Senator Kennedy. \nTheir bill was S. 2625. It had 30 Democratic cosponsors, including the \nDemocratic leader. They offered two proposals as amendments on the \nSenate floor. Fifty Democrats voted in favor of the first proposal. \nForty-five Democrats supported the second, which, I might add, was \nworse than the first. The Democratic Leader as well as Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Kerry supported both of these Democratic proposals.\n\n[[Page S10618]]\n\n  In stark contrast with the bill that the President signed last \nDecember, the Democratic proposal, Graham-Kennedy, had a drug benefit \nthat was not permanent. Our legislation is permanent. That is right. \nTheir proposal would have ended at about the time baby boomers were \nbeginning to retire. What a promise: Prescription drugs, and in 2010 \nyou have nothing.\n  Chart No. 1 has the language of one section of their legislation. I \nread:\n\n       No obligations shall be incurred, no amounts shall be \n     appropriated, and no amounts expended, for expenses incurred \n     for providing coverage of covered outpatient drugs after \n     December 31, 2010.\n\n  You can't be clearer than that. Seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities deserve better than the false hopes of a drug benefit that \nexpires after 6 years. But that is exactly what the first Graham-\nKennedy amendment did. It simply rode off into the sunset after 2010, \njust at the very time that 77 million baby boomers start to retire. The \nfact that the Graham-Kennedy proposal offered a drug benefit that ended \n6 years after it started ought to be unbelievable. You would never \nthink that Senators would think of doing something like that--false \npromises, a costly program for a few years, and then it ends. But they \nsunset the benefit to hide the true cost of their proposal. At the time \nthe Congressional Budget Office said it would cost over $100 billion \neach year to extend the Graham-Kennedy drug benefit past the sunset, \n$100 billion a year, and they had no plan to pay for this enormous \ncost.\n\n  To make their drug benefit permanent, Congress would have had to cut \nall other Government programs by more than 10 percent or increase taxes \non all working Americans by an amount equal to 2 percent or greater. \nThat is the same as a tax increase of around $1,500.\n  Besides vanishing in 2010, under the first Graham-Kennedy amendment, \nthe Government could limit beneficiaries to just a single one-size-\nfits-all plan. The Secretary of Health and Human Services could have \nsimply decided that you could get your coverage through that one plan--\nperiod, no choice.\n  Even more amazing, the first Graham-Kennedy amendment proposed a drug \nbenefit that could only cover up to two brand name drugs in any \ntherapeutic category. What does that mean? It means if your doctor \nprescribed a different brand name drug and it is not on the preferred \nlist, then you don't get the plan to pay for it.\n  I will give you some examples. Let's take high cholesterol. There are \nmore than eight well-known brand drugs to lower cholesterol. The single \nGovernment plan under Graham-Kennedy could pick Lescol. Say your doctor \nprescribes Mevacor. Well, you would get no coverage at all. This \nscenario could have been repeated for arthritis, high blood pressure, \nany other chronic condition that many beneficiaries have. Does that \nsound like a plan that is incredibly fair? No. Well, that is the plan, \nand it is far more restrictive than what the private plans offer today. \nCertainly the new Medicare law has no such requirement.\n  The first Graham-Kennedy amendment also set co-payment amounts in \nlaw--$10 for generics, $40 for brand drugs. To offer a lower copayment, \nthe plan again had to ask for the Secretary's approval, a bureaucrat in \nthe seniors' medicine cabinets for sure, not something that you are \ngoing to see under the bill that the President signed last December.\n  In addition, just like thousands of drugs could have been shut out, \nGraham-Kennedy could have shut out thousands of pharmacies because it \ntold the Government to set up a preferred pharmacy network under that \none Government plan, and the Secretary had to establish the pharmacy \naccess standards. In contrast, the bill the President signed set strict \nrules about pharmacy access to make sure that plans include \nbeneficiaries' neighborhood pharmacies in their networks.\n  So under their plan, there was one choice, with one formulary and one \npharmacy network that may or may not cover the drugs beneficiaries need \nor allow them to use a pharmacy they want. Take it or leave it.\n  Under Graham-Kennedy, that outcome was the strong possibility facing \nbeneficiaries who have waited long enough for a prescription drug \nbenefit. The MMA established a good program that the President signed \nlast December.\n  When I think about the Graham-Kennedy prescription for drug coverage, \nI cannot help but think of those little warning labels that you \nsometimes find on the side of your prescription bottle. In this case, \nit should have said this: Warning. This Graham-Kennedy plan may not \nhelp you at all because if you take a non-preferred drug, it won't be \ncovered. You will only be guaranteed ``reasonable'' access to a \npharmacy, and the Government will determine what is reasonable. Worst \nof all, if you need drug coverage after December 31, 2010, there won't \nbe any plan for you or for anybody else.\n  Again, 50 Democrats, including Senator Kerry, supported this.\n  When that amendment failed, Senator Graham and Senator Kennedy came \nup with an alternative which, hard to believe, was worse. Most seniors \nwould not have even gotten a basic prescription drug benefit under the \nsecond Graham-Kennedy plan because it wasn't a universal benefit. And \nwe have a universal benefit signed by the President of the United \nStates.\n  So that's right, under the Democratic plan, the proposal did not \noffer a basic drug benefit to 70 percent of the seniors who had incomes \nabove 200 percent of the Federal poverty level at that time.\n  Seniors across the country would have been left behind. Let me show \nyou. In my State of Iowa--and I am saying this to Iowans if the plan \npassed by the President doesn't fit just right, it is voluntary, so if \nthey don't want to do it, they don't have to. But under the proposal \noffered the year before by the Democrats, 64 percent of the people in \nmy State would not have had any basic program whatsoever; 67 percent \nleft behind in Arizona; 72 percent left behind in Washington; and 70 \npercent left behind in Colorado.\n  The second Graham-Kennedy amendment violated a fundamental tenet of \nMedicare--and that is a tenet of the legislation we passed--that it be \nuniversal. They called for disqualifying any beneficiary who earned \n$1--just $1--more than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. So $1 \nwas the difference between eligibility and ineligibility for this basic \ncoverage.\n  Under the bill that the President signed, all Medicare beneficiaries \nare eligible to participate on a voluntary basis in the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  There is also a big gap in coverage. We also have been hearing from \nopponents of the bipartisan bill that passed the Congress and was \nsigned by the President, about the gap in coverage. They refer to it as \nthe donut hole.\n  Again, looking at their second attempt--we have it here. After \nlooking at this plan that was put forth, my only conclusion is that \nthis concern about a gap is newly found because most beneficiaries \nwould not have received any basic coverage under their plan. To qualify \nfor catastrophic coverage, a beneficiary would have to pay $3,300 out \nof pocket.\n  Talk about a hole. The majority of beneficiaries would not even get a \ndonut.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 66 percent of seniors \nwould not meet their catastrophic coverage threshold in 2005.\n  For a beneficiary who would meet the threshold, and based on average \nspending, it would take about 10 \\1/2\\ months--sometime around \nThanksgiving Day--to get any help under the catastrophic benefit.\n  You know that what most beneficiaries got under the second Graham-\nKennedy plan is a 5-percent discount off of their drug costs until they \nspent $3,300. And they proposed setting the 5 percent discount in law.\n\n  I might add that 5 percent is much less than discounts available \nunder the Medicare-Approved Drug Discount Card Program.\n  Study after study is showing higher discounts. A recent study by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) showed discounts of 12 \nto 21 percent, and in many instances, even more. Competition among the \ncard sponsors is leading to higher discounts for beneficiaries.\n  So much for the idea that direct Government involvement rather than \nmarket competition would get beneficiaries a better deal.\n\n[[Page S10619]]\n\n  That is not the end. On top of all this, the last version of Graham-\nKennedy did not even really offer a Medicare drug benefit because \nstates would have administered it under their Medicaid programs.\n  An analysis conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices at that time showed that many States would have had to \nshoulder a sizable new financial burden if the Graham-Kennedy plan \npassed--a $70 billion unfunded mandate.\n  Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, \nOregon, South Dakota, Washington, and West Virginia were among the \nhardest hit States.\n  At a time when States were already struggling, the second Graham-\nKennedy approach would have left them with few other avenues except \nraising taxes to implement the drug benefit.\n  So while the opponents of the new Medicare drug benefit have been \nhere on this Senate floor yelling sometimes at the top of their lungs \nabout it, this was their plan, which was supported by 45 Democrats \nincluding the Democratic leader and Senator Kerry.\n  In addition, the second Graham-Kennedy plan--as well as the first--\ndid nothing to strengthen and improve the Medicare program.\n  The Medicare bill we passed last year added new coverage choices and \nbenefits. It addressed provider payments issues to make sure that \nbeneficiaries have access to physicians and hospitals because otherwise \na prescription drug benefit--or any benefit for that matter--would be \nmeaningless.\n  So I think we can clearly see that the Graham-Kennedy proposals were \nbad medicine.\n  Mr. President, as I said, it is one thing to tear something down when \nyou have a better plan. But, as you can see, this was their plan.\n  Their first plan offered a drug benefit that was not a permanent part \nof Medicare and it had limited drug coverage, a one-size-fits-all \nbenefit--take it or leave it. Their next plan didn't give 70 percent of \nseniors even basic coverage, it had a huge gap in benefits, and a \nMedicare low income benefit that wasn't even run by Medicare.\n  To me, that was unacceptable in 2002 and it's unacceptable today. \nInstead, last year a bipartisan coalition worked to give beneficiaries \na meaningful and permanent Medicare prescription drug benefit and a \nrevitalized Medicare program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I have great affection and respect for the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, but I just listened to distortion and misrepresentations on \nthe legislation that I cosponsored with my good friend from Florida. \nThe fact is, every senior group in the United States of America \nsupported our proposal, and they cannot say the same about the \nRepublican proposal.\n  Why in the world would all the senior groups support our proposal? \nBecause we build on the solemn commitment that was made to the seniors \nin this country in 1964 and 1965. Lyndon Johnson signed the Medicare \nbill in 1965, where we guaranteed to every senior citizen good quality \nhealth care for the rest of their lives if they paid into the system \nand played by the rules. We guaranteed hospital care and care by \nphysicians, but we never did it for prescription drugs.\n  That was the commitment that was made by this Government to the \nseniors of this Nation. This was a downpayment to meet the commitment \nLyndon Johnson made and that every one of us who supported the Medicare \nProgram believes in.\n  Every day that we fail to provide a real prescription drug program to \nthe seniors is a violation of that commitment. The other side ought to \nbe telling us how we are going to finish that commitment and close the \ngap for our senior citizens, rather than fly-specking other legislation \nthat has been introduced, which did not have massive giveaways to the \nHMOs and massive giveaways to the drug companies.\n  President Bush's Medicare bill is a travesty. That is why it is not \nbeing endorsed by the senior citizens of this country.\n  It is astounding that Republicans think they can defend President \nBush's good-for-nothing Medicare bill by attacking the Graham-Miller-\nKennedy bill offered more than two years ago. Is especially astounding \nbecause that bill--which received a majority of votes in the United \nStates Senate but was blocked by the Republican minority--was so much \nbetter than the Bush bill that Republicans passed last year.\n  Let's look at the record. Our bill provided $600 billion for \nprescription drugs for senior citizens, not the $400 billion in the \nBush bill. The Bush priorities are tax cuts for the wealthy. Our \npriorities are health care for senior citizens.\n  Under our bill, every dime of the $600 billion went for prescription \ndrugs. Under the Bush bill, $139 billion is squandered on windfall \nprofits for the drug companies and $46 billion on giveaways to HMOs.\n  Under our bill, senior citizens got a real benefit, not one as full \nof holes as a Swiss cheese. Under our bill, senior citizens started \nreceiving benefits on the first prescription they fill. Under the Bush \nbill, seniors have to pay a $250 deductible before they see a dime's \nworth of benefits.\n  Under our bill, seniors citizens had complete coverage. No doughnut \nholes. No big coverage gaps where seniors must pay the full cost of the \ndrugs they need--or go without. Their bill has a huge coverage gap of \nalmost $3,000. Once a senior has purchased $2,250 worth of drugs, they \nget no benefits until they spend an additional $2,850. What kind of \ninsurance is that!\n  Under our bill, senior citizens paid a $25 a month premium for their \ncoverage--and it was guaranteed. Under the Bush bill, the average \npremium senior citizens would have to pay was estimated at $35--but if \ninsurance companies decided to charge more, it could be $40 or $50 or \n$60 or $90. There was no guarantee and no limits.\n  Under our bill, seniors were guaranteed access to any drug they \nneeded--even if it was not on the formulary. Under the Bush bill, if an \ninsurance company decides not to cover a drug the senior citizens \nneeds, the senior citizen is out of luck.\n  The bottom line is that under the Bush bill, 15 million senior \ncitizens actually will pay more for the drugs they need than they do \ntoday. Six million of the poorest of the poor on Medicaid will be \nforced to pay more out of pocket. Six million more senior citizens will \npay more in premiums than they will get in benefits. Three million \nseniors will lose the good retirement coverage they now enjoy from a \nformer employer and be forced into the inadequate government program \nthe bill creates. Under the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill, every senior \ncitizen is better off. That is one key reason why every legitimate \norganization of senior citizens endorsed the Graham-Miller-Kennedy \nbill, and why the vast majority of senior citizen organizations opposed \nthe Bush bill.\n  President Bush says in every stump speech that we have a ``moral \nobligation to honor our senior citizens.'' He is right about that, but \nit is typical Bush. Right words, wrong deeds. It is wrong to make 15 \nmillion senior citizens worse off with his good-for-nothing Medicare \nbill. It is wrong to impose the highest premium increase in Medicare's \nentire history on senior citizens. It is wrong to escalate premiums a \nwhopping 72 percent in just 2 years, so that the average senior--with \nan income of just $15,000--has to pay almost $1,000 in Medicare \npremiums. It is wrong to tolerate a situation under which, according to \nthe Bush Administration's own estimates, the average 85-year-old will \nspend more than 40 percent of her Social Security benefits on Medicare \npremiums and cost-sharing by 2006. It is wrong to give away money to \ndrug companies and HMOs that belongs to senior citizens. It is wrong to \ntry to privatize Medicare and force senior citizens to join HMOs.\n  George Bush has had 4 years to help senior citizens get the \naffordable health care Medicare promises. He has failed. Now he wants \nanother chance. He doesn't deserve it.\n  John Kerry and Democrats in Congress have a better approach. We will \nrepeal and replace the good-for-nothing Bush Medicare bill. We will \nfight for senior citizens. We will put their interests first, not the \ninterests of big drug companies and HMOs. We will honor our senior \ncitizens with deeds, not just words.\n\n[[Page S10620]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. Res. 445, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 445) to eliminate certain \n     restrictions on service of a Senator on the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McConnell/Reid/Frist/Daschle Amendment No. 3981, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the reorganization resolution is now \nthe pending business before the Senate. I want to report to our \ncolleagues an agreement that Senator Reid and I have reached--he is on \nthe floor as well to discuss the matter--as to how we are going to \nproceed.\n  Point No. 1: any amendments will need to be offered. The issue we are \ndealing with, of course, is sensitive to a number of different \ncommittees in the Senate. It is the intention of Senator Reid and \nmyself not to have a managers' package. If Members of the Senate feel \nstrongly about a particular amendment, what we recommend to them is \nthey come over to the Senate floor and offer the amendment so that \neveryone can understand fully what change in the underlying resolution \nis being proposed.\n  Senator Reid and I have said repeatedly that the underlying \nresolution is certainly not like the Ten Commandments; it should not be \nadjusted. We cobbled it together as best we could through a series of \nbipartisan discussions and compromises. Now it is the pending business \nbefore the Senate. We expect amendments. We would like amendments. We \nreceived notice last night by hotlining that there could be as many as \n50 amendments Members may wish to offer. We are open for business, and \nwe would like for Senators to come over and offer those amendments so \nwe can move forward.\n  I also remind our colleagues that Senator Frist and Senator Daschle \nand Senator Reid and myself did file a cloture motion last night, not \nto shut anyone out but because we are about to leave on Friday and so \nmany amendments were indicated as possibilities that we felt we needed \nto nudge the process forward by creating the possibility of an end time \ntomorrow.\n  Let me repeat before turning to my friend and colleague, Senator \nReid, that if Senators have an amendment, please come and offer it, \nexplain it to the rest of the Senate, lay it before the Senate, explain \nwhat it is about, and let's have votes and move the process forward as \nrapidly as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as difficult as this was for us to get to \nthe point where we are now, it is not as if the Senator from Kentucky \nand the task force just made all this stuff up. Because of 9/11, we \ncreated a Department of Homeland Security. We now have a Cabinet-level \nSecretary of Homeland Security--a former Congressman and Governor--Tom \nRidge. There is a Department of Homeland Security, I repeat, of Cabinet \nstatus, and because of legislation we passed previously, it has certain \nobligations within the executive branch of Government. So we had a \nguideline to follow because that is what Secretary Ridge has been doing \nin that Department of Homeland Security.\n  One of the guidelines we had was to try to track that with what will \nbe the organizational prerogatives of the Senate. I believe we have \ndone a pretty good job doing that. As the Senator from Kentucky \nmentioned, if people think they want to improve upon what we have done, \nwhat they need to do is offer an amendment and the body will decide \nwhether that is the right way to do it.\n  Also, the two leaders have said we are going to finish our work \nbefore we leave for the recess prior to the election. That means we are \nnot going to wait around here all day for someone who has a lunch or \nmeeting in their office or a committee hearing. If we go for a period \nof a half hour, 45 minutes here--and that is an arbitrary number I \nthrow out--and nobody shows up, we are going to move to third reading. \nWe are not going to wait around with the recess, prior to the lameduck \nsession, taking place tomorrow, supposedly. We are not going to wait \naround here all night for people to work out their schedules to come \nhere. This is their schedule, the floor of the Senate. This is the \nprimary obligation Senators have. Everyone should know--staffs \nlistening, some Senators listening--if we are waiting around here with \nnothing to do in a quorum call, Senator McConnell and I are going to \nmove to third reading, and we are going to wrap up this resolution.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me also take this opportunity to \nremind our colleagues what this is all about. The Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity and his principal assistants are being dragged around the \nCapitol continuously. Just this year, there have been 164 hearings, up \nfrom 148 last year. There are currently 88 committees or subcommittees \nin the House and Senate that have at least some part of the Homeland \nSecurity Department. Here in the Senate, which we are addressing in \nthis underlying resolution, there are 25 Senate committees or \nsubcommittees that have jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Secretary Tom Ridge called me on Monday pleading for relief. \nHis job, as important as oversight is, is not to spend all of his time \nup here.\n  What we are trying to do in the underlying resolution is to \nconsolidate in one place the jurisdiction over the Department of \nHomeland Security to simplify oversight for us and to simplify the very \nnecessary process of oversight for the Secretary and his principal \nassistants.\n  The resolution is pending. As I said, we are open for business, and \nwe hope to have amendments in the very near future.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Agricultural Disaster Assistance\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, at this moment there are several matters \npending before the Congress before we recess and/or adjourn. One of \nthem is something that is extremely critical to a lot of people in our \ncountry and that is disaster assistance. It is not only the hurricanes \nin Florida, but it is the droughts farmers and ranchers have faced \nthroughout our country, obviously especially in rural parts of America, \nand in my State, Montana, quite severely.\n  Montana has faced a drought, mostly around the southwestern part of \nour State. There are parts of Montana that are not droughted out. It is \nprecarious. Because of the almost arbitrary patterns of nature, it is \nhard to know where it is going to rain or where it is\n\n[[Page S10621]]\n\nnot going to rain, but the fact is, a lot of people are in very tough \nshape. They need disaster assistance just like the folks in Florida. \nMaybe Louisiana and Alabama need disaster assistance as well.\n  It is important for us to remember that we are here, frankly, to help \nAmericans. We are not 50 different nations. We are one country. We are \none Congress with one Senate and one House. We have one President. It \nis true that we have 50 States, but we are one country and we have one \nCongress. The Constitution provides Congress will enact legislation and \nthe executive branch will administer the legislation, but it is up to \nus to do what is right for our country, for America.\n  Sometimes an argument is made, and I even heard this argument made on \nthe floor, that hurricanes are sudden and when there is damage those \nfolks deserve assistance, but droughts are over time; therefore, they \ndon't deserve disaster assistance because it is not really a disaster. \nIt is something that is an adverse consequence that happens over time.\n  Responsible Senators are making that argument to me. Actually, I \nquestion whether they are responsible if they are making that argument. \nIt is a totally fallacious argument. It is wrong for a Senator to say, \neven if it is in private: You folks don't need agricultural disaster \nassistance because that's over time; that's not a sudden, immediate \noccurrence.\n  The problem, obviously, is that whenever there is a hurricane--and it \nis too bad, the damage it causes--our national networks focus on it \nbecause it is a sudden, at that time, at that one moment disaster, so \nthe TV cameras are there, the correspondents are there. How many times \ndid we see the shots of disaster in Florida? And well we should, \nbecause it is terrible what those people are going through. There were \nparts of Florida hit several times and we should help those people who \nneed help. There is no doubt about that.\n  But, as I said, we should help those people who need help, and there \nare some other people who need help on account of nature's disastrous \noccurrences and they are farmers and ranchers. It is true that droughts \nhave occurred every 4 or 5 or 6 years. But that does not diminish the \nargument that they need help, too. It is nature that caused the \nproblem. They didn't cause the problem. They deserve help just as \neverybody else deserves help. We are one country, one Congress, one \nSenate, and one House, and we should very quickly give that aid, not \nonly to the folks in Florida but also to the folks across our country \nwho suffered disaster because of drought.\n\n  Many times on the floor Senators have shown photographs of drought in \nthe country. It is real. I ask all Members--of course they don't have \nthe time--to get out of Washington, DC. Get out of the cities. Go \nacross America and see where the drought is. They are droughted out.\n  There are also floods which have totally destroyed crops. There are \nfloods in eastern North Dakota, for example, near the Mississippi \nRiver. Take North Dakota, it is flood at one end of the State and it is \ndrought at the other end of the State--they are both disasters. That \nis, both phenomena have destroyed the crops.\n  This is pretty simple stuff. It is very simple. It is basic. I don't \nknow why we can't get together and help folks who suffered losses \naround the country, natural losses--we are talking about natural losses \nhere--just as folks in the South, particularly Florida, suffered \nnatural losses.\n  Then there is the other argument: There is a farm bill. The farm bill \ntakes care of farmers. There is a farm bill and it is a pretty big farm \nbill.\n  Let's look at the facts. How much of that farm bill actually went to \nfarmers? A very low percentage. Most of the farm bill, I might say, \nwent to other programs--the Food Stamp Program. In fact, only about 18 \npercent of the total farm bill is dollars allocated to farmers and \nranchers, essentially support payments. Why? To fight other countries \nthat have bigger support payments for their farmers which make our \ncrops even less competitive, so we have to have a farm bill to make \nsure our farmers are competitive, too. Clearly, that is one reason for \nthe next round of the WTO talks, the Doha Round; namely, for producing \nnations to begin working together to lower some of their price \nsupports, particularly export subsidies. That is the most heinous form \nof subsidy. Get rid of those export subsidies, as the Europeans have \nagreed they will begin to do, and then we can address the problems of \nthe farmers.\n  But the main point is only 18 percent goes to farmers; the rest goes \nto other programs, mainly food stamp programs.\n  Add to that, that 18 percent is irrelevant to the phenomenon we are \ntalking about. It is irrelevant. Why is it irrelevant? It is irrelevant \nbecause that is a farm program which pays farmers essentially only when \nthey produce crops. It is a support payment program. It depends upon \nthe price of crops. But when farmers do not produce any crops because \nof a natural disaster, the farm program does not help them. It doesn't \nhelp them and that is why we have agricultural disaster assistance \nprograms. We have had several--many in the past. That is the same kind \nof program we should have right here today.\n  So I say to my colleagues who are now negotiating agricultural \ndisaster assistance, the real question is, What do we do now? The House \npassed a $3 billion agricultural disaster assistance bill. It is folded \ninto the hurricane assistance dollars. It is now over here in the \nSenate. The conferees are trying to decide whether that should be put \nin the Homeland Security appropriations, which is in conference.\n  I don't care about the process. That is irrelevant to me. I only care \nabout the result. The result should be that, while we give aid to folks \nwho suffer damage on account of the hurricanes, we should also give aid \nto our farmers and ranchers across our country who have suffered an \nequally devastating natural disaster. Let's just do it and do it now.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on S. Res. 445.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3989 to Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the underlying bill \nwhich I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the provisions relating to the jurisdiction of the \n                    Department of Homeland Security)\n\n       Strike section 101(b)(1) of the resolution and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Jurisdiction.--There shall be referred to the committee \n     all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and \n     other matters relating primarily to the following subjects:\n       (1) Department of Homeland Security, except matters \n     relating to--\n       (A) the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security \n     Administration, or the Federal Law Enforcement Training \n     Center; and\n       (B) the following functions performed by any employee of \n     the Department of Homeland Security--\n       (i) any customs revenue function including any function \n     provided for in section 415 of the Homeland Security Act of \n     2002 (Public Law 107-296);\n       (ii) any commercial function or commercial operation of the \n     Bureau of Customs and Border Protection or Bureau of \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including matters \n     relating to trade facilitation and trade regulation; or\n       (iii) any other function related to clause (i) or (ii) that \n     was exercised by the United States Customs Service on the day \n     before the effective date of the Homeland Security Act of \n     2002 (Public Law 107-296).\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I offer this technical clarifying \namendment to the underlying resolution. It\n\n[[Page S10622]]\n\ndelineates committee jurisdiction. Part of it is with respect to the \nCustoms Service, which the Finance Committee has had jurisdiction over \nfor 188 years. Now the Homeland Security agency appropriately should \nhandle all national security matters in protecting American security. \nIt is appropriate that those functions be transferred to that \ndepartment which has that jurisdiction.\n  It is also important that the Finance Committee maintain jurisdiction \nover not the national security aspects of Customs but the commerce \naspects of Customs. This amendment clarifies that distinction. It is in \nno way intended to have jurisdiction over the security aspects of \nhomeland security--only the commercial side, for which customarily the \nFinance Committee has the appropriate role.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that both Senator \nGrassley and the ranking member are supportive of the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3989 to Amendment No. 3981) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Totally False\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just when you think things have gotten \nabout as bad as they can get with the situation in Iraq and what got us \ninto Iraq, another shoe drops. This morning we open up our newspapers \nand we read that the Duelfer report came out yesterday. This is the \nperson whom the Bush administration picked to investigate Iraq's \nweapons programs. And here is what the headline reads:\n\n       U.S. ``Almost All Wrong'' on Weapons.\n\n  It is not that we were just slightly wrong, 50 percent or 60 percent \nor 40 percent--99.9 percent of everything that President Bush, Vice \nPresident Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and Colin Powell \nsaid prior to the war in Iraq and right after it was wrong. Where did \nthey come up with this stuff? Where did they come up with the sayings \nthey had on Iraq?\n  Here is Colin Powell:\n\n       There can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological \n     weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many \n     more. And he has the ability to dispense these lethal poisons \n     and diseases in ways that can cause massive death and \n     destruction.\n\n  That was in a February 5, 2003 address to the U.N. Security Council. \nWhere did he get that nonsense? Did he just pluck it out of thin air?\n  Here is Condoleezza Rice:\n\n       We have found, in Iraq, biological weapons laboratories \n     that look precisely like what Secretary Powell described in \n     his February 5th report to the United Nations.\n\n  That was from May 28, 2003. She says: We found them.\n  Where are they? Don't these people have any shame at all?\n  Here is President Bush:\n\n       Iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons and is \n     rebuilding facilities used to make more of those weapons.\n\n  Absolutely false.\n  Donald Rumsfeld, March 11, 2003:\n\n     . . . we know that he continues to hide biological or \n     chemical weapons, moving them to different locations as often \n     as every 12 to 24 hours, and placing them in residential \n     neighborhoods.\n\n  Totally false.\n  Here is President Bush before the United Nations, September 16:\n\n       Iraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missiles with \n     ranges beyond the 150 kilometers permitted by the U.N. Work \n     at testing and production facilities shows that Iraq is \n     building more long-range missiles that can inflict mass death \n     throughout the region.\n\n  President Bush, United Nations, September 16, 2002. Totally false. \nTotally false.\n  Here is Vice President Cheney:\n\n       Let's talk about the nuclear proposition for a minute . . . \n     We know he's been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire \n     nuclear weapons. And we believe he has, in fact, \n     reconstituted nuclear weapons.\n\n  Vice President Cheney, March 16, 2003--every single one of them \ntelling mistruths to the American people to get us sucked into the Iraq \nwar. Now we have--I don't know what happened yesterday--1,061 dead, \n8,000 of our young people casualties, injured for life. How many \ncountless innocent Iraqis, women, children? They didn't like Saddam \nHussein either, but they are now injured, many of them killed. \nThe country is in chaos. Iraq is a quagmire.\n\n  The rest of the world is looking at this, and we are the \nlaughingstock of the world. They are saying, what happened to you, \nAmerica? What happened to you?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I don't know if the Senator from Iowa heard today, but \nthere was an announcement that 13,000 civilian Iraqis have been killed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I didn't hear that.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I heard on public radio this morning.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thirteen thousand Iraqis have been killed?\n  Mr. REID. Civilian Iraqis.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I don't know if that is right. We would have to \nlook at that to see if that is right. Thirteen thousand Iraqi civilians \nkilled? How many women, how many children? The rest of the world is \nasking, what has happened to you, America? America used to be the moral \nleader in the world. You were the ones we looked to for guidance and \ndirection, to be honest and open, not secretive, not lying to the rest \nof the world. When we confronted Nikita Khruschev in 1962 when they put \nmissiles in Cuba, we had the photographs. We had the positive proof. \nThe world has looked upon us like that.\n  And now? Now the rest of the world is looking at the United States \nand saying: You are just lying. You lied about this. You covered it up. \nAnd look at the mess you have created now.\n  And still President Bush and Vice President Cheney, Colin Powell, \nDonald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, the whole crowd of them still \ncontinues to insist that everything they did was right. They still \ncontinue to insist that they would do the whole thing just as they did \nit.\n  In any other country in this world, if the leadership of that country \nhad done this, they would have to resign in disgrace.\n  They certainly would not be seeking reelection. I am surprised this \nPresident and Vice President and their team are asking the American \npeople to put them there again after this--1,061 Americans dead; \nseveral thousand, 8,000, severely injured for the rest of their lives. \nNow we have this report about 13,000 Iraqi civilians dead. It is a \ncountry in chaos.\n  America is isolated in the world community when, after September 11, \n2001, the world was on our side. They were with us. They wanted to help \nus go after al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and the terrorists because the \nrest of the world knew then, as they know now, they have a stake in \ngoing after terrorists. But they had no stake in going into a misguided \nwar, a war that we were taken into with falsehoods--absolute, total \nfalsehoods.\n  I would be the first to say I don't have all the answers on how we \nget out of Iraq. It is just like dropping a ceramic bowl and it breaks \nand you have to put it together again. It is very tough. But I do know \nthis: We will never solve our situation in Iraq, we will never get our \ntroops out of Iraq with the leadership we have in the White House right \nnow. This President has burned his bridges; he has poisoned the well \nwith every country in the world. People know they misled us and \ncontinued to mislead us in Iraq. I mentioned the lives. How about the \nmoney--$200 billion and counting. Well,\n\n[[Page S10623]]\n\nthey say $130 billion or $140 billion. Come on, it is going to be well \nover $200 billion, and we know that. Yet we cannot provide health care \nto our people. We cannot fund No Child Left Behind. We cannot pass a \nhighway bill to rebuild our highways because we don't have enough \nmoney.\n  No, I don't have all the answers in Iraq. I am the first to state \nthat. I know one thing: We will never be able to get out of Iraq and \nsolve that mess with the leadership that has so misled us and the world \nin the past. We need new leadership with fresh credibility to give them \na chance to go to the rest of the world and say there is someone new \nhere, and we are going to rebuild those coalitions and alliances. We \nare not going to continue to go down that road. There is one thing \nabout being consistent; there is another thing about being stubborn and \nreckless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I object. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator be yielded 5 minutes and that I be given 15 minutes after the \nSenator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from New Hampshire be recognized for 15 \nminutes in morning business after Senator Harkin gets his 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to close up anyway. We hear a lot \nabout consistency. I tell people this: Imagine you are a passenger in a \ncar. You are on a steep mountain road, and you want to get to the \nbottom of the mountain. You look over, and your driver is President \nBush. He has his hands gripped tightly on that wheel, and he is looking \nstraight down that road. You see a bend in the road up ahead and you \nsay: Mr. President, there is a bend in that road. But the President is \nhunched over that wheel, he is gripping it tightly, and he is looking \nstraight ahead and squinting those eyes, and he says: I don't care. I \nstarted out straight, and that is the way I am going.\n\n  Then he drives you over the cliff. You get to the bottom, but your \ncar is wrecked and you are either dead or severely injured.\n  Imagine yourself a passenger in a car on that same steep mountain \nroad. You look over and your driver is John Kerry. You say: Look, Mr. \nKerry, there is a bend in the road.\n  He says: I see that bend, and I know how to take it. So he takes that \nbend and another couple bends, and he gets you safely to the bottom of \nthe mountain. The car is secure and you are safe. That car represents \nour country, and you are the ``passenger''--the people of this country.\n  I am sorry, Mr. President, it is not enough to be stubborn and \nreckless. That hurts our country. That hurts our people. It is better \nto be tough and smart. It is better to know that sometimes our enemies \nare going to shift their tactics. The terrorists are not always going \nto do one thing. We better be able to respond.\n  Yet we are bogged down in one quagmire in Iraq, and that is where we \nare headed. That is dragging our country down. It is hurting our \npeople. That is stubborn. That is reckless. That is not consistent. \nThat is ignoring the fact that any military leader will tell you that \nwhen you go into battle, you have a plan.\n  But if the enemy does something different, you have to be able to \nmaneuver. George Bush cannot maneuver. He is stuck in the quicksands of \nIraq, while al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden go about their business. \nBetter to be tough and smart than to be reckless and stubborn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                              War in Iraq\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think it is worth a minute or two to \nrespond to some of the comments by the Senator from Iowa. I find them \nto be so inconsistent with the facts as they exist on the ground that \nit is difficult not to respond to them.\n  The Senator from Iowa is doing an excellent job of Monday morning \nquarterbacking. However, the information that the President made his \ndecisions on, the information that our military made decisions on was \nthe same information available to us in the Senate at the time. It was \nthe exact same information that led the Senator from Massachusetts, the \nnominee of the Democratic Party, to conclude--I will paraphrase him, \nand I think it is fairly close--that Saddam Hussein must be removed \nfrom office, and anybody who doesn't understand that, he should be \nremoved from office, is not qualified to be President of the United \nStates. He said that in a debate in New Hampshire, or in one of the \ndebates running up to the primary, during the primary process. He went \non after that to say that he had seen the information and he presumed \nthat the information was reasonably accurate as to the threat Saddam \nHussein presented.\n  Not only did the Senator from Massachusetts say that, but, of course, \nPresident Clinton's administration said exactly that relative to the \nweapons of mass destruction and relative to the threat of Saddam \nHussein. In fact, not only did the Senator from Massachusetts say that, \nnot only did the prior President, President Clinton, say that, but the \nUnited Nations, in 17 different resolutions, said exactly that to the \npeople of Iraq. As part of the world community, they told Saddam \nHussein to disarm, open up his nation, stop killing his people. But he, \nof course, did not.\n  I now find it extraordinarily ironic, extremely inconsistent, and \nreflective, in my opinion, of poor judgment that we have a nominee for \nthe national party whose positions are being parroted by the Senator \nfrom Iowa, who is essentially saying that a policy of appeasement and \ndefeat toward Iraq is the appropriate policy for us to pursue.\n  They have a nominee for their national party who has said he would \nrather have Saddam Hussein than the chaos that is there. That is in \ndirect contradiction to what he said before, which was that Saddam \nHussein represented a threat that should be removed, and anybody who \ndidn't understand that should not be elected President.\n  Of course, he has said such things as the war in Iraq is ``the wrong \nwar, at the wrong place, at the wrong time.'' And we have ``taken our \neye off of the ball.'' The problem with that philosophy, which he \nessentially says as a Monday morning quarterback that he is going to \nchange positions from the original position relative to the war in \nIraq, is that it not only undermines his credibility as a potential \nleader of this Nation, it undermines his ability to be able to \ncommunicate effectively with the other world leaders who are relying on \nour leadership.\n  One thing we have found over time is that both troops in the field \nand world leaders like to know that the United States stands for \nsomething and that we do not change with the political winds or whoever \nour opponent happens to be as of that day.\n  When you have a Presidential nominee of a national party, in the \nsense of the Senator from Massachusetts, who is essentially adjusting \nhis message as the polling data comes in and adjusting his message as \nhe confronts different opponents, whether it is Howard Dean in the \nprimary when he becomes much more passive or, as he moves through the \nprimary process, he becomes much more aggressive and then becomes much \nmore passive again as the numbers come in, it is very hard to look to \nthat person for the leadership you need if you are going to lead the \nworld community. This President has done an aggressive job leading the \nworld community.\n  I think it is ironic that so many Members on the other side of the \naisle so easily disregard the commitment and basically disrespect the \ncommitment some of our allies have made, especially Britain which has \ncommitted thousands of troops and lost many people in this war on \nterrorism, both in Iraq and around the world, or Australia or Poland or \nItaly. These are countries which have stood by us.\n  Granted, France is not there. France is not in Iraq. France is, \nhowever, in Afghanistan. France is working with us relative to Iran. \nFrance has chosen not to pursue the course we have pursued in Iraq, but \nI do not think we can let our national policy, our national defense, or \nour national security be determined by where France is and how\n\n[[Page S10624]]\n\nFrance stands on issues. We, obviously, encouraged them to join us, but \nthey decided not to. When it comes to our national security, I do not \nthink we can have our policy decided by the French.\n  The reason why Iraq is so critical has to be restated. We have a \ntactical war we have been pursuing which is essentially this: The \nPresident, with an incredible amount of energy and expertise of the \nmilitary and the intelligence community, has chased the terrorists \naround the globe, has kicked over the rocks under which they live and \nhas tried to bring them to justice. That is called a tactical strategy, \nand that, unfortunately, is going to go on for a lot of years. We are \ngoing to have to continue to hunt these people down.\n  On the fact which reflects the inconsistency of the position of the \nSenator from Iowa--and there has been considerable success in this area \neven though the Senator from Iowa may not be willing to acknowledge \nit--over 75 percent of the leadership of al-Qaida has been captured or \nkilled, Afghanistan is free, there is no longer a Taliban government \nthere, and they will hold elections this weekend with 10 million \nregistered to vote, 40 percent of whom are women. Those women were not \neven allowed out of their house prior to action there. That is \nsignificant progress. But that is a tactical effort, chasing the \nterrorists around the globe.\n  We are not going to succeed in this war unless we convince the \nIslamic world that Western values are not a threat to the Islamic \nvalues, unless we can prove to the Islamic community at large, \nespecially in the Middle East, that being free, that having liberty, \nthat having the right to vote, that having a market economy, that \ngiving the women a right to participate in society is not a negative \nbut is rather a positive. If we are successful in setting up a nation \nin Iraq which has liberty, which has individual rights, which has the \nrule of law, which has a form of democracy, which gives women the right \nto participate in society at a fairly high level of equality with men, \nwe will have fundamentally undermined the capacity of Islamic \nfundamentalism to recruit throughout the world because we will prove to \nthe mainstream Islamic community in this world that Western values, \nrather than being a threat, is a plus.\n\n  I hope that rather than being sunshine supporters of our efforts in \nthat part of the world, we would recognize that we are involved in what \nis a major strategic effort to try to win the war on terrorism. We are \nnot in Iraq to benefit the Iraqis. We are in Iraq to keep America \nsafer, and the way we keep America safer is by having Iraq turned into \na successful free nation where people have liberty, people have \nfreedom, women have rights, and there is a democracy where people can \nvote.\n  They are going to hold elections in January. As Prime Minister Allawi \nsaid when he was here, Iraq has become the cutting edge in the area of \nthe fight on terrorism. It is hope which is confronting the fear of the \nterrorists. We should be supporting people such as Prime Minister \nAllawi trying to protect their nation.\n  It is noted that 13,000 Iraqis have died in Iraq. That is a huge \nnumber of people, and it is a sad commentary, but those individuals \nhave died in a process to try to obtain freedom for their nation, in \nmany instances. Certainly, that number compares rather dramatically \nwith the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who were murdered under the \nSaddam Hussein regime.\n  Our goal, of course, is to create an Iraq where death is the \nexception rather than the rule, where the rule of law is the rule, and \nwhere liberty exists and where, as a result, the freedoms that \nencourage people to flourish are allowed to flourish themselves. We \nwill have, in that way, undermined the role of the terrorists, and the \nhope that Mr. Allawi is seeking will be realized. The accomplishment \nwill significantly improve our safety and lead directly to America \nbeing safer.\n  That is a quick response to the very long statement of the Senator \nfrom Iowa. I thought some comment should be made.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                       FSC/ETI Conference Report\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the recent conference \nwhich was completed on the FSC bill, which is the foreign tax bill, \nwhich is a fairly complicated piece of legislation, a major piece of \nlegislation. Certainly, I congratulate the adeptness of the people who \nled that bill through both the House and the Senate, because passing a \nbill through the House and Senate of that size is a challenge, to say \nthe least, and the success of their getting it through is very \nimpressive, especially in light of the fact that so much of the bill \nthat passed the Senate did not appear in the final product as it came \nout of the House, and vice versa.\n  The bill was modified significantly. The reason I did not sign the \nconference report--and I thought I should come to the floor to explain \nthis--is that I do not find the bill compelling on balance. Yes, the \nbill does something that has to be done, which is to correct the \nproblems the WTO has assessed against us relative to the duty that the \nEuropean Union assessed against us relative to the duties and our tax \nlaw and the fact that many of our manufacturers are now being assessed \na fairly significant duty as a result of penalties assessed under that \nfinding. That needed to be corrected.\n  That, however, was a $50 billion exercise. It could have been done in \na revenue-neutral way, and it should have been done. But the bill ended \nup being about a $140 billion bill, of which the majority, the balance \nof the tax reductions in this bill are targeted toward interest groups \nand initiatives which are at the margin, to say the least, relative to \nneed and are significantly, in my opinion, questionable. I will just \npoint to one, and that is the manner in which the ethanol subsidy is \nproposed in this bill.\n  Remember, ethanol is alleged to be a renewable fuel which will give \nus some sort of energy independence, but most of the studies have \nconcluded--at least a major study in this area has concluded--that you \nactually use as much energy to produce ethanol as you use ethanol and, \ntherefore, it really is a wash relative to whether it is a true \nrenewable that gives us some sort of energy independence. Maybe down \nthe road it can be produced more efficiently, but certainly right now \nit cannot be produced that way.\n  It also has huge environmental impacts. In fact, ironically, the \nrecent study by the Oceans Commission, set up by this Congress, \nconcluded that the most significant pollutant in the oceans today is \nthe nitrates runoff from the Midwest which is creating a huge dead zone \nin the Gulf of Mexico, and that is having a major impact on pollution \nin the oceans. That is a function of agricultural practices which are \nbasically encouraged, in many ways, by this ethanol subsidy.\n  The way this ethanol subsidy is handled in this bill is a masterful \npiece of legislative activity. I do admit to that. It is masterful in \nthat basically they take the ethanol subsidy, and today we pay 13 cents \ntax on ethanol, 18 cents on a gallon of gas, and they raise the tax to \n18 cents for everything.\n  All ethanol products now are paying the full gasoline tax, so there \nis a 5 cent per gallon revenue increase to the Federal Government, \ntheoretically--theoretically because it is purely theoretical but \nbeautifully done.\n  They take that 5 cents which was going into the general fund and they \nmove it over to the highway fund where it is absolutely required to be \nspent because the highway fund spends under a formula. That 5 cents is \nactually spent on roads, and I guess one can argue that that is good \npolicy.\n  Then in a movement of undeniable brilliance when it comes to raiding \nthe American coffers of the taxpayers, they take the 5 cents and they \nrefund it to the ethanol producers through a tax credit. So having \nraised the tax, they guarantee it will be spent and then they guarantee \nthat on top of spending it they will actually refund it to the \nproducers.\n  Who are the producers? Well, in this instance one company produces \none-third of the ethanol in this country and so they are going to get \nabout a $2 billion windfall out of this proposal.\n  That may be good policy if one is from the Midwest, but it is not \ngood policy from the standpoint of producing a renewable because as a \npractical matter ethanol is not defensible as a renewable right now \nbecause it costs as much in energy costs to\n\n[[Page S10625]]\n\nproduce it as it does to use it. Its production costs equal its value. \nIt is creating significant pollution concerns. As a result of this \nbill, we have created a huge new subsidy for the producers which was \nnot there before.\n  I have more to say on this topic. I appreciate the courtesy of the \nSenate in allowing me this time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the McConnell \nsubstitute No. 3981.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3994\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the substitute \nto the desk for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss], for himself and \n     Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 3994.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland \n                   Security and Governmental Affairs)\n\n       At the end of section 101(b)(1) insert the following:\n       ``except matters relating to the U.S Citizenship and \n     Immigration Service and the immigration functions of the U.S. \n     Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement, and the Directorate of Border and \n     Transportation Security.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, under the current resolution that is \nbeing considered, the Commerce Committee retains Coast Guard \njurisdiction and Transportation Security Administration jurisdiction \nand the Finance Committee retains the revenue side of the Customs \nDepartment jurisdiction. This amendment simply allows the Judiciary \nCommittee to receive parity with the other committees that are giving \nup part of their jurisdiction to the new Homeland Security committee.\n  I will tell my colleagues specifically what this amendment does. It \nretains the Immigration and Naturalization functions at the Judiciary \nCommittee, which are in line with Senate rule No. XXV. Specifically, it \nincludes three agencies: Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as Customs and Border \nProtection. In addition, Judiciary would retain the immigration \nfunctions at the border and transportation security directorate.\n  These functions include the U.S. visit entry/exit program and the \nVisa Waiver Program. The amendment preserves the language that \ncurrently rests in S. Res. 445 that maintains certain customs in the \nFinance Committee.\n  What does the new Governmental Affairs and Homeland Security \nCommittee get as a transferee from the Judiciary Committee under this \namendment?\n  First, it receives the information, analysis, and infrastructure \nprotection directorate. It receives the emergency preparedness and \nresponse directorate, including FEMA; third, the science and technology \ndirectorate; fourth, State and local coordination function; and five, \njurisdiction over Secret Service.\n  In addition, the following agencies would go to the new committee: \nThe Office of Domestic Preparedness under BTS from Judiciary and also \nwould receive domestic emergency support teams under EPR from \nJudiciary.\n  This is a balanced approach. This amendment maintains parity with the \nCommerce Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Judiciary Committee \nrelative to the particular jurisdiction we will maintain.\n  As the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee on the Judiciary \nCommittee, daily we deal with various matters involving immigration. \nSome of that has had to do with terrorist issues. Those issues should \nrightly go to the new Department of Homeland Security, but the bulk of \nissues we deal with relative to immigration are dealt with at the State \nDepartment, not currently with the Department of Homeland Security.\n  There will be overlap on every issue that every Federal agency deals \nwith relative to terrorism and homeland security. We cannot cover every \nsingle issue and move it to this one particular committee to have sole \njurisdiction over it just because it may deal with homeland security; \nwe can not move every single subcommittee and all jurisdiction over \nevery issue to the newly created committee.\n  What this amendment does is retain in the Judiciary Committee the \nbasic core immigration issues that are judiciary related, not terrorism \nrelated.\n  The Judiciary Committee is made up of individuals who have a legal \nbackground, and for the most part there are legal issues involved in \nthe immigration issues we are proposing be retained within the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I stepped off the floor briefly. Through the \nChair to the distinguished Senator from Georgia, I ask: Is this \namendment offered on behalf of the Senator from Georgia and Senator \nKennedy?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I should have mentioned that. Senator Kennedy and I \noffered this amendment together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are hoping to get a vote on this \namendment in the near future. Is Senator Bayh going to offer an \namendment as well?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is there anyone else in the Chamber to speak on the \nChambliss-Kennedy amendment? If not, it might be a good idea to lay \nthat aside and let Senator Bayh offer his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to the manager of the bill, I think \nthat is totally appropriate. He has something to do in a half hour or \nso, so it would be good to have his amendment taken care of at this \ntime.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily lay aside \nthe Chambliss amendment to give Senator Bayh an opportunity to send his \namendment forward.\n  I repeat that we are looking for a time agreement to vote on the \nChambliss-Kennedy amendment, we hope in the next 30 to 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment is set aside.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3995\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh], for himself, Mr. \n     Roberts, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, and Ms. Snowe \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3995.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To eliminate sequential referral)\n\n       Section 201 is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       (i) Referral.--Section 3 of S. Res. 400 is amended by--\n       (1) striking subsection (b); and\n       (2) redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections \n     (b) and (c), respectively.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I begin my remarks by praising both Senators \nReid and McConnell for the important work they have done on this \nunderlying amendment. They have accomplished some very good things that \nwill strengthen the intelligence system in this country and, in so \ndoing, strengthen our Nation's security.\n  I have had the honor of serving on the Intelligence Committee for the \nlast 3 or 4 years. During that time, I have developed some grave \nconcerns about the strength of that committee and our ability to exert \nthe kind of oversight and leadership in the area of strengthening the \nNation's intelligence that these difficult times demand.\n  Senators Reid and McConnell have addressed some of those concerns \nvery directly. Tenure on the panel is made permanent, which will allow \nthose of us who serve there to develop the kind of expertise needed for \nthe very intricate, sophisticated decisions that need to be made.\n  It will also enable us to exert the kind of oversight necessary to \nmake\n\n[[Page S10626]]\n\nsure the executive branch carries out its functions in the way they \nneed to be carried out.\n  They also provide resources to the committee to discharge our duties. \nCurrently, the resources are not available and I am afraid that too \noften the Intelligence Committee gives the appearance of exerting \noversight without effective oversight in fact. These things, and many \nothers, are significant steps forward in addressing the concerns about \nwhat changes we need to make to have meaningful intelligence oversight \nand leadership in the intelligence area by the Congress.\n\n  I would also like to praise my colleague from Virginia, Senator \nWarner. There is not a Member for whom I have more esteem and regard \nthan the Senator from Virginia. It has been my privilege over the last \nyear and a half to serve with him on the Armed Services Committee. In \nthat capacity I have learned firsthand that there is no Member of this \nbody who has a greater devotion to the national well-being and our \nNation's security than the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia.\n  With that by way of background, I would like to extend my remarks in \nthe following way. I know the Senators who worked on this issue have \nworked hard. In some respects, Senators Reid and McConnell have been \ngiven by our leaders almost an impossible task. They are asking them to \nreorganize this Congress in ways that touch upon the prerogatives and \ninstitutional interests of the Members. This is a very sensitive topic \nwhich often has failed to achieve results in the past. I salute them \nfor their efforts.\n  It is said by some that this is the best we can do, and perhaps that \nis so. But I believe there are some ways in which we can do better, and \nwe will not know if we can do better until we try. If we are unable to \ndo better, it is not the fault of Senators Reid and McConnell but \ninstead resides with the rest of us who have the privilege of serving \nin this institution.\n  It is also occasionally said that we should not make the perfect the \nenemy of the good, and that is absolutely true. That is an aphorism I \nhave subscribed to on many occasions. This needs to be a practical \nprocess, focused upon results. It is what distinguishes us from \npolitical scientists, editorial writers, and pundits. We have to get \nthings done.\n  But during these critical times, it is my heartfelt belief that we \nshould push the envelope on what is possible and insist that we do \neverything we possibly can to strengthen this country and, along with \nit, Congress, and our ability to exert oversight and leadership in the \narea of intelligence. We should not settle for 75 percent or even 90 \npercent without an effort to do everything humanly possible to \nsafeguard this country. Lives hang in the balance. That is why I am \noffering the amendment I offer today.\n  My amendment reflects the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. \nToday, former Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton issued a statement \nsupporting our efforts. I spoke with Congressman Hamilton yesterday, \nand he characterized our amendment as ``much better, much better, a \ndefinite step in the right direction.''\n  Our amendment represents the sensible center. I know there may be \nother amendments that touch upon the topic of consolidating \nappropriations and authorizations in a single committee. Our amendment \ndoes not touch upon that sensitive topic. Instead, it gives full \nmeaning to what Senators Reid and McConnell are attempting to do in \ntheir amendment, and that is to elevate the Intelligence Committee and \nthe function it discharges to the priority it deserves and to create a \nprocess and structure to match that priority.\n  Their proposal makes the Intelligence Committee what is called an A \ncommittee. It is important that we give that full meaning and no longer \nrequire that committee to defer to others through what is called ``on-\ndemand sequential referral.'' To the viewers at home, on C-SPAN, this \nsounds like Washington-speak, and essentially it is. What it \nessentially means is the Intelligence Committee must seek the approval \nof other committees for its other recommendations, unlike the other A \ncommittees that exist in this body. If we stick with this proposal, it \nwill mean that the Intelligence Committee and the function it \ndischarges will have less authority than the Agriculture Committee, \nless authority than the Banking Committee, less authority than the \nCommerce Committee, the Energy Committee, the Environmental Committee, \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, and the Judiciary Committee. Certainly these \ncritical times require that the Intelligence Committee and the \nimportant national security function that it discharges be placed on a \npar with these other committees and that it be given a structure and \nauthority to match.\n\n  As a practical matter, the current structure means that the \nappropriations process takes precedence over the authorization of \nintelligence. As a practical matter, too often it means that the \nintelligence authorization function itself is subservient to other \nauthorizing committees. This is not the structure these times demand. \nThis is what my amendment addresses.\n  Finally, this is an important moment for this institution and for \neach of us as individuals. This is a great institution, and I, among \nall our Members, have special reason to cherish its prerogatives and \nits rich tradition, having grown up in the shadow of the Senate.\n  Everyone who serves in this body is a patriot. Everyone is devoted to \nthe national security interests of this country. All of us seek to do \nnot what is easy but what is right. Yet it is too often the case that \nwe are afflicted by tunnel vision. Too often we get caught up in \ninstitutional concerns and prerogatives without stepping back to take \nthe broader view of what is important for the country as a whole. That \nis what we are attempting to address in this debate today. It requires \na sacrifice from us all. That is what this amendment would accomplish--\ngiving up a small amount of our individual power and prerogatives in \nthe greater national interest. It is what the times demand. It is what \nthis amendment would accomplish. It is why I speak strongly in favor of \nits consideration.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I wish all of my colleagues could have \nbeen on the floor to hear the remarks from the distinguished Senator \nfrom Indiana, who is a very valued member of the Intelligence \nCommittee. We have some very good members on both sides of the aisle.\n  Senator Bayh always asks incisive questions. He gets to the bottom of \nthe very comprehensive and complex issues we discuss. I thank him for \nbeing a valued member of the Intelligence Committee. I want to thank \nhim for offering this amendment, which, outside the beltway and I \nsuppose on the floor of the Senate and for anybody listening or \nwatching, is pretty mundane, or arcane: What on Earth is he talking \nabout, ``on-demand sequential referral of legislation, reporting from \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence''? Were it not for the fact \nthat Senator Bayh is an excellent speaker and a highly appreciated \nMember of this body, probably nobody would be even understanding this, \nor paying any attention.\n  I know this Senate wants to get this bill done. I know we want to go \nto conference on intelligence reform. I know we have the tax bill. I \nknow we have the omnibus bill. I know people want to leave for the \nweekend. People are tired, and Lord knows we have been wrestling with \nthis issue on how we reorganize the Intelligence Committee to make it \nmore effective, in line with what the 9/11 Commission has recommended, \nwhat every commission has recommended down the years--the Bremer \nCommission, the Gilmore Commission, the Hart-Rudman Commission, the CIS \nStudy, all these commissions, not to mention the 24 times we have tried \nreform of the Intelligence Committee since Dwight David Eisenhower and \nfailed in each and every case. I know the fatigue factor, the high-\nglaze factor has set in in this body, as evidenced by the membership, \nas evidenced by my dear colleagues and friends across the aisle now \ntalking about something else, even though I could probably talk as loud \nas the Senator from Massachusetts. But, having said that, let me try to \ntell Members what this is about.\n  His amendment would eliminate the current practice, again, of on-\ndemand\n\n[[Page S10627]]\n\nsequential referral of legislation reported from the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. This very common sense measure--Mr. \nPresident, may I have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I know in normal times this amount of noise is about the \nbest you can get, but I hope people will pay attention to what Senator \nBayh is trying to accomplish and, as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, which I support very strongly. It is a commonsense measure.\n  Speaking of the Intelligence Committee, the very committee that the \n9/11 Commission said should be enabled to do a better job instead of \nthe way it is now when we are so fractionalized, it says we should be \non the same level playing field as other standing committees in the \nSenate--just fair play, same level playing field in terms of sequential \nreferral. A committee brings up a subject, they pass a bill, they make \nan inquiry, they publish it, and another committee says: You know, we \nare interested in that as well. We would like to have sequential \nreferral.\n  How do you do that? You do it by unanimous consent or you go to the \nleaders and you say: You know, we have a dog in this fight. We are \ninterested in it. We have expertise, we have background, and we would \nlike to take a look at it as well.\n  Not on the Intelligence Committee. Virtually every other committee in \nthe Congress now has on-demand--that means you finish a product, you \nfinish your authorizing bill, and we will grab it by the throat and we \nwill do whatever we want to with it.\n  That is not right. That is not right with regard to what we are \ntrying to do to empower--and by empower I don't mean to empower over \nand above other important committees--or enable us to do our job.\n  Let me give you the classic example. We don't have, despite all of \nthe rhetoric, all of the activity, all of the effort by Senator Collins \nand by Senator Lieberman and the intelligence reform bill, all of the \neffort by the Joint Inquiry Task Force on 9/11, all of the effort by \nthe Intelligence Committee in regard to the WMD report--now the report \nby Mr. Duelfer and the Iraq Survey Group, and the group of intelligence \nnot only of the United States globally and the importance that that has \nfor the daily lives and pocketbooks not only of people in America but \naround the world, and all of this discussion about 9/11, we do not have \nthe intelligence authorization bill passed.\n  We had a vote yesterday 90 to 7 on my amendment--probably the first \ntime I will ever do that--saying regardless of what happens in \nintelligence we ought to authorize first and then appropriate. There is \na novel thought. But even at this late date, we don't have the \nintelligence authorization act passed. Why? It is because of this on-\ndemand referral that no other committee has as a millstone around its \nneck.\n  Senator Bayh is one of the committee's most serious, capable members, \nand he and I agree. We worried about this, along with other members on \nthe Intelligence Committee, mostly made up of senior Members who know \ntheir job and who have attended. Their attendance record is \noutstanding. I can't get into that because it takes a decision by the \nchairman and vice chairman, and also perhaps a vote in committee to get \ninto attendance records. I am not going to do that, simply to say these \npeople have many other duties. They come there and work hard. We have \nhad over 125 hearings in the Intelligence Committee, 60 percent more \nthan at any other time in history, with regard to the WMD report, 521 \npages long, which I think is the most thorough study any committee has \never done on the intelligence community.\n  Senator Bayh's presence on this floor on the issue underlines its \nimportance. It is bipartisan in nature and impacts on the committee's \nability to do its work.\n  What will the amendment of Senator Bayh do if it passes? It will mean \nthat for the first time in history the legislative priorities of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee will reach the Senate floor without being \nautomatically filtered through the lens of other Senate committees. I \nmust admit that under resolution 400 we have the ability in the \nIntelligence Committee--if anybody mentions intelligence, there might \nbe another committee which can ask for referral. We don't normally do \nthat. I don't think we have to do that. As a matter of fact, I am \ntrying to think of when we did that in the history of the committee. \nBut certainly that is a lot different than on-demand sequential \nreferral by every other committee.\n  Interested committees under the Bayh amendment will still be able to \nrequest sequential referral to the Intelligence Committee legislation. \nBut just as other authorizing legislation, those committees would have \nto do so through a unanimous consent agreement instead of a demand \nletter.\n  All we want is to be treated as any other committee. My goodness. If \nwe are the ones who are supposed to be empowered and stand up according \nto the 9/11 Commission and do a better job--and I think we have in the \nlast few years--why on Earth would you force the Intelligence Committee \nto go through this on-demand sequential referral?\n\n  An example of the problems associated with on-demand sequential \nreferral of intelligence--I don't know what to call this. On-demand \nspecial referral sounds like a lot of gobbledygook outside the beltway, \nan arcane thing. It is sort of like cattle rustling; you sort of take \nthat bill and rustle it away from that pasture on demand and the poor \nowner of that cowherd can't do a doggone thing about it. It is time to \nend it.\n  At any rate, an example of problems associated with on-demand \nsequential referral, or the cattle rustling of Intelligence Committee \nlegislation to the Armed Services Committee, is the fate of \nintelligence reforms proposed by former Intelligence Committee Chairman \nSenator Specter, who was on the floor a while back, and Vice Chairman \nBob Kerrey, who did a splendid job as vice chairman--that was back in \n1997 during the Intelligence authorization bill, the Intelligence \nCommittee proposal, what we have debated here for the last 2 weeks--\nthis was back in 1997--direct appropriations of intelligence community \nfunding by the Director of Central Intelligence is something which \nGeorge Tenet and every other DCI has wanted for a long time. That \nappropriations would have funded the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nNational Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office--what was \nthen called the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. The Armed Services \nCommittee obtained sequential referral of the 1997 intelligence \nauthorization bill. After 30 days of the Armed Services Committee being \ninnovative and forward looking, the Specter-Kerrey reform measure \nbecame a computer system to track intelligence expenditures. It didn't \nhave any authority. It became a computer center to track intelligence \nexpenditures.\n  On-demand sequential referral has had a chilling effect on the \nintroduction of legislative initiatives by the Intelligence Committee.\n  I see the distinguished former chairman, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, who had a reform measure back in 1997 which would \nhave gone a long way toward intelligence reform that we have been \nconsidering on this floor for the last 3 days. I thank him for that \neffort. But he got sidetracked. His cattle got--well, they were sort of \nbranded, sort of got into another pasture. I think that is unfortunate.\n  A degree of self-policing occurs about what legislative provisions \nrealistically can survive automatic referral through other committees. \nAs a result, many provisions are dropped or diluted to make the bill as \nunobjectionable as possible.\n  Senator Collins of Maine said we had a delicate balance. We had a \ndiscussion yesterday of the national intelligence director. The thought \nwas that director should be able to move positions, but then we had a \ncompromise. We could move positions and we couldn't move people. What \nthe heck is that? I know that in compromise when you refer to other \ncommittees, you make it less objectionable, but sometimes you leave the \ncutting edge of reform with a very dull knife. This deterrent effect, I \nwill tell you as chairman of the committee, begins prior to the \ncommittee markup. I know whatever we do in terms of authorization must \ngo over to the distinguished chairman\n\n[[Page S10628]]\n\nof the Armed Services Committee. I serve on that committee. I have the \nutmost respect for the chairman of that committee. It is a privilege to \nserve on that committee. I am chairman of something called Emerging \nThreat and Capabilities. I have enjoyed my service on the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  But we know even before markup that we are going to have to go to the \nArmed Services Committee, and we could on demand referral have the same \nthing happen on Foreign Relations, on Appropriations, on Armed \nServices, and Judiciary because those are the members who now serve on \nthe committee to make sure there are two people on that committee so it \nis widely represented.\n  But I know, and everybody on the committee knows, that before we even \ndo the authorization, we have to go through this Byzantine kind of \nmachination before we get our product on the floor even to pass it.\n  Again, where is the intelligence authorization bill for this year? I \ndon't know. We have tried to hotline it. We have had objections.\n\n  After all this year of reform we cannot even pass an intelligence \nauthorization bill? Do we want to continue that? This deterrent effect, \nas I said, begins right at the start. We have 22 professional staffers \nwho have backgrounds, analysts with the DIA, CIA throughout the \nintelligence community. They are the people who put together the 521-\npage report on the WMD. We let the chips fall where they may.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I worked together, both sides, and we had a \nbipartisan vote, 17 to 0. It was tough. Can we do the job? You darn bet \nyou, and we have 22 staffers who can do that job.\n  I daresay none of the other committees that have on-demand sequential \nreferral have this kind of staff. Yet we end up on the cutting-room \nfloor. Sometimes we do not even get in the room where we end up on the \ncutting-room floor. I don't think that is right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could the Senator suspend for one moment?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be delighted. Maybe my blood pressure would come \ndown. I would be delighted to suspend on behalf of the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky, as a fan of the Louisville Cardinals.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have a number of speakers in the Chamber now, and I \nwant to try to get consent to establish some order.\n  How much more time does the Senator from Kansas wish?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I haven't quite figured it out yet. I got wound up \npretty good.\n  I have one more page, and the Senator from Pennsylvania asked how \nlong will that take? How about 2 minutes, 3 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Kansas be \npermitted an additional 3 minutes, to be followed by the Senator from \nVirginia for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. May I inquire of the distinguished Senator, are we \ngetting time limits now? I wanted to have a good colloquy with my dear \nfriend and esteemed chairman of the Armed Services Committee who has a \nwilling offer to make because I am not quite sure in regard to this \nissue what it will be, and if we put in an artificial time limit--I \ndon't know.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is no time limit on any agreement, but we are \nseeking a time agreement on the Chambliss amendment. And Senator Cornyn \nwould like to speak on that amendment, as well as Senator Specter and \nSenator Kennedy.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Levin also wishes to speak on the amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I make a suggestion to the distinguished leader? \nQuietly, in the rooms off the Chamber, I think a resolution of this \nmatter is about to be achieved. So, therefore, the purpose of my \namendment would be to frame for colleagues the issue as I see it, which \nI think can be explained very simply and calmly.\n  Then perhaps a few comments, and this amendment, I understand, will \nbe laid aside, and we can proceed to the Chambliss amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am trying to accommodate the Senator on the other \namendment, the Chambliss amendment. He must leave town around 1 \no'clock. We were hoping to get a vote on that amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am a cosponsor of the Chambliss amendment, so I would \nappreciate it if I could have maybe 6 or 7 minutes prior to the time we \nvote. I, too, want to cooperate with the managers, and particularly the \nchairman, to make sure he is able to work his program.\n  If the leader could ensure that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I make this suggestion: I ask unanimous consent \nSenator Roberts complete his remarks. He has asked for an additional 3 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent we then return to the Chambliss \namendment, and in order, have Senator Kennedy for 6 minutes, Senator \nCornyn for 6 minutes, Senator Specter for?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may, I follow Senator Roberts for just 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am asking consent to accommodate a Member of the \nSenate who must leave in the not too distant future, to return to the \nChambliss-Kennedy amendment, have the discussion on that because that \nis the amendment we are hoping to get a vote on in the not too distant \nfuture.\n  Since discussions are underway on the Bayh amendment, it would be my \nhope those involved in that will continue their discussions off the \nfloor, and we will resume that discussion on the floor after that.\n  Let me ask unanimous consent that at the end of Senator Roberts's \nremarks, we take up the Chambliss, resume consideration of the \nChambliss-Kennedy amendment, and Senator Kennedy be recognized for 6 \nminutes, Senator Cornyn be recognized for 6 minutes, and Senator \nSpecter?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I won't be here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Anyone else on the Chambliss?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak on the Chambliss-Kennedy \namendment. So far as we were eviscerating the Judiciary Committee, I \nthought possibly I might say a word or two.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time? There is no time agreement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would like to have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And 10 minutes for the chairman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the conclusion I would like 3 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And 3 minutes for Senator Specter.\n  Mr. REID. If I could, reserving the right to object, is everyone \nspeaking on the Chambliss-Kennedy amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. No.\n  Mr. REID. It has nothing to do with the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My consent agreement was related to the Chambliss-\nKennedy amendment, and the time for the Senators was related to \ndiscussion of that amendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. To which we would return when Senator Roberts \ncompletes its discussion on the Bayh amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I assure the Senator from Kentucky I wish to speak on the \nChambliss-Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, could I ask the distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee whether his 12 minutes will defer to the \nBayh amendment or the Chambliss-Kennedy amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I was here early this morning with Senator Bayh, so that \nis the purpose of my presence, solely for that amendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It is probable that the chairman of the Select Committee \non Intelligence, from time to time recognized by the Armed Services \nCommittee, would like to at least have something to say about what the \ndistinguished chairman will say about the Bayh amendment.\n  I am not trying to set the record straight because that is not in the \nrealm of possibility of the distinguished chairman, but I don't know \nhow to accomplish that now if we go to the other--I guess we will have \ntime.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I might suggest to the Senator from Kansas, there is \nno time agreement on the Bayh amendment, and the unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S10629]]\n\nagreement I just propounded was entirely related to the Chambliss-\nKennedy amendment which we would like to resume consideration of. I am \nsure the Senator from Kansas will have more to say about the Bayh \namendment later. There are no restrictions.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, this has set the tone in the \nfuture. We will not be setting amendments aside. We will dispose of \namendments and move to something else. It is too confusing doing it \nthis way.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas has the floor for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I guess we started up a fuss by talking \nabout this, which I can understand.\n  Let me go back to sort of remind anyone that is listening that on-\ndemand sequential referral, as referred to in the Bayh amendment, has \nhad a chilling effect on the introduction of legislative initiatives by \nthe Intelligence Committee.\n  Why is that important? It is because the joint inquiry task force \ninvestigating September 11, it is because the 511-page report on WMD, \nintelligence on whether there were WMD in Iraq, and the 9/11 \nCommission's report had this unique idea, and the unique idea was that \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence should be granted at least \nenabling power, be empowered to be the oversight committee that has \nindependence and leadership and clout and that we do not today.\n\n  One of the obstacles is this on-demand sequential referral. Every \nother committee in the Congress can ask for sequential referral, but \nthey do it by unanimous consent or they ask the leadership. There is \nnothing wrong with that. But on-demand sequential referral from the \nvery committees that we have two members on the Intelligence Committee \nrepresenting--Judiciary, Appropriations, Armed Services, and Foreign \nRelations? They are represented. And as I have indicated, legislative \ninitiatives that we have end up on the cutting-room floor. It is a very \nfractionalized process, both from the Armed Services Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I have nothing but admiration for the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia and the distinguished Senator from Michigan and the work they \ndo on behalf of our military, and for the appropriators and the work \nthey do on behalf of our military. It is just that it is a \nfractionalized process. Sometimes we are in the room, sometimes we are \nnot. Sometimes we don't know what ends up on the cutting-room floor, \nsometimes we do. That does not speak well for the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission and the Intelligence Committee.\n  This process, which the members of the Intelligence Committee believe \nis unique to the Intelligence Committee, does not permit the committee \npriorities to reach the Senate floor for full debate. We cannot fully \ndebate it because it is classified. Everybody else who wants sequential \nreferral changes a bill. They come to the floor, argue the points, and \nthen win or lose. We cannot because it is classified.\n  This provision is a significant obstacle to the full realization of \nthe Intelligence Committee oversight and should be repealed. I support \nthe amendment. I encourage my colleagues to do likewise. I hope we are \nable to reach some accommodation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and my colleagues and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3994\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair be kind enough to notify me when 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes is up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senators from \nKentucky and Nevada for their help in bringing us to where we are today \nin terms of meeting our responsibilities under the 9/11 Commission. I \nagain congratulate the Senators from Maine and Connecticut for their \noutstanding leadership on the floor of the Senate. America must be \nheartened by the results of their effort. I join in commending all of \nthem for the job they have done.\n  This amendment, which my friend, the chairman of the Immigration \nSubcommittee, and I offer is virtually identical in effect to the \nGrassley-Baucus amendment that was just accepted. That amendment keeps \nmany of the Customs-related functions in the Finance Committee.\n  The amendment that Senator Chambliss and I offer keeps the \nimmigration-related functions in the Judiciary Committee. What we are \nseeking is much more modest than the major exemptions written into the \nbase bill for the Coast Guard and the Transportation Security \nAdministration.\n  Our amendment does not preclude the new Homeland Security Committee \nfrom exercising jurisdiction over security issues, such as developing \nbiometric identifiers to enhance national security, upgrading \ntechnology, including electronic interoperable data systems, compiling \nwatch list information to screen out terrorists, and enhancing \nintelligence and law enforcement capabilities. That is appropriately \nreserved.\n  But surely we can meet the serious terrorism dangers we are facing \nfrom terrorists without obstructing the entry of more than 500 million \nindividuals who go across our borders every year and who legally enter \nthe United States each year as visitors, as students, as temporary \nworkers, crossing legally from Canada and Mexico, on a daily basis, to \nconduct business or to visit their families.\n  These immigration issues are about reunifying families, protecting \nrefugees and asylum seekers, welcoming foreign workers when we cannot \nfind American workers to fill our jobs, opening our doors to immigrants \nwho will be future U.S. citizens. These issues are about welcoming \ninternational students and visitors, scholars and researchers to our \ncountry, so that we can benefit from a climate of open exchange.\n  Immigration law involves so much more than weeding out the few \nterrorists. The problem is, the terrorists are the danger, not just the \nissues of immigration. Transferring total jurisdiction to a new \nHomeland Security Committee would ignore all the other primary \nfunctions of our immigration laws and effectively send a message to the \nworld that terrorists are winning and that our pride in our immigrant \nheritage and history has turned to fear.\n  Immigration is a central part of our heritage and history. It is \nessential to who we are as Americans. Maintaining it is part of our \nnational well-being, our identity as a nation, and our strength in \ntoday's world. In defending the Nation, we are also defending the \nfundamental constitutional principles that have made America strong in \nthe past and will make us even stronger in the future.\n  Mr. President, for all of these reasons, I believe the Judiciary \nCommittee should retain jurisdiction over the immigration issues \nunrelated to terrorism. That is what the Chambliss amendment does. I \nhope it will be accepted by the membership.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Chambliss and \nSenator Kennedy on this amendment which I think injects some needed \nrationality in this process. I certainly support the goal of improving \nthe oversight of our intelligence community and homeland security \nefforts. But I think what has happened in our haste is that there has \nbeen some unintended consequences, and one is attempted to be remedied \nby this amendment.\n  Simply stated, this amendment, as Senator Kennedy and Senator \nChambliss have already addressed, would retain the immigration \nfunctions at the Border and Transportation Security Directorate in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I, as does the Presiding Officer, serve on the \nJudiciary Committee in large part because of my concern about \nimmigration and border security issues as a Senator from Texas, with a \n1,200-mile border with Mexico, one of the more problematic borders of \nthis country. I serve with Senators from California and Arizona. The \nonly State not represented on the Southern border is the State of New \nMexico.\n  But as the Presiding Officer knows, immigration issues are \nexceedingly\n\n[[Page S10630]]\n\ncontentious and complex. Frankly, there are a number of Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee who have invested an awful lot of time and effort \nto try to get up to speed. And indeed, there are others, like me, who \nhave introduced immigration reform bills, which I am hopeful will be \nbrought up when we return in January or shortly thereafter.\n  What I am concerned about is if we make this change now, it will \ndelay long-overdue immigration reform in this country as the new \ncommittee to which it is assigned is getting up to speed. It is no \nslight meant to them. They are very distinguished and competent \nSenators. But the truth is, the staff and Senators who have been \ninvolved in immigration issues on the Judiciary for a long time have \nlearned a lot, developed a lot of the relationships and contacts with \nthe various parties who are interested in this issue, the stakeholders.\n  Just in terms of injecting some modest bit of rationality in this \nprocess, I am pleased to join Senator Chambliss, Senator Kennedy, and \nSenator Leahy, who I know will also speak to this matter, and others on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in saying that if common sense and \nrationality prevail in this process, then this amendment will be \naccepted, either by agreement, by unanimous consent, or by a vote. And \nI certainly would urge all of my colleagues to support the amendment in \nthe event a vote is required.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is reserved for the Senator \nfrom Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the expressions of the \nSenator from Texas, the Senator from Georgia, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I am a strong supporter of the Chambliss-Kennedy \namendment. It would retain the majority of immigration jurisdiction for \nthe Judiciary Committee, not just because we like that but because that \nis where the experience is and that is where it ties in the best.\n  As Senator Chambliss pointed out this morning, just as the Commerce \nCommittee retained the Coast Guard because of the long tradition of the \nCoast Guard being there and the expertise for it, and EPW is retaining \nthe Transportation Security Administration, by the same token, the \nJudiciary Committee should retain core immigration issues.\n  We should not burden the Homeland Security Committee with immigration \nand citizen refugee matters. That is not the purpose of the new \ncommittee. There are some aspects of immigration law and policy that \nwill raise homeland security issues--some--but we have to note that \nimmigration is an extraordinarily broad area. It is an important \neconomic issue and, as President after President has said, in one way \nor the other, it is often a moral issue. This is the country that has \nthe Statue of Liberty beckoning us all. This is the country that \nbrought my grandparents here not speaking any English but making a new \nlife.\n  The Judiciary Committee has decades of experience in business \nimmigration issues, refugee policy, and naturalization. As written, the \nresolution before us would take those issues, which are not homeland \nsecurity issues, and give them to the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  I ask: Does it make sense for the Governmental Affairs Committee to \noversee and legislate on the H-1B visa program which employers use to \nbring in highly skilled foreign workers? That is not a homeland \nsecurity issue. Does it make sense for that committee to be responsible \nfor the refugee program? That is something Judiciary and Foreign \nRelations oversee and do a very good job of. I don't think it is in the \ninterest of the Senate or, for that matter, of immigrants for sole \njurisdiction over immigration matters to be transferred to a committee \nwith a homeland security mandate.\n  We should be conscious of the security aspects of immigration policy, \nof course, but we also need to retain our national commitment to legal \nimmigration--the thing that brought my grandparents to this country. \nImmigrants like my grandfather and grandmother enrich our economy and \nour culture. It is important for us not to see immigration solely \nthrough the prism of national security.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remaining \ntime be allocated equally to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, \nand the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly on the pending amendment offered by the Senator from Georgia. I \ninitially ask unanimous consent that I be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When I said 3 minutes would be sufficient, I said that \nin the context of a collective noun, but I shall not take much more \nthan that.\n  I believe the jurisdiction of the immigration function as embodied in \nthe Chambliss amendment ought to be maintained in the Judiciary \nCommittee. There is very considerable expertise built up in the \nJudiciary Committee over the years on the very important subjects \nrelated to immigration. The President has stated a policy of dealing \nwith the problem of 11 million people in the United States who do not \nhave legalized status. The Subcommittee on Immigration of the Judiciary \nCommittee has done extensive work on this matter. It is a pressing \nmatter and I think will be one of the priority items to be considered \nby the Congress next year.\n  The most important issues can best be handled by the current \nSubcommittee on Immigration of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Briefly stated, those are the reasons why I support the pending \namendment and ask that the traditional jurisdiction in the Judiciary \nCommittee over immigration be maintained.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10631-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10631-S10632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S10631]]\n\nSenate\n\n            INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE REORGANIZATION--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I can make a suggestion, there are \nnegotiations that need to take place on the Bayh amendment that has \nbeen offered. I respectfully suggest that there are two important \nmeetings that are going to take place: one we are having and one the \nRepublicans are having. I am wondering if it wouldn't be in the best \ninterest of all--1 o'clock is the filing deadline for amendments--that \nthe Senate stand in recess from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will not object to that request--in \nfact, I agree to it--but I also want to make the point that one of the \nmost important amendments we anticipate is an amendment by Senator \nMcCain. I know earlier he had contacted us indicating he wanted to come \nover and offer it. Since we will be in recess under the consent \nagreement Senator Reid is going to offer from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., it is \nmy hope Senator McCain will be able to come over and offer that at 2 \np.m. and we can get that in the queue.\n  Mr. REID. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to a request for a recess \nfrom 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     Using Indian Health Service Facilities to Register New Voters\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about an article \nthat was in yesterday's Washington Post that I thought raised a very \ndisturbing issue of which the Senate needs to be aware. The article is \nentitled ``Indian Health Agency Barred New-Voter Drive.'' I will read a \ncouple of paragraphs from the article so that people understand the \nissues.\n  It says:\n\n       Officials at a federal program that runs hospitals and \n     clinics serving Native Americans this summer prohibited \n     employees from using those facilities to sign up new voters, \n     saying that even nonpartisan voter registration was \n     prohibited on federal property.\n       Staff members at several Indian Health Service hospitals \n     and clinics in New Mexico, a presidential battleground state \n     where about one-tenth of the population is Native American, \n     were trying to register employees, patients and family \n     members who use the facilities.\n       In a July e-mail, Ronald C. Wood, executive officer of the \n     program's regional Navajo office, told his hospital and \n     clinic directors that ``we are in a very sensitive political \n     season'' and he outlined a policy that he said came from \n     Indian Health Service headquarters.\n       ``There have been some recent questions about whether we \n     can do nonpartisan voter registration drives in our IHS \n     facilities during non-duty hours''. . . .``The guidance from \n     HQs staff is that we should not allow voter\n\n[[Page S10632]]\n\n     registration in our facilities or on federal property.''\n\n  This is of concern because of the history of Native Americans being \ndenied the right to vote in my State and perhaps in other parts of the \ncountry as well.\n  The history of this issue in New Mexico, very briefly, is that a \nreturning Marine Corps veteran, someone who served in the Second World \nWar in the Marine Corps, named Miguel Trujillo, was denied the right to \nvote in our State. In 1948, he had to bring suit in Federal court to \nobtain the right to vote. He was an Isleta Pueblo Indian member, and he \nwas teaching at Laguna Pueblo in my State and was denied the right to \nvote as a Native American.\n  I should point out that his son Michael Trujillo went on to become \nthe head of the Indian Health Service. His daughter Josephine Waconda \nwas the first American Indian woman to be a rear admiral in the career \nIndian Health Service. So they have a tremendous part of our history in \nthat family.\n  It is absolutely inexcusable that the Indian Health Service would be \ngiving direction saying that it is inappropriate or illegal or \nprohibited for people to use Federal property or Indian Health Service \nfacilities to register people to vote on a nonpartisan basis.\n  Yesterday, I sent a letter to Tommy Thompson, Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, urging that even though it is not going to affect this \nyear's election since voter registration in our State is essentially \nover this week in New Mexico, even though it does not affect voter \nregistration, it is imperative that he, as head of that Department, \nissue a policy and clarify that this is not the policy of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, this is not the policy of the \nIndian Health Service.\n  We have a very strong policy that is recognized in the Defense \nDepartment that they encourage military personnel and others who are \npart of the military family to participate in registering others, \neither on or off base, to vote. That is as it should be. That is on a \nnonpartisan basis. I think we all support that. We need to have the \nvery same policy with regard to Indian Health Service facilities and \nIndian Health Service personnel.\n  I hope very much that Secretary Thompson will respond to my letter \npositively, will issue a directive so that it is clear from now on that \nIndian Health Service personnel are not in any way prohibited from \nparticipating in voter registration drives on a nonpartisan basis. This \nis an issue that deserves attention before it is lost in the shuffle of \nthis campaign. I hope we can get a response from the Secretary in the \nnear future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nletter I sent to Secretary Thompson.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                  October 6, 2004.\n     Hon. Tommy Thompson,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, 200 \n         Independence Ave. SW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Thompson: I was dismayed to read a report in \n     the Washington Post this morning that officials at the Indian \n     Health Service were prohibiting employees at several \n     locations in New Mexico from using IHS facilities to register \n     new voters. While it would certainly not be appropriate or \n     legal under the Hatch Act for federal employees to be \n     involved in partisan political activity on federal property, \n     the proposed Indian Health Service (IHS) voter registration \n     program, as described in the Washington Post article, would \n     not be prohibited under the Hatch Act because the program is \n     described as nonpartisan. In addition, according to the \n     article, the activity would take place during non-working \n     hours, which should allay the fears of anyone concerned that \n     the IHS employees would feel coerced to take part in the \n     activity or that the program would interfere with employees' \n     regular duties. As long as the program were conducted in a \n     nonpartisan way, e.g. employees leading the effort do not \n     attempt to influence the registrants in any way, and \n     employees were free to choose whether or not to participate, \n     it would be perfectly legal.\n       It is well known that the Defense Department has undertaken \n     efforts to make sure that as many of its employees are \n     registered to vote and participate in next month's elections \n     as are eligible to do so. The Defense Department's efforts, \n     like those proposed by Indian Health Agency employees, are \n     designed to increase citizen involvement in one of the most \n     important elections in our history. These are admirable goals \n     that should be encouraged, not prohibited.\n       While it is clearly too late to clarify the Department's \n     policy with regard to this year's election, I would still ask \n     that you act as expeditiously as possible to issue a \n     directive that makes it clear that the Department of Health \n     and Human Services will not prohibit its employees from \n     engaging in non-partisan voter registration on federal \n     property. In fact, I would hope that you would encourage your \n     Department to engage in the same active voter registration \n     efforts that the Department of Defense does. It is the right \n     thing to do in the service of full participation in the \n     democratic process, a goal that I know you share with me.\n       Please let me know of your plans to encourage voter \n     registration as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeff Bingaman.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I don't expect that this amendment should \nrequire a lot of debate. It is an issue that we have all talked about a \nlot. It is all a question of turf and jurisdiction. It is something \nthat would never be seriously considered by this body under any other \ncircumstances except that we are talking about the war on terrorism and \nthe overwhelming issue of how we are going to defend this Nation. I \nwill be more than happy to agree to a time agreement with the \nappropriators who will lead the fight against this amendment which \nwould be agreeable to them.\n  This Chamber can be very proud of its bipartisan work that resulted \nin the overwhelming passage of S. 2845, the National Intelligence \nReform Act of\n\n[[Page S10633]]\n\n2004. That bill addressed 38 of the 9/11 Commission's 41 \nrecommendations to further secure our homeland. Not only the two \nmanagers of that bill--Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman--deserve \nour gratitude but the two leaders, as well, worked together to ensure \nthe Senate acted on this important reform legislation prior to \nadjourning before the elections.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Lieberman, Lott, Snowe, \nRoberts, and Bayh be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, one of the Commission's two options which \nthe Commission recommended for how best Congress can improve \ncongressional structure over intelligence--the underlying resolution \ndoes not propose either of the Commission's two options creating either \na joint committee modeled after the Joint Atomic Energy Committee or \nHouse and Senate committees with combined authorizing and appropriating \npowers.\n  Let me tell you what this is all about. The Commission report was \nclear that along with the need to reform the executive branch, \ncongressional reform is needed. And I quote from the report:\n\n       The other reforms we have suggested for a national \n     counterterrorism center and national intelligence director \n     will not work if congressional oversight does not change too.\n\n  I want to repeat that:\n\n       The other reforms . . . will not work if congressional \n     oversight does not change too.\n       Unity of effort in executive management can be lost if it \n     is fractured by divided congressional oversight.\n\n  We can't leave this week with our job incomplete. We have to address \nthe Commission's recommendations regarding the urgent need to reform \ncongressional oversight, intelligence and homeland security. To do this \nin a meaningful way to carry out the important institutional reforms \nrecommended by the Commission, each of us in Congress must sacrifice \nour own self-interest. We do not serve the American public well with \nshortsighted, parochial turf battles.\n  The Commission acknowledges that this won't be an easy task.\n  The report states:\n\n       Of all our recommendations, strengthening congressional \n     oversight may be among the most difficult and important. So \n     long as oversight is governed by current congressional rules \n     and resolutions, we believe the American people will not get \n     the security they want and need. The United States needs a \n     strong, stable and capable congressional committee structure \n     to give America's national intelligence agencies oversight, \n     support and leadership.\n\n  The Commission also stated:\n\n       Tinkering with the existing structure is not sufficient.\n\n  It calls the congressional oversight ``dysfunctional.''\n  Their recommendations clearly state that we must have a committee \nwith both authorizing and appropriating authority.\n  It is not any simpler nor more complicated than that.\n  I have a letter from the 9/11 Commission which states:\n\n       If Senator McCain offers an amendment in support of \n     Commission recommendations on Congressional oversight, we \n     will support it.\n       We urge the Senate to adopt provisions for the strongest \n     possible reform of Congressional oversight.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that three letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 6, 2004.\n       Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, former Chair and Vice \n     Chair of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon \n     the United States (also known as the ``9/11 Commission) today \n     released the following statement:\n       ``We continue to believe that reform of Congressional \n     oversight is necessary in order for the Commission's overall \n     recommendation to be effective.''\n       ``If Senator McCain offers an amendment in support of \n     Commission recommendations on Congressional oversight, we \n     will support it.''\n       ``The proposals of Senator McConnell and Reid constructive, \n     positive and move in the right direction. They are useful and \n     modest steps. They are not as far-reaching as those \n     recommended by the Commission.''\n       ``We urge the Senate to adopt provisions for the strongest \n     possible reform of Congressional oversight.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               John F. Lehman,\n\n                                    New York, NY, October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: I am writing to reiterate my strong support for \n     real Congressional reform as recommended by the 9/11 \n     Commission.\n       As our report makes clear, the important executive branch \n     reforms that passed the Senate yesterday will not work if \n     congressional oversight does not change too. Unfortunately, \n     the McConnell/Reid proposal does not fulfill the Commission's \n     vision for comprehensive reform. The intelligence committee \n     needs real power and prominence, which is why the Commission \n     strongly recommended a new committee structure combining \n     authorizing and appropriating authority, and a simplified and \n     functional homeland security committee structure.\n       I urge the Senate to make the Commission's recommendations \n     for Congressional reform as high a priority as it made our \n     other recommendations, which received an overwhelming \n     bipartisan vote of 96.2. The Congressional reforms are \n     equally important and necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n     John F. Lehman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  October 7, 2004.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I write to reaffirm my strong support \n     for Congressional action to implement the recommendation of \n     the 9/11 Commission Report to strengthen Congressional \n     oversight of intelligence and homeland security.\n       As you know the bipartisan 9/11 Commission was unanimous in \n     its recommendation that serious reform was necessary. In the \n     language of the Commission: ``Tinkering with the existing \n     structure is not sufficient. . . . the goal should be a \n     structure--codified by resolution with powers expressly \n     granted and carefully limited--allowing a relatively small \n     group of members of Congress, given time and reason to master \n     the subject and the agencies, to conduct oversight of the \n     intelligence establishment and be clearly accountable for \n     their work.''\n       This is best implemented by establishing a single committee \n     in each house of Congress combining authorizing and \n     appropriating authorities. Therefore, I endorse your \n     amendment to the current bill which will ensure this single \n     authority.\n       Thank you for your work to ensure that the recommendations \n     of the 9/11 Commission are implemented.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bob Kerrey.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Bob Kerrey writes:\n\n       I write to reaffirm my strong support for Congressional \n     action to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 \n     Commission Report to strengthen Congressional oversight of \n     intelligence and homeland security.\n\n  Bob Kerrey, by the way, served here for two terms, as I recall, for \n12 years.\n  He further states in his letter:\n\n       This is best implemented by establishing a single committee \n     in each House of Congress combining authorizing and \n     appropriating authorities. Therefore, I endorse your \n     amendment in the current bill which will ensure the single \n     authority.\n       Thank you for your work to ensure the recommendations of \n     the 9/11 Commission are implemented.\n       Sincerely, Bob Kerrey.\n\n  I would like to point out just as way of background how we got to the \nproposal we have on the table.\n  My understanding is both leaders appointed both whips--the Senator \nfrom Nevada and the Senator from Kentucky--as part of two 11-person \ncommittees to come up with recommendations.\n  We met a couple times, the 11 Republicans, and discussed various \nissues, then there was another meeting of both, and then we were told \nthat Senator Reid and Senator McConnell would come up with some \nrecommendations. That is not exactly what I had in mind when I was \nasked to serve as part of an 11-Senator committee. Here came these \nrecommendations.\n  I don't want to digress but, for example, the Transportation Security \nAdministration is left in the Commerce Committee. I am glad to have \nmore discussions with the Senator from Kentucky about that.\n  I asked, How could the Transportation Security Administration not be \nmade part of the new Homeland Security Committee? The Transportation \nSecurity Administration is the heart and soul of it. His answer was--\nmaybe he will have a different answer--it was part of the negotiations. \nWhat does that mean?\n  I digress. The fact is, unless we give the authorizing committee the \nproper appropriating capability, we will continue to have, as the 9/11 \nCommission said, a dysfunctional oversight of intelligence. It is a \ngood idea to make Intelligence Committee members permanent members and \nnot have them term\n\n[[Page S10634]]\n\nlimited. I think it is a good idea to have it an A committee, although \nthat may cause significant problems if we do not give the Permanent \nCommittee on Intelligence appropriating authority.\n  It is sometimes nice to have a real-world example of why we need \nthis. I am not a member of the Intelligence Committee. I have no access \nto classified information. Frankly, I have never sought any because of \nthe fear that some information I might have I might speak about in a \npublic forum.\n  There was a very expensive and very controversial intelligence \nprogram, and the Intelligence Committee--this is a relatively short \ntime ago--the Intelligence Committee, after many hearings, extensive \nscrutiny and a thorough scrubbing of this program, determined that the \nprogram should be canceled. We are talking about a multibillion-dollar \nprogram.\n  Do you know what happened? The Appropriations Committee funded it.\n  So if you are the bureaucrat over in Langley or at the National \nSecurity Agency or any place else, where do you go? Where do you go \nwhen you want your projects done? Do you go to the authorizing \ncommittee or do you go to the appropriating committee? The power \nresides in the purse. The Golden Rule prevails around here. We all know \nthe Golden Rule.\n  So if we are going to have a truly effective Intelligence Committee \noversight that can function with strength and power, we are going to \nhave to give them appropriations authority. I predict after the initial \nattractiveness of serving on the Intelligence Committee, if they do not \nhave appropriating authority, we will have difficulty getting people to \nserve on the authorizing committee because, again, the power is not \nthere.\n  We know why many of the authorizing committees are not nearly as \nimportant or as powerful as they used to be. It is because the \nappropriations process is what drives not only the money but also the \npolicy.\n  We are going to have an Omnibus appropriations bill sometime. Usually \nwhat happens, coincidentally, it is within 24 hours of when we go out \nof session. It always seems to work out that way. There will be \nnumerous policy changes. There will be numerous moneys and earmarks put \nin. Last year there were 14,000 earmarks put in the appropriations \nbills, up from 4,000 in 1994.\n\n  We are going to see things that will astonish some Members. For \nexample, I was astonished several years ago when there was a line item \nin an appropriations bill that called for the leasing of Boeing \naircraft. We had never had a hearing in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. We never looked at the issue. No one even suggested it, that \nI know of, and I have been on the committee for 18 years. There was a \nline item that appeared in an appropriations bill that said we would \nlease Boeing aircraft.\n  Do you know what happened since then? The GAO and the Office of \nManagement and Budget determined that it was a $5.7 billion additional \ncost to the taxpayer. We now ended up, with this long trail that began \nwith a line in an appropriations bill, with one of the former employees \nof the Department of Defense pleading guilty and receiving a 9-month \nprison term, saying she had rigged the contract to the benefit of \nBoeing aircraft.\n  Now, why do I bring up that example? Because I can tell Members right \nnow that if that had been a subject for the Armed Services Committee, \nwe would have had hearings on it. We would have examined the leasing \nidea and rejected it as the ridiculous, expensive idea that it was.\n  I can go with many other examples. Cruise ships that cost the \ntaxpayers $200 million in loan guarantees that were half built at \nPascagoula, MS. I can tell Members of line items in appropriations \nbills that say when the broadcasters reach 85 percent of high-\ndefinition television in 85 percent of the homes in America, which the \nChairman of the Federal Communications Commission says will never \nhappen--I could go over a long list of items that are not only money \nbut also policy.\n  What will happen if we do not give the authorizing Intelligence \nCommittee the appropriations power? Exactly what has happened in the \npast. Projects that cost a great deal of money that the Intelligence \nCommittee either approves or disapproves of are overridden in the \nappropriations process. It happens time after time after time.\n  I usually pride myself in straight talk. I would be surprised if I \nwin on this amendment. One of the Commissioners called me and told me, \n``I'm under intense pressure''--those are his words--``not to support \nyour amendment but I will go ahead and do so.''\n  There are Members of this Senate who are under intense pressure, as \nwell.\n  If we want to tell the American people with the justified pride that \nwe take in the actions we have achieved in the Senate in the last few \ndays, which is remarkable--at least from my standpoint, one of the \nprouder moments I have experienced in the number of years I have spent \nhere as we have gone through an incredible process, beginning with \nhearings before Senator Collins's committee back in August, which \nculminated in a tremendous achievement and the most significant \ngovernmental reform since 1947--then we have done about half to three-\nquarters of the job. If we do not give the authorizing committee either \nappropriating power or some kind of power, some kind of authority, then \nwe will see a basically dysfunctional and toothless Intelligence \nCommittee.\n\n  The Senator from Nevada came to me and said he was going to move to \ntable. I tell the Senator from Nevada, one, I want everyone to be able \nto talk, so we will just reintroduce the amendment if it is tabled, \nunless everyone gets to talk. But I also say to the Senator from Nevada \nthat I would be glad to enter into a time agreement for passage of this \nlegislation. I intend to get an up-or-down vote. I will reintroduce it \nunless the Senator from Nevada allows an up-or-down vote on the \namendment. I think it is that important.\n  Mr. REID. If I could, through the Chair to my friend from Arizona, I \nhave no problem with an up-or-down vote. I would rather he told me he \nwanted an up-or-down vote. I would say fine. I have no problem.\n  I also say to my friend, I want to make sure everyone who wants to \nspeak will have the opportunity. I have no problem at all with an up-\nor-down vote on this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bayh not be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My friend from Hawaii was on the floor first. Does he \nwish to speak on this matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, the Senate is considering the \nresolution which responds to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission \nto revamp the congressional oversight process for intelligence and \nhomeland security. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few \nwords about this matter.\n  The Commission recommended two options for Congress to consider \nregarding intelligence oversight. First, they suggested that the \nCongress could create a joint bicameral committee modeled after the \nJoint Committee on Atomic Energy, as they said, to streamline the \ncongressional review over intelligence functions. They supported this \nidea because they believe we need to have a very powerful Intelligence \nCommittee which can stand up to the administration and speak \nauthoritatively for the Congress. I understand there is virtually no \nsupport within the Senate for this suggestion.\n  The other alternative suggested by the Commission was to give the \nIntelligence Committees the authority to appropriate funds, and this is \nthe matter now being discussed. The Intelligence Committee--some of the \nmembers--believes the inability to appropriate funds allows the \nadministration to play the Intelligence Committee off against the \nAppropriations Committee. They argue this weakens congressional \noversight. My colleagues are undoubtedly aware that granting an \nauthorization committee such authority would be unprecedented in modern \ntimes.\n  Chairman Stevens and I were surprised that neither one of us was \ncontacted by the members of the 9/11 Commission as they conducted their \nreview\n\n[[Page S10635]]\n\nand prepared their recommendations. We were shocked that, without even \nconsulting us or our House counterparts on the Appropriations \nCommittee, they would recommend that Congress eliminate our role in \nintelligence oversight. As such, I cannot offer any personal \nexplanation for the Commission's recommendation.\n  Furthermore, their report provides scant explanation why they believe \nthe Appropriations Committee should be excluded from its mission to \nfund all Federal agencies. In fact, there is not a single word in the \n9/11 Commission's report to suggest that the appropriations \nsubcommittee was at fault in its oversight of the intelligence budget. \nNever once were we accused of that shortfall.\n  I believe the Intelligence Committee's role in spending authority is \nalready powerful enough without any new authority. Under the National \nSecurity Act of 1947, as amended by section 504, the intelligence \ncommunity cannot spend appropriated funds unless the funds are \nspecifically authorized. Now, I think this is worth repeating. The \nintelligence community cannot spend appropriated funds unless the funds \nare specifically authorized. As such, the Select Intelligence Committee \nalready has more authority than any standing committee.\n  Let me be clear about what that means. If the Appropriations \nCommittee were to fund programs that were not included in the annual \nintelligence authorization bill, the appropriated funding for those \nprograms cannot and will not be spent by the executive branch.\n  This authority is virtually unheard of in other budget functions. The \nauthority was granted to the Intelligence Committee to ensure that the \nexecutive branch could not use the wide latitude provided in \nappropriations law to circumvent the will of the Congress. \nAppropriations acts are written with broad authority to hide the \namounts for classified programs in large lump sums. This ensures that \nthe amounts for these programs remain undisclosed. As such, the limits \non spending for classified programs are very broad. The authorization \nrequirement ensures that both committees agree on how much should be \nspent to provide a better check on the administration.\n\n  More important, I believe the idea of centralizing congressional \noversight is not only a bad idea, it could be dangerous to the Nation. \nIn all areas of Government, except intelligence, our system requires \nand allows public scrutiny. The media, nongovernment organizations, and \neven lobbyists all provide information and insight to Members of \nCongress on everything except intelligence.\n  Congress needs to have a system of checks and balances internal to \nthe legislative branch because there are no other checks. We all \nremember Iran-Contra, which was able to go unchecked even though \nmultiple committees had some degree of intelligence oversight. What \nchance would we have of uncovering that type of abuse if only one \ncommittee were examining intelligence matters?\n  We know there have been other abuses by the intelligence community. I \nremember a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nexpressing outrage to discover that the National Reconnaissance Office \nwas spending significantly more money to build a new headquarters than \nthe chairman was aware. I recall how Chairman Stevens uncovered a slush \nfund in the same agency that had been accumulating outside of the \nknowledge of the Congress.\n  Do any of my colleagues really believe that having only one committee \nperform oversight of the intelligence community's budget will provide \nmore effective oversight?\n  In addition, a single committee overseeing intelligence for the \nSenate would create a powerful czar. Little opportunity would exist for \nmeaningful debate on intelligence budgets because so few Members would \nbe aware of the details of intelligence matters. Of equal concern, a \nmore powerful chairman could end up being co-opted or at least overly \ninfluenced by the intelligence community and potentially lose \nobjectivity. The Senate would be at his or her mercy with little \noutside scrutiny. That is not an appropriate or effective form of \noversight for the Congress.\n  Having a few committees cleared for intelligence programs, such as \nArmed Services, Appropriations, and Intelligence, and each with some \nrole in determining how resources are provided would ensure that fewer \nbad ideas get legislated, and it would also create more effective \noversight and competitive analysis by the Congress.\n  I also note that maintaining the link to the Appropriations Committee \nis beneficial to the intelligence community. Intelligence funding is \nprotected by inclusion under the Appropriations Committee. By combining \nall appropriations resources, the committee has historically solved \nmany intelligence shortfalls.\n  If the Appropriations Committee is removed from intelligence matters, \nit will be less likely to support intelligence requirements. First, the \ncommittee will not be as knowledgeable of intelligence needs. Second, \nit is human nature for chairmen and ranking members to care about the \nprograms over which they have jurisdiction. If they do not have some \noversight over intelligence programs, they will not have the link to \nthe intelligence providers or necessarily the desire to help.\n  The Intelligence Committee would be subject to 302 budget reductions \nand other general reductions levied against all committees by the \nBudget Committee. To believe that they would be held harmless in \nacross-the-board cuts or other cutbacks I think is very naive. Their \nfunding level is more likely to be decreased than increased.\n  Linking Defense and Intelligence is critical. DOD cannot operate \nwithout good intelligence. The Defense Subcommittee has ensured that \nintelligence resources support the needs of the warfighter. Today, the \nDefense Subcommittee reviews the recommendations of both the Armed \nServices and Intelligence Committees. The Appropriations Committee can \nminimize redundancies and make sure that the needs of both Defense and \nIntelligence are met. Separating Defense from Intelligence through the \ncreation of an all-powerful Intelligence Committee would hurt oversight \nand hurt the community they hope to help.\n  In recent testimony before the House Intelligence Committee former \nDeputy Defense Secretary, Defense Comptroller, and staffer to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, Dr. John Hamre stated that the \nIntelligence and Armed Services Committees worry too much about input \nand not enough about output.\n  His counsel was to let the Appropriations Committee worry about input \nin the budget process, to determine what we should spend money on and \nlet the authorizing committees worry about how the agencies are \nperforming with these resources. He noted that the authorizing \ncommittees spend far too much time on the budget and therefore had \ninsufficient time for oversight. I am pleased that the leadership has \ndecided to recommend creating an Intelligence subcommittee on oversight \nto highlight its importance.\n  Since the Civil War it has been the mission of the Appropriations \nCommittee to balance needs among competing priorities. While the 9/11 \ntragedy exposed problems with intelligence oversight, it did not expose \nproblems with the appropriations process for intelligence. \nCertainly, nothing was uncovered that would be resolved by giving the \nIntelligence Committee the authority to appropriate funds.\n\n  The intelligence budget should not be considered in a vacuum. It \nneeds to be considered in conjunction with the Defense budget. While \nsome speculate we can simply separate national intelligence from \nmilitary intelligence, it is not that simple. Many programs have both \nnational and military, strategic or tactical, components. Military \npersonnel provide a large proportion of the intelligence community \nworkforce. The Defense Department and Intelligence Community both need \nto support maintaining this relationship and benefit from doing so. It \nshould remain the Appropriations Committee's responsibility to ensure \nthat the needs of both defense and intelligence are met.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill that the Senate adopted yesterday \nrecognizes the need for maintaining a close working relationship \nbetween DoD and intelligence. Creating an Intelligence Committee that \ncould separate itself from all the other actors in the intelligence \nsupport arena would be, quite simply, a colossal mistake.\n\n[[Page S10636]]\n\n  Some of our colleagues think that the Congress needs to reorganize \ndramatically to meet the challenges of the 21st century. There are also \nthose that believe that the Intelligence Committee needs to be \nstronger. The resolution that has been offered by the leadership in \nfact will provide some significant enhancements to the authority of the \nIntelligence Committee which will hopefully improve oversight. However, \nI believe the real key to better oversight is for our authorizing \ncommittees to focus on outputs as Dr. Hamre noted and for the \nAppropriations Committee to focus an allocating resources as \nefficiently and effectively as possible.\n  I was the first chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have \ngreat regard for the work of that committee and a great fondness for \nits chairman and vice chairman. I have also served on the \nAppropriations Committee for the past 30 years. I understand the \ncritical role that this committee plays in our Nation's security both \nin defense and intelligence. I can say with no false modesty that the \nwork that Chairman Stevens and the committee does in overseeing the \nintelligence budget with the assistance of our very experienced \nprofessional staff is unmatched anywhere in Congress.\n  As powerful as the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was, it did not \ncontrol appropriations. Maintaining Appropriations Committee control \nover funding would preserve a check on unlimited spending by an \nauthorizing committee and would allow at least one other committee to \nhave some review of Intelligence matters. I for one do not think that \nthis is sufficient oversight, but it is clearly the minimum that the \nSenate should accept.\n  This is a very important matter. Senator Reid and Senator McConnell \nhave spent the past 3 weeks deliberating on this issue. They have \nconsulted with many Members who have competing interests in this arena. \nThe resolution they propose represents a compromise that balances these \nmany and varied views. I cannot say I am completely happy with their \nrecommendation, but I can say this: Their recommendation is far \nsuperior to the alternative that is being proposed by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote to support the bipartisan leadership \nand defeat the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, the Senator from Florida be recognized. He has kindly agreed \nto let me proceed because I am due at a conference committee meeting in \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized after the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object. We can't do that. The Senator from \nFlorida has been here since 2 o'clock. I think we should keep our \nregular order here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, the \nSenator from Florida, with all due respect, is not speaking on the \namendment. Usually we go back and forth for and against the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. He is speaking on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment realigns responsibility \nfor intelligence appropriations from the Appropriations Committee to \nthe Intelligence Committee. This includes all funding relating to \nintelligence, national, joint military programs, and tactical military \nfunding and classified intelligence matters as in FBI and other \nGovernment agencies.\n  I think it would be a mistake to adopt this amendment. First, it \nignores the history of the appropriations process and the lessons we \nhave learned in both Houses of Congress. In 1865, the House created the \nAppropriations Committee. The Senate followed suit in 1867. Then from \n1867 to 1885, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees were \nstripped of their control over appropriations as one authorization \ncommittee after another gained the authority to report appropriations.\n  In 1885, both Houses realized this ad hoc approach was detrimental, \nand by 1922 both the House and Senate had reinvested appropriations \nauthority back into one committee in each House. History has proven \nthat moving appropriations to authorization committees creates a \ndecentralized appropriations process that leads to greater spending and \nless accountability. That would be even more so today under the Budget \nAct.\n  In 1910, Congressman James Tawney, Chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee from 1905 to 1911, said:\n\n       The division of jurisdiction and responsibility in the \n     matter of initiating appropriations has contributed more than \n     any single cause to the enormous increase in the \n     appropriations during recent years.\n\n  Congressman Tawney's conclusions were backed up by a 1987 study that \nfound expenditures for rivers and harbors between 1877 and 1885 rose \nsharply after the authorizing committee gained the right to \nappropriate. A book published in 1989 by Charles Stewart III contains \nsimilar findings. Even after accounting for price changes, economics, \npopulation, and territorial growth, wars and major programmatic changes \nsponsored by the authorizing committee, Mr. Stewart found the greater \ndecentralization of the appropriations between 1877 and 1885 led to \ngreater spending.\n\n  Contrast those to the findings of a 1992 study conducted by James F. \nKogan who found that deficits are rare and nonexistent when spending \njurisdiction lies within the committee.\n  Let me go now to the 9/11 Commission recommendations. They are not \nonly ill informed, but they are also unfounded. Not one line in the \nCommission's report stated that the Senate and House Appropriations \nCommittees were not performing effective intelligence oversight--not \none line. Consolidating appropriations and authorization for \nintelligence matters will undermine nearly 140 years of congressional \ntradition and ignore our years of experience in such matters.\n  I have heard some grumblings about how those of us who oppose \nprovisions in this legislation are merely protecting turf. I am not \ninterested in turf. I am interested in function as well as effective \noversight. You cannot move the responsibilities for appropriations and \nauthorizations around without having a real impact on function. And you \ncertainly should not make recommendations that aim to do that without \neven discussing those broad, sweeping changes with the Members of \nCongress who are familiar with and part of the appropriations process.\n  My colleague from Hawaii has discussed this at length. I don't want \nto be redundant, but Dr. Hamre, whom he quoted, is not alone in his \nassessment that the budget issues are overemphasized when policy and \nappropriations are jointly considered. Listen to this. Even the 9/11 \nCommission acknowledged that risk on page 421 of their report, where \nthey write:\n\n       We also recommend that the Intelligence Committee should \n     have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, \n     freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the \n     budget.\n\n  If budget issues pose such all-consuming risk to the entire oversight \nprocess, it is the view of this Senator that they should be used within \na separate committee that would fully address them. This would \nencourage collaboration and coordination, the hallmarks of our \nGovernment system.\n  The legislative appropriations process works best where there is \nfriction between the committees and bodies of Congress. That is what \nthe Founding Fathers believed in, a system of checks and balances. It \nis our suggestion that the organizations of our Government are founded \nupon that concept, and this amendment doesn't reflect that philosophy.\n  The insights I offer are not an attempt to protect turf. They are \nrecommendations I would have given to the 9/11 Commission had they \ntalked to me or to my colleague from Hawaii. Given my 36 years in the \nSenate, 8 of which I have spent as chairman or ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, I think they are very important in this \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, I will speak against this amendment. I have serious \nconcerns about any effort that would move appropriations \nresponsibilities from\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\nthe Appropriations Committee to the new Intelligence Committee.\n  I have spent over 30 years working on defense and intelligence \nmatters. I have served as the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor 6 years. Those experiences give me a unique perspective on the \nappropriations process, intelligence organizations, national security \nand defense. Based on that experience, I am very concerned about any \neffort that would combine appropriations and policy responsibilities \nand place them under the jurisdiction of a single committee.\n  Collapsing appropriations and policy functions and housing them in \nthe new Intelligence Committee would be a mistake.\n  First, it ignores the history of the appropriations process and the \nlessons we have learned in both Houses of Congress.\n  In 1865, the House created the Appropriations Committee. The Senate \nfollowed suit in 1867. Then, from 1867 to 1885 the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees were stripped of their control over \nappropriations as one authorization committee after another gained the \nauthority to report appropriations. In 1885 both Houses realized that \nthis ad hoc approach was detrimental, and by 1922, both the House and \nSenate had vested appropriations authority back in one committee.\n  History has proven that moving appropriations to authorization \ncommittees creates a decentralized appropriations process. And that \nleads to greater spending and less accountability.\n  In 1910, Congressman James Tawney, Chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee from 1905 to 1911, said the ``division of \njurisdiction and responsibility in the matter of initiating \nappropriations has contributed more than any single cause to the \nenormous increase in appropriations during recent years.''\n  Congressman Tawney's conclusions were backed up by a 1987 study that \nfound that expenditures for rivers and harbors and agriculture between \n1877 and 1885 ``rose sharply after authorizing committees gained the \nright to appropriate.''\n  A book published in 1989 by Charles H. Stewart III contained similar \nfindings. Even after accounting for price changes; economic, \npopulation, and territorial growth; wars; and major programmatic \nchanges sponsored by the authorizing committees, Mr. Stewart found that \ngreater decentralization of the appropriations process between 1877 and \n1885 led to greater spending.\n  Contrast those findings with a 1992 study conducted by John F. Cogan \nthat found deficits are rare or nonexistent when spending jurisdiction \nlies within the Appropriations Committee, and I think you will agree, \nMr. President, that we are better off with a centralized appropriations \nprocess.\n  Of course, when you look at how the 9/11 Commission conducted its \ninvestigation, it's not surprising that their recommendations ignore \nthis history. Not one of the 9/11 commissioners or 9/11 commission \nstaff members interviewed Senator Inouye or me about intelligence \noversight. Nor did they interview the Chairmen and Ranking Members of \nthe House Appropriations Committee.\n  So, I do not find it surprising that their recommendations ignore \ndecades of ``lessons learned'' by the House and the Senate. But, I do \nfind it difficult to understand how the Commission could recommend a \nmajor realignment of Congressional organization and attempt to change \nthe process for conducting Congressional business without ever speaking \nto any of the Members of Congress responsible for the appropriations \nprocess.\n  The 9/11 Commission's recommendations are not only ill-informed, they \nare also unfounded. Not one line in the Commission's report stated that \nthe Senate and House Appropriations Committees were not performing \neffective intelligence oversight Not one line! And consolidating \nappropriations and authorization for intelligence matters would \nundermine nearly 140 years of Congressional tradition and would ignore \nour years of experience with such matters.\n  I have heard some grumblings about how those of us who oppose \nprovisions in this legislation are merely protecting their ``turf.'' \nI'm not interested in ``turf.'' I am intensively interested in function \nas well as effective oversight. You can't move the responsibilities for \nappropriations and authorizations around without having a real impact \non function. And you certainly shouldn't make recommendations that aim \nto do that without even discussing those broad and sweeping changes \nwith the members of Congress who are familiar with and part of the \nappropriations process.\n  If the 9/11 Commission had asked me about these recommendations I \nwould have told them that Congress has tried to place policy and \nappropriations functions under the jurisdiction of one committee \nbefore, with poor results. We have found that mixing policy legislation \nwith appropriations legislation is inefficient and more importantly, \nnot supportive of the individual processes. Those past experiences led \nto rules in the House and Senate that institutionalized the separation \nof policy and appropriations functions.\n  Every year, Congress needs to fulfill its appropriations \nresponsibilities in a timely manner; if we don't, the government can't \nkeep operating. But the appropriations timetable is completely at odds \nwith the complex and controversial deliberations that surround most \npolicy legislation.\n  History has shown that combining policy and appropriations functions \nleads us down one of two paths: either Congress rushes policy \ndeliberations in order to meet fiscal year deadlines and risks adopting \nbad policy or we must delay the timely passage of appropriations bills \nin the interest of debating policy issues and we risk disrupting \ngovernment operations.\n  Whichever path we follow we short-change one goal in order to fulfill \nthe other.\n  The 9/11 Commission hopes that if we combine policy and budget \noversight in one committee, policy deliberations will guide our \nefforts. But my years of experience tell me it will have the opposite \neffect. Budget decisions will rule the committee and policy oversight \nwill take a back seat.\n  Former Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre expressed concern about \nthe dominance of budget issues in intelligence oversight when he \ntestified before the Appropriations Committee a few weeks ago. He said:\n\n       Frankly, the quality of congressional oversight is not \n     good. It is not as strong as it needs to be. I think we are \n     confusing it by this issue of consolidating authorizations \n     and appropriations. I have said to the Armed Service \n     Committees--I used to work there, as you know--that they have \n     made a huge mistake thinking that they are powerful only by \n     trying to do what you do, shape the dollars.\n       There are reasons you have authorization committees. They \n     are to set the broad trends and directions for the policy \n     goals and to oversee the functioning of the Government. \n     But they spend far too much time wanting to shape the way \n     you appropriate little lines in the budget, and I think \n     that is a mistake.\n       You play a crucial and indispensable role. They play a \n     crucial and indispensable role, but they are neglecting it, \n     in my view, by putting too much time and attention on budget \n     detail. I would like to see them spend far more time looking \n     at the large purposes, the large policy directions, and \n     overseeing the true functioning of these institutions. That \n     is what I think was intended by having separate authorization \n     and appropriations processes. They can be complementary, but \n     during the last 20 years, frankly, they have been in conflict \n     with each other. And I think that needs to change, and I will \n     be glad to amplify on that further at another time.\n\n  But Dr. Hamre is not alone in his assessment that budget issues are \noveremphasized when policy and appropriations are jointly considered. \nEven the 9/11 Commission acknowledged this risk. On page 421 of their \nreport they write:\n\n       We also recommend that the intelligence Committee should \n     have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, \n     freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the \n     budget.\n\n  If budget issues pose such an all-consuming risk to the entire \noversight process, it is the view of this Senator that they should be \nhoused within a separate committee that can fully address them, not \ndelegated to subcommittee. This would encourage collaboration and \ncoordination--hallmarks of our system of government.\n  Those kinds of experiences suggest that the language included in this \namendment is the wrong way to address the budget and policy issues \nfacing our nation's intelligence community. Consolidating \nappropriations and authorization into one committee\n\n[[Page S10638]]\n\nmeans fewer members of Congress and staff members will be looking at \nthese complex issues--how does that improve Congressional oversight? It \nseems to me we would have less oversight, not more.\n  The legislative and appropriations process works best when there is \nfriction between committees and bodies of Congress. That is what the \nFounding Fathers believed in--a system of check and balances. Our \nConstitution and the organization of our government are founded on that \nconcept, and this amendment does not reflect that philosophy.\n  The insights I am offering are not attempts to protect ``turf.'' They \nare the recommendations that I would have offered had the 9/11 \nCommission interviewed me. Given my 36 years in the Senate 8 of which \nhave been spent as chairman or ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee--I think they are an important part of this debate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arizona. The Senator's amendment would have the effect of \nharming the Senate's oversight capabilities and making it ineffective.\n  The Senator from Arizona argues that if we don't combine intelligence \noversight and appropriations into a single committee we are wasting our \ntime with reform efforts. I disagree. The resolution authored by the \nSenators from Kentucky and Nevada accomplishes all of the goals \noutlined by the 9/11 Commission and it does it in a way that maintains \nan established system of checks and balances we have had in the Senate \nsince the Appropriations Committee was established in 1867. The \nappropriations and authorizing committees serve important but distinct \nand separate roles, and it would be unwise to combine them.\n  Currently, intelligence funding is shared by five appropriations \nsubcommittees, and intelligence oversight is divided among three \ncommittees. Supporters of the Senator's amendment say that if you \ncombine intelligence appropriations and authorization into a single \ncommittee, you will centralize and have more powerful oversight.\n  This is not the case. Not since the early 19th and 20th centuries did \ncongressional committees originate both authorizing and appropriations \nbills. Programs back then were often authorized permanently. Oversight \nand appropriations functions were separated because it was determined \nthat having joint authorizing and appropriations committees lead to \ngreater spending and less accountability. We don't need to repeat that \nmistake of the past.\n  Another reason for opposing this amendment is a matter of \npracticality. The Intelligence Committee meets several times a week. I \nhave heard from my colleagues on the committee that it is the most \ndemanding committee assignment they have. Under the resolution their \nworkload and responsibility will significantly increase. We would be \nasking the Intelligence Committee to take on even more work by adding \nappropriations responsibility. It would make their workload enormous.\n  For those who believe the Appropriations Committee divides \nresponsibility for intelligence between too many subcommittees, this \nresolution addresses that complaint. The resolution would combine all \nintelligence appropriations into a new Intelligence Appropriations \nSubcommittee. While I would prefer we leave it to the Appropriations \nCommittee to make the determination on whether this consolidation is \nwarranted, I will support the resolution before us.\n  We have passed already this year, and the President has signed into \nlaw, the Defense Appropriations bill. This bill contains most of \nfunding this year for the intelligence agencies of our government. We \nhave not, however, been able to approve this year an Intelligence \nAuthorization bill for the next fiscal year. I do not believe the \nSenator's amendment serves us well if intelligence funding would now be \nheld hostage to policy disputes in the Intelligence Committee that are \nholding up passage of an authorization bill.\n  The resolution Senator McConnell and Reid have laid before the Senate \nis totally consistent with the 9/11 Commission's recommendations and we \nshould approve it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I am honored to have served 10 \nyears on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, including the \nopportunity to serve 18 months as its chairman. Today, I will make some \ncomments on the general context of congressional reform in support of \nreform of the intelligence agencies, including some specific remarks \nrelative to the amendment that is on the floor at this time.\n  While some of us in Congress had recognized the problems within the \nIntelligence Community over the years--and we have been working on \nspecific reforms--the tragedy of September 11, 2001, revealed systemic \nweaknesses that require sweeping changes. In the last few weeks, I have \nspoken about these issues in floor statements. We have now finished \nwork on an excellent piece of legislation that will establish a strong \nnational intelligence director and lay the groundwork for serious \nreform of our national intelligence community.\n  It is my hope the House of Representatives will soon follow our lead, \nso that we may proceed to conference and turn this legislation into \nlaw. Now it is time to turn to one final, critical component of reform: \nUs.\n  We in the Congress must be candid and admit that one of the targets \nof reform must be the current committee structure by which Congress has \norganized itself to provide oversight to the intelligence community. \nOur oversight has been proven to be haphazard at best. The 9/11 \nCommission report states:\n\n       Of all our recommendations, strengthening congressional \n     oversight may be among the most difficult and the most \n     important. So long as oversight is governed by current \n     congressional rules and resolutions, we believe the American \n     people will not get the security that they want and need. The \n     United States needs a strong, stable, capable congressional \n     committee structure to give America's national intelligence \n     agencies oversight, support, and leadership.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission goes on:\n\n       The future challenges of America's intelligence agencies \n     are daunting. They include the need to develop leading-edge \n     technologies that give our policymakers and our warfighters a \n     decisive edge in any conflict where the interests of the \n     United States are vital. Not only does good intelligence win \n     wars, but the best intelligence enables us to prevent them \n     from happening altogether.\n       Under the terms of existing rules and resolutions, the \n     House and Senate Intelligence Committees lack the power, \n     influence, and sustained capability to meet this challenge. . \n     . .\n       The other reforms we have suggested--for a National \n     counterterrorism Center and a National Intelligence \n     Director--will not work if congressional oversight does not \n     change, too. Unity of effort in executive management can be \n     lost if it is fractured by divided congressional oversight.\n\n  To those remarks, I say amen.\n  I am pleased that many of our colleagues have joined the chorus and \ncried amen as well. We now have many amendments before us that can \naccomplish the necessary changes to our Senate committee structure. I \nthank Senators Reid and McConnell, along with their staffs, for the \nwork they have invested in this issue.\n\n  The Reid-McConnell working group has come forward with a number of \nwise recommendations. I want to endorse a few of those recommendations \nin greater detail, while explaining my reasons for opposing the \namendment that is now before us. I also want to make some \nrecommendations that go beyond the resolution, but which I suggest \nwould give the new structure enhanced oversight and direction on the \nintelligence community.\n  The first recommendation I strongly support is the abolition of term \nlimits for members of the Intelligence Committees. The terms of \nIntelligence Committee members should be made permanent so that the \naccumulated experience and expertise of the committee members can be \nretained.\n  When a Member joins almost any other committee in the House or the \nSenate, he or she typically brings some base of knowledge to the task, \nsuch as a lawyer serving on the Judiciary Committee, or a military \nveteran serving on Armed Services, or someone with a financial services \nbackground joining the Banking Committee.\n  It is a rare Member who has firsthand experience with the \nintelligence community. The complexity of the issues, the technologies \ninvolved in collection\n\n[[Page S10639]]\n\nanalysis, means that it is a very steep learning curve when someone \njoins the Intelligence Committee. It is not an exaggeration to suggest \nthat it can take as much as half of the current 8-year term before the \nMember feels confident in their knowledge of the intelligence community \nand can begin to make wise, informed judgments. That tutorial exhausts \nhalf of the time of Members currently serving.\n  The justification for those term limits dates back to the creation of \nthe Intelligence Committees in the 1970s, following Senator Frank \nChurch's investigation of abuses by the CIA. It was feared that members \nof the Intelligence Committee would become captives of those they were \noverseeing, given the general lack of public scrutiny of the workings \nof the committee.\n  However, in order to ensure that committee members have the expertise \nnecessary to exercise effective oversight, we must give them adequate \ntime to build up the experience they need. We must hope that their \nconstituents will pay enough attention to their oversight of the \nintelligence agencies to ensure that the committee members remain \nindependent. I expect this will be the case, given the increasing \nawareness of the importance of intelligence to our national security.\n  There is another step that I believe should be taken, and that is an \nincreased emphasis on training of Members who will join or who \ncurrently belong to the Intelligence Committee. This is, as our \nPresident has said, hard work, serving on the Intelligence Committees. \nThe background, organizational history, financial matters affecting the \ncommunity, as well as the emerging threats the community is responsible \nfor understanding and assisting in our defense, are difficult. Members \nof the committee should devote greater time to their personal and \ncollective training so they can better discharge these \nresponsibilities.\n\n  The second recommendation I would like to endorse is the distribution \nof the Intelligence Committee's responsibilities through the use of \nsubcommittees, especially here a subcommittee on oversight that could \nexamine adverse actions within the intelligence community which often \nrequire a detailed after-incident report.\n  One of my principal concerns about the Intelligence Committee during \nmy decade of service was the inordinate amount of time that was spent \nlooking through the rearview mirror at the problems that had already \ncome to fruition, including several significant cases of \ncounterespionage, which left an inadequate amount of time to look \nthrough the front windshield at the threats that were coming at us.\n  I believe the establishment of a subcommittee which had the specific \nresponsibility for oversight, including these after-incident events, \nwould contribute substantially to the committee's capability to look to \nthe future.\n  Another suggestion within the committee structure, since we will now \nbe reorganizing the intelligence agencies around mission-based \nintelligence centers, should be the basis for establishing other \nsubcommittees with oversight responsibilities within the Intelligence \nCommittee itself. As an example, in the legislation we just passed, two \nintelligence centers are established by statute: one counterterrorism, \nthe other counterproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Clearly, \nthe Intelligence Committee should have subcommittees with specific \nresponsibility to oversee the action of these two critical centers to \nassure that the threats are being properly identified, the resources \nare available to respond to those threats, that the centers are \naccomplishing their objective, and as other centers are created by \naction of the national intelligence director, they, too, deserve a \nspecial focus of a subcommittee within the Intelligence Committee.\n  Next, I believe it is crucial that the appropriations for the \nintelligence community be detached from the budget of the Department of \nDefense so that intelligence funding can respond to intelligence needs \nand not simply fluctuate with the defense budget.\n  The reality is that while the intelligence budget is inside the \ndefense budget, that has resulted in, over time, a percentage \nrelationship. And so as happened in the 1990s, when the overall size of \nthe defense budget contracts because the Cold War was over and there \nwas a feeling that we did not need to spend the resources we had when \nwe were face to face with the Soviet Union, the consequence was we were \nalso constricting the size of the intelligence budget at exactly the \ntime the intelligence community needed to be expanding.\n  We spent 40 years looking at the Soviet Union. We knew a lot about \nit. We had people who understood the language and the cultures of our \nadversary. But after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world did not \nsuddenly declare peace. Rather, a new set of threats emerged from a \ndifferent part of the world, largely the Middle East and central Asia, \nand we were grossly deficient, particularly in our human intelligence \ncapability, to understand and react to those new threats.\n  By divorcing the intelligence budget from the defense budget, we will \nhave a greater opportunity to look specifically at the needs of both of \nthose two important parts of our national security system, but to do so \nindependently on their own merits.\n\n  I am familiar with the proposal Senator McCain and others have put \nforward to give the Intelligence Committee both authorizing and \nappropriation authority. I respectfully disagree. Having two committees \nthat pay attention to intelligence matters can be very helpful. I will \nadmit that at one time, I was intrigued with the idea of permanently \nmerging the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in the way the old \nJoint Atomic Energy Committee was merged and in a way for the last \nCongress the two committees merged for purposes of the 9/11 inquiry.\n  I have now disabused myself of that suggestion. I believe it is \nimportant that, particularly with intelligence where there are so few \nAmericans who have the background to make proper judgments and so many \nof those do not have the information upon which to make precise \njudgment, and where there are few eyes outside of the Congress, the \npress, interest groups, citizens groups, and others who can effectively \nmonitor the intelligence community, it is particularly important that \nwe have a sufficient number of eyes within the Congress that are \nfocused on intelligence issues.\n  During the runup to the invasion of Iraq, for instance, there were \nfour congressional committees that had some form of oversight over the \nadministration's push for war. Only one of those four--and I see on the \nfloor now the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee who, with \nhis colleague Senator Rockefeller, was largely responsible for this--it \nwas only the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence which asked the \ntough questions which submitted the findings which have accelerated the \npace of reform within the intelligence community.\n  If there are four congressional committees with some oversight over \nintelligence funding--the two authorizing committees and the two \nappropriating subcommittees--there is less chance that all relevant \ncongressional committees will be negligent in their oversight of \nadministration action.\n  I suggest two reforms which would enhance the establishment of a \nseparate subcommittee of appropriations for intelligence. One of those \nis to increase the authority of the Intelligence Committee over the \nauthorization process. As Senator Inouye mentioned in his remarks, \nthere is currently law that says funds cannot be appropriated to the \nintelligence community which have not been authorized. The problem has \nbeen that there are sources of authorization other than the \nintelligence community. So if the Intelligence Committee, which is now \ninvested with the particular responsibility, decides what it believes \nto be the appropriate priorities, those priorities could be disrupted \nby authorizations which come from other sources and which, in turn, \nvalidate appropriations.\n  The second point I suggest is that the chair and vice chair of the \nIntelligence Committees serve on the appropriations subcommittee. There \nis precedent for this. As an example, in reverse order, the current \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee serves on the Armed \nServices Committee. The rationale is that Armed Services represents \nsuch a significant part of the total appropriations that it is \ndesirable to have the person most responsible for those appropriations \nbe a member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  I would recommend that the same type of interlocking relationship\n\n[[Page S10640]]\n\nshould exist between the leadership of the Intelligence Committee and \nthe new intelligence appropriations subcommittee.\n  Finally, I recommend that the Intelligence Committee expand the use \nof advisory panels, such as the technical task force which has served \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee extremely well over the last 5 years.\n  I would like to recognize my colleague, Senator Shelby, who was very \ninstrumental in the initial establishment of that technical committee. \nThis advisory panel has reduced the tendency toward group think, which \nhas afflicted the intelligence agencies themselves, as we witnessed so \nclearly in the report of Senator Roberts and the Intelligence Committee \non the runup to the Iraq war.\n  One possibility would be to have an advisory panel for each of the \nsubcommittees, locking the Intelligence Committee into the pattern that \nmirrors and supports mission-based intelligence centers.\n  There has been a term in the military referred to as incestuous \namplification, which is a condition of warfare where one only listens \nto those who are already in lockstep agreement, reinforcing set \nbeliefs, creating a situation ripe for miscalculation.\n  Current events have offered powerful evidence that the intelligence \ncommunity has been engaged in incestuous amplification. It is therefore \nespecially important that the oversight committees of the Congress \navoid that temptation.\n  While I regret to say it, in many ways the Congress deserves the \ncomments which have been made by the 9/11 Commission, but I believe the \naction we are considering today will go a long way toward assuring that \nthe Congress will be a full partner in reforming the intelligence \ncommunity of the United States, and the intelligence community in turn \ncan be a fuller partner in assuring the safety of Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3999\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator McCain and his \namendment to the McConnell-Reid measure amending S. Res. 445.\n  First, I pay tribute to the former chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, Mr. Graham. I thank him for his service to our \ncountry. He is retiring, although that certainly does not describe the \nSenator, but I thank him for his leadership and his suggestions as we \ngo through this very difficult task of reforming how we do our \noversight responsibilities in reference to our intelligence \nobligations.\n  Back to Senator McCain and his amendment, if we approve the McCain \namendment, Senators will implement what is the most important \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission for improvement of congressional \noversight of intelligence activities--most important by the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  Now, why is John McCain getting in the middle of what would have to \nbe termed a sheep and cattle war, if one goes back to the history of \nArizona, and taking on the challenge of suggesting that the \nIntelligence Committee, or any authorizing committee, have \nappropriations power? That is tough. I mean, that really is tough.\n  I think everybody knows there is more than one way to skin a cat that \nis sticking his head in a bootjack than simply pulling on his tail. \nThat is hard work. That is where nobody wants to reach their hand into, \nbut there again that is John McCain.\n  John is from Arizona. I used to reside in Arizona. There is a lot of \ncactus in Arizona. One does not have to sit on each and every one of \nthem. Sometimes people think that Senator McCain does that. Why is he \ndoing this? Why is he fighting this sometimes lonely battle? Well, on \npage 420 of the 9/11 report, the Commissioners wrote this:\n\n       Under the terms of existing rules and resolutions the House \n     and Senate intelligence committees lack the power, influence \n     and sustained capability to meet this challenge.\n\n  He is right. He is dead on. He is pulling that cat by the tail in the \nbootjack. And in terms of being right, there are times that one can \ntake on tough measures and sort of let them go and slide or one can do \nthe right thing. The truth of it is that I can tell my colleagues, as \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee and an 8-year veteran of that \ncommittee--and it has been a privilege--we are fractionalized when we \ntalk to Lee Hamilton, Governor Kean, Bob Kerrey, the former Secretary \nof the Navy, John Lehman, and others. They came to visit before the \nIntelligence Committee with Senator Rockefeller and myself, Senator \nRockefeller being the distinguished vice chairman and my bipartisan \npartner in trying to do what is right on behalf of our national \nsecurity--and we think we have done a good job, by the way, backed up \nby 22 professional staffers, the most of any committee. So, \nconsequently, what happens to us is that when we do our work as quoted \nby the 9/11 Commission--and after the visit by the 9/11 Commission to \nthe Committee, they agreed with us that we are fractionalized, that our \njob is pretty tough, that in terms of being an authorizing committee we \nprobably are expected to have the most obligation, independence, \nleadership, clout in regards to oversight in reference to intelligence \nand national security of any committee in the Congress, but we have the \nleast.\n  Why is that? It is because we are fractionalized in terms of \nsequential referral on demand. I am not going to get into that speech \nagain because I think we are trying to work it out. I think we have a \ncompromise, or I hope we have a compromise, and I thank Senator \nRockefeller for being a leader in this instance.\n  Whatever we do, we know that we have to then first go to the Armed \nServices Committee and then, of course, we have to go to the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Now, that is not a bad thing because we have many fine people serving \non the Appropriations Committee. I do not mean to perjure the \nAppropriations Committee. Far from it. They have many obligations. They \nhave their constitutional authority to do this. But what happens? The \nintelligence community comes before us during the long session of 6 \nmonths, 8 months, 9 months when we do our authorization and make \npriority changes and make recommended changes and make reform changes, \nsome of which have been very dramatic. And I think they understand \nthat, obviously, then we are going to have to go to the Armed Services \nCommittee and then, obviously, we are going to have to go to the \nSubcommittee on Defense of the Appropriations Committee where they have \ndone, I might add, a splendid job of doing their very best in terms of \ntheir obligations to meet our national security obligations vis-a-vis \nthe intelligence community.\n  Now, what would someone do if they were a member of the intelligence \ncommunity? They would appear before the authorizing committee, the \nSenate Intelligence Committee--and I am not saying it was wink them, \nblink them, and nod to a committee that has no authority, but one can \nsort of make that case--and I do not perjure anybody who has come \nbefore the committee because they are great people. They are laying \ntheir lives on the line. They are dedicated people. That is not my \npoint.\n  What they do, however, is go to the Senate Armed Services Committee \nand then they also go to two primary members of this Senate whom I \npersonally call friends and admire and respect, and there have been no \ntwo people in the Congress of the United States, perhaps in the history \nof the United States, who have done more for the military and done more \nduring those times where we were stretched thin and hollow and \naddressing the tremendous problems we have today. I am talking about \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska, who is chairman of the \ncommittee, Ted Stevens and his counterpart, the Senator from Hawaii, \nDan Inouye. I do not know who has been the stagecoach driver and who \nhas ridden shotgun. During these particular years, they both worked \nequally well.\n  But what happens to them is that time demands come in and the \nintelligence community comes in and says: Wow, we have a problem. We \nhave just had an ``Oh, my God'' hearing before the Intelligence \nCommittee. Oh, my God, how did this happen? Khobar Towers, embassy \nbombings, USS Cole, the lack of really trying to figure out what \nhappened when we missed the India nuclear explosion, 9/11, Somalia--do \nyou know what. It was all tied together.\n\n  So the Appropriations Committee is faced with this urgent need, and \nthey\n\n[[Page S10641]]\n\nrespond. And the intelligence community pretty well gets what they \nwant. That is not all bad, especially when we are facing some kind of \nemergency, but it basically cuts out the Intelligence Committee's \nauthorization process to some degree. It cuts out what the Armed \nServices Committee does as well. It is time based.\n  The 9/11 Commission took a look at this and said: Congressional \noversight for intelligence and counterterrorism is now dysfunctional. \nCongress should address this problem. We have considered various \nalternatives. The primary suggestion: a single committee in each House \nof Congress combining authorizing and appropriating authorities. The \nMcCain amendment will accomplish this alternative. The McCain amendment \nwill accomplish this by giving appropriations authority to the Senate \nIntelligence Committee.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, a man \nwhom I admire, a man who has been a great friend, basically cited the \nexample between 1865 and 1885 that when they took away powers from the \nAppropriations Committee, storm clouds arrived, lightning struck, and \nit was doom and gloom time until they restored that authority.\n  Let me suggest another number. It is called 9/11. Let me suggest all \nthe hearings we have held in the Intelligence Committee--I call them \n``Oh, my God'' hearings: Oh, my God, how did this happen?--indicated \nthe systemic failure of the global intelligence community in regard to \nWMD and the situation in Iraq--not just the United States, everyone, \nincluding the United Nations.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee and his counterpart, the \nranking member--when he says there is no turf battle, I believe him. I \ndon't know of any two Members who would put turf over conscience and \nturf over performance and the obligations of what they have already \ndone. I know the chairman has mentioned that he and the members and the \nqualified staff of the Appropriations Committee have gone the world \nover, and they have. I know. I have been with them on many occasions, \nlooking at intelligence and looking to see how the money is spent on \nthe ground, taking a hard look. I understand that.\n  But we have 22 staffers, 22 professional staffers who have background \nand experience in regard to being an analyst at the DIA, being an \nanalyst at the CIA with at least 10 years' experience. We have the \nstaffers who put together the 521-page WMD report, where the chips fell \nwhere they may. Guess what happened. The intelligence was wrong. Some \npeople try to put that at the foot of the President. He made very \ndeclarative and aggressive comments. Others in this Congress received \nthe same intelligence and made the same statements. Now, of course, a \nlot of that has changed because it is an even-numbered year, and you \nknow what kind of situation we are in.\n  But I am trying to say your Intelligence Committee stands ready to do \na professional job in regard to budget authority, should we be granted \nthat privilege, with 22 professional staffers. We have done that. There \nhave been occasions where we have been granted access. I don't mean \nthat in a cynical way because the Appropriations Committee usually is \nin a big hurry with what they have to do, meeting obligations that are \nemergencies--where we have made our suggestions. Some of them, not all \nof them--as a matter of fact, not very many of them--were accepted by \nthe Appropriations Committee or, for that matter, the Armed Services \nCommittee. Some of them, a lot of them, ended up on the cutting-room \nfloor.\n\n  In some cases we were not granted access because of the time \nequation, and wouldn't you know that many of the recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission and many of the problems we have experienced that \nnobody wants to see that we have had hearings on are the same kinds of \nthings we have tried to fix in the Intelligence Committee and maybe \ncould have had we not had this fractionalized process that the 9/11 \nCommission has talked about.\n  I have talked about what a hard job this is. I talked about the \ncourage Senator McCain has had to approach this topic. It is a tough \ntopic. Really, this is not hard. Members have a choice. They have a \nchoice to make. A vote for the McCain amendment enhances the \ncongressional oversight by addressing the findings of the 9/11 \nCommission, period. The amendment will enhance the power, influence, \nand sustained capability of the Senate Intelligence Committee; that is, \nto conduct oversight of this Nation's intelligence activities. It \ncouldn't be any more simple.\n  Members, you should vote for the measure if you want to enhance the \nSenate Intelligence Committee's ability to conduct congressional \noversight as recommended by the 9/11 Commission and, by the way, \nvirtually every other commission that has studied this. So the McCain \namendment is in harmony with the 9/11 Commission's major recommendation \nfor improving congressional oversight and intelligence activities.\n  I am not saying the appropriators or the Armed Services Committee has \ndone anything wrong, egregious, dysfunctional, whatever. They have done \na great job under the circumstances with the setup of the Congress as \nit has been. But we stand ready with 22 professional staffers to do the \njob. I believe we can do the job.\n  I am voting for the McCain amendment. In behalf of our national \nsecurity, I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator McCain has introduced an amendment \nto address the 9/11 Commission's recommendation for the creation of a \ncommittee on intelligence with appropriations powers.\n  I have a great respect for the 9/11 Commission. They are dedicated \nmembers who have the Nation's best interests in heart and mind, and, \nfor the most part, they have done an excellent job. Like the Commission \nmembers, I want our Government to take steps that will help ensure that \nour Nation will never again suffer a catastrophe like 9/11. But, I fail \nto comprehend how giving a legislative committee its own checkbook will \nhelp avoid another such disaster. Legislative committees have their \nplates quite full with evaluating policy. They should not take on the \nheavy lifting of appropriating public monies as well.\n  The fact that the Commission made this recommendation left me \nwondering just how it came up with such a proposal.\n  First, I looked at the Commission's report to see what evidence they \ncited for making this recommendation. I was startled to find that the \nCommission provides no specifics in its report to substantiate or \njustify this revolutionary proposal. The Commission offers no examples, \nno rationales, no justifications, no explanations. In short, the \nCommission provides no evidence that the appropriations process is \nflawed when it comes to intelligence matters. There simply is no \nsubstantive rationale for the need for this kind of drastic \nrecommendation.\n  According to the Commission, this recommendation was garnered from \ninterviews with ``numerous members of Congress from both parties, as \nwell as congressional staff members. . . . We found that \ndissatisfaction with congressional oversight remains widespread.'' But \ncuriously the report never mentions any specific member or any staffer \nby name or position. Who are these phantom critics? Why were they \nespecially qualified to comment? The point is, unspecified \ndissatisfaction from unidentified Members of Congress and unidentified \ncongressional staff offers very little basis for embracing such a \nprecedent-setting proposal.\n  While I do not know who the Commission interviewed to reach this \ndetermination, I do know who they did not interview. They did not speak \nto Senator Stevens, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nand chairman of its Defense Subcommittee. I know they did not talk to \nSenator Inouye, the ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee. Both \nSenators Stevens and Inouye are long experienced legislators and \nappropriators in the field of intelligence. Why weren't they \ninterviewed? Nor did they talk to me, and I am the ranking Democrat on \nthe Appropriations Committee and the former chairman of the committee.\n  Knowing just whom the Commission did and did not interview is \nimportant because of the makeup of the Commission. While undoubtedly \nsincere, well-meaning, and honorable, only 4 of the members of the 10 \nindividuals on the \n9/11 Commission had ever served in Congress, and only 2 of them had \nexperience with the appropriations process.\n\n[[Page S10642]]\n\nThis recommendation, to grant both appropriation and authorization \npowers to a legislative committee, in my judgment reflects this lack of \nexperience. Moreover, it belies a lack of familiarity with the history \nof the appropriations process.\n  This particular recommendation would blur the existing oversight \nprocess which tends to ensure a more thorough examination of \nintelligence matters because of a focus on policy matters which is \nseparate from the focus on budgetary matters. In other words, the \ncommission wants to increase oversight of intelligence matters by \nparadoxically lessening and collapsing oversight on intelligence \noperations.\n  The Commission's recommendation would limit the watchdog duties over \nsecret intelligence functions to a tiny group of Senators, thereby \nfomenting an environment that would probably promote ``group think,'' \nand secrecy. In other words, the Commission wants to end, or, at the \nleast, reduce ``group think'' and incestuous oversight in intelligence \nmatters, but it is making a recommendation that would create an \nenvironment that would likely promote both.\n  Most importantly, the historian in me marvels at the degree to which \nthe Commission's recommendation flies in the face of history. The \ncurrent Appropriations Committee just happens to be the carefully \nconsidered antidote to several past failures of the same sort of \ndecentralized appropriation's fixes which the 9/11 Commission now \nincredibly recommends. There is nothing new or innovative in this \nCommission recommendation. It has been tried before, and it has failed \nmiserably.\n\n  In 1816 the Senate established the Committee on Finance and assigned \nit appropriations responsibilities in an effort to enhance \ncongressional fiscal control. But as the country grew, the problems did \ntoo.\n  The War with Mexico, 1846-1848, for example, caused Federal spending \nto nearly triple, and this dramatic explosion placed great pressures on \nCongress to revamp its appropriations process. In 1850, the Senate \nadopted its first rule governing appropriations. It banned amendments \nfor additional appropriations not previously authorized by law.\n  The Civil War, 1861-1865, as one might expect, vastly expanded and \ncomplicated Federal spending. Congress abruptly learned how the lack of \ncentralized control in the Senate played to the strong advantage of the \nPresident. Congressional control of the power of the purse went out the \nwindow as President Lincoln spent millions of dollars without even \nbothering to secure formal congressional appropriations. He could be \nforgiven because he was trying to hold the union together, but the \nConstitution was circumvented and congressional power of the purse was, \nfor a time, effectively seized.\n  Following the Civil War on March 6, 1867, the Senate established a \nCommittee on Appropriations in an effort to bring unity, authority, \nconformity, and order to the Federal spending process.\n  As soon as the Appropriations Committee was established, however, \nauthorizing committees began a vigorous struggle to regain their lost \nappropriations authority. Several House committees first grabbed \nappropriations authority. Soon, Senate committees were demanding the \nsame. Everybody wanted a piece of the action. What kind of Pandora's \nbox are we opening if we grant appropriations power to the Intelligence \nCommittee? Why not also the Department of Homeland Security? Once the \nbox is opened, the grabbing begins. In the late nineteenth century the \ngrabbing gathered steam even amid stern warnings.\n  Congressman Samuel Randall, D-Pa, the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee at the time, warned that combining authorizing \nand appropriating authorities under one committee's jurisdiction would \nlead to greater Federal spending. ``Experience and observation,'' he \npointed out, ``demonstrate such distribution leads to continually \nincreasing appropriations, and renders it more difficult to keep \nexpenditures within the limits of receipts.'' In other words, blending \nauthority and appropriating leads to deficits.\n  When the Senate debated granting the Committee on the District of \nColumbia the right to make appropriations in 1883, members of the \nAppropriations Committee argued against the move. Pointing out that the \nAppropriations Committee serves as a necessary, coordinating agent with \nthe legislative committees, Senator Beck of Kentucky argued, ``it is \nnot wise legislation to vest any committee with absolute power as to \nthe amount of money necessary to carry those laws into effect. . . . We \nought to have one committee as a check upon another, one guard placed \nupon another, so that no body of men sitting as a committee of Congress \nshould have absolute power over the money of the people.''\n\n  Again, that is another important lesson for us today. The \nAppropriations Committee is a needed, important partner with Congress's \nlegislative committees. When the 9/11 Commission argues for more \nsupervision of intelligence matters, it is bogus to suggest that we \nstart by decreasing oversight.\n  But, in the late 19th century, these members of the Appropriations \nCommittee were ignored. After the DC Committee had sought \nappropriations powers, more and more authorizing committees began \nseeking appropriations authority. Responding to pressure, the Senate \nreturned appropriations authority to most Senate committees. The \nresult, a repetition of all of the past problems. Without central \nauthority, oversight and a central controlling mechanism, Federal \nfinances again fell into disarray. Legislative committees were off \npursuing their own individual agendas. Budget requests were submitted \npiecemeal. The practice known as ``coercive deficiencies,'' wherein \nexecutive agencies went through their year's appropriation within a \nmatter of months, and then appealed to Congress for additional funds to \nget them through the year, again became common. Most importantly, the \ndecentralized system of appropriations was simply not capable of \nmanaging the expenditures of a Federal Government that was growing \nlarge in size and in expense. No one was minding the fiscal store.\n  I would urge any Senator who thinks that giving appropriation power \nto an authorizing committee will help restrain spending or increase \ndiscipline to study Congressional history. Congressman James Tawney, \nthe chairman of the House Appropriations Committee from 1905 to 1911, \nconcluded that ``division of jurisdiction and responsibility in the \nmatter of initiating appropriations has contributed more than any other \nsingle cause to the enormous increase in appropriations during recent \nyears.'' Everyone always wants to get an oar in the water.\n  A number of scholarly studies support Congressman Tawney's \nobservation, including the 1987 study by David Brady and Mark Morgan, \nReforming the Structure of the House Appropriations Process, and the \nbook by Charles Stewart, Budget Reform Politics. These works document \nthat without a central authority to impose overall budgetary discipline \non the legislative committees, accountability all but vanished, and the \npublic's money was spent with abandon.\n\n  World War I, like both the Mexican and Civil Wars, forced the \nCongress to confront the financial mess that decentralized funding had \ncreated, and to establish a supervisory control over the appropriations \nprocess. In 1922, the Senate returned jurisdiction over all \nappropriations measures to the Appropriations Committee. Thus, they \ncreated the system that has now served us well for more than 80 years.\n  Now, the 9/11 Commission proposes to return to the failed system of \nthe past, and I adamantly oppose it. It is a formula for less \naccountability over public funds and for even larger deficits.\n  The lessons of history must not be brushed aside.\n  Most of us probably know the historical truism that those who do not \nremember the past are condemned to repeat it. History really does \nrepeat itself because human nature does not change. In our desire to \ncorrect the reasons for our intelligence failures, let us avoid past \nmistakes. In our understandable desire to improve our intelligence \nsystem following 9/11, at least, we can try to avoid so-called \nsolutions which have a proven track record of disaster.\n  While it also endeavors to preserve its Constitutional purpose and \ntraditions the U.S. Senate has an obligation to adapt to new \nchallenges.\n\n[[Page S10643]]\n\n  I know that Senators Reid and McConnell examined the recommendations \nof the 9/11 Commission with those thoughts in mind. I know that the \nWorking Group they co-chaired has proposed changes that will implement \nmany of the reforms of the 9/11 Commission, while respecting the rights \nof Senators and the institution of the Senate.\n  I cannot say the same about this amendment.\n  Authorization committees and appropriation committees have very \ndifferent mandates, one to oversee policy, the other to oversee \nbudgets. Different authorization and appropriations committees ensure \nchecks and balances and better oversight.\n  The amendment would result in fewer Senators looking into \nintelligence matters. It would eliminate the double punch of oversight \nwith an authorization committee focused on policy matters and the \nAppropriations Committee focused on budget matters.\n  The message of the 9/11 Commission was to increase, not decrease, the \nrole of the Congress in intelligence matters. It asked the Congress to \npursue more vigorous oversight and to ask tougher questions. This \namendment would take us in the opposite direction.\n  I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do not support the McCain amendment to \ngrant appropriation powers, in addition to oversight powers, on \nintelligence matters to the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  I am a member of the Intelligence Committee and I support the effort \nin this resolution to strengthen the oversight capabilities of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee. However, I cannot support this \namendment. Because much of the work done by the Intelligence Committee \nis necessarily done in closed session, it is all the more important to \nhave the checks and balances of additional committees involved in the \nreview and funding decisions concerning intelligence activities. \nIntelligence matters, by their nature, require secrecy. However, \ndemocracy works best with active and open debate. For this reason, it \nis critical that this process, while secret, involve more than a small \nnumber of Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after conversation with the managers, I \nbelieve we have other issues to address. I think everybody is familiar \nwith this issue. If it is agreeable to the managers, perhaps we could \nhave an agreement.\n  How much time does the Senator from Connecticut want?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Five minutes. The Senator from Pennsylvania wants 5 \nminutes; the Senator from Missouri, 5 minutes; and I be allowed 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to be able to speak for a few minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Two minutes?\n  Mr. REID. A few minutes. I will do it as quickly as I can.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Nevada, 5 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I may need 10.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Nevada, 10 minutes, and that followed by \na rollcall vote?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona should be the last speaker?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. Part of that unanimous consent request is that I be \nthe last speaker, for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there would be no amendments in order prior \nto the vote up or down as the sponsor of the amendment wants.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the benefit of Members, Mr. President, would you \nrepeat the terms of the unanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nSenator from Connecticut will have 5 minutes, the Senator from \nPennsylvania will have 5 minutes, the Senator from Missouri will have 5 \nminutes, the Senator from Nevada will have 10 minutes, the Senator from \nArizona will be the concluding speaker with 5 minutes, and there will \nbe no amendments allowed before the final vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Followed by a rollcall vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be a rollcall vote.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the McCain amendment. \nThe McCain amendment is part of the package of legislation Senator \nMcCain and I and others introduced on September 7 to implement all of \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. That is why I am pleased to \nbe a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Governor Kean, Congressman Hamilton, members of the Commission made \nclear to Congress that they had three major and most urgent \nrecommendations. The first was to create a national intelligence \ndirector, the second was to create a National Counterterrorism Center, \nand the third was to reform the way in which Congress oversees \nintelligence.\n  The first two, the national intelligence director and \ncounterterrorism center, we accomplished yesterday in passing the bill \nthat came out of our Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Collins \nand I joked along the way that maybe we got the easier assignment than \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell, who had to deal with Congress's own \ninternal organization. I believe they have done well.\n  I do want to say a few things, and I will have more to say about this \nin a bit.\n  With regard to homeland security, the legislation Senator McCain and \nI introduced embracing the 9/11 Commission said that Congress should \neither establish a new committee with sole jurisdiction over homeland \nsecurity or give that jurisdiction to another existing committee.\n  Senator Reid and Senator McConnell and the working group chose to \ngive that jurisdiction to the Governmental Affairs Committee on which I \nam privileged to serve. At the same time, it is significant to note \nthat it is now going to be called the Committee on Homeland Security \nbut at same time large chunks of the homeland security jurisdiction--\nthe Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration, now part of \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service--have been taken back by the \nother committees. That is the kind of action that encourages those who \nare cynical about this Chamber, and I hope we can try to do better on \nthat.\n  With regard to the oversight of intelligence, the working group made \na significant reform proposal which sponsors have described. But the \nMcCain amendment embraces the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, \nwhich I still respectfully believe is the better course to follow, \nwhich is to combine the expertise of the intelligence community and \ntheir considerable staff in authorizing with the power to appropriate \nand in that sense to make sure that this most critical aspect of the \nwar on terrorism, intelligence, has the most active and informed and \naggressive oversight from Congress.\n  The enormous achievement that the legislation we adopted yesterday \nrepresents in reforming our intelligence and homeland security \napparatus will not fully be realized, or may go astray, unless there is \nthe strongest possible congressional involvement in oversight. I \nbelieve this amendment will provide for that. That is why I rise to \nsupport it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nopposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona for a \nnumber of reasons.\n  First, the Intelligence Committee, with its current responsibilities, \nhas a very heavy workload. I was on the Intelligence Committee for 8 \nyears and chaired the Intelligence Committee in the 104th Congress. It \nis a very time-consuming job. I think it would be unwise to give them \nthe additional burden of deciding appropriations.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee--and I do not make this \nargument on a turf basis--we spend a lot of time making the allocations \namong the 13 subcommittees which we have. We have a budget resolution. \nWe have a specific amount of money and we have to make the allocations.\n  If we have a committee such as the Intelligence Committee not a part \nof\n\n[[Page S10644]]\n\nthe appropriations process, to evaluate intelligence appropriations in \ncontrast to the other appropriations functions, it simply does not give \nthe full picture.\n  We, obviously, never have as much money as the individual members \nwould like to have for their respective subcommittees, but when the \ncommittee makes a decision as to allocations, it is keeping the entire \nbudget in mind. That would be lost if you had the Intelligence \nCommittee with the authority simply to carve out whatever amount of \nmoney they chose without regard to the other appropriations processes.\n  In addition, the experience as detailed by the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, the Senator from Alaska, has been that when \nauthorization and appropriations were combined, there were enormous \nappropriations. At a time of deficits and at a time of large national \ndebt, we ought not create another structure which would add to the \nburden of additional funding.\n  The separateness of an intelligence appropriations subcommittee from \nthe intelligence authorizing committee also lends for more \ncongressional Senate oversight. With all of the work we have to do, \nthere is insufficient time to give appropriate oversight to the \nintelligence functions. A separate appropriations subcommittee would \nhave an opportunity to add to that oversight and would have an \nopportunity to add as a check and balance to what the authorizers may \ndo.\n  We are proposing some very far-reaching changes here. I believe the \nresolution is a sound one in that it strengthens the hand of the \nintelligence authorizing committee by taking away term limits so the \nmembers of that committee will develop real expertise. But we should \nnot abandon the traditional division of responsibility between \nauthorizers and appropriators.\n  I have great respect for what the Senator from Arizona seeks to do. \nHe has made very cogent critiques of the Appropriations Committee from \ntime to time when the Appropriations Committee seeks to take on the \nauthorizing role. There are not supposed to be authorizations on the \nappropriations bill.\n  We know, as a practical matter, that happens on occasion. Really, it \nhappens with excessive frequency. But just as the separateness ought to \nbe maintained with appropriators not authorizing; so, too, the \nseparators ought to be made with authorizers not appropriating.\n  It is for these reasons that I oppose the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain \namendment.\n  I joined the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence knowing full \nwell that our system needed reform. Since that time, I have worked very \nhard with our distinguished chairman and members on both sides to try \nto bring about real reform that will enhance our Nation's ability to \nfight the war on terror by assuring we have the most accurate, \nactionable, and timely intelligence available.\n  I applaud the provisions of the Collins-Lieberman bill, and commend \nmy colleagues for coming together on that important piece of \nlegislation. It is now time, however, for Congress to get into the \nreally difficult battle; that is, reorganizing and reforming ourselves. \nThat is necessary so long as such reform makes sense. The 9/11 \nCommission concluded:\n  The House and Senate intelligence committees lack the power, \ninfluence and sustained capability to meet the challenge of overseeing \nthe United States intelligence community, and executive branch reform \nwill not work if congressional oversight does not change too.\n  That doesn't mean that a commission to investigate the facts and \ncircumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \nshould become the only basis for intelligence reform and we must adopt \nevery recommendation. We have spent a good bit of time in this body--I \nhave personally and I know my other members on the Intelligence \nCommittee have worked on these issues far longer than the 9/11 \nCommission worked on them. I know from my experience on the \nAppropriations Committee how important that responsibility is, and I \ndaresay that those of us on the Appropriations Committee have lots of \nexperience on how the appropriations process works.\n\n  I feel very strongly in the case of this amendment and the \nCommissions's recommendation to combine authorization and \nappropriations powers that we need to reject it.\n  A longstanding lesson in the Congress that we have observed, I think \nwisely, is that it is inefficient and undesirable to mix policy \nlegislation with appropriations legislation. Appropriations are \nrequired on a timely basis to keep the Government operating with as \nlittle disruption as possible, particularly funds for the intelligence \ncommunity which are paramount to the day-to-day operations in \ncontinuity of our national security. It should not get stalled or held \nup as a result of potential policy disagreements.\n  Every year on the appropriations bills which we process, we work hard \nto get the appropriations out on time and try to focus on those issues \nthat need to be resolved in appropriating.\n  Combining this legislation with appropriations can result in \nundesirable situations such as a rush job on policy deliberations in \norder to meet fiscal year deadlines, and thus potentially shortchanging \nthe policy changes we need to make as a result of our oversight, or \ndelays in appropriations, thus disrupting Government operations as we \nget involved in controversial policy debates.\n  The longstanding lesson and separation has been institutionalized in \nrules for both the House and Senate. Over the years, various attempts \nhave been made in history to mix policy and appropriations functions \ninto a single committee. In the past, this has been judged as \nundesirable.\n  If we want to get rid of the Appropriations Committees and spread \nappropriations throughout all the authorizing committees, that is a \nlong and much more extended debate than we are having here. I do not \nthink we can or should single out intelligence and say in intelligence \nalone they will have the appropriations functions along with the \nauthorizing functions.\n  Congress already has a mixed policy budget oversight model adopted in \nthe 1980s for intelligence, the past legislation that provides the \nIntelligence Committees with powerful control over the budget. Section \n504 says no funds may be obligated unless authorized, and over time the \nIntelligence Committee began to authorize at the level of detail of \nappropriations.\n  I was very happy to support our chairman's position in Collins-\nLieberman that protects our jurisdiction and enhances the power of the \nIntelligence Committee. The Intelligence Committee as an authorizing \ncommittee ought to have greater powers. The need to authorize funding \nat the detailed budgetary levels would compel the Intelligence \nCommittee to behave like an Appropriations Committee.\n  I am familiar with how they work. It is better that the Intelligence \nCommittee not get into this field. It is undesirable if our intent is \nto make our Intelligence Committee more effective. The Senate \nIntelligence Committee potentially becomes dominated and consumed by \nbudget review and arguing over specific appropriations items.\n  The question we have before the Senate is, should Congress \nreorganize. That would be a bad idea. We heard, as the Senator from \nPennsylvania has discussed, objections to legislating on an \nappropriations bill. I object to appropriating on an authorizing bill. \nI hope my colleagues support that point of view.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend leaves, we have served together for many \nyears. We do things in that committee that are so important for the \nState of Nevada. We authorize programs dealing with flood control, \nwhich Nevada has tremendous problems with, with the growth taking \nplace. We do things there to help flood control in Las Vegas and the \nAppropriations Committee will not give us the money we feel we need.\n  Superfund is a program I believe in, but we authorize things in that \ncommittee and the Appropriations Committee lets us down almost every \ntime. We do it with the Corps of Engineers. We do it with the \nendangered species.\n  I say, why shouldn't we have the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee do their own appropriating?\n\n[[Page S10645]]\n\nThen we would not have to worry about Las Vegas flooding. We would take \ncare of it. I would go each year as quickly as I could to get the first \nbill passed and get all the money so there is none left for the rest of \nthe committees.\n  The fact is programs that are within that jurisdiction--FEMA is an \nexample--these are programs that are essential. I get upset at the \nAppropriations Committee, even though I am a member, for not getting \nmoney to the things I support, as someone who has been chairman of that \ncommittee on two separate occasions.\n  I know the good intentions of my friend from Arizona. He and I came \nto the House together. We came to the Senate together. I never like to \nget involved in a legislative battle with Senator McCain because of his \npassion with legislative battles and life in general. The fact is, even \nthough I don't like to get involved, and I rarely do, he is wrong this \ntime. He is wrong.\n\n  What would happen if this amendment is passed? There would be more \nsecrecy. There would be too much power consolidated, as the former \nchairman who served on the committee 10 years, Bob Graham, has said. He \nhas served as chairman and wrote a book on the Intelligence Committee. \nHe said it would be the wrong thing to do. It would reduce the number \nof people and staff looking at the critical matters.\n  The appropriations and authorization process has been separate for \n170 years. Why? This is not by accident. It is because there has to be \nsome control, ultimately, of money. That is why we do not allow Senator \nReid of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Reid and \nothers who serve on authorizing committees to have a free hand in the \nmoney.\n  Now, the authorizers look at matters of policy. That is the way it \nshould be. The appropriators are spending the people's money the way \nthe law states.\n  The solution we have come up with is a better solution that \nstrengthens the Intelligence Committee and creates a new intelligence \nappropriations subcommittee.\n  Governor Kean, the cochair of the\n9/11 Commission, said:\n\n       I think [an intelligence appropriations subcommittee] would \n     be very much in my mind within the spirit of our \n     recommendations.\n\n  I know my friend from Arizona wrote a letter saying this is fine, \nmaybe, but what we want is better. I don't want to get in a nitpicking \n``he said, they said,'' but I am reading from page 421 of the 9/11 \nCommission:\n\n       We also recommend that the intelligence committee should \n     have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, \n     freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the \n     budget.\n\n  I don't know if it was an oversight, but I wrote a book once and they \nsent it to an editor, someone who worked at the University of Texas. \nShe was a professional editor. This is my book, a history book, and she \ncame back with all of the contradictions that I had made myself right \nin my book. I was so stunned how good she was.\n  Whoever was doing the editing of this report made a mistake, because \nyou cannot have it both ways. You cannot have limited budget authority \nand have them do the appropriation and the authorizing all at one time.\n  This is something that is very important. Senator McCain is wrong. It \nwould not be hard, for example, to find someone to serve on the \nIntelligence Committee. He said we cannot find people to serve on the \nIntelligence Committee and this will make it worse.\n  Walk through those doors and through another set of doors and you \nwind up in Senator Daschle's office. The most sought-after committee by \nDemocrats in the Senate is the Intelligence Committee. There is a long \nline of people wanting to serve on that committee. Why? Because it \ndeals with the most important aspects of what goes on in this country. \nIt deals with the intelligence aspects of our Federal Government. They \ndeal with what no one else deals with. Senator Roberts and Senator \nRockefeller have done a wonderful job with very few tools to do it \nwith. What we did yesterday and what we are doing here today is \ncreating an Intelligence Committee that has the tools to do work that \nthey have done in a very difficult way. We are giving the Intelligence \nCommittee superpower authority.\n\n  I suggest to my friend Senator McCain, it is going to be easy to find \npeople to serve on this committee. It has been easy in the past and it \nwill be easier now because the committee is better than ever.\n  He describes the lack of oversight in the current intelligence \nprocess, but his process is to give only a handful of Senators \nunprecedented power. We propose more checks and balances. That is what \nwe need--more, not less.\n  This amendment is an amendment that is offered in good faith. I know \nmy friend from Arizona feels he is doing the right thing, but it is the \nwrong thing to do. It would be bad; it would consolidate power. This is \nexactly what we do not need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada, and \nespecially I thank Senator Roberts who brings great expertise to this \nissue, given his position as chairman of the Committee on Intelligence.\n  I mention again the families and the Commission fully support this \namendment. I have no doubt when we take this vote, my friends, that the \nCommission unanimously, and the families of September 11 support this \namendment.\n  I will quote from Jim Thompson, former Governor of Illinois, a member \nof the Commission, who says:\n\n     . . . I urge the Senate to make the Commission's \n     recommendations for Congressional reform as high a priority \n     as it made our other recommendations. The congressional \n     reforms are important and necessary.\n\n  That is why the Commission was unanimously strongly recommending a \nnew committee structure combining authorizing and appropriating \nauthority in a simplified and functional Homeland Security committee \nstructure.\n  Mr. Richard Ben-Veniste:\n\n       I urge the Senate to make the Commission's recommendations \n     for Congressional reform as high a priority as it made our \n     other recommendations.\n\n  The Commission strongly recommended new committee structure combining \nauthorizing and appropriating authority in a simplified and functional \nHomeland Security committee structure.\n  There is no doubt how the Commission stands or how the families \nstand. What this is all about is contained on page 419 of the 9/11 \nCommission report, the bestselling report:\n\n       Of all our recommendations--\n\n  ``Of all our recommendations''--\n\n     strengthening congressional oversight may be among the most \n     difficult and important. So long as oversight is governed by \n     current congressional rules and resolutions, we believe the \n     American people will not get the security they want and need.\n\n  This is really what this amendment is all about.\n\n     . . . the American people will not get the security they want \n     and need.\n\n  So we are not talking about a turf battle here. We are not talking \nabout who is going to do what and who is going to have the power of the \npurse. We are talking about the security that the American people want \nand need, according to the 9/11 Commission.\n  Mr. President, I am a bit of a realist. I think it is going to be \nvery difficult to win this vote. ``Intense pressure'' has been put on \nMembers of the Senate as well as members of the Commission.\n  I thank the members of the Commission who have stood up to that \npressure, but I have no doubt that if this amendment goes down, we will \nperform two-thirds of our duties, and one-third, which, as the \nCommission pointed out, is the most difficult and most important, we \nwill have failed that. And that is congressional oversight. That is \nreally what this vote is all about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote will now be \nheld on the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nChambliss) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n\n[[Page S10646]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 23, nays 74, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 200 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--23\n\n     Alexander\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Cantwell\n     Collins\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (SC)\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Snowe\n     Sununu\n     Voinovich\n\n                                NAYS--74\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Chambliss\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n  The amendment (No. 3999) was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think it may be important that we pause \nfor a minute and figure out what we have done. I would like to have a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Maine. We are now at a position where we \nare supposed to be consolidating authority in the homeland security \ncommittee. In fact, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky said last \nnight:\n\n       The most sweeping change we recommend is to consolidate \n     congressional jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland \n     Security. If you don't think this is major reform, ask the \n     roughly 25 Senate committee or subcommittee chairmen who \n     currently have jurisdiction over Homeland Security agencies \n     or programs.\n\n  Truth in advertising: The homeland security committee has 38 percent \nof the Department's budget and 8 percent of the Department's employees. \nThat is the great consolidation. Why don't we just stop, why don't we \ncall it a night and say the heck with this farce. This is crazy. This \nis stupid.\n  The amendment I am about to propose does, what? Something shocking. \nIt takes the Transportation Security Administration, which is the heart \nand soul of homeland security, and moves it to, guess what. The \nhomeland security committee from the committee on which I have been \nproud to serve for 18 years.\n  Guess where the Coast Guard remains. The Coast Guard remains, guess \nwhere. In the Commerce Committee. This is a joke. This is a joke, I say \nto my dear friends.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, can this Senator be part \nof that colloquy?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if we are going to create jurisdiction in \none committee for homeland security, let's do it. Let's not pretend \nthat we are doing it. Let's not do it in name only. As a result of the \nproposal put before the Senate with its exclusions and the amendment \nadopted this morning, as the Senator from Arizona indicated, the \nhomeland security committee would have exclusive jurisdiction over less \nthan 38 percent of the Department's budget.\n  It would have exclusive jurisdiction over fewer than 8 percent of the \nDepartment's employees. That is 13,000 employees out of 175,000 \nemployees. There are more amendments filed that would take still more \nagencies away from the committee's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, it is my \nmemory, if my memory serves me correctly, after 9/11, the first major \nstep that we took was the creation of what agency? The Transportation \nSecurity Administration? Is that true?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So what are we doing with the TSA, may I ask the Senator \nfrom Maine? Are we moving it into her committee so she has jurisdiction \nover it?\n  Ms. COLLINS. No.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Ah, I can hardly believe that. I mean, after all, that is \nwhat homeland security is really all about, I thought.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The fact is that Congress has held 312 hearings over the \npast 2 years on homeland security. The Department has conducted 2,200 \nbriefings. There are 25 Senate committees and subcommittees with \njurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security. This is an \nintolerable situation for the Department. It is why the Department and \nthe President are pleading with us to consolidate all of the Department \nunder one authorizing committee.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, if \nSecretary Ridge or Deputy Secretary Hutchinson had to testify before \nCongress as far as the activities of the TSA, to whom would they \ntestify?\n  Ms. COLLINS. They would testify all over. They testified before 88--\n--\n  Mr. McCAIN. But what about now?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Well, that is a good question. I have had hearings. \nOther hearings have been held. Twenty-five Senate committees and \nsubcommittees have a claim over DHS. It is why Secretary Ridge called \nup in desperation and said: Please give us some relief from this. This \nis intolerable. We are supposed to be running the Department. Instead, \nwe are constantly testifying.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield to me on that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have a chart of the Department of Homeland Security \nsummary of appropriations, and it shows the total amount is \n$38,840,000,000. The two items that are not in that jurisdiction that \nwould come out total $11 billion. The total amount the homeland \nsecurity committee will have is $22,945,000,000.\n  Now, Mr. Ridge appeared before the Commerce Committee under the \nchairmanship of the Senator from Arizona only twice.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Secretary Ridge----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am reliably informed the reason it went to the \nCommerce Committee in the first place was the Senator from Arizona \nwrote a memorandum for the Parliamentarian saying that is where it \nshould be, in the Commerce Committee, because we have jurisdiction over \nall the means of transportation and all of the entities TSA deals with.\n  Now, the Senator's committee--I am a member of that committee--will \nnot have jurisdiction over railroads, trains, buses, boats, all of the \nentities that TSA affects. TSA has moved into the facilities owned by \nthose entities. They have not built their own buildings; they have \nmoved into those occupied by the airlines, buses, wherever. The \nconflict we have to resolve is between TSA and entities that provide \nthe transportation.\n\n  Now, if we are going to have a consolidation of jurisdiction, that is \nwhy we have done this, that is why the Senator from Arizona wrote the \nmemorandum in the first place, because we have the jurisdiction over \nthe means of transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Alaska is probably correct that I \nasserted jurisdiction over transportation at the time that TSA was \ncreated. That was before the 9/11 Commission was formed and made their \nrecommendations and their decision was made. At least we told the \nAmerican people that we would give those responsibilities to that \ncommittee.\n  Now, maybe Ridge only testified before us twice; Hutchinson, many \ntimes. There were a multitude of hearings where we called upon TSA, \nexercising our oversight responsibilities, to provide us with \ninformation, briefings, and hearings.\n  The TSA belongs under homeland security, I say to the Senator from \nAlaska, whether they go by bicycle,\n\n[[Page S10647]]\n\nskateboard, or bus. The fact is that this is a joke when we leave the \nheart and soul of homeland security in the Commerce Committee, of which \nI am proud, and I know, according to the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission, must be consolidated.\n  I do not know what budget the Senator is looking at, but the facts \nthat the Senator from Maine and I have is that it is 38 percent of the \nhomeland security budget and 8 percent of the Department's employees.\n  My response is, fine, if the Senator from Alaska feels that it \nbelongs in the Commerce Committee, he is entitled to that opinion. Let \nus just not tell people we are consolidating. Let us tell them the \ntruth. Let us tell them it is business as usual in the Senate, as the \nlast vote just proved. It is business as usual, and let us not waste \nthe time of our colleagues and try to fool the American people that \nsomehow we are making any significant changes when as it stands 8 \npercent of the Department's employees fall under the committee on \nhomeland security and 38 percent of the budget.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I asked the Senator from Maine a question. I have not \nreceived a response. I am not a part of this dialog. I will make my \nstatement later. I really take offense at the attitude of the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator usually does.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let's keep the personalties out of it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Alaska asked to join in the colloquy and \nhe was welcome to join the colloquy. If he chooses not to stay in the \ncolloquy, then please do not remain in the colloquy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do not shout as loud as the Senator from Arizona and \nthen interrupt people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is welcome to join in the colloquy. I thought \nthe colloquy was an exchange of views, ideas, and thoughts. I certainly \nwould look forward to engaging in any colloquy with the Senator from \nAlaska. I have the greatest respect for him and the power and authority \nthat we just saw exercised in the last vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to clarify the issue. It is not \njust TSA and the homeland security functions of the Coast Guard that \nare not transferred to the new homeland security committee. It is the \nimmigration functions of the bureaus of Customs and Border Protection, \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Citizenship and \nImmigration Services stay now in the Judiciary Committee. Certain \nfunctions of the bureaus of Customs and Border Protection and \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement stay in Finance. So I think if we \nadd in all of the exclusions, then we get to the percentages that I \nquoted.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, my point is this: Are we going to do this or \nnot? If we are not going to consolidate all of the functions of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security under one authorizing committee, as \nthey are under one appropriations subcommittee, appropriately so, then \nlet us not pretend that we are.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the view of the Senator as to the primary role of \nthe U.S. Coast Guard today?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The primary role of the Coast Guard today is port \nsecurity. It has in some ways taken away from its many other important \nfunctions in fisheries enforcement and regulation, for example.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Under this proposal that we are contemplating, where does \nthe Coast Guard remain?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Coast Guard would remain in the Commerce Committee.\n  The point is this: The administration has called for this \nconsolidation. Let us either do it or not do it, but let us not pretend \nwe are doing it by changing the name of a committee but only \ntransferring to its exclusive jurisdiction 38 percent of the budget and \n8 percent of the people.\n  If some of the pending amendments are approved, such as one to no \nlonger have the Secret Service transferred, then we are just going to \nend up with jurisdiction over Tom Ridge's personal staff. That is about \nwhat is going to be left.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, I would \nlike to mention as part of this colloquy a recommendation of the 9/11 \nCommission: Congress should create a single principal point of \noversight and review for homeland security. Congressional leaders are \nbest able to judge what committee should have jurisdiction over the \nDepartment's duties, but we believe that Congress does have the \nobligation to choose one in the House and one in the Senate.\n  Now, is it true that under an amendment that has just been adopted by \nvoice vote earlier, more responsibilities have been taken from the \nSenator's committee?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is correct. The underlying resolution as \namended this morning now leaves the vast majority of the homeland \nsecurity jurisdiction in committees other than in the new homeland \nsecurity committee. I think that is a mistake. I think, if we are going \nto take that route, then we have not done the consolidation that the \nadministration has called for.\n  Perhaps that is the will of this body. I understand these issues are \ndifficult, that committees think they have a special relationship with \nthese agencies. But let's not pretend we are consolidating agencies to \nparallel the consolidation that we undertook when we created the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from Maine, I am sure she is aware but \nI think our colleagues should know, that the legislation creating the \nTransportation Security Administration, under the title ``Functions,'' \nreads:\n\n       The Under Secretary shall be responsible for security in \n     all modes of transportation including carrying out chapter \n     449 relating to civil aviation security, related research and \n     development activities, security responsibilities over other \n     modes of transportation, be responsible for day-to-day \n     Federal security screen operations, for passenger air \n     transportation, interstate transportation. . . .\n\n  It goes on and on. It is all security. That is the job of the \nTransportation Security Administration. That is one of the reasons why \nit is so named.\n  So rather than take the Transportation Security Administration and \nput it under the committee on homeland security and governmental \naffairs, we leave it in the Commerce Committee.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is correct. That is the effect of the \nunderlying resolution.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4000 To Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I perhaps foolishly have an amendment at \nthe desk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object. What was the request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No, I didn't make a request. I said I have an amendment \nat the desk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection setting aside the pending \namendment?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I still don't understand. Is the Senator now calling up \nthe amendment on Commerce?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the present time, yes.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4000 to amendment No. 3981.)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that the Committee has jurisdiction over the \n                Transportation Security Administration)\n\n       On page 2, beginning in line 13, strike ``to the \n     Transportation Security Administration,''.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I pretty well described this amendment just as we were \ndiscussing in this colloquy. Basically, it moves the Transportation \nSecurity Administration from the Commerce Committee to the new \ncommittee on homeland security and governmental affairs. I pretty well \ndescribed it. I think it is clear, given the responsibilities of the \nTransportation Security Administration which I read a few minutes ago. \nThey all have to do with transportation security. Obviously, homeland\n\n[[Page S10648]]\n\nsecurity is the appropriate place for it to be.\n  I ask consideration of the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an important amendment for the \nSenate. I hope Members will listen because the Transportation Security \nAgency is the one that manages basically the entities at the airports, \nthe bus stations, wherever they may be where people enter into forms of \ntransportation.\n  All of those transportation means are under the jurisdiction of \nCommerce. I don't know about the rest of you, but I went to Nome one \ntime and I found the Transportation Security Administration had moved \ninto the Alaska Airlines terminal, owned by that airline, and said: \nMove out of the way. We have to put in these security devices. And they \ndid that. They built a wall through that terminal and they proceeded to \ntake it over.\n  I have had more complaints about the Transportation Security \nAdministration than I have any other entity since I have been in the \nSenate because of the way they impact the traveling public.\n  I remind the Senate, there is a provision in the bill that authorized \nthe Transportation Security Agency to transition to private enterprise \nwhen the time came that private enterprise could handle it. This is not \na permanent Government entity. We sincerely believe that those involved \nin the transportation mechanisms should transition to the point where \nthey, working with private enterprise, provide these functions. Right \nnow these are temporary functions. We have provided Government \nemployees to do it temporarily, not permanently. So this whole premise \nis that it should go over to the Governmental Affairs Committee--on \nwhich I am proud to serve and was once chairman--and they should \noversee this entity, which we in Commerce want to see transition to \nbecome a part of the systems of transportation and not something \nmaintained by Government forever.\n  This is not something that really ought to be done this way at all. I \ndo not disagree with the Senator from Maine. There are a substantial \nnumber of entities that are under the jurisdiction of various \ncommittees that should come to the governmental affairs and homeland \nsecurity committee, as it is now to be renamed. But in terms of that \ntransition, those things do not impact the overall commerce of the \nUnited States the way this one does.\n  The Coast Guard, by the way--the Coast Guard's primary mission is not \nport security. It is to maintain the jurisdiction in the United States \nin peacetime over the waters that are essential to our commerce and in \nwartime to become part of the Department of Defense.\n  What sense does it make to split it up? By the way, a portion of the \nCoast Guard is already under Homeland Security. It is already there. We \nagreed to it in the bill that created the Homeland Security Department. \nThis takes the rest of it, the part that deals with fishing, that deals \nwith boat inspection, that deals with the various aspects of using the \nCoast Guard around the world as it did off Iraq when it had the job of \nhandling interdicting shipping that violated the sanctions against Iraq \nimporting certain goods. That was done by the Coast Guard. This isn't \nhomeland security, either.\n  Its primary function up my way is to patrol the fisheries, to \nmaintain the maritime border. That has nothing to do with the security \nof the United States. It has to do with the protection of the basic \nresources of our oceans.\n\n  If anyone has worked with the Coast Guard, they know they are part of \nthe drug interdiction job. Maybe DEA ought to be transferred to \nhomeland security. I am not sure. But it is certainly not the kind of \nthing we are talking about now.\n  The Coast Guard has missions beyond ports. It has waterways, coastal \nsecurity, drug interdiction, migrant interdiction, defense readiness, \nmaritime safety, search and rescue. Search and rescue is absolutely \nessential to our State, to have the Coast Guard deal with those souls \nwho are at sea, in danger. They do a marvelous job. They do \nenvironmental protection. What does environmental protection have to do \nwith homeland security? That is a different matter--oil spills, \ncontamination of the water, ice protections, and whether we can have \ntransit of the vessels that are capable of going through ice. We now \nhave a considerable number of icebreakers up our way. That is what they \ndeal with.\n  There is an enormous number of categories that have nothing to do \nwith homeland security and those that deal with homeland security we \nalready transferred to homeland security. The idea the Coast Guard is \ntaking now, the rest of it--the amendment would say, take the rest of \nit and put it over there. I don't know if it is in this one, but that \nis the proposal, as I understand it.\n  Admiral Collins, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, when asked about \nthe future asset acquisition of the Commerce Committee this last April, \nstated:\n\n       To enhanced mission performance, The Coast Guard must \n     optimize its unique authorities and capabilities, \n     accomplishing partnerships while gaining capacity it needs to \n     complete the full range of our missions. New assets will be \n     used to conduct fishery patrols, search and rescue cases, as \n     well as protecting the Nation against terrorist attacks.\n\n  We have no problem putting the terrorist activities in. They are \nalready in Homeland Security. You don't need this process to go through \nto split that jurisdiction up again.\n  The problem right now is that Commerce Committee, having jurisdiction \nover all forms of transportation, would be faced with the problem of \nhow to deal with this Transportation Security Agency. I think the \ncommittee under the chairmanship of the Senator from Arizona has a \ngreat record in dealing with this. As a matter of fact, they approved \nnine bills this year alone related to transportation security in this \nCongress and none of them dealt with security. One did--the Aviation \nSecurity Improvement Act was enhancement of security with regard to \nairlines themselves.\n  I think if one examines the record of this Commerce Committee, it has \nconducted its jurisdiction under the Senator from Arizona. I look \nforward to continuing that as chairman in the next Congress.\n  I want to give my friend from Hawaii time to speak on this.\n  With regard to the nominations on the TSA and Coast Guard, they have \nbeen done in record time in Commerce. As compared to the rest of the \nCongress, nominations before our committee are expedited, and \nnecessarily so. The impact of this matter obviously is that the \nconfirmations of the Coast Guard will be taken over to homeland \nsecurity. Those Coast Guard people do a lot more than just port \nsecurity.\n  I am getting redundant.\n  But the difficulty with this is the transportation infrastructure \nitself should not be broken up. We should aim for the goal that this \nproblem which is handled by TSA will be taken over by private \nenterprise. It should be. We envisioned that at the time we passed the \noriginal bill.\n  We have jurisdiction, as I said, over aircraft, rail, and highways. \nThere is no question when we look at it that putting those concepts \nthat affect our livelihoods right now and dragging them down is the \nconsiderable impact of TSA on their operations--not only on this \noperation as passengers, but the whole spectrum of the relationship \nwith TSA to the transportation entities, I think, needs to be \nconsidered.\n  The McCain amendment would transfer jurisdiction over there to the \nhomeland security and governmental affairs agency.\n  We had a hearing this morning about the plight of the airline \nindustry. There is no industry that has been affected as much by TSA as \nthe airline industry. TSA is examining how to counter the threat posed \nby shoulder-launched missiles. The FAA has that jurisdiction.\n  We have jurisdiction in Commerce over the FAA. Why should we transfer \nto Governmental Affairs the jurisdiction over an entity that is dealing \nwith this type of equipment? They also have jurisdiction ultimately \nover some of the aspects of the transportation mechanisms themselves--\ndesign of airplanes, design of buses, design of trucks, cars; the whole \nthing. I believe all of that ought to stay where it is, with Commerce.\n  The FAA currently governs baggage weight and rules for lost and \ndamaged\n\n[[Page S10649]]\n\nbaggage. TSA only deals with baggage security. We are going to take \nbaggage security and put a whole entity over there when the problem is \nthe problem of the industry which has the responsibility legally for \nthe baggage no matter who handles it. I think this is absolutely wrong.\n  Currently, the airline industry pays $14 billion in user fees, \naccording to the air transportation testimony. Those fees have to be \nreduced. The only way to reduce them is to get TSA's function into the \nhands of private enterprise related to the entity they serve--not the \nwhole transportation system but the system they are working with. TSA \nis designed almost as a ``one size fits all'' for everything. That \nshould not be. We should have a security system that is related to the \nresponsibility of those providing the transportation and let the users \nof that transportation pay for it and not the taxpayers. This is where \nin the long run we are going to go, and I believe it is the right thing \nto do.\n\n  I cannot believe we should have two committees dealing with the \nairline industry. Governmental Affairs has no competence in this area \nin terms of the impact of entities like TSA on the airline industry. We \ndo. We assert it in the committee under the chairmanship of the Senator \nfrom Arizona. It has been a good relationship. I believe it should be \ncontinued.\n  I have talked a little bit about the Coast Guard. I don't think that \nis covered by this amendment. The current amendment covers only \nCommerce, as I understand it. Is that correct? I have not seen the \namendment yet. Parliamentary inquiry: Does this amendment currently \nonly apply to the Commerce Department? Is it under TSA and the Commerce \nCommittee jurisdiction?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It only applies to TSA.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Does the Senator from Hawaii wish to be recognized?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I don't want to take a lot of time. I \nwonder if we could get an agreement that perhaps Senator Inouye be \nrecognized for--how much time would he need?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Twenty minutes; followed by Senator Lieberman for 5 \nminutes; Senator Lott for 5 minutes; whatever time Senator Stevens \nwould need; and then 5 minutes for me to wrap up, followed by a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't know whether I will use any time, \nbut I would like to be included to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for that agreement.\n  How much time does the Senator from Alaska need? Five minutes as \nwell.\n  Let me repeat: I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Hawaii \nbe allowed 20 minutes; the Senator from Connecticut 5 minutes; the \nSenator from Mississippi 5 minutes; the Senator from Alaska 5 minutes; \nif needed, the Senator from Nevada 5 minutes; and the Senator from \nArizona for 5 minutes, followed by a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the request be \nmodified: that there be no amendments in order prior to final passage \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from Alaska in \nopposition to this amendment to transfer jurisdiction over the TSA to \nthe soon-to-be renamed Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  As noted by Senator Stevens, this amendment would effectively strip \nthe Commerce Committee of its ability to oversee and coordinate the \nsafety and security needs of our Nation's transportation system. To \nconsider security in a vacuum, without understanding the impacts of \nsecurity policy on the safety and operations of the mode of \ntransportation, could give rise to unrealistic, contradictory, and \ncounterproductive policies.\n  The McCain amendment would sever issues and responsibilities that \nhave enabled the Commerce Committee to craft and enact two of the most \nsignificant transportation security measures this body has adopted \nsince the 9/11, 2001 attack on our Nation.\n  The Aviation and Transportation Security Act created the TSA, the \nTransportation Security Administration, mandated the Federal takeover \nof aviation security functions, and created a fee to pay for the new \nresponsibilities.\n  The Maritime Transportation Security Act created a new regime for \nmaritime security within the TSA and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  The Commerce Committee also successfully completed a conference with \nthe House earlier this year on a second port security bill, the Coast \nGuard and Maritime Security Act.\n  These efforts were successful because of the Commerce Committee's \nunderstanding of the transportation industry, and the integral link \nbetween security, safety, and operations.\n  The committee has worked for more than a decade to improve \ntransportation security and has had to deal with the inertia of the \nFederal Government as well as fight entrenched interests to change the \nway we secure the transportation system.\n  As far back as 1996, attempts were made to transfer security \nfunctions from the airlines to the Federal Government. Similarly, the \nport security act was initiated prior to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. \nThe 9/11 attacks created sufficient public pressure to fundamentally \nchange the way the Federal Government secured our aviation system and \nthe ports.\n  The problems we are having in improving security are not the result \nof an outdated committee system; they are the result of ``growing \npains'' of a newly created department with insufficient resources to \nfulfill its responsibilities.\n  The 9/11 Commission made many recommendations. However, the \nrecommendations with respect to the transportation sector were very \ngeneral, with no specifics. An effective approach would require taking \noperational needs of transportation systems, the funding streams for \nthese systems, the economics of the industries, and the safety \nregulatory framework that is so crucial to protecting our citizens.\n\n  In setting transportation security policy, all of these aspects come \ninto play: safety regulations imposed by the Department of \nTransportation, safety regulations and recommendations by the National \nTransportation Safety Board, and the need to efficiently move \npassengers and cargo.\n  For example, the Commerce Committee developed legislation to \nstrengthen cockpit doors based on its jurisdictional aviation funding \nprograms, the FAA's certification approval process, and aviation system \nsafety. We had working knowledge of aircraft structure and the carrier \nmaintenance schedules.\n  The Commerce Committee was able to develop funding streams for the \ninstallation of another explosive detection system because of the \ncommittee's jurisdiction over airport funding programs and the use of \nthe airport and airways trust fund.\n  Similarly, the authorization for pilots to carry guns required an \nunderstanding of a wide variety of issues, including structural \nintegrity of the aircraft, training programs, and the pilot licensing \nprocess.\n  For example, if you left it up to a gun merchant or gun expert, he \nmight say, give the pilots a .45. If you fired a .45 in one of those \naircraft, it will blow the plane apart under the pressure of the \natmosphere. So we have some sort of background and knowledge about \naircraft structure. So the pilots would be carrying a smaller caliber \npistol, something that will not put the aircraft into an explosive \nposition.\n  You cannot separate safety considerations, security considerations, \nand the operational theory. Keep in mind that when we passed the \nAirport Security Act, we initiated a user fee system, a system where \nthe beneficiaries, if you want to call them that, the airlines, pay a \nfee for the metal detectors, pay a fee for the x ray machines, pay a \nfee for the personnel. They have been paying $14 million per year.\n  If you separate this function to another organization that will have \nno knowledge about the economics involved in the airlines, not \nrealizing that the airlines are now on the verge of bankruptcy, who \nknows, we may really put them out of business. And the major mission of \nour airlines is to\n\n[[Page S10650]]\n\ncarry passengers, to carry on the mobility of the citizens of the \nUnited States.\n  Transportation security decisions cannot be separated from the safety \nand operational concerns. The Senate leadership, tasked with the \nmission of developing a reorganization plan, recognized this vital \nlink. That is why the leadership amendment keeps matters relating to \nthe Coast Guard and the transportation security within the jurisdiction \nof the Commerce Committee.\n  Even the Department of Homeland Security recognizes that security \ndecisions can have safety and operational ramifications. This link is \nembodied in a recent memorandum of understanding between the Department \nof Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation.\n  Transportation security and safety are so intertwined that separating \nthem, as the McCain amendment would do, could do harm rather than \nbenefit our transportation system.\n  After we created the Transportation Security Administration, long \nbefore we had a Department of Homeland Security, the President put in \ncharge a tough law enforcement official who knew little about \ntransportation. He did not last long because he knew only one side of \nthe equation. He was succeeded by Admiral Loy who understood not only \nthe balance between safety and security but the need to support \npolicies and positions to maintain our safety needs while meeting our \nsecurity challenges.\n  Those tasked with the responsibilities of securing our transportation \nsystem must take into account the intricacy of the operations of the \nsystem, from safety standards to mock in place realities. The two \ncannot be separated. Without such context, security decisions will be \nmade in a vacuum that at best might produce misguidance and extraneous \nefforts and at worst could triple the transportation modes that ensure \nthe free flow of commerce and traffic upon which our Nation has been \nbuilt.\n  Competition, safety, and security are interrelated and inseparable \naspects of interstate transportation, and each element significantly \nimpacts a carrier's operation.\n  I realize this amendment does not discuss the Coast Guard, so I will \nnot discuss that matter at this moment.\n  This is not a debate about protecting turf. It is a debate about the \nbest way to do the job our Nation has entrusted to us. It is about our \nrole in transportation safety and security and our ability to craft \neffective and timely solutions.\n  Although the report said Congress should create a single board of \nreview for homeland security, I feel certain the commission did not \nintend that such a consolidation would result in more harm than good. \nEach of us must look at what is in the best interest of our Nation. \nSenators Reid and McConnell have done that. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the McCain amendment.\n  Finally, it has been said the homeland security proposal submitted by \nthe leadership of the Senate did not change the status quo. It \nrecommends, as this resolution will point out, that the new homeland \nsecurity and governmental affairs committee have sole jurisdiction of \nthree of the four directorates in the Department of Homeland Security: \ndirectorate of information analysis, science and technology programs \nunder the under secretary, and emergency preparedness and response \ndirector.\n  Yes, we have tried our best to make a change but not at the expense \nof a good, efficient, safe, and profitable transportation system.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we were listening to Senator McCain and \nthe unanimous consent request for time, the cloakroom had a call from \nSenator Lautenberg. I ask unanimous consent that the order now before \nthe Senate be amended to allow Senator Lautenberg 10 minutes. I am \nhopeful I will not have to use my 5 minutes, so it would not extend \nthings for more than 5 minutes, 10 at the most. I ask Senator \nLautenberg be allowed 10 minutes prior to Senator McCain speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I rise to support this amendment. When the 9/11 \nCommission Report came out--and the Commissioners said the top three \npriorities were the creation of a national intelligence director; \nsecond, national counterterrorism center; and, third, reform of \ncongressional oversight of intelligence and homeland security \nfunctions--a lot of cynics said none of this is going to be easy; maybe \nthey will be able to reorganize the administrative branch of our \nGovernment, but they will never do the job themselves on themselves.\n\n  I am afraid the Senate is in the process of proving the cynics right, \nand it is a shame. We are creating a shell here. This is like a shell \ngame. We are calling a committee a homeland security committee, but if \nyou pick up the shell, there is not much homeland security under it.\n  I remember when the Department of Homeland Security legislation, in \nthe aftermath of September 11, was brought before our committee and \nbefore the Congress. This was originally a recommendation of the Hart-\nRudman Commission which some of us picked up and advocated here in the \nCongress.\n  During the legislative consideration of the Homeland Security \nDepartment, almost every agency that is now a part of the Department \ncame to us and said: We can't go to this Department; it is too big; we \ncan't work together. We appealed to them that they had to put their own \ninterests aside, and in the aftermath of September 11, a national \ncrisis which proved we were not organized to protect our homeland, they \nhad to get together in one department and make it work for the public's \nbenefit. We accomplished that in the Department, and they are now. It \nhas not all been smooth, but I don't think there is anybody who would \nsay we are not safer today than we were before the creation of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security because they are all working together.\n  That is why the 9/11 Commission said, if you want to do effective \noversight of homeland security, if you want to make sure the Secretary \nof Homeland Security is not spending so much time jumping around from \ncommittee to committee up here in Congress but actually protecting the \nhomeland, then create one homeland security committee of the Senate and \nthe House.\n  I have no particular argument to be made about which committee that \nshould be. In the legislation Senator McCain and I put in, we mirrored \nthe report of the 9/11 Commission: Either give one existing committee \nall of the homeland security oversight legislatively or create a whole \nnew committee on homeland security. The Senate is on a path to do \nneither and, therefore, not meet the challenge of the 9/11 Commission \nand the challenge of our current circumstances in the war on terrorism \nto create such a committee.\n  Here in this amendment, Senator McCain is trying to restore to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, or being renamed the homeland security \ncommittee, the Transportation Security Administration. The total \nDepartment of Homeland Security has 175,000 employees. TSA has more \nthan 51,000. Its functions are totally with regard to homeland \nsecurity. Incidentally, the Coast Guard is totally within the Homeland \nSecurity Department. There may have been some misunderstanding about \nthat here. Some of its functions are clearly not directed to homeland \nsecurity. But TSA is totally homeland security. It belongs in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and it belongs in the committee \ndesignated here in the Senate to do oversight and authorization of \nhomeland security.\n  So I appeal to my colleagues, if you want to give this title to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, fine. Senator Collins and I and members \nof our committee will do the best job we can. But if you are giving us \nthe title, give us the responsibility to do the job right. If not, give \nit all to another committee or create a new committee. But right now, \nremembering the famous old saying about ``if it walks like a duck and \nquacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it must be a duck,'' we are \ncreating a committee that does not have the budgetary authorization for \nmost of the Department of Homeland Security, does not oversee most of \nthe employees of the Department of Homeland Security, and we are \ncalling it the committee on homeland security. It is not. And I do not \nsee a good reason for doing it other than business as usual here in the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S10651]]\n\n  So I appeal to my colleagues, let's do what is right for the country \nand put all of this in one committee. You can decide which one you want \nit to be. It does not have to be the one I happen to be ranking \nDemocrat on. But let's do what is right and put it in one committee.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is the next \nSenator to be recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. When is the Senator from New Jersey to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is to speak just \nbefore the Senator from Arizona is to close.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I be recognized before the Senator \nfrom Mississippi? I think it is appropriate for the Senator from Alaska \nto speak, as the main opponent of the amendment, before I speak, which \nwould be after the Senator from New Jersey. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from Alaska be allowed to speak prior to me speaking, \nwhich would then wrap it up, since the Senator from Alaska is the \nprimary opponent of the amendment and I am the sponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, I don't know what that \ndoes to the other order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It puts the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, \nprior to you rather than after you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is fine. I have no objection. Senator Lott precedes \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is not a quorum call in effect, is \nthere?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am informed Senator Lautenberg will not be returning \nto the floor to speak. Next will be Senator Lott, right?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, Senator Lott.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, under the time agreement, is this the time \nthat I will have to speak on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first I want to speak on the broader \nsubject, and with only 5 minutes, I don't have much time. But I am \nreally worried that what we are doing here is not enough. I understand \nthat the whips, who have been designated to carry out this task by our \nleaders, Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, have worked very hard to \ntry to accommodate everybody's interests and concerns, but there is \nsomething bigger here than just individual interests and concerns or \nturf or jurisdiction, and I feel a lot of that is still at play.\n  If we do not do anything more to this resolution than what is already \nin it, it is worth having. I do not want to complain about that. At \nleast we are making the Intelligence Committee permanent.\n  There are a number of things that are in this resolution that are \nworth having, but I am worried it is not enough. I don't like going \nagainst my friends and colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, Senator Cochran. I have faith in both of them. But I \ndon't have faith in the way the system is set up now. The way things \nare spread out all over this institution, both on intelligence and \nhomeland security, it is a prescription not to be able to do our job. \nThat really does bother me. I didn't feel this way until I went on the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  But I say to my colleagues, after a year and a half on the \nIntelligence Committee, I am really scared. I am worried that our \nintelligence community has not done its job and that it is not \norganized properly. We are trying to do something about that with the \nlegislation we passed yesterday. I don't think we did enough. I still \nthink there are a lot of people trying to protect the status quo. The \nPentagon doesn't want to give up 80 percent of the budget. They want to \nmake sure that everything is done the way it has been being done. The \nPentagon wants to make sure the Secretary of Defense still controls \ncertain nominations. Again, too many people are worried about trying to \nkeep what they have now when what we ought to be worrying about is how \ndo we do a better job of getting better intelligence, not only for the \nmen and women in the military but across the board in intelligence.\n  And this is the thing that really bothers me: part of it is our \nfault. We have not been doing our job. What is the proof? Look at 9/11. \nLook at the other things that we have found that the intelligence \ncommunity did not know were about to happen or gave us information that \nwas not accurate. If they failed, we failed.\n  When these two pieces of legislation are finished, both the \nintelligence reform in the administration and the congressional reform, \nare we going to be better off? Are we going to have somebody we can \nhold accountable? Are we going to be able to make sure the Pentagon is \ndoing its job, the CIA is doing its job? I don't believe so. The \nintelligence authorization committee is not set up to do the job. Even \nwith this arrangement we are working on now, it is all going to be \ncontrolled by appropriations and the black budget.\n  I want to emphasize, I trust Senator Stevens, and I know he wants the \nsecurity of this country to be looked after. But if we are not going to \nhave an Intelligence Committee with the authority to do the job and \nwithout the knowledge of what is happening on appropriations, I would \nrecommend we all get off because we are going to be held responsible \nand we are not going to be able to do the oversight that is necessary.\n  We are working at it. That is good. I commend everybody. On the \nhomeland security, I debated on this particular point. I am on the \nCommerce Committee. I want all the jurisdiction we can possibly get. I \nam very concerned about the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard should be more \nthan port security. The Coast Guard is about search and rescue. The \nCoast Guard should be about drug interdiction, which it is. It has a \nbig agenda. I think you can make a strong case that it ought to stay in \nthe Commerce Committee, and under the amendment, as I understand it, it \nwould. That is a critical point.\n  But if we are going to have a separate homeland security committee, \nor if we are going to put that issue under the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, we ought to do it in a way where we do cut down this \nduplication. I, again, am worried that we are talking about doing more \nthan we are really doing.\n\n  I have debated about whether we need a separate homeland security \ncommittee. But I think if we are going to do it, to only put 38 percent \nof the homeland security matters before the committee is not \naccomplishing the job, just like I am worried that on intelligence \nauthorization, we still have not solved the problem with sequential \nreferral to the Armed Services Committee. We still have not solved the \nproblem about how do the authorizers know what the appropriators are \ndoing, and how do the appropriators know what the authorizers are \ndoing. We are not doing enough.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we to go conference on the other bill, more \nwork needs to be done. As we work toward completion on this \nlegislation, I hope we will strengthen the hand of those who have \nnegotiated on it and those who are going to be held responsible for \nwhat is the end result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the order, Senator Lautenberg has 10 \nminutes. He will not need that time so that can be stricken. What is \nthe order of the speaking now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 5 minutes, \nfollowed by the Senator from Alaska, followed by the Senator from \nArizona, each for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't have a dog in this fight other than \nthe fact that I have worked for a month to the point where we are now. \nI don't want anyone here to think the new committee on homeland \nsecurity-governmental affairs does not have a lot of\n\n[[Page S10652]]\n\nwork to do and a lot of jurisdiction. They are totally responsible for \nthree directorates. The new homeland security-governmental affairs \ncommittee will have sole jurisdiction over three of the four primary \ndirectorates in the Department of Homeland Security: science and \ntechnology directorate, emergency preparedness and response \ndirectorate, information analysis and infrastructure protection, and \nshare parts of the directorate of border and transportation security.\n  For my good friend, the Senator from Maine, to stand and say, We \ndon't have anything to do, basically, is simply not factual.\n  I would also say we have transferred jurisdiction from 10 standing \ncommittees and given jurisdiction to this committee. This is not a \nnumbers game as to how many employees are involved. It is the number of \nfunctions they have been asked to take a look at. And if it is any \nindication that we haven't given them anything, you should understand \nthat every chairman of the 10 committees has been telling us we gave \nthem too much. You can't have it both ways.\n  I would also say, even though I don't have a dog in this fight, no \none should ever suggest that Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens are not \nequipped to handle what has been left with them in Commerce. Remember, \nSenator Inouye is a Medal of Honor winner. Senator Stevens is a World \nWar II veteran. That may not make them better Senators, but it \ncertainly doesn't make them worse Senators.\n  The only reason I am standing, people can vote however they believe \nthey should, but they should not vote based on the fact that we have \ngiven this new homeland security subcommittee no jurisdiction. They \nhave lots of work to do, including all the work they did before. It is \nnot as if they don't have anything to do. They have all they had to do \nbefore plus all the other things they have been given as a result of \nthis legislation that we hope will pass soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think the Senate should realize that \nwhen you are talking about the Transportation Security Agency, we are \ntalking about 45,000 screeners in the current system. Passenger \nscreening takes about $1.8 billion; baggage screening, $1.3 billion. \nSecurity and enforcement takes $703 million. The security part of TSA \nis very small compared to the manpower looking at passengers and \nbaggage. That is their primary function now. And of this $2 billion, \n$70 million comes from aviation user fees, and $95 million comes from \ntransfer from carryover for the fiscal year 2003.\n  This is a function, in terms of this part of the homeland security \nagency, that is directly related to the transportation mechanisms. We \nurged and have continued to urge that the aviation industry pay the \nvast portion of this now because the major portion of TSA affects the \nairports and airways. We believe, and I sincerely believe, that we \nshould find a way to have airlines collecting these user fees, have \nthem provide the kind of screening that is necessary for the passengers \nand for their baggage.\n  As a matter of fact, we have placed in this bill--this is the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, of which I am a member of the \nconference, and they are meeting right now--a substantial amount of \ntaxpayer money to continue this process of getting all of the baggage \nscreening and all the passenger screening done. But the bulk of the \nmoney, two-thirds of the money each year is coming from the aviation \nindustry itself, which is currently terribly hampered. They are hiring \npeople still. In the small airports, it is very unique because they \nstill have the people who are handling the passengers, but they have \nthese people hired by TSA who are using a third or more of their \nbuildings. That has to stop. That has to transition to a private \nenterprise.\n  If we do this, and we put it in Governmental Affairs, that is not \ngoing to happen. They don't have the pressure from the entities that \nare carrying these passengers. We do in Commerce, and we have tried our \nbest so far to meet the process and to be fair to both the Governmental \nagencies that have the temporary job and the transportation agencies \nthat are paying the bulk of the cost of that job.\n  But there has to be a transition. We cannot keep it up. In fact, very \nsoon the airlines are going to be unable to pay those charges. They are \ngoing to have to be paid by the taxpayers. We heard this morning they \nare not even going to be able to make their contribution to the \nretirement funds. This must be changed.\n  I will use the remainder of my time to say I agree with Senator Lott. \nWe had a conversation at noon today about the whole system. It hasn't \nbeen since 1977 that we reorganized the Senate. We should do that. We \nshould recognize the changes in the economy, changes in our people, \nchanges in the whole global concept. But we have not done that. This is \nattempting now--because Homeland Security agencies have come upon us--\nby the way, it has been on us for a while; we didn't need the 9/11 \nCommission to tell us what to do. We created Homeland Security before \nthey were created. They took it upon themselves to tell us how to do \nour own laundry. We can do this ourselves.\n  By January, we will have to see what the House has done. We have the \nproblem of dealing with 100 people, but they have 435 in the House. We \nare going to have to change to meet the reorganization they are going \nto bring about. They have a reorganization group going. We should have \na reorganization group. With this group, the two whips have done a \nmarvelous job trying to meet the demands of the 9/11 Commission, which \nis piecemeal as far as the Senate is concerned.\n  We should have another reorganization. Whose job is that? That is the \njob of Rules and the Governmental Affairs Committees to reorganize and \nfind a way to deal with the reorganization that is required for the \nSenate to meet current and future needs. This isn't the way to do it.\n  The Senator keeps mentioning that two-thirds somehow or another is in \nCommerce. That is not so. We have one-third of this budget. We have \none-third of the burden from the financing of Homeland Security, which \nis in TSA. I have the figures.\n  I have table 3 from the Department of Homeland Security summary of \nappropriations for fiscal 2004 and 2005. This is prepared by the CRS.

Mr. President, it is very clear. We are talking about \none-third, not two-thirds.\n  The other part of this is the other agencies spread throughout this \nmaze of jurisdiction we have. When we reorganized in 1997, someone used \na mixing bowl, and the committees spilled out first. It wasn't a good, \nsound reorganization. We need a good, sound reorganization. This is not \nthe way to do it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to quote from the 9/11 Commission \nreport so we can put this into the perspective that I think this \namendment deserves:\n  Of all of the recommendations, strengthening congressional oversight \nmay be among the most difficult and important. So long as oversight is \ngoverned by current congressional rules and resolutions, we believe the \nAmerican people will not get the security they want and need.\n  The underlying resolution, as amended, leaves the vast majority of \nhomeland security jurisdiction in committees other than the new \nhomeland security committee. TSA and the Coast Guard stay in Commerce. \nBy the way, the Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The revenue functions of the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement stay in Finance. The \nrevenue functions of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration \nServices stay in Judiciary. It goes on and on.\n  Screeners are responsible for security. The Coast Guard's primary \nresponsibility is our Nation's security. I wish they could return \nprimarily to their old line of work.\n  So what do we end up with? We end up with a homeland security \ncommittee with jurisdiction over less than 38 percent of the \nDepartment's budget and fewer than 8 percent of the Department's \nemployees. TSA employs 51,000 people. Those remain under the Commerce \nCommittee. Not only that, but it is clear that what we have done here \nis essentially nothing. What we ought to do, perhaps, is just say we \nfailed. I am not going to rant and rave anymore about how unfortunate \nit is that the Appropriations Committee is able to, as they have in the \npast, fund programs that the Intelligence Committee has thoroughly \nscrutinized and say should be canceled, at a cost of billions of \ndollars.\n  I think we all know what the job of the Transportation Security \nAdministration is. It is security. It is fighting the war on terrorism. \nWhere should it be? It should, obviously, be under our new committee on \nhomeland security and governmental affairs. So I won't bring up an \namendment on the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard should be also under this \ncommittee because it is under the Department of Homeland Security. It \nis just logical.\n  So as I say to my colleagues, if this amendment fails, why don't we \njust call it a day and say it is business as usual. We have had great \nsuccess on executive reorganization and I am proud of the work the \ncommittee has done. Unfortunately, we have failed to act in any \nsignificant manner as far as the reorganization of the Senate is \nconcerned, and that was recognized by the 9/11 Commission.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Before the vote, Mr. President----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is to proceed to a vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't object, Mr. President. I wish the Senator from \nKentucky had asked for time during the normal unanimous consent \nagreement. I don't object.\n  Mr. REID. He is not going to speak on the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was going to say to our colleagues \nthat it is the intention of Senator Reid and myself to continue to \nprocess amendments into the evening, with the goal of finishing \ntonight. We still have 30-some-odd amendments. There is certainly no \nrequirement that they all be offered. We intend to keep plowing ahead \nand try to reach the finish line tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two leaders are emphatic that they want \nto move forward. We have a lot of stuff to do. Tomorrow is the \nscheduled day for departure. That will be difficult. I wish people \nwould follow the example of the Senator from Arizona, and I say that \nseriously. He never takes a lot of time. He doesn't waste a lot of \ntime. He sets a tone for how we should move forward. I appreciate his \ncooperation on these two very important amendments. These are the two \nmost important amendments we will have on this bill now before the \nbody. I appreciate his cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Arizona.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nChambliss) and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

I am hopeful that Senator Hatch will \nshortly be prepared to send his amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Kentucky, I have a pending \namendment which has been agreed to with a modification by Senator \nRoberts. I am prepared to offer it whenever appropriate so we can take \ncare of it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It appears as if Senator Hatch may not be quite ready, \nso why don't we have Senator Durbin go ahead and offer his amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4036 to Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4036 to Amendment No. 3981.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify the provisions relating to the staffing and budget \n                        of the select Committee)\n\n       In section 201, at the end of subsection (g), add the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Of the funds made available to the select Committee \n     for personnel--\n       ``(1) not more than 55 percent shall be under the control \n     of the Chairman; and\n       ``(2) not less than 45 percent shall be under the control \n     of the Vice Chairman.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have good news for the Chamber. I \nbelieve we have reached an agreement on this amendment which will help \nus move this important resolution along.\n  I saw Senator Roberts on the floor a moment ago. I have had a \nconversation with Senator Roberts and Senator Rockefeller. The purpose \nof this amendment is to move us closer to the bipartisan model which we \nwant to establish for this important intelligence committee. Yesterday, \nwith an overwhelming vote of 96 to 2, the Members of this Chamber \nadopted the intelligence reform suggested by the 9/11 Commission, and \nit is a product of the fine bipartisan cooperation of Senator Susan \nCollins of Maine and Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.\n  I believe in the time I have been fortunate enough to represent \nIllinois in the Senate, it was one of our finer moments because we \nresponded to a national crisis. We did it in a timely fashion. We did \nit in an orderly way. We brought together amendments which were \nsubstantive and numerous and voted in nonpartisan rollcalls. We came to \nthe floor, and after a week and a half of debate brought this bill out \nwith a vote of 96 to 2 to reform the executive branch. I think the \nmessage of the process and the message of the reform bill is that we \nwant to take partisanship out of the intelligence operations of the \nexecutive branch.\n  I believe by the joint effort of the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, \nand the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, we are seeing that same \nthing today about the legislative branch.\n  This amendment which I propose is an effort to move us closer to \nparity in staffing. I believe that establishing this by rule is a good \nthing for the future of the Intelligence Committee. What it says is \nthat regardless of the partisan split of the committee, which is now a \nsplit of eight to seven, if I am not mistaken, we are going to divide \nstaff by a 55-45 proportion, 55 percent to the chairman representing \nthe majority of the committee, and 45 percent to the ranking member \nrepresenting the minority on the committee.\n  Along with Senator Roberts, who is on the majority side of this \ncommittee, and Senator Rockefeller, the ranking member, we had a \nconversation and we have agreed to a new number which I will present as \na modification to this amendment shortly. It is a number of 60 percent \nfor the chairman with the majority membership of the committee, 60 \npercent of the staffing funds in control of the chairman, and 40 \npercent of the funds in the control of the minority ranking member.\n  I think this is a fair compromise. I believe it is offered by both \nsides in the spirit of moving us toward this bipartisanship on the \nIntelligence Committee. I believe it will have the net effect of \nimproving the product of the committee.\n  Let me quickly add that I don't believe there are necessarily \nDemocratic or Republican answers to the tough issues we face on the \nIntelligence Committee. But I believe both sides should be adequately \nstaffed so they can rise to the occasion when we face challenges for \ninvestigations and hearings that are held with witnesses being brought \nbefore us. By establishing 40 percent of the personnel funds to the \nranking member and 60 percent to the chairman, I think we are moving \ncloser to that model.\n  For those who have been involved, Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, \nlet me make it clear this would apply to the committee staff and not to \nindividual member staffs. The effort in the preparation of this \nresolution was made so that every member of the Intelligence Committee \nwho has personal staff would not be affected by this amendment. The 60-\n40 would apply strictly to the other committee staff over and above the \npersonal staff of the committee.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe the amendment at the desk is 55-45. Is the \nSenator going to modify the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. At this point I will be happy to yield for any other \nquestions or comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to verify what the \nSenator from Illinois has said.\n  Senator Roberts can't be here at this particular time, but he \nauthorized me to say he is in agreement with this. It is a sensible \napproach. It is bipartisan in nature. As far as we are concerned, there \nis agreement on both sides. What the managers decide is up to them.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4036, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if there are no further comments or \nquestions, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment now pending \nbefore the Senate be modified on its face, and in paragraph (d), \nsubparagraph (1), the number 55 be changed to 60; and in paragraph (d), \nsubparagraph (2), the number 45 be changed to 40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4036), as modified, is as follows:\n       In section 201, at the end of subsection (g), add the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Of the funds made available to the select Committee \n     for personnel--\n       ``(1) not more than 60 percent shall be under the control \n     of the Chairman; and\n       ``(2) not less than 40 percent shall be under the control \n     of the Vice Chairman.''.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe we are prepared to move \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4036), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Hatch is here and ready to \noffer an amendment.\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4037 to Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. Leahy, \n     and Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 4037 to \n     amendment No. 3981.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To retain jurisdiction over the Secret Service in the \n                      Committee on the Judiciary)\n\n       In section 101(b)(1), after ``Service'' insert ``, and the \n     Secret Service''.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to offer a Leahy-Specter-Hatch \namendment that would preserve the Judiciary Committee's oversight \njurisdiction over the U.S. Secret Service.\n  The reason for the amendment is not simply the committee's \nlongstanding relationship with the Secret Service, although that \nrelationship is strong and healthy. It is a very good reason why we \nshould retain the status. The Judiciary Committee has had jurisdiction \nover the Secret Service's title 18 authority since June 25, 1948. I was \nastonished to hear one of my colleagues say on the floor earlier today \nthat the Judiciary Committee was trying to move jurisdiction to the \nJudiciary Committee. The committee has had jurisdiction over the Secret \nService for the last 56 years.\n  The more important reason is that a huge percentage of Secret Service \noperations are authorized by title 18 of the criminal code. That will \nobviously and appropriately remain under the Judiciary Committee's \njurisdiction. If the point of this bill is to reform congressional \noversight, then it would make no sense to reduce the Judiciary \nCommittee's ability to examine how title 18 of the criminal code \nauthority is used while continuing to rely upon the Judiciary Committee \nto make sure that title 18 provides appropriate authority to the Secret \nService.\n  A little bit of history may be helpful. The Secret Service was \nestablished as a law enforcement agency in 1865. While most people \nassociate the Secret Service with Presidential protection, its original \nmandate was to investigate counterfeiting of U.S. currency. Today, the \nprimary investigative mission of the Secret Service is to safeguard the \npayment and financial systems of the United States.\n  The Secret Service has exclusive jurisdiction for investigations \ninvolving the counterfeiting of U.S. obligations and securities. That \nauthority to investigate counterfeiting is derived from title 18 of the \nUnited States Code, section 3056. Some of the counterfeited U.S. \nobligations and securities commonly dealt with by the Secret Service \ninclude U.S. currency and coins, U.S. Treasury checks, Department of \nAgriculture food coupons, and U.S. postage stamps.\n  The Secret Service combats counterfeiting by working closely with \nFederal, State and local law enforcement agencies, as well as foreign \nlaw enforcement agencies, to aggressively pursue counterfeiters. Secret \nService agents commonly work with Federal prosecutors--employees of the \nDepartment of Justice, over which the Judiciary Committee retains \njurisdiction.\n  It is important for Congress to keep up with the times when \ndetermining the scope of Title 18. Since 1984, the Secret Service's \ninvestigative responsibilities under Title 18 have expanded to include \ncrimes that involve financial institution fraud, computer and \ntelecommunications fraud, false identification documents, access device \nfraud, advance fee fraud, electronic funds transfers, and money \nlaundering.\n  People who counterfeit things are creative, and so are those who \ninvent new products that are susceptible to being counterfeited. It is \nimportant that Title 18 provide the Secret Service with appropriately \nupdated authority, and therefore it is crucial that the Judiciary \nCommittee have the ability to require the Secret Service to report on \nits use of authority.\n  Listen to some of the types of criminal investigations that the \nFinancial Crimes Division of the Secret Service plans and coordinates:\n  Financial Systems Crimes, including bank fraud; access device fraud; \ntelemarketing; telecommunications fraud; computer fraud; the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation and Farm Credit Administration \nviolations.\n  These are all traditional criminal investigations and they are all \ngoverned by Title 18. They are at the core of Judiciary Committee \njurisdiction and expertise.\n  Another division of the Secret Service, Forensic Services Division, \nFSD, is almost entirely focused on providing analysis for questioned \ndocuments, fingerprints, false identification, credit cards, and other \nrelated forensic science areas. A main purpose of this division is to \ninvestigate crimes and provide evidence for prosecutors to use in \ncourt. FSD also manages the Secret Service's polygraph program and \ncoordinates photographic, graphic, video, and audio enhancement.\n  Here's an example of how the Judiciary Committee's relationship with \nthe Secret Service works: As part of the 1994 Crime Bill, Congress \nmandated the Secret Service to provide forensic/technical assistance in \nmatters involving missing and sexually exploited children. The Forensic \nService Division offers this assistance to Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement agencies, the Morgan P. Hardiman Task Force and the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children. It is important for \nthe Judiciary Committee to continue its relationship with the Secret \nService to make sure that its capabilities are utilized in important \nareas of law enforcement such as these.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote for keeping the \njurisdiction where it belongs, with the people who have to deal with \nthese criminal laws all the time. Frankly, it is a tough process. We \nshould not move the Secret Service out of the Judiciary Committee \njurisdiction because that is where this very tough anticrime approach \nhas to occur and has to take place.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen to me. I have no axes to grind here. \nI am not just trying to preserve jurisdiction; it doesn't make sense to \ntake it out of the hands of the Judiciary Committee as much as some \nthink it may. I don't think it can make a good case that it should be \ntaken out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record what looks like \n50 or more jurisdictional aspects of the Secret Service investigational \napproaches.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           Title 18 USC 3056\n\n       Secret Service has jurisdiction to investigate the \n     following:\n       --213--Acceptance of loan or gratuity by financial \n     institution examiner\n       --216--Punishments for 213\n       --471--Counterfeiting US obligations\n       --472--Uttering Counterfeiting securities\n       --473--Dealing in Counterfeiting obligations or securities\n       --474--Possession of device to counterfeit obligations\n       --476--Theft of tools used to counterfeiting obligations\n       --477--Selling of tools for counterfeiting obligations\n       --478--Counterfeiting of foreign obligations\n       --479--Uttering Counterfeit foreign obligations\n       --480--Possessing counterfeit foreign obligations\n       --481--Possession of electronic images for counterfeiting \n     foreign obligations\n       --482--Forgery or Counterfeiting Bank Notes\n       --483--Uttering counterfeit foreign bank notes\n       --484--Fraudulently combining multiple United States \n     Instruments\n       --485--Counterfeiting United States coins\n       --486--Unauthorized passing of United States coins\n       --487--Making or possessing counterfeit dies for coins\n       --488--Making or possessing counterfeit dies for foreign \n     coins\n       --489--Making or possessing likeness of United States or \n     foreign coins\n       --492--Forfeiture of counterfeit paraphernalia\n       --493--Bonds and obligations of certain lending agencies\n       --508--Forging United States Transportation Documents\n       --509--Unlawful Possession of Government transportation \n     plates\n       --510--Forging Treasury Check endorsements\n       --657--Misapplication of funds from a Credit Institution\n       --709--False advertising or misuse of names of indicate \n     Federal agency\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\n       --871--Threats against the President\n       --879--Threats against former Presidents\n       --912--Impersonation of Officer of the United States\n       --981--Civil forfeitures\n       --982--Criminal forfeitures\n       --1001--False statements\n       --1006--False statements to credit entries\n       --1007--Forged/Counterfeit statements to influence the FDIC\n       --1011--False statements to Federal Land Bank\n       --1013--Use of forged securities or bonds to defraud \n     Federal Land Bank\n       --1014--False Statement to influence Farm Credit \n     Administration\n       --1028--Identity Theft\n       --1029--credit card fraud\n       --1030--Computer fraud\n       --1344--Bank Fraud\n       --1752--Entering the temporary offices of the President\n       --1907--Disclosure of private information by a farm credit \n     examiner\n       --1909--Conflicts of interest for National Bank Examiner\n       --1956--Money Laundering\n       --1957--Engaging in Monetary Transactions from specified \n     Unlawful Activities\n\n  Mr. HATCH. When you look at these, you cannot conclude anything but \nthis should stick with the Judiciary Committee. I don't have any ax to \ngrind. Everyone knows that. The fact is, this is the right thing to do \nor I would not be standing here trying to do it. We have had a great \nrelationship with the Secret Service and have done a great deal of work \ntogether over my 28 years on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I know \nthis is right, and we have to do this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I totally agree with the Senior Senator \nfrom Utah in this battle. Senator Hatch and I have worked very closely \non this issue. This is an amendment cosponsored principally by Senator \nHatch and myself and Senators Sessions, Specter, and Biden. It is not a \npartisan amendment by any means. It is not ideological. It just makes \ngood sense.\n  In the resolution before the Senate we look at the new committee, the \nhomeland committee and governmental affairs committee, but we have four \nexceptions for good reasons. Section 101, we take the Coast Guard out \nof that. We take the Transportation Security Administration, we take \nthe Federal law enforcement training sector, and we take the revenue \nfunctions of the Customs Service. But we have to make one other \nexception, and that exception is the U.S. Secret Service.\n  The Secret Service operates under Title 18 of the United States Code, \nthat title of the United States Code of criminal law. Every one of \nthese yellow tabs in the criminal code is one more area under criminal \nlaw, criminal code, where the Secret Service operates. The \ndistinguished Senator from Utah said it is not just the protection \nservice by any means, even though that is what we see in the news. They \nenforce many of the criminal laws, many of the laws related to the \ncounterfeiting of U.S. currency and other financial instruments. They \ncarry out criminal investigations. Criminal law enforcement function is \nthe cornerstone of what the Secret Service does.\n  I first got involved with the Secret Service when I was a State's \nattorney of Chittenden County in Vermont. That was over 38 years ago. \nWe had a counterfeiting case we were prosecuting under State law. For \nthe expertise, for help in the investigation, we called in the Secret \nService. The Secret Service was involved immediately. Even though it \nwas a State case, a State prosecutor, the Vermont State police, the \nBurlington City Police, the expertise came at a moment's notice from \nthe U.S. Secret Service. They stayed throughout that case. They made \nsure we had the expertise. They made sure they gave us all their \nknowledge of how one of these cases would be tried. Incidentally, we \nwon that case.\n\n  Years later, when I was a new Member of the Senate, I was walking \ndown the hall and I see the Secretary of State coming down the hall, \npeople from the State Department, and also a couple of Secret Service \nagents. There was the Secret Service agent, David Lee--I remember his \nname--standing right there doing the dual things they do. His primary \nrole had been in counterfeiting cases. We talked briefly about the \nnumber of counterfeiting cases he went to. I told him how much it meant \nto my little State of Vermont, which could not handle counterfeiting \ncases. A lot of crimes had been committed, and the Secret Service came \nin.\n  Now, they enforce criminal law. They have full Federal arrest \nauthority, full authority to carry any needed firearms, full authority \nto use deadly force. We should continue our oversight, and the \nJudiciary Committee should continue its role. Their dual criminal law \nenforcement of financial institution investigations and protective \noperations is inseparable from the proper jurisdictional oversight of \nthe Judiciary Committee. Again, I point to the Federal criminal code \nrules.\n  Now, the Coast Guard has been made exempt. It, like the Secret \nService, is a distinct entity. Both should be exempted, not just the \nCoast Guard. The Secret Service has even more reason to be exempt. The \nsuccess of the Secret Service mission depends on the criminal laws of \nthe United States.\n  An example of that is that all the criminal fraud law enforcement \ninvestigations which the Secret Service handles are within Title 18. \nWhere do they handle it? Within the Department of Justice through the \nAttorney General and the U.S. Attorney--under, obviously, the \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I will give another example. The Secret Service is authorized at the \nrequest of any State or law enforcement agency or at the request of the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children to provide forensic \nand investigative assistance in support of investigations involving \nmissing or exploited children.\n  Let me tell you right now, if you have a missing child, we want \neverybody involved. All the local authorities will tell you that, \nespecially if they are anywhere near a State line. They want everybody. \nAgain, it comes under our committee.\n  So I agree, as I said, with the Senator from Utah. This is not a \npartisan issue. It is not a liberal issue. It is not a conservative \nissue. It is just good, plain sense.\n  Mr. President, I would hope my colleagues would be willing to accept \nthe amendment on behalf of myself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nSpecter, Mr. Biden, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise, with a lot of respect for the \nSenator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont, to oppose this \namendment. I do so because it continues the stripping away of \njurisdiction from the newly designated committee on homeland security \nover more and more of what constitutes the Homeland Security \nDepartment.\n  The recommendation of the 9/11 Commission to improve congressional \noversight of homeland security and to allow the leadership of the \nHomeland Security Department to spend more time protecting our homeland \nand less time running from committee to committee here in Congress was \nto create one committee on homeland security with jurisdiction over all \naspects of the Homeland Security Department.\n  The Homeland Security Department includes 175,807 employees. Now, \nemployees are not the only measure of jurisdiction, but let's start \nwith that number and then say that the bill brought before us by the \nworking group immediately took out 45,000 from the Coast Guard, now \nunder the Homeland Security Department, and 51,000 from the \nTransportation Security Administration. Add to that an amendment \noffered by my friends from the Judiciary Committee today which took \nback a good part of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Immigration \nand Customs Service Enforcement, which will be shared in some part with \nHomeland Security and Customs & Border Protection, and you are at a \npoint where jurisdiction over well over half--heading toward almost \nall--of the Department of Homeland Security employees is no longer \nunder the committee we are establishing to oversee the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I will repeat what I said earlier about the Transportation Security \nAgency authority. Our committee recommended the creation of a \nDepartment of Homeland Security after September 11. Why are we here? We \nare here because we were attacked on September 11, and we looked back \nand said: We were not ready. We were not organized to defend our \npeople. So we proposed the creation of the Homeland Security \nDepartment.\n\n[[Page S10657]]\n\n  Almost every agency we wanted to bring together in that Department \nprotested: We want to be on our own turf. We want our own ground. But \nwe pushed forward because there was a larger national interest. We \nprevailed, and we brought all these agencies together--one department. \nAnd it is working. We brought them together for the synergy of them \nworking together to protect our national security in an age of \nterrorists who hate us more than they love their own lives and have \nshown that over and over again.\n  So here comes another amendment to take the Secret Service, which is \nin the Department of Homeland Security, away from the oversight and \njurisdiction of what we are calling the Homeland Security Department. \nWe are beginning to make the homeland security committee look like a \nhouse without rooms in it or not as many rooms as are supposed to be \nthere, or like a shell, when you pick it up and there is not much under \nit even though it says ``homeland security'' on the top. That is a \nshell game, and this adds only to that trend.\n  Now, look, there are a lot of committees that could claim some \nrelationship to different subparts of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  The fact is, they are a distinct entity within homeland security. We \nhave carved out that distinct entity for the Secret Service because of \ntheir law enforcement role. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut \nhad no problem with carving out the Coast Guard, and the Coast Guard--\n--\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. There is a problem.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But it has been done. It has been accepted.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Not done by me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It was not objected to by you, and it was accepted.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It was indeed, and we are still working on an \namendment to try to see if we can right that wrong. I say to the \nSenator from Vermont, with all respect, I understand your question. The \npoint is, if we were doing this right, everything in the Homeland \nSecurity Department would be overseen by the homeland security \ncommittee. That is what the 9/11 Commission called for.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might respond to that, if we were doing this right, \nwe would not have brought out something put together behind closed \ndoors. I am not accusing the Senator from Connecticut of doing that, \nbut we suddenly have this thing plopped on our desks as people are \nleaving for the long-promised recess, and we are told: Here, we just \nhave to put this all together right now. It is not the way to do it. We \nhave not had hearings. We have not done anything like that. I think had \nwe had those hearings, had we discussed it, you would have found a vast \nmajority of Americans would assume the Secret Service carries out their \nlaw enforcement functions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may, here is the basic point. The \nSecret Service is now part of homeland security. The Homeland Security \nDepartment should be overseen by the homeland security committee. I was \nnot behind those closed doors, if they existed. My understanding is the \nworking group leadership spoke to the ranking members on each of the \ncommittees. I may be wrong. I did not do that. That is what I heard.\n  But let me explain. The Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nUtah have cited context between the Judiciary Committee and the Secret \nService. As I say, there are so many committees that can cite context \nin one way or another with different components of the Homeland \nSecurity Department. But let me tell you why the Secret Service was put \ninto the Homeland Security Department.\n  Obviously, the Secret Service is best known for its mission in \nprotecting the Nation's highest elected leaders as well as visiting \nheads of state. It is entirely appropriate that the department \nresponsible for safeguarding the security of this Nation includes an \nagency which is responsible for protecting its top leaders who, \ntragically, in this age may be targets of terrorism.\n  Since 1998, when President Clinton issued Presidential Decision \nDirective 62, the Secret Service has assumed responsibility for \nplanning, coordinating, and implementing security operations at all \nnational special security events. And what is the great fear at such \nevents? Terrorism. These national events, like the Olympics or the \npolitical party conventions, are important to our country and, \nunfortunately, enticing targets to terrorists if they are not defended. \nIt is the Secret Service that is responsible for planning, \ncoordinating, and implementing those security operations--another \nobvious reason why it should be in the Homeland Security Department.\n  What has being there allowed the Secret Service to do? To draw on the \nexpertise and resources of the different agencies within the Department \nof Homeland Security to support the Secret Service's protective \nmissions as well, of course, as to share the Service's own expertise \nand experience with the other agencies in the Department to help them \ndo their job better.\n  Some of the unique responsibilities of the Secret Service are \nparticularly relevant to terrorism. The Secret Service has \nresponsibility for identity theft in various forms and methods. This is \none of the terrorists' primary tools, assuming identities not their own \nto break through the defenses our country sets up. The ability to \nidentify and prevent the proliferation of false identifications is \ncritically important to the Department's mission of identifying \nterrorists and stopping them before they strike us, and that is the \nSecret Service's responsibility.\n  The Secret Service also has responsibility for the protection of \nimportant national buildings, including the White House, the Vice \nPresident's residence, foreign missions, and other important buildings \nin the Nation's Capital which, tragically, sadly, in our age, are also \nprime targets for terrorists. Those are the reasons why the Secret \nService has been placed in the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  But again, I come back to the main point. Are we going to do what we \nsay we are going to do or are we going to false advertise? We say we \nare going to respond to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations for a \ncommittee on homeland security. I have said before and I will say it \nagain, the Governmental Affairs Committee has had some experience in \nhomeland security so we are a natural place to put it. But I haven't \nsought it.\n  What I seek is the willingness to reorganize ourselves to the same \nextent that we have been willing to reorganize the executive branch, by \ncreating the Department of Homeland Security and now a national \nintelligence director. With all respect to my friends on Judiciary, \nthis is just another step to stopping us from achieving that mission, \nfrom meeting the challenge that the 9/11 Commission has set before us--\nand the request of the families of 9/11--to organize ourselves in a way \nthat we can perform the kind of oversight that will mean we are doing \neverything humanly possible to prevent anything such as September 11 \nfrom happening again.\n  I hope we will draw the line on what is sucking out the insides of \nwhat we are calling a committee on homeland security.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the issue before us is really very \nstraightforward. Do we want to reorganize the Senate to consolidate \njurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security within one \ncommittee or don't we? What we should not do is to pretend we are \nconsolidating jurisdiction in one committee, as recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission, and as strongly endorsed by the administration and \nSecretary Ridge. If we are going to consolidate authority, then let's \ndo it. If we are going to try to address the problem of 25 different \nSenate committees and subcommittees having a claim on the new \nDepartment, requiring testimony from officials in the Department, if we \nwant to continue on that route, then let us not pretend we are \nundergoing significant reform.\n  Moreover, the Secret Service has responsibilities ranging from \ninvestigations of Presidential threats to protection at major events \nthat go to the heart of the Department of Homeland Security's mission. \nThe Secret Service is a vital part of the mission of securing the \nhomeland. That is why it was moved into the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and that is why if we are going to mirror the Department, it\n\n[[Page S10658]]\n\nshould be under the jurisdiction of whatever committee is given \nresponsibility for homeland security.\n  There are functions of the Secret Service that clearly fit with the \ncore mission of the Department of Homeland Security. Indeed, at a \nhearing shortly before passage of the legislation setting up the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Director of the Secret Service \ntestified, explaining why it was important to include the \nSecret Service in the new Department. He stated:\n\n       Our core philosophy mirrors that of the new Department of \n     Homeland Security. Like our agency, the new department will \n     be prepared to respond to incidents and infiltration. Our \n     common goal is to anticipate and prepare through robust \n     threat assessments and analyses of intelligence information \n     that is made available to us.\n\n  He also stated:\n\n       Beyond our protective responsibilities, the Secret Service \n     is a major contributor to other aspects of our homeland \n     security.\n\n  He concluded his testimony by stating:\n\n       It is clear the Department of Homeland Security will be \n     built on the pillars of prevention and protection. These are \n     the very words found throughout our strategic plan. They \n     define the mission and the culture of the United States \n     Secret Service.\n\n  I know that the Secret Service enforces certain criminal laws, and it \nhas a good relationship with the Judiciary Committee. However, the fact \nis, it is part of the Department of Homeland Security. If we are going \nto have a committee responsible for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, we should do that. We should not exclude key agencies. \nOtherwise, we are defeating the whole purpose of creating new \njurisdiction and trying to consolidate oversight and responsibility for \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if the distinguished Senator from Maine would \nyield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I have yielded the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the distinguished Senator from Maine, we have the \nSecret Service in Homeland Security, but carved out is a separate \nentity, partly because of their criminal jurisdiction and the fact that \ntheir oversight is in the Judiciary Committee. I would ask if by the \nsame logic that because they are there, they must suddenly come under \nthis new committee, do we also bring the Attorney General's office \nunder this new committee for oversight because they prosecute the cases \nbrought by the Secret Service? Do we bring the U.S. attorneys? Maybe \nthe Attorney General and the U.S. attorney should be brought into this \nnew homeland security committee for confirmation, for oversight, or \nbudget and everything else because, after all, they have criminal \njurisdiction and the Secret Service goes to them.\n  Or do we have a bifurcated thing where the Secret Service criminal \njurisdiction, which does come under the Department of Justice and the \nU.S. attorneys for prosecution, suddenly say: Well, we can watch what \nthey are doing in the Judiciary Committee, but maybe we shouldn't be \nwatching because maybe it should be somewhere else where there is none \nof the 56 years of experience watching over it?\n  It seems to me what we are doing is trying to set up an \norganizational chart for the sake of organizational charts. I might \nsay, maybe this is one of the problems with putting this thing together \nbehind closed doors, without the input of the people most directly \ninvolved, without any hearings. And suddenly as the airplanes are \nrevving up and the smell of jet fuel is in the air, we are saying: \nQuick, we have to do it, forget the 56 years, forget what has worked. \nForget the fact that it is working. Forget the fact that it works \nextremely well. Forget all those criminal cases that they handle. We \nhave an idea to fill out some new chart and, therefore, go forward with \nit. Forget the proud tradition of the Secret Service. Forget all the \nexperience, all the things they have done. Forget the prosecutors they \nhave to go to. But, by golly, we are going to have a nice new chart.\n  There is more I could say but I shan't. I think maybe we ought to \nvote and see where we stand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont raised a \nrhetorical question, or at least I think it was a rhetorical question. \nHe said, Should we put the Office of the Attorney General under the \njurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee? Of course, the \nanswer to that is obviously no, because the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral is not part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The issue before us is really straightforward and simple. Do we want \nto follow the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and Secretary \nRidge and the rest of the administration and have a single authorizing \ncommittee in the House and the Senate with responsibility for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, not responsibility for 38 percent of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, not responsibility for 8 percent \nof the employees of the Department of Homeland Security? No, there \nisn't a recommendation to have agencies that are not part of the \nDepartment added to the jurisdiction.\n\n  The idea is to have a single authorizing committee in the House and \nthe Senate to mirror the agencies that are in the Department of \nHomeland Security, to consolidate jurisdiction between the House and \nSenate, which is spread over 88 committees and subcommittees; so that \nthe officials of the Department don't have to answer to so many \ncongressional overseers that they are prevented from devoting as much \nattention as they need to to do their duties. That is what this debate \nis about.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine, in asking the \nquestion actually gives my answer, because if the issue is simply where \nare they sitting, that determines jurisdiction. The Secret Service, for \nyears and years, would have been under the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee because they are in the Treasury Department. They have been \nin the Treasury Department forever. But the jurisdiction has been under \nthe Judiciary Committee because of their unique law enforcement \naspects.\n  Now, the Senator from Maine says, quite properly, we should not put \nthe Attorney General under this committee, even though these various \ngroups, various entities for criminal prosecution have to go to the \nU.S. attorney but because the Attorney General is under the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  By the same token, when the Secret Service was in Treasury, everybody \nknew, because of the criminal jurisdiction and involvement, they would \nbe under the jurisdiction of a committee that deals all the time with \ncriminal law, with the courts, and with title 18. This is title 18 in \nmy hand, the Federal Criminal Code and Rules. Taking up the whole \nmiddle part of this is Secret Service jurisdiction.\n  Do we want to make them better? Do we want proper oversight? Do we \nwant to say, by golly, look at this, we came out with this closed door \nitem and put it out here and immediately the Senate has saved the \nworld--no hearings, nothing? Here it is.\n  I am far more interested in having the Secret Service be the best it \ncan be. I am far more interested in making sure we are giving them the \nproper criminal codes they need. I am far more interested in making \nsure, when they are investigating crime, they can do their best.\n  I think what Senator Hatch and I are trying to save the Senate from \ndoing is making a very serious mistake with the Secret Service, just to \nfill out an organizational chart.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Utah in the Chamber. I \nwill yield in a moment.\n  But I point out, in talking about the number of places Secretary \nRidge may have to appear, he has only come to the Judiciary Committee \nonce in each of the last 2 years. It is not like he is coming often.\n  But the point is, the Secret Service has 56 years of experience of \nmaking sure it works right. We are going to throw that overboard \nbecause we got this brand-new color-coded organizational chart for the \nSenate. My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, you can rest easy tonight, \nthere will be no more terrorism because the Senate has a new \norganizational chart. Whoop-de-do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't think there is anybody on this \nfloor who respects the chairlady of the appropriate committee and the \nranking\n\n[[Page S10659]]\n\nmember more than I do. I think the world of both of them. I think they \ndeserve a commendation for what they have done. I just cannot pay \nenough tribute to them. I know they are sincere.\n  I want everybody here to know that I don't have an ax to grind. I \nhave a reputation for trying to do what is right. I am very sincere \nabout this. It is not a question of trying to retain jurisdiction for \nretention's sake. This is really important. I believe we should have a \ncommittee on homeland security. I believe it should have jurisdiction \nover much of the area that applies to terrorism. But I also sincerely \nbelieve--and I think the case is overwhelming--that most of what the \nSecret Service does is pursuant to the Criminal Code.\n  The Judiciary Committee is specifically and especially geared to \nhandle oversight of those problems. You don't have to completely \ndevelop a whole new system of oversight. It has worked marvelously well \nfor 56 years.\n  At the end of the day, the Secret Service is a criminal investigative \nagency. Sure, they may have some peripheral and even very important \ninterests in terrorism, but their interests go way beyond that. Almost \neverything they do comes because of what the Criminal Code tells them \nto do.\n  The Secret Service's criminal authority is much broader than homeland \nsecurity and counterterrorism. Let me review some of the longstanding \ncriminal laws. I will just review some of them. These are criminal \nstatutes and they are important, and the Secret Service works pursuant \nto these statutes.\n  It has jurisdiction to investigate acceptance of loan or gratuity by \nfinancial institution examiners; punishment for section 213, the prior \nsection I mentioned; section 471, counterfeiting U.S. obligations; \nsection 472, uttering counterfeit securities; section 473, dealing in \ncounterfeiting obligations of securities; section 474, possession of \ndevice to counterfeit obligations; section 476, theft of tools used in \ncounterfeiting obligations; section 477, selling of tools for \ncounterfeiting obligations; section 478, counterfeiting of foreign \nobligations; section 479, uttering counterfeit foreign obligations; \nsection 480, possessing counterfeit foreign obligations. This is all \npursuant to title 18 USC. Section 481, possession of electronic images \nfor counterfeiting foreign obligations; section 482, forgery or \ncounterfeiting bank notes; section 483, uttering counterfeit foreign \nbank notes; section 484, fraudulently combining multiple U.S. \ninstruments; section 485, counterfeiting U.S. coins; section 486, \nunauthorized passing of U.S. coins; section 487, making or possessing \ncounterfeit dyes for coins; section 488, making or possessing \ncounterfeit dyes for foreign coins; section 489, making or possessing a \nlikeness of U.S. or foreign coins.\n  I will not read the rest. But it goes right down the Criminal Code \nwhere they spend almost all their time. If you ask virtually anybody in \nthe Secret Service, they believe the jurisdiction ought to be kept with \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  I do not think there is any question. I know the head of the Secret \nService does. There is no question they have overlapping jurisdiction \nin some areas where they can help with terrorism, but that is a modest \namount of what they do.\n  Most all of what they do involves technical Criminal Code laws, and \nthat is judiciary, and the Judiciary Committee is especially equipped \nto handle those type of activities.\n  The Judiciary Committee has a long history of balancing civil \nliberties with law enforcement obligations. The Secret Service carries \nout a host of law enforcement activities.\n  Let's face it, the Judiciary Committee is uniquely qualified and \nuniquely structured to vigorously oversee and monitor this balance. My \noffice received a letter from organizations from the ACLU to the \nAmerican Conservative Union expressing civil liberties concerns with \nthis reorganization.\n  Look, I understand my two colleagues and their desire to try to bring \neverything together, but if you use this as an excuse to do that--in \nfact, one agency or another might have something to do with terrorism, \nbut that is not its major obligation--my gosh, you might as well take \nover the whole Government.\n  I think this works well. If it ``ain't'' broke, why are we trying to \nfix it? I believe very sincerely that my two esteemed colleagues, as \nmuch as I love and respect them, are wrong on this. I can live with \nanything the Senate decides to do, but I think it would be tragic if \nthe Secret Service is moved over to this Department and this committee \nthat is not particularly the committee that should have jurisdiction \nover it and over the work that the Secret Service does.\n  I do not want to keep the Senate any longer. All I can say is, I \nwould feel badly if this amendment is not agreed to by the Senate. It \nshould be agreed to by the Senate. I am prepared to vote on it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier we discussed Judiciary Committee \njurisdiction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   October 7, 2004\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Capitol Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Capitol Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Capitol Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Capitol Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We write to raise serious concerns about a \n     provision of S. Res. 445, the McConnell-Reid Senate \n     Intelligence and Homeland Security Oversight Reform Proposal, \n     that would create a new Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs Committee.\n       While we commend the Senate for taking strong actions to \n     revamp congressional oversight of the Executive Branch's \n     intelligence and homeland security functions, we strongly \n     oppose any action to remove from the Judiciary Committee its \n     jurisdiction over criminal law, law enforcement, domestic \n     intelligence activities, domestic surveillance authorities, \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of \n     Justice, and investigative guidelines issued by the Attorney \n     General. As organizations with longstanding expertise and \n     experience in these areas, we believe it is essential at this \n     critical time in our Nation's history that the Judiciary \n     Committee retain its jurisdiction over these issues and \n     ensure continuity of congressional oversight. Its members and \n     staff have developed years of experience in these complex \n     legal issues, which have serious implications not only for \n     safety and security but also for civil liberties and civil \n     rights. In particular, the Judiciary Committee's deep \n     substantive expertise and historical role in civil liberties \n     issues is increasingly important as government powers expand \n     to fight terrorism.\n       We urge you to clarify that jurisdiction over these law \n     enforcement and domestic intelligence issues, including \n     oversight of the FBI and Justice Department, remain with the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression.\n       American Civil Liberties Union.\n       American Conservative Union.\n       American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n       American Library Association.\n       Bill of Rights Defense Committee.\n       Center for American Progress.\n       Center for Democracy and Technology.\n       Center for National Security Studies.\n       Citizens for Health.\n       Cyber Privacy Project.\n       Free Congress Foundation.\n       Friends Committee on National Legislation (Quaker).\n       Human Rights Watch.\n       National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.\n       National Coalition of Mental Health Professionals and \n     Consumers, Inc.\n       Peoople for the American Way.\n       Private Citizen, Inc.\n       The Rutherford Institute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, let me sum up. This amendment poses the \nquestion, Are we really going to do what the 9/11 Commission asked us \nto do, which is to create a committee to oversee the Department of \nHomeland Security? That is what it is all about.\n  We reorganized the Federal Government executive branch to better \nprotect our homeland security. The Commission says we have to \nreorganize our\n\n[[Page S10660]]\n\noversight to be able to protect our homeland security. That is what the \nproposal of the Commission is all about.\n  We are getting to a point, as we begin to take all these pieces out, \nwhere it is a sham, as I have said before. What we are calling a \nhomeland security committee is not really. It is as if you had a cat, \nand you put a little necklace around its neck with a sign that said, \n``I am a horse,'' and expected people to think the cat was a horse.\n  We are at a point now where we are calling this committee the \nhomeland security committee, and it is not.\n  Let me go to the numbers in closing. There are 175,000 employees in \nthe Department. The McConnell-Reid proposal takes out the Coast Guard \nand TSA. That is 97,000 of those 175,000 employees gone. Earlier today, \nmy friends from the Judiciary Committee took back Immigration, Customs \nenforcement, Customs, and border protection, another almost 19,000 \nemployees gone from what is supposed to be the oversight committee of \nhomeland security.\n  It was said earlier that what is left is a lot in our committee--\nthree of the four directorates. OK, I know the number of employees does \nnot say everything, but it does say a lot. Three directorates left in \nthe oversight responsibility of the committee we are calling the \nhomeland security committee, three directorates from DHS: emergency \npreparedness, 4,800 employees; intelligence analysis and infrastructure \nprotection, 700 employees; science and technology, about 200 employees. \nWe have about 5,700 employees left in the three directorates that come \nunder the new committee on homeland security from the Homeland Security \nDepartment. That is 5,700 out of a total of 175,000 in the Department.\n  Let me give this stunning statistic, Mr. President. Are you ready? \nThe Secret Service itself has 6,381 employees. That is about 500 more \nemployees than in the three directorates that are left clearly within \nthe jurisdiction of the committee being called the homeland security \ncommittee.\n  As I have said, if you want to give the responsibility for oversight \nof homeland security to another committee, do it. If you want to create \na new committee on homeland security, do it. But if you are going to \ncall it a committee on homeland security, then give it jurisdiction \nover homeland security.\n  A lot of the reality of the promise has already been taken away. I \nhope my colleagues will draw a line here and say that the Secret \nService, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security for very \ngood reasons that I enumerated earlier, should remain under the \njurisdiction for oversight of what we will call the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthe Hatch amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4037.

Mr. President, Senator Roberts has a couple of \namendments that he believes have been cleared with everyone interested \nin them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President. The two leaders have indicated \nthey want to press forward on this resolution tonight. We still have a \nnumber of amendments. They are completing in the House, as we speak, \nthe FSC conference report, the conference dealing with the drought aid \nand the hurricane assistance, and we have to deal with those in the \nnext few days, so we need to finish this bill tonight if at all \npossible. The two leaders have instructed their two loyal assistants to \nmove forward on this resolution, and that is what we are going to do. \nSo everyone who has amendments should bring them forward. If there is a \ntime when no one is offering amendments, we will move to third reading \non the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have two amendments to offer. I wish to \noffer them in sequence, taking 2 minutes at most for each one. I \npropose to only give a very brief description of each amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4019 To Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I call up amendment No. 4019.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4019 to amendment No. 3981.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 400 is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``Sec. 15. (a) In addition to other committee staff \n     selected by the select Committee, the select Committee shall \n     hire or appoint one employee for each member of the select \n     Committee to serve as such Member's designated representative \n     on the select Committee. The select Committee shall only hire \n     or appoint an employee chosen by the respective Member of the \n     select Committee for whom the employee will serve as the \n     designated representative on the select Committee.\n       ``(b) The select Committee shall be afforded a supplement \n     to its budget, to be determined by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, to allow for the hire of each employee who \n     fills the position of designated\n\n[[Page S10661]]\n\n     representative to the select Committee. The designated \n     representative shall have office space and appropriate office \n     equipment in the select Committee spaces.

Mr. President, this amendment simply clarifies language \nin the McConnell-Reid amendment regarding the staffing of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  The amendment ensures that the professional staff of the Intelligence \nCommittee and the personal staff now designated by Members to serve on \nthe committee will be provided similar access to committee resources \nand information as determined by the chairman and vice chairman.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank Senator Kyl \nfor his assistance. It provides modest but important clarity to the \nproposals of Senator McConnell and Senator Reid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, strengthening the two congressional \nIntelligence Committees was a fundamental part of the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations for improving congressional oversight. This is more of \nthat. They made many recommendations, most of which were included in \nwhole or in part in our resolution.\n  One area where the Commission did not make a specific recommendation \nbut which is very important was the question of shared jurisdiction \nbetween the Intelligence Committee and other committees, specifically \nthe Armed Services Committee. Under the current structure, other \ncommittees have the automatic right to receive sequential referral of \nany legislation reported by the Intelligence Committee if it touches on \ntheir jurisdiction. And the Intelligence Committee enjoys a reciprocal \nright of referral. In practice, this authority has been exercised \nhardly at all--very rarely, infrequently--at least by the Intelligence \nCommittee, but it has become a bit of an annual routine for the Armed \nServices Committee to seek sequential referral of the intelligence \nauthorization bill. This practice is based upon legitimate interests on \nthe part of the Armed Services Committee. But the system has worked to \nthe detriment of the Intelligence Committee and effective oversight. I \nwill try to explain why.\n  Every year the intelligence authorization bill is referred to the \nArmed Services Committee for a period of not more than 30 days of \nlegislative session. The Armed Services Committee almost always holds \nthe bill for a full 30 days which can, in fact, work out to 2 calendar \nmonths, when you really carry that math out. This allows them to review \nthe bill, which is important and proper, but it puts the Intelligence \nCommittee far behind in the annual legislative process. By which I mean \nby the time the bill is reported, after a sequential referral by the \nArmed Services Committee, acted on by the Senate, and negotiated with \nthe House, the annual appropriations bill often is already enacted into \nlaw.\n  For example, this year our authorization bill has not been dealt \nwith. The appropriations bill has been passed in the Senate. This is an \nawkward way to do business. So we too often have been unable to provide \nthe appropriators with the benefit of the work of the intelligence \noversight committees. Timely passage of the intelligence authorization \nbill would become even more critical with the creation of a new \nappropriations subcommittee on intelligence.\n  In order for this new system to work, the Intelligence Committee has \nto be integral to the whole process. That is the whole point. We have \nto make changes in the way the sequential referral authority works. So \nSenator Evan Bayh offered an amendment to completely strike the \nlanguage that provides for automatic sequential referral, and that is \ncertainly one way to approach it. It has some downsides.\n  The Armed Services Committee and other committees have legitimate \ninterests that need to be protected. Doing away with the provision also \nwould remove the Intelligence Committee's ability to request the \nreferral of legislation reported by other committees when that \nlegislation relates to intelligence matters.\n  Finally, completely removing the referral authority would have the \ninevitable result--and this is sort of the soul of this institution--of \nalienating the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. This is \nsomething we cannot afford and must not do. The committees have to work \ntogether constantly on a wide range of issues.\n\n  To achieve what Senator Bayh and myself and others want, all of us \nseeking more effective intelligence oversight, we have worked out a \ncompromise, I am very happy to report. The amendment I have offered \nsignificantly reduces the amount of time that another committee has \navailable to review legislation reported by the Intelligence Committee \nand vice versa. That time goes from 30 days of legislative session down \nto 10.\n  But hold on. The amendment also makes clear that the clock does not \nbegin until the committee receiving our bill has all the relevant \nclassified annexes available for review which could be thousands of \npages.\n  According to our compromise, an additional 5 days of sequential \nreferral can be added if requested by the majority or the minority \nleaders. That struck people as wise and useful. So when there is a \nlegitimate need to have more scrutiny by the Armed Services Committee, \nthey would make that request, and it would, of course, be granted.\n  This is made easier under the new structure because the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Armed Services Committee are now ex officio \nmembers of the new Intelligence Committee. We welcome their \nparticipation. I don't think it will do anything but strengthen our \ncommittee more. In fact, I think we will end up with five members of \nthe Armed Services Committee on our Intelligence Committee, and that is \ngood.\n  So I thank Senator Bayh for bringing this issue to the attention of \nthe Senate. I thank Senators Levin and Warner for their willingness and \ninsistence on finding a middle ground. I really mean I thank them. I \nthank both the majority and minority leaders who were instrumental in \nreaching this agreement because we were back and forth all day long.\n  Finally, I thank, of course, my chairman, Senator Roberts, for his \nhelp in crafting this compromise. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The amendment has been modified?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the comanager of this bill. We have no \nobjection. We appreciate very much the time and effort of so many \ninvolved to get us to this point.\n  I urge that the amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does any Senator seek recognition on the \namendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4030), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have tried to be silent tonight. If anyone \nwants to come and offer an amendment, I will sit down.\n  People have made statements asking: What is this committee going to \nhave; you have taken everything from them. I am going to read a few of \nthe most important things they have to do. This committee should not be \nconcerned only with the number of employees. They should be concerned \nwith responsibilities.\n  The first directorate, the Directorate for Information Analysis and \nInfrastructure Protection: the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for \nInformation Analysis and Infrastructure Protection.

To perform such other duties relating to such \n     responsibilities as the Secretary may provide.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a big-time focus on the administration of this \nnew committee. This is only part of it. For someone to come to the \nfloor and say they have not given us anything, I have read some of the \nmost important aspects of setting the policy of this country as it \nrelates to defeating terrorism. They may not have the right number of \nemployees, but their responsibilities for setting the policy of this \ncountry are in that committee. Anyone who thinks not, let them see what \nwe have done. This is only the first directorate. There are others. I \nhave not completed reading what is in this directorate.\n  Here are the agencies covered: The Department of State, the CIA, the \nFBI, the National Security Agency, the National Imagery and Mapping \nAgency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n  I have only read a few things of the first directorate. If they had \nnothing else to do during the legislative year than deal with what I \nhave completed reading, it would be a massive undertaking. In addition \nto that, you see, we have not taken any of the responsibilities away \nfrom the Governmental Affairs Committee. They had huge responsibilities \nbefore we gave them this. For people to come on this floor and whine \nand cry about they don't have anything to do, it is not in keeping with \nwhat we have done with this committee.\n  I will go to one other directorate. I have only read a few pages from \nthis directorate. I have read three pages. I have about 15 or 20 more \nhere. I don't feel that I want to spend my time reading that, other \nthan to say they have tremendous responsibilities.\n  Under the Office of Science and Technology, they have another big \njob. This is to ``carry out programs that, through the provision of \nequipment, training, and technical assistance, improve the safety and \neffectiveness of law enforcement technology and improve access by \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.''\n  That is another huge responsibility they have been given.\n\n       In carrying out its mission, the Office shall have the \n     following duties:\n       No. 1. To provide recommendations and advice to the \n     Attorney General.\n       No. 2. To establish and maintain advisory groups (which \n     shall be exempt from the provisions of the Federal Advisory \n     Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.)) to assess the law enforcement \n     technology needs of Federal, State, and local law enforcement \n     agencies.\n       No. 3. To establish and maintain performance standards in \n     accordance with the National Technology Transfer and \n     Advancement Act of 1995 (Public Law 14-113) for, and\n\n[[Page S10664]]\n\n     test and evaluate law enforcement technologies that may be \n     used by Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.\n       No. 4. To establish and maintain a program to certify, \n     validate, and mark or otherwise recognize law enforcement \n     technology products that conform to standards established and \n     maintained by the Office in accordance with the National \n     Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Public Law \n     104-113). The program may, at the discretion of the Office, \n     allow for supplier's declaration of conformity with such \n     standards.\n       No. 5. To work with other entities within the Department of \n     Justice, other Federal agencies, and the executive office of \n     the President to establish a coordinated Federal approach on \n     issues related to law enforcement technology.\n       No. 6. To carry out research, development, testing, \n     evaluation, and cost-benefit analyses in fields that would \n     improve the safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of law \n     enforcement technologies used by Federal, State, and local \n     law enforcement agencies, including, but not limited to--\n       A. weapons capable of preventing use by unauthorized \n     persons, including personalized guns;\n       B. protective apparel;\n       C. bullet-resistant and explosion-resistant glass;\n       D. monitoring systems and alarm systems capable of \n     providing precise location information;\n       E. wire and wireless interoperable communication \n     technologies;\n       F. tools and techniques that facilitate investigative and \n     forensic work, including computer forensics;\n       G. equipment for particular use in counterterrorism, \n     including devices and technologies to disable terrorist \n     devices;\n       H. guides to assist State and local law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       I. DNA identification technologies; and\n       J. tools and techniques that facilitate investigations of \n     computer crime.\n       No. 7. To administer a program of research, development, \n     testing, and demonstration to improve the interoperability of \n     voice and data public safety communications.\n       No. 8. To serve on the Technical Support Working Group of \n     the Department of Defense, and on other relevant interagency \n     panels as requested.\n       No. 9.

To support research fellowships in support of its \n     mission.\n       No. 13. To serve as a clearinghouse for information on law \n     enforcement technologies.\n       No. 14. To represent the United States and State and local \n     law enforcement agencies, as requested, in international \n     activities concerning law enforcement technology.\n       No. 15. To enter into contracts and cooperative agreements \n     and provide grants, which may require in-kind or cash matches \n     from the recipient, as necessary to carry out its mission.\n       No. 16. To carry out other duties assigned by the Attorney \n     General to accomplish the mission of the Office.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a pretty heavy load. I would say if they think \nthey have more time than this, then they have a lot of time. This is \nwhat we believe we have given them, partially. And for anyone to come \nhere and say that these three directorates, plus the fourth--this \ndoesn't give them anything to do, it may not be the number of \nemployees, but there is a large number of employees in the TSA.\n  They have so much. Committees are there to set policy. That is the \nwhole purpose of it, and I have laid out policy directions that they \nhave on which it would take forever for this body to hold hearings.\n  It is very unfair to Senator McConnell and me and the task force \ngenerally to say we did not give them anything. We gave them so much \nyou need a semitruck and trailer to haul the responsibilities alone. I \nhave read only part of them.\n  Senator McConnell will be on the floor shortly. If there are no other \namendments, we will go to final passage. Everybody should know it is \n8:30 at night, and we waited all day. We want to be patient. As I \nindicated, we are going to do our very best to finish this legislation \nas soon as we can.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3986 to Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is an amendment at the desk by \nSenator Byrd, No. 3986. I ask that it be considered. It has been \ncleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3986 to amendment No. 3981.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3986\n\n       At the appropriate place in Sec. 402(b) after the word \n     ``matters,'' insert the following:\n       ``, as determined by the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations''\n  Mr. HARKIN. I didn't hear the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a request to dispense with further \nreading of the amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. An amendment by Senator Byrd relating to the \nresolution we are working.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3986) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4038 to Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is an unnumbered amendment at the \ndesk by Senator Shelby regarding the National Flood Insurance Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Shelby \n     and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered 4038 to \n     Amendment No. 3981.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To retain jurisdiction over the National Flood Insurance Act \n  of 1968, with the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: ``Provided, \n     That the jurisdiction provided under section 101(b)(1) shall \n     not include the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, or \n     functions of the Federal Emergency Management Agency related \n     thereto.''.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am aware of no opposition to the Shelby amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4038) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Delaware has \nan amendment to offer. He has indicated\n\n[[Page S10665]]\n\nhe would be willing to enter into a time agreement which, as far as I \nam concerned, is fine. He has indicated he would take--\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, unless someone else wishes to speak on \nthis, 15 minutes. I think I can do it in 10, but let's say 15 minutes \nto protect myself.\n  Mr. REID. And whoever wishes to speak against him have 15 minutes, \nand Senator Biden have 5 minutes to close if somebody speaks following \nthat.\n  Would that be appropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Could we be informed as to the topic?\n  Mr. REID. The topic of it is Senator Biden and Senator Lugar wish to \nadd the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee \nas ex officio members of the Intelligence Committee, having no voting \nrights or the ability to help establish a quorum.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator for the explanation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Biden \nhave 15 minutes, that someone opposing his amendment have 15 minutes, \nand Senator Biden have 5 minutes to close the debate prior to a vote on \nthe amendment, and that no amendments to the amendment be in order \nprior to a vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4021 To Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nlaid aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. BIDEN], for himself and Mr. \n     Lugar, proposes an amendment numbered 4021 to amendment No. \n     3981.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 5, after line 3, insert the following:\n       ``(C) The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations (if not already a member of the select \n     Committee) shall be ex officio members of the select \n     Committee but shall have no vote in the Committee and shall \n     not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum.''.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is very straightforward. Right now, \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee are ex \nofficio members of the Intelligence Committee, with no voting rights, \nno requirement that they be there to make a quorum. Quite frankly, they \nare there to be able to listen when they seek to do that.\n  Senator Lugar and I are proposing the same exact status be made \navailable for the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I know the argument will be, why don't we make everybody, \nevery chairman, every ranking member, ex officio members? But the \nForeign Relations Committee does need access to this information.\n  I know it will come as a shock, but because of the necessary \nrequirement of focusing on certain subject matters, which hopefully we \ngain some expertise on, the Foreign Relations Committee and its \nchairman and ranking member, hopefully, have some insights occasionally \nwhich other Members may not have because they do not spend the time on \nthat issue. Just as in the Armed Services Committee, the ranking member \nand the chairman may have access to information that is not \nintelligence information but is information that would shed light upon \njudgments being made by the Intelligence Committee as a consequence of \ninformation made available by the CIA and other intelligence \noperations. Because, as we all know, intelligence operations can have \nmajor impacts for good or for ill on American foreign policy.\n  I am necessarily, as we all are, restrained from giving contemporary \nexamples of that, but I have been here a long time and go back to the \nperiod of the Cold War. I sat on the Intelligence Committee at the \ntime, but I was not a ranking member. I was on the Intelligence \nCommittee for 10 years, I think as long as anybody who served in this \nbody. There may be somebody who served longer than me on that \ncommittee. But one of the things I learned is occasionally the \nIntelligence Committee would come up with initiatives made available \nunder our special rules, which are necessary, special rules that are \napplicable only to the Intelligence Committee, and access and brief \nonly the Intelligence Committee, and many members on the committee \nwould not be aware that there were totally different operations going \non on a diplomatic front or on an arms control front or on a matter \nrelating to national security that were not explicitly--explicitly--\nintelligence matters.\n  Let me give you a few examples without giving, obviously, the \ndetails, but generic examples. Intelligence collection and analysis are \nessential to the verification of compliance with arms control and \nnonproliferation agreements. A few years ago, we on the Foreign \nRelations Committee heard that a particular intelligence system that is \nimportant to that function--that is, collecting intelligence for \ncompliance on nonproliferation treaties and arms control--we heard that \nfunction was in danger of being lost.\n  We took the initiative. We raised it with the Intelligence Committee \nbecause we had heard this. We let them know what we had heard to make \nsure the executive branch retained this particular system that we \nbelieved, in the Foreign Relations Committee, was essential to a matter \nrelating to nonproliferation, something that most of the members on the \nIntelligence Committee, understandably, serving on many committees \nother than Foreign Relations or Armed Services, did not see the \nparticular relevance of. So when briefed by the Intelligence Committee, \nit seemed all right. It didn't seem like this particular system was \ncritical for a foreign policy initiative that was underway and a treaty \nthat existed. And by the way, we only heard about it from someone in \nthe executive branch who had made it known to a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  Intelligence is also needed to give warning of new dangers and \nopportunities around the world. That may require different capabilities \nfrom those of us who serve on the Armed Services Committee or who \nserved in the Armed Services. The Armed Services Committee rightly \nworries about intelligence support for military operations. Why is that \nunrelated to major diplomatic operations? That can have as much \nconsequence on American security as tactical military operations.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has a concern to ensure that there is \na balance, that U.S. intelligence resources are not devoted primarily \nor overwhelmingly to tactical targets. My friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, may disagree with me, but if I translate that, we only have \nso many assets that can be brought to bear. If I can make an analogy to \nthe FBI, there are only 11,600 FBI agents, I think maybe 11,800. By the \nway, I might note, before 9/11 there were only 11,300. So we haven't \ndone much there.\n  But let's assume we say what is going on right now. There is a \ndecision being made that those agents should focus on counterterror. \nThat is a legitimate issue. But what about the Mafia? What about \norganized crime units that deal in drugs that are not involved in \nterror? It is a legitimate issue to debate as to where the resources \nshould be placed. Of that 11,800, you have about 4,000 people to be \nmade available. You only have so many satellites. You only have so many \nagents. You only have so many resources. And, understandably, the Armed \nServices Committee wants to make sure those resources are focused on \nthose tactical issues that are critically important.\n  I am not suggesting they should not. But there should be a voice \nthere that is fully informed on the foreign policy side and has access \nthat other members of the Foreign Relations Committee do not have \nbecause, as we all know, there are certain things that are made \navailable to the Foreign Relations Committee, under our rules, only to \nthe ranking member and only to the chairman and not the whole \nmembership. And so absent having the fact that we have a member who may \nbe brighter than and more informed than the chairman or the ranking \nmember, they don't have the same access. They don't have the same \naccess to all the diplomatic initiatives that are underway.\n\n[[Page S10666]]\n\n  So if it makes sense to have Armed Services have tactical input here, \nit seems to me that this false separation of our foreign policy and our \ndefense policy is one of the reasons we got ourselves in trouble to \nbegin with. What are we doing now? We are agreeing to change the rules. \nWe are about to change the rules, I hope, when we get into reorganizing \nthis body. And we are going to say no longer is a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee not able to serve on Armed Services, and no longer \nis a member of Armed Services not able to serve on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Why? We are going around making sure that there \nare not stovepipes in the Intelligence Committee. We finally figured \nout there should not be stovepipes in terms of information and access \nand expertise as it relates to strategic doctrine, foreign policy, and \ntactical military operations. It is necessary.\n\n  I know of one matter on which we were kept in the dark for some \nmonths, then briefed earlier this year. And we have gotten no \ninformation since. We go back, the chairman and I, and say: We want \nmore information.\n  They say: We already told the Intelligence Committee.\n  Then the Intelligence Committee tells us, which is literally true: We \ncan come and read whatever it is that is there.\n  We all know how this place works. If you are not there in the middle \nof a hearing, if you are not there in that closed session, if you are \nnot able to probe what is being said and have a perspective that may be \ndifferent than the members of the committee, you are not likely to get \nthe information.\n  That is especially true because if we gained information as ex \nofficio members of the Intelligence Committee, we would be bound by the \nsame nondisclosure rules that apply to other members of the \nIntelligence Committee. I found in my 10 years on the Intelligence \nCommittee--I think that is longer served time than anybody who \npresently sits on the Intelligence Committee, or as long; I could be \nwrong about that--I found, as one of my friends said early on when I \ngot put on that committee originally: I don't want to go on because it \nis like Pac-Man. They will tell you information that you otherwise \ncould learn, but once they have told you, you can't disclose it because \nif you do, even though it appears in the New York Times, you have \nviolated the law.\n  One of the things that is useful, I find that people are much more \nopen with me as a junior member of the Intelligence Committee rather \nthan a 31-year member of the Foreign Relations Committee. So we would \nbe bound by the same rules. The Foreign Relations Committee also has a \nmajor concern for the safety and security of overseas embassies. We \nhave shared that concern in this regard with the Intelligence \nCommittee, which doesn't want to see intelligence personnel or \ninformation put at risk by ineffective security in our embassies. We \nwill be able to pursue that shared interest more effectively if our \nchairman and ranking member have ready access to the information on \nthis security and security around the world.\n  And lastly, because I am getting pretty close here, the idea of being \nable to completely separate the functioning of our State Department and \nthe functioning of the intelligence community in little neat boxes does \nnot comport with reality. That is not how it works.\n  Other than the present chairman of the committee maybe not wanting \nthe Government expense of adding two more chairs at the table, I quite \nfrankly don't understand what the problem is.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, Senator Biden, in his usual flare, has \noffered an amendment to add the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee as ex officio members of the \nIntelligence Committee. Under S. Res. 400, the organizing resolution \nfor the Senate Intelligence Committee, eight members are already \ncrossovers from other committees: two from the Judiciary Committee, two \nfrom Armed Services, two from Appropriations, and two from foreign \nRelations. This is on purpose, because we believe these four committees \nshould have crossover representation on the committee as it now stands. \nThat is under S. Res. 400.\n  With all due respect, I think the members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee--Senator Hagel, Senator Rockefeller--do an excellent job in \nrepresenting the Foreign Relations Committee on the Intelligence \nCommittee. These crossover members do perform an invaluable service for \nthe Intelligence Committee.\n  First, they ensure that the insights and perspectives of the other \nSenate committees are considered in the oversight of the intelligence \nactivities of the United States. And second, they do already provide \nthe Armed Services Committee and the Judiciary Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee and, yes, the esteemed members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, with a view of the Intelligence Committee on \nissues that cross jurisdictional boundaries.\n  Now, under the McConnell-Reid reform proposal, the Intelligence \nCommittee would grow by two ex-officio members already. The chairman \nand ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, the majority and \nminority leaders, already serve as ex-officio members of the committee. \nSo following reform, the Intelligence Committee will be composed of \neight crossover members. If Senator Biden's amendment is successful, \nthere will be six nonvoting ex-officio members.\n  Now, any chairman or any ranking member who has crossover \njurisdiction with any other committee, under this logic, should be an \nex-officio member of the committee. After all, we need to keep an eye \non one another. I have every trust in thee and me, but I wonder about \nthee. This is like Bob Barker: Come on down, be an ex-officio member of \nthe Intelligence Committee. This is empowerment? This is further \ndissolution in terms of the responsibilities and cohesion and \npertinence in regard to the Intelligence Committee.\n  Well, does the Intelligence Committee need that much oversight? Do \nthe guaranteed crossover memberships not really protect sufficiently \nthe equities of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees?\n  As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I said on the Senate floor \nearlier today that I often have concerns with the actions of the Armed \nServices Committee, Foreign Relations Committee, Appropriations \nCommittee, and the Judiciary Committee--not necessarily in that order.\n  Given this logic, as such, given the proliferation of ex-officio \nmemberships, perhaps the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee should have ex-officio membership on other committees with \njurisdiction that overlap the intelligence issues. What is good for the \ngoose is good for the gander. I will leave Members to decide who is the \ngoose and who is the gander. I focus on four primary committees: Armed \nServices, Foreign Relations, Appropriations, and Judiciary. I was going \nto have a second-degree amendment to say, why can't Senator Rockefeller \nand I be ex-officio on these committees if they want to be ex-officio \non our committee? I am not sure exactly what they would do other than \nmonitor. We can certainly find something for them to do as they follow \nthe work of the Intelligence Committee. I could go on. We could have \nex-officio status for Senator Rockefeller and myself for the new \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Banking, Finance, and \nAgriculture Committees. They all have cross-jurisdictional interests \nthat touch on intelligence issues.\n  With only limited exceptions, all Senators have access to the \ninformation and activity of the Intelligence Committee. As chairman, I \nand the distinguished vice chairman, Senator Rockefeller, have invited \nall Senators to come down and take a look at the classified portions of \nthe Iraq review or any other Intelligence Committee product or holding. \nYou are welcome. Just ask. Come on in.\n  The committee assists in the arrangement of classified briefings for \nall Senators by our intelligence agencies. Ex-officio membership is an \nunnecessary requirement and maintains the status of the Intelligence \nCommittee as a weak child of the Senate.\n  Let's not have any further diminution of the Intelligence Committee. \nI\n\n[[Page S10667]]\n\nurge colleagues to oppose the Biden amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, you know, one of the problems of being \naround here a while is that you get in this body and you take things in \na personal context. This has nothing to do with overseeing the \nIntelligence Committee. This is about expanding the capability of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  Let me give my friend an example. I think he totally misses the \npoint. He views this as an assault on the committee, a weakening. We \nare looking at them. I wonder if the Senator is aware that on the \nForeign Relations Committee, there are numerous occasions when the \nranking member and chairman are made aware by the Secretary of State \nand/or the President himself of a diplomatic initiative that they have \nno idea is about to be undertaken. I wonder if he knows that. It is not \nabout the collection of intelligence, it is about a diplomatic \ninitiative.\n  Let me make something up. Assume we were having great difficulty with \nCanada and they are our enemy. The President and Secretary of State \ncall the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee \ndown to get our judgment on whether, if we made the following entree \ndiplomatically to a particular group in Canada--say, Quebec--we might \nbe able to move the ball, and, at the same time, the Intelligence \nCommittee is hearing information that is meat and potatoes, critically \nimportant, that there is an initiative underway in the Intelligence \nCommittee to eavesdrop upon the undertakings of the very people who are \nabout to make this initiative. It might be a useful thing, not an \nassault on the chairman or a diminution of his authority but another \naccess and avenue of, hopefully, an informed person with a different \nperspective on something that is not banking, or it is not agriculture; \nit is serious stuff.\n  We tend, when we think about intelligence, to think only in terms of \ncovert operations and the military. The fact is, that is part of our \nproblem. This false separation of the conduct of American foreign \npolicy and the policy of our strategic doctrine and our tactical \ndoctrine is part of our problem. So this is not about sitting down and \nbabysitting, or whatever the phrase used by my friend was; this is \nabout being collaborative and letting them maybe know a perspective \nthey didn't know.\n  Lastly, we all have access to all kinds of information. The problem \nis, unless we are essentially tasked with the responsibility and \nobligation, there is so much we have to do, we don't get to do it. I \nknow what the chairman is worried about: this guy sitting next to me. I \nhired him in the Intelligence Committee 20 years ago. He sat there for \n10 years. Now he works for me on the Foreign Relations Committee. There \nis a worry--not about my particular colleague on my left--but we will \nhave staff there that will do what they do in every committee if they \nattend a hearing: Mr. Chairman, this is about to happen, and it is a \nsmall thing and it totally conflicts with what you have been told by \nthe Secretary of State and it may be useful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's opening time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Do I have any time beyond that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes to close.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The bottom line is, I wish we would get together in this \nplace and stop viewing everything as sort of an assault on somebody \nelse's jurisdiction. This is not about that. I got off of the \nIntelligence Committee. I was on the Intelligence Committee, the Budget \nCommittee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Judiciary \nCommittee. I concluded that I could not do all four of those, so I got \noff. I gave up the chairmanship of the Budget Committee because I \ndidn't think I could do that and my job on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  The strength of this institution lies in our willingness to recognize \nthe contribution that each of us can make, the perspective we bring to \nthe table, and, occasionally, just maybe a degree of expertise that \nmaybe another colleague doesn't have. I clearly do not have the \nexpertise of my colleague on the Intelligence Committee on intelligence \nmatters now. He is fully, contemporaneously, totally informed. I don't \nhave the competence on matters relating to the Banking Committee and \nthe international banking system as the chairman and ranking member do \nbecause that is their obligation. I don't have the competence my friend \nfrom Alaska has on the Appropriations Committee and how all these \npieces fit together, but I respectfully suggest that I might be able to \ncontribute.\n  Whoever succeeds me--the Senator from Connecticut, I think, is next \nin line to be chairman or ranking member of the Foreign Relations--I \nrespectfully suggest he has a perspective that might be useful.\n  Why do we view this in terms of competition? If you hang around this \nplace long enough, you kind of go through a couple phases, one of which \nis you end up sometimes not recognizing the potential strength that \nlies here.\n  Senator Hagel and Senator Rockefeller are brilliant members of the \nForeign Relations Committee. Senator Rockefeller, because he is the \ncochairman, has not been able to attend one-fifth of our hearings, and \nhe should not be at our hearings. He should be doing the work of the \nIntelligence Committee because that is his primary responsibility. \nSenator Hagel is the same way. They are both incredibly well-informed \npeople. They both serve on the committee, but they do not have the full \naccess Senator Lugar has to every diplomatic initiative that Senator \nLugar may be aware of or the particular concerns or the sensitivity of \na particular initiative and at a particular time.\n  I conclude by saying, I go back to my days on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I happened to be aware, only because Senator Pell made me \naware, of an initiative that was underway in a particular Eastern \nEuropean country. At the time, Mr. Casey and Ugell were running \noperations there. Only because I was made aware by the chairman of the \ncommittee of what he had been briefed on and was allowed to communicate \nwas I able to say in a hearing and I think--I don't know this for a \nfact. I know I asked for two hearings, as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee of the entire Senate. I demanded there be a secret hearing, \nthat we close the doors, only Senators, no staff. It does not often \nhappen because you only have one of two choices when you are informed \nabout what you think is a dangerous initiative that is underway in the \nintelligence community. You go forward and you blow it and you suffer \nthe consequences, you have broken the law, or under the laws, you can \nask for a secret meeting of the Senate.\n  There was an operation that was proposed. This is years ago in the \nearly days of the Reagan administration, relating to the very country \nin which there was a serious diplomatic initiative being made, in a \nsense covertly, not by the intelligence community, but by the State \nDepartment and the White House.\n  When I made the Congress aware of that, it was concluded that maybe \nit was not a good operation, and I signed on that piece of paper. You \nstill have to sign off: I oppose this action. Whether it is because I \ndid that or not, I cannot say, but the action was jettisoned. It was \nill-conceived and totally at odds with the initiative the Reagan \nadministration had going over in another piece of it. I do not know if \nthat was a positive contribution or not, but I can tell you it was a \ndifferent perspective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I believe I have approximately 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator from Delaware, \nwhom I admire for his expertise on foreign policy, I think all of us \nhave an obligation to learn from, to ask, to seek guidance, to seek \nexpertise from other Members, and I hope it is in that spirit that we \nare able to do this.\n  As Chairman of the Emerging Threats Capabilities Subcommittee on \nArmed Services, I work very closely with Senator Lugar on the \nCounterthreat Reduction Program. I do not think I can do the job \nwithout talking to Senator Lugar. Senator\n\n[[Page S10668]]\n\nNunn and Senator Lugar put that together, the Nunn-Lugar program. I \ntalk with Senator Lugar a lot in regard to his perspectives on foreign \npolicy.\n  I have not taken the opportunity that I probably should have to talk \nwith the Senator from Delaware at great length--we talk about some \nthings but certainly not enough. I welcome the Senator to come to the \nIntelligence Committee in regard to any desire he might have to go over \nor to review any of the intelligence material that pertains to foreign \npolicy. All of that does, as a matter of fact. It was the State \nDepartment that pretty much got it right in the WMD review in regard to \npossible WMD in Iraq, and we know that and we respect that. We made a \nspecial effort to invite the State Department in, and we will be happy \nto visit with the Senator from Delaware about that.\n  I yield the remaining time I have to a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee who is always telling me about the need to tie in \nthe relationship with regard to foreign relations and intelligence. He \nis the distinguished vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. We \nwork together in a bipartisan way. We have gone through pretty tough \ntimes. We achieved a 17-to-0 vote in regard to the WMD inquiry.\n  We are not trying to deny information to anybody. We want to share \nit. We want to learn, especially from people such as Senator Biden.\n  I yield my remaining time to Senator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, \nthe Senator from Kansas. I say to the Chair, I was downstairs and I had \na wonderful opportunity to spend some time talking with Senator Byrd. \nWe do not have that much opportunity to talk with each other--all of \nus--and I enjoyed it. Then I began to listen to the conversation. I \nbegan to think, I don't know of any committee in the Congress which is \nmore specifically and more logically set up with respect to \nrepresentation from other committees.\n  We have the Foreign Relations Committee. We have the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have the Appropriations Committee. We have the Armed \nServices Committee. We have general members. We are actually going to \ngrow somewhat smaller probably as a result of this intelligence reform. \nSo everybody is represented.\n  One of the things I have also noticed is that there are a number of \nSenators--unfortunately not the majority of them, but a number of \nthem--who will come in early in the morning, and they will get with my \nstaff or Senator Roberts' staff and they will say: I want to read stuff \nthat I can only read inside these closed facilities. It may be a \nNational Intelligence Estimate. It may be parts of a report. But we \noperate openly within a very discreet and necessarily secreted space.\n  It does not occur to me that Foreign Relations is denied access. \nEverybody, by definition of being a Senator, belongs to the \nIntelligence Committee by way of information. It would be perfectly \nhonest to say sometimes taking the 3 or 4 hours, as a number of \nSenators do, they come in and read and sometimes those are much more \nproductive than even some of the hearings that we might have where \neverybody gets 5-minute questioning rounds, and Senators will take \nthat.\n  Is it true we have a special relationship with the Armed Services \nCommittee? Yes, it is true because a great deal of the Armed Services \nbudget interacts and relates to what is going on in intelligence. This \nevening, we passed a very carefully crafted compromise between \nsequential referral because the relationship between Armed Services and \nIntelligence is necessarily complex and can have tension or less \ntension, and we want to try and keep it having less tension.\n  We have a very small space. Our hearing room is the smallest hearing \nroom I have ever been in, in either the State legislature or the \nSenate. It seems to me the particular committees that have jurisdiction \nare represented. They are represented under S. Res. 400. It is very \nformal, it is very exacting, and just as Senator Lugar--I am so \ndistressed to see Senator Lugar leave the committee because he was so \ngood at it, but that was the 8-year limit, which is now hopefully going \nto disappear.\n  There is representation, I say very honestly to my friend from \nDelaware. There is representation. The Senator is always welcome. The \nSenator has as much right and access--equal and not one-quarter of 1 \npercent less--to what goes on in terms of the intelligence that is \navailable to us, Chairman Roberts or myself and other members of our \ncommittee--now 17, soon to be 15--have.\n  I would just hope that that particular relationship of armed services \nwould be understood. The chairman is on the Armed Services Committee \nand that is a conflict. It tears at him because he is chairman of one \nand very senior on the other, but we work it out. We simply work it out \nbecause we stay with it.\n  Again, I say that being on Intelligence is sort of like 100 percent \nof your time, and I think the quickest way to achieve that is to come \nin and do the reading. I am thinking of a lot of Senators, whose names \nare going through my head as I speak, who do that. They come in at 7 in \nthe morning. My staff and the chairman's staff are there. They \naccommodate them. They say: What do you want to read? And they make it \navailable. They sit down and read and they walk away and they have \ngotten an enormous amount of information.\n  So I think the system works pretty well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I think the committees are accommodating, and I \nwould hope that the Senator would be understanding of that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question? I will be very \nbrief.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I used to have a friend who used to say: You have to know \nhow to know.\n  The Senator has been on the Intelligence Committee long enough to \nknow that unless one is there and they know what has been said, reading \nthe report is not particularly relevant half the time. My question is \nthis: What is the problem? The committee does not have enough seats? \nThe committee does not have enough chairs if we walk in? What is the \ndeal? What is the concern? That we would release the information more \nthan anyone else on the committee might?\n  I mean, I am a little confused. Like from that line in the movie: \nWhat is the story, Richie? What is the problem? What is the downside? \nDo we breathe too much of the oxygen in the room? Are we going to take \nup more time? I do not quite get it.\n  I understand what the Senator says about how we are covering it. What \nI do not understand is, no one has said to me what is the downside of \nSenator Lugar being able to, when he feels like it, show up, sit there \nand ask questions just like the Senator asks questions because he has a \nperspective. I am a little curious about that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would be happy to do my best to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the chairman have 2 minutes \nto respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the distinguished ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, that, in fact, to get into the room space \nis a problem. We do not have a single place to put a single person \nexcept in the back of the room. Now, that embarrasses me to say that, \nbut it is a fact.\n  Secondly, I differ with the ranking member when he says that reading \ndoes not count that much. Reading and knowing the material, whether it \nis WMD or whether it is predictions, or whatever it is, is the greatest \npart of it.\n  The hearings are tremendously important and they are the democratic \npart of it so everybody has a chance to ask questions, but I know of \nnothing which precludes the ranking member being able to do that. For \nexample, to staff, it is a matter of just saying, I want to know the \nanswers.\n  The Senator has the same privileges on Intelligence that this Senator \ndoes, I would say through the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do not believe that is accurate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n[[Page S10669]]\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Before going to the vote, I will say that I am aware \nof only two, possibly three, amendments remaining. We are still hoping \nto push forward. I know Senator Craig is here, and I believe he is \nprepared to offer an amendment. It is still our hope that we can press \nthrough to final passage tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4021.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

This has been a very long \nday. I know people are exhausted. We have a lot more work to do. We \nwill continue for a while. Again, no more rollcall votes tonight.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Our two managers have done a wonderful job in getting us \nto this point. It is very important now to know what amendments are \nleft. If they can be submitted tonight, we will work on a finite list \nand try to get that finite list locked in tonight or first thing \ntomorrow to work through what amendments remain.\n  Our two managers are to be congratulated for a job well done today. \nWe will try to finish tomorrow.\n  Mr. FRIST. For planning purposes, because people are asking how long \nwe will be around, we are really having to take this an hour at a time. \nThe plans remain, as the Democratic leader and I have said all week, we \nwill complete this bill. We are going to deal with FSC/ETI, the jobs \nmanufacturing bill, and we will complete Homeland Security \nappropriations before we leave.\n  We have been fairly clear about the schedule, and everyone has worked \nvery hard, but it means we will stay here until we finish. So we will \nbe here tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, or whenever we complete \nour work. I don't know how long that will take. Everyone knows what the \nbills are. We have again and again asked for people to focus on the \nbills. Members have done a very good job. People are very tired.\n  Rather than break and spend all next week or even the week after \nthat, we have decided to go straight through. We know what the business \nis. The objectives are as I said. And we will again--it is late \ntonight--we will start early tomorrow morning, and we will complete \nbusiness before we leave.\n  No more rollcall votes tonight.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4040 to Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. On behalf of Senator Domenici and myself, I send an \namendment to the desk. I understand it has been agreed to by both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for Mr. \n     Domenici, for himself and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4040 to amendment No. 3981.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To transfer jurisdiction over organization and management of \n  United States nuclear export policy to the Committee on Energy and \n                           Natural Resources)\n\n       Section 101(b) is amended by--\n       (1) striking paragraph (10); and\n       (2) adding at the end the following:\n     ``Matters relating to organization and management of United \n     States nuclear export policy (except programs in the \n     Department of Homeland Security) shall be referred to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.''.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We support the amendment. It is an excellent, necessary \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4040) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Vitiation Of Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sure that everyone in good faith \noffered the amendment, but the action that was taken by the Senate has \nto be rescinded. The managers of the bill were not aware of what was \ngoing on. Anyone interested in this had no knowledge of what was going \non. It is simply not the right thing to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the action taken by the Senate on \namendment No. 4040 be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I certainly have no objection. I thought \nthis had been agreed to by both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, both managers of the bill were engaged \nin conversation here. There was a misunderstanding about whether the \nDomenici amendment had been approved. Senator Reid correctly asked that \nthe vote be vitiated.\n\n[[Page S10670]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Is there objection to the \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand there is no quorum call in \nprogress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                              Overtime Pay\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, America is stuck in a jobless recovery. \nThis jobless recovery is not an accident. It is in large measure the \nresult of failed economic policies, policies that the Bush \nadministration stubbornly clings to. Despite the loss of millions of \nprivate sector jobs over the last 3 and a half years, this \nadministration has embraced offshore outsourcing. It has been against \nextending unemployment insurance for the long-term unemployed. It is \nadamant against raising the minimum wage. And it has been determined to \neliminate time-and-a-half overtime pay for millions of American \nworkers.\n  It is time, I believe, for us to chart a new course. It is time for \nWashington to listen to ordinary working Americans. They are telling us \nloudly and clearly that their No. 1 issue is economic security. They \nare telling us that they fear losing their jobs, their health care, and \ntheir retirement.\n  Now they also fear losing their right to time-and-a-half compensation \nfor overtime. They fear, with good reason, that under the Department of \nLabor's new rules, they will be obliged to work a 50- or 60-hour week \nwith zero additional compensation. For millions of working Americans \nthis is unacceptable, and it is the last straw.\n  Accordingly, we have repeatedly offered an amendment to stop the Bush \nadministration's new rules to eliminate overtime pay protections for \nmillions of American workers. That amendment was voted on numerous \ntimes in the Senate and passed both by strong bipartisan majorities. It \nalso has the overwhelming support of the American public. Yet despite \nthis clear expression of the will of Congress and the public, my \novertime amendment was stripped earlier in the year from the Omnibus \nappropriations bill in conference and again this week in the conference \non the FSC-ETI bill.\n  But my overtime amendment will be back, and it will be back by \npopular demand. It amazes me, wherever I travel in the United States, \npeople come up to me to talk about this overtime issue. They know what \nthe administration is doing. They are angry. They want action to stop \nthese new overtime rules.\n  Frankly, at this point, the administration has zero credibility on \nthis issue. The Department of Labor claims that it simply wants to give \nemployers a clearer guide as to who is eligible for overtime pay. But \nordinary Americans are not buying this happy talk. They know the \nadministration has put into effect a radical rewrite of the Nation's \novertime rules. They know these new rules strip millions of workers \nfrom the right to fair compensation.\n  The American people are right. Plain and simple, the new overtime \nrules are a frontal attack on the 40-hour workweek, proposed initially \nby the administration without a single public hearing.\n  The new rules could effectively end overtime pay in dozens of \noccupations, including nurses, police officers, clerical workers, air \ntraffic controllers, social workers, even journalists. Indeed, the new \ncriteria for excluding employees from overtime are deliberately vague \nand elastic, so as to stretch across vast swaths of the workforce.\n  Listen to Mary Schlichte, a nurse in Cedar Rapids, IA. Here is what \nshe said:\n\n       Many nurses just like me work long hours in a field with \n     very stressful working conditions and little compensation. . \n     . . Our patients rely on us, and our families depend on us. \n     We need overtime pay so we can stay in the profession we love \n     and still make ends meet.\n\n  Ms. Schlichte told me about her nurse colleagues in Cedar Rapids who \nalso rely on overtime pay. One nurse is married to a struggling farmer, \nand she relies on overtime pay to cover their insurance premiums. They \nalready fear losing their farm, she says, and now they fear losing \ntheir health care, too.\n  Dixie Harms is a longtime trainer of nurses in Des Moines. Ms. Harms \ntold me:\n\n       If overtime is changed for hospital nurses, we will see a \n     mass exodus of registered nurses from the hospital setting \n     because they will get fed up and refuse to ``volunteer'' so \n     many hours doing what they love doing.\n  Three years ago, after the terrible September 11 attacks, many here \nin Washington spoke eloquently about the heroism of our firefighters, \npolice officers, first responders, and public safety workers. Ever \nsince, America's first responders have worked long hours to protect us \nfrom terrorist threats. But the administration even wanted to deny \nthese workers time-and-a-half compensation for those longer hours. This \nis wrong.\n  Since passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, overtime \nrights and the 40-hour workweek have been sacrosanct, respected by \nPresidents of both parties. But alas, it is not sacred to this \nadministration. For 65 years, the 40-hour workweek has allowed workers \nto spend time with their families instead of toiling past dark and on \nweekends. At a time when family dinner is becoming an oxymoron, this \nstandard is more important than ever.\n  These radical revisions are antiworker and antifamily. And given the \nfact that we are stuck in a jobless recovery, the timing of this attack \non overtime could not be worse. It is yet another instance of this \nadministration's economic malpractice. Bear in mind that time-and-a-\nhalf pay accounts for some 25 percent of the total income of Americans \nwho work overtime. With average U.S. incomes declining, the proposed \nchanges would slash the paychecks of millions of white-collar workers.\n  Moreover, the new rules are all but guaranteed to hurt job creation \nin the United States. Isn't this just basic logic? If employers can \nmore easily deny overtime pay, they will push their current employees \nto work longer hours without compensation. With millions of Americans \ncurrently out of work, why would we give employers yet another \ndisincentive to hire new workers?\n  It is bad enough to deny 6 million workers their overtime rights, but \nwhat is striking is the mean-spiritedness of the Department of Labor. \nThe Department offered employers what amounts to a cheat sheet. It \noffered employers helpful tips on how to avoid paying overtime to the \nlowest paid workers, the same workers who are supposedly helped by the \nnew overtime rules.\n  For example, the Department suggested cutting a worker's hourly wage \nso that any new overtime payments will not result in a net gain to the \nemployee. It also recommended raising a worker's salary slightly to \nmeet the threshold at which eligibility for time-and-a-half pay ends. \nThis is just disgraceful. But it gets worse. The administration's \nscheme specifically targeted veterans, categorizing many as \nprofessionals even if they do not hold a professional degree or receive \nthe same salary as degreed professionals.\n  Think about it: The administration opted to deny overtime pay to \nfirst responders, police officers, and firefighters who put their lives \non the line protecting us here at home. It also aimed to take away \novertime from veterans who put their lives on the line overseas. This \nmay seem outrageous to most Americans, but some major employers are \nvery pleased.\n  Here is a portion of the Boeing Corporation's comments on the \nDepartment's rules:\n\n       Many of [Boeing's] most skilled technical workers received \n     a significant portion of their knowledge and training outside \n     the university classroom, typically any branch of the \n     military service . . . Boeing thus supports the department's \n     focus on the knowledge used by the employee performing her \n     job rather than the source of the knowledge or skill . . .\n\n  The National Association of Manufacturers made similar comments. Let \nme quote:\n\n       NAM applauds the department for including this alternative \n     means of establishing that an employee has the knowledge \n     required for the exemption to apply. This addition is \n     entirely consistent with the realities of the current \n     workplace and the purpose of the Fair Labor Standards Act. \n     For example, many people who come out of the military have \n     significant knowledge based on work experience but have not \n     had ``a prolonged course of specialized intellectual \ninstruction.''\n\n  Understandably, veterans were deeply disturbed by the \nadministration's\n\n[[Page S10671]]\n\nproposed new rules. For example, Vietnam Veterans of America wrote to \nthe Secretary of Labor and said:\n\n       [Veterans] who have received military training equivalent \n     to a specialized degree could now be classified as a \n     professional employee and lose their right to overtime. This \n     will be true even if the veterans in question do not earn the \n     higher pay afforded to those with an advanced degree or with \n     supervisory/management positions.\n\n  The organization further complained that this legitimizes the already \nextensive problems of discrimination against veterans.\n  And this is from the national president of the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, Thomas Corey:\n\n       Therefore, we would like to make you aware that the \n     proposed modification of the rules would give employers the \n     ability to prohibit veterans from receiving overtime pay \n     based on the training they received in the military . . . The \n     proposed rule changes will make these veterans and their \n     families unfairly economically vulnerable in comparison with \n     their non-veteran peers. We hope you will agree that the men \n     and women who have served our Nation so well in military \n     service should not be penalized for having served.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to express my sadness with the \nactions of the Senate these last 2 days and express why I will oppose \nthe resolution to reorganize the Senate. I will vote against the \nresolution because it was supposed to improve the manner in which this \nChamber overseas the intelligence and homeland security issues. As of \nnow, it will do no such thing. In fact, it is a step backward because \nwe have claimed to have taken action when in reality little has \nchanged.\n  Make no mistake, the status quo rules the day and underscores the \nobservation that the Senate has failed to change the way it conducts \noversight of intelligence and homeland security issues as recommended \nby the 9/11 Commission.\n  First, the 9/11 Commission recommended we establish a single \ncommittee, each House of Congress, combining authorizing and \nappropriating authorities. However, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, which I supported, \nthat would have given the Select Committee on Intelligence \nappropriating power that would substantially reform the manner in which \nthis body conducts oversight of intelligence. The actions of the Senate \nfly in the face of the 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n  Without this power, I anticipate that the problems that have been \ndescribed by Senator McCain and Senator Roberts during this debate will \ncontinue. In many instances, the executive branch agencies will pay \ntheir authorizing committees lip service and go behind their backs to \nthe Appropriations Committee to get what they want. All you have to do \nis talk to members of the Intelligence Committee and you will \nunderstand why it is so important that they have the appropriations \npower.\n  If we are going to be asking people to serve on a Select Intelligence \nCommittee and we don't give them the appropriations, then why serve on \nthe committee, because it will be more of the same that we have had \naround here for the last several years?\n  I have seen it time and again in my first term. We do a poor job of \noversight because authorizing committees lack the power of the purse. \nThe defeat of the McCain amendment will only continue to make oversight \nof intelligence more difficult than necessary.\n  Second, the Senate took up this resolution to fulfill the \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission that there should be a single \nauthorizing committee in each House of Congress for the Department of \nHomeland Security, just as we have for the Department of Defense, \nDepartment of State, and Department of Justice.\n  Again, what we did flies in the face of the recommendation. We have \nseen amendment after amendment offered and accepted by this body, which \nguts the authorizing jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security \nand governmental affairs. Instead of having a single authorizing \ncommittee, the Department of Homeland Security will have at least four. \nMany of my colleagues took the floor and insisted the exceptions they \nwere carving out of the jurisdiction of the homeland security committee \nhad nothing to do with turf. Baloney. It had everything to do with \nturf.\n  At a time when our national security is in jeopardy, the American \npeople should be upset and concerned with what we have seen on the \nfloor of the Senate when we should be concerned about our homeland \nsecurity. All of us in the Senate understand that we are in jeopardy \nfrom what we are doing in our respective offices to make sure our \npeople are being taken care of here.\n  As a result of the turn of events, it is a farce to rename the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs the committee on homeland security \nand governmental affairs. It is no such thing. It has jurisdiction over \na small percentage of the employees of the Department and less than 40 \npercent of the budget.\n  Let me repeat that we didn't even give the proposed homeland security \ncommittee the jurisdiction over either the majority of the budget or \nthe personnel of the Department.\n  When we return in November--maybe in January--I will seek to offer an \namendment to restore the name of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. \nIf we are not going to create a homeland security committee, let's not \npretend that we are. Let's not pretend. Things have not really changed \nat all, in my opinion. I hope that what the Senate has done is reported \nacross America, so that our constituents can see what we have done and \ntell us what a lousy job we did. Then maybe we can come back during the \nlameduck session in November and pass a reorganizing resolution that \nactually makes a difference and is guided solely by what is in the best \ninterest of our country and not the best interest of each individual \nSenator.\n  A few years ago, the Committee on Governmental Affairs held a hearing \nat which the Comptroller General testified on the preparedness of the \nexecutive branch to meet the 21st century challenges facing America. I \nam reminded of that hearing and I ask, Is the Senate prepared to meet \nthe challenges of the 21st century? Are we capable of making the \nchanges necessary to meet both the great dangers and wonderful \nopportunities we have before us? These last few days would indicate \nthat we are not.\n  Shame on the Senate, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the proposed reform to \nstrengthen our oversight of the intelligence community.\n  We just passed sweeping, historic legislation to reform America's \nentire intelligence community. It was a very good bill that will \ngreatly strengthen our ability to develop good intelligence and fight \nterrorism.\n  The National Intelligence Reform Act fulfills what I consider the \npriorities for intelligence reform, including many reforms I have been \nfighting for: A strong National Intelligence Director to lead and \nmanage the intelligence community. A National Counter Terrorism Center \nso we have unity of effort to combat terrorism. Information sharing so \nanalysts can connect the dots. An Inspector General for the entire \nintelligence community. Strong alternative analysis or red-teaming. An \nombudsman so our intelligence professionals can speak truth to power. \nAnd protection for civil liberties and privacy.\n  But reform of our intelligence community is only half the job. We \nmust also reform our oversight of the intelligence community. As the 9/\n11 Commissioners said, reforming intelligence without reforming \noversight is like one hand clapping.\n  The 9/11 Commission report says that, ``Of all our recommendations, \nstrengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult \nand important.'' Our leaders gave this ``most difficult and important'' \ntask to two of our most esteemed colleagues: Senator Reid and Senator \nMcConnell. I thank them for their leadership. And thank the entire \nbipartisan working group. I thank them for their creativity, \ncooperation and consideration\n\n[[Page S10672]]\n\nto develop the substance of the proposal now before the Senate.\n  I support all three key recommendations of the bipartisan working \ngroup: to create an appropriations subcommittee for Intelligence; to \nstrengthen the Select Committee on Intelligence; and to create a \nHomeland Security Committee. Let me talk about each of these \nrecommendations.\n  The bipartisan working group proposal, and the rule we are now \nconsidering, will create an appropriations subcommittee for \nIntelligence. I believe this is one of the most important reforms we \ncan make to strengthen Congressional oversight of the intelligence \nbudget. That's why I wrote to Senator McConnell and Senator Reid urging \nthem to do this.\n  Some of my colleagues point out that the 9/11 Commission recommended \ncreating a combined authorization and appropriations committee for \nintelligence. But that was just one option mentioned in the 9/11 \nCommission Report.\n  The 9/11 Commission Report also included two provisions supporting an \nIntelligence Appropriations subcommittee:\n  The 9/11 Commission, on page 410 of its report, criticized the \nintelligence appropriations process, noting that ``the final budget \nreview is handled in the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittees. Those committees have no subcommittees just for \nintelligence, and only a few members and staff review the requests.''\n  The 9/11 Commission included the following recommendation on page 416 \nof its report: ``Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for \nintelligence. . . .''\n  Governor Tom Kean, Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, supports creating \nan Intelligence Appropriations subcommittee. In the September 7, 2004 \nIntelligence Committee hearing, I asked him directly what he thought of \nmy idea of an Intelligence Appropriations subcommittee. Chairman Kean \nsaid, ``I think that would be very much in my mind within the spirit of \nour recommendations.''\n  Creating an Intelligence Appropriations subcommittee is the best way \nto strengthen oversight of the intelligence budget. Appropriations \nsubcommittees conduct rigorous oversight of the agencies they fund. \nSenator Bond and I certainly do for the agencies funded by our VA/HUD \nbill. An Intelligence subcommittee will make the Appropriations \nCommittee's oversight stronger: intelligence will have the attention of \na full subcommittee, and that subcommittee will have sufficient staff \nfor real oversight of intelligence funding. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in strong support of the proposal to create an Intelligence \nAppropriations subcommittee.\n  The working group also recommends strengthening the existing Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. I am proud to serve on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I take that responsibility very seriously. Senator Daschle \nappointed me to the Committee in 2001, before the September 11th \nattacks. I have always used my role to push for reform and \nmodernization so that we have the best possible intelligence for our \ndecisionmakers and our troops.\n  The bipartisan working group proposal maintains many of the good \nthings about the way the Intelligence Committee is organized: Including \nmembers of the Armed Services, Appropriations, Foreign Relations and \nJudiciary Committees. Ensuring the majority has only a 1-vote \nadvantage. Having subpoena authority. Having a core nonpartisan \nprofessional staff.\n  The rule would also strengthen the committee: Elevating it to an \n``A'' Committee. Creating at least one subcommittee to strengthen \noversight. Giving the committee a stronger role in reviewing civilian \nintelligence nominees. Creating designated staff positions for each \nmember of the committee.\n  So I really think this resolution will help the Intelligence \nCommittee to be more effective.\n  The third reform proposed by the bipartisan working group is to \ncreate a Homeland Security Committee. We know that our colleagues on \nthe Government Affairs Committee did a good job with the creation of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, so it's only logical that the \ncurrent Governmental Affairs Committee would take on responsibility for \nhomeland security. I believe it's important to make sure that other \nfunctions within the jurisdiction of Governmental Affairs do not lose \nout in this reform. I am thinking in particular of the Committee's work \non government management and the Federal workforce, to ensure that we \nsupport our federal employees who serve the American people in so many \nways.\n  Having an authorizing committee for homeland security should be a \nreal help in the unfinished business of making the Department of \nHomeland Security an effective agency, to work with our States, \ncounties, cities and towns, as well as other Federal agencies, to \nprotect the American people.\n  The three reforms proposed by the McConnell-Reid working group, and \ncodified as changes to the Senate Rules in this resolution, meet the \nchallenge of the 9/11 Commission and our obligation to the American \npeople to strengthen congressional oversight. That's why I intend to \nsupport the Resolution, and urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate agreed, \nby unanimous consent, to an amendment that Senator Grassley and I \noffered to S. Res. 445, the Senate intelligence reform resolution. Our \namendment will preserve the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee over \nthe commercial operations of what has historically been known as the \nUnited States Customs Service.\n  The United States Customs Service is one of the oldest agencies in \nthe U.S. Government. It was created in 1789 to collect tariffs which, \nat that time, were the principal source of revenue funding the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Until 1816, the Senate had no standing committees. Senators \nestablished ad-hoc committees to consider specific bills. In his 1815 \nmessage to Congress, President Madison recommended a series of \ncontroversial economic measures, including tariff revisions and the \ncreation of a second national bank. The Senate responded by creating \nthe Select Committee on Finance and Uniform National Currency.\n  In his 1816 message, President Madison recommended a further series \nof economic measures. This time, the Senate responded by creating the \nCommittee on Finance as a standing committee on December 10, 1816. \nUnder the leadership of Chairman George Campbell, Democrat of \nTennessee, the committee's very first task was to consider the Tariff \nAct of 1816. Other original members of the Finance Committee included \nSenators Chace of Vermont, Bibb of Georgia, King of New York, and Mason \nof New Hampshire.\n  Over the ensuing 188 years, the Finance Committee's jurisdiction has \ncome to include not just tariff legislation, but all legislation \nrelated to international trade. Up until 1930, trade policy had been \nset primarily through Congressional establishment of tariffs, under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee. When, however, the Smoot-Hawley \nTariff of 1930 became associated with the Depression, Congress shifted \nits approach. As the new Roosevelt administration considered proposals \nto reduce tariffs, Secretary of State Cordell Hull suggested that, \ninstead of reducing tariffs unilaterally, Congress authorize the \nPresident to negotiate reciprocal reductions.\n  When, in 1934, President Roosevelt endorsed this approach and sent it \nto Congress, the bill was referred to the Finance Committee. The bill \nwas enacted into law as the Trade Act of 1934, establishing the basic \nmodel for trade policy ever since. As a result, the committee acquired \njurisdiction not only over tariffs, but over a broad range of issues \nimplicated by U.S. trade policy.\n  Throughout those 188 years, the Finance Committee has retained \njurisdiction over the Customs Service. And, like that of the Committee, \nthe mission of Customs has expanded to cover a range of trade issues.\n  Today, Customs continues to serve a revenue collection function. This \nyear, it will collect nearly $25 billion in import duties, making it \nthe second largest source of government revenue after the income tax.\n  In today's globalized world, however, Customs has also come to serve \na vital role in facilitating trade and, through trade, the nation's \neconomic well-being. For example, in fiscal year 2004, Customs will \nprocess approximately 28\n\n[[Page S10673]]\n\nmillion entry summaries, covering imports worth $1.36 trillion. That is \nmore than 56,000 separate merchandise entries every day.\n  In fiscal year 2003, Customs made 6,500 seizures of goods, worth \nnearly $1 billion, that were imported in violation of the intellectual \nproperty rights of U.S. businesses and individuals.\n  Customs enforces the U.S. trade remedy laws, collecting $1.5 billion \nin antidumping and countervailing duties in fiscal year 2004.\n  In addition, Customs enforces country-of-origin labeling rules, \nblocks trade in endangered species and conflict diamonds, collects \ntrade data widely relied upon in the government and private sector, \nfights child pornography, and issues hundreds of classification and \nvaluation rulings every year. Thousands of American businesses and jobs \ndepend on Customs to process imported inputs efficiently, so they can \nreduce production costs through just-in-time inventory systems.\n  Over time, Customs has also come to have a national security mission. \nCustoms agents are often the first line of defense at the border. For \nexample, it was a Customs agent who apprehended the so-called \n``millennium bomber'' crossing the border from Canada into Washington \nState in December 1999.\n  Until recently, Customs was housed within the Department of the \nTreasury. Treasury was well-suited to oversee both the revenue \ncollection and commercial facilitation functions of Customs, and to \nensure that those functions were carried out in a manner calculated to \nadvance the economic growth and well-being of the United States.\n  After September 11, 2001, however, things changed. We learned that \nday how important it is to ensure the strongest possible coordination \namong the many Federal Agencies charged with our domestic security.\n  In the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress moved the Customs \nService from the umbrella of the Treasury Department into the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The Customs Service, as such, no longer exists as a single entity. \nRather, its many functions were divided among two parts of the Border \nand Transportation Security Directorate of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement.\n  When Congress created the Department of Homeland Security, there was \nwidespread concern in the business community that moving Customs from \nTreasury--an agency whose principal mission is the health of the U.S. \neconomy to a new agency principally concerned with national security \nwould lead to a shift in Customs' focus away from trade facilitation--\nwith adverse consequences for those businesses and for the economy as a \nwhole.\n  For some agencies, this problem was solved by splitting the agency \napart and moving to DHS only the people directly working on security \nissues. For example, this is what happened at APHIS. That solution did \nnot work for Customs, because many Customs employees perform both \ncommercial and security functions as part of their jobs.\n  Instead, Congress made Customs serve two masters. The employees of \nCustoms were physically moved into the Department of Homeland Security. \nBut the commercial functions of Customs remain under the policy control \nof the Treasury Department. Section 412 of the Homeland Security Act of \n2002 expressly provides that ``authority related to Customs revenue \nfunctions'' that was previously vested in the Secretary of the Treasury \n``shall not be transferred'' to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  There was some flexibility built into the law. That way, over time, \nthe Secretary of Treasury could delegate some responsibilities to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security if experience demonstrated that a \nparticular Customs function was more closely related to security than \nto trade facilitation.\n  As a practical matter, the result has been shared authority over \nCustoms by Treasury and Homeland Security. Similarly, in the Senate, \nthe result has been shared oversight by the Finance Committee and the \nCommittee on Government Affairs. One committee focuses on homeland \nsecurity issues and the other on commercial issues.\n  In response to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, the Senate \nis now engaged in a debate over how to reorganize our committee \nstructure to provide stronger, more coherent oversight over issues \nrelated to homeland security.\n  In my view, the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission do not justify \nany changes in committee oversight jurisdiction of Customs. The \nCommission has recommended centralizing oversight over homeland \nsecurity issues in one committee in each House. The clear purpose of \nthat recommendation is to centralize oversight over homeland security \nfunctions, not over other functions that happen to be performed by \nindividuals employed by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Grassley-Baucus amendment to S. Res. 445 ensures that the Finance \nCommittee will retain the jurisdiction over the commercial facilitation \nfunctions of the Customs Service that the committee has held for nearly \n200 years.\n  Everyone understands that in the post-9/11 world, the United States \nmust vigilantly protect our borders. But while we do so, we must ensure \nthat we do not overburden commerce with other Nations. We must strike a \ndelicate balance between protecting the Nation's borders and promoting \nthe nation's economic health. If we lose that balance, American \nbusinesses will suffer. So will our ports, because shippers will find \nit faster and less expensive to send their cargo through Canadian or \nMexican ports.\n  I believe that granting jurisdiction over the business facilitation \nfunctions of the Customs Service to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs would inevitably lead to commercial \nconsiderations being discounted heavily in the name of security. That \nwould hurt the U.S. economy in the long run.\n  On the other hand, retaining jurisdiction over the revenue and \ncommercial functions of Customs in the Finance Committee in no way \ndetracts from the ability of the new Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee to oversee those functions of Customs that pertain to \nborder security. Separating oversight of these two functions will \nguarantee that commercial concerns receive a full and fair airing in \nany debate involving both commerce and security.\n  So what are the functions over which the Finance Committee would \nretain jurisdiction under this amendment? Clearly, all the ``revenue \nfunctions'' defined in section 415 of the Homeland Security Act are \nincluded. These are generally functions that have virtually no security \naspects to them--such as collecting tariffs, regulating country of \norigin labeling, or enforcing antidumping duty orders.\n  The amendment also preserves Finance Committee jurisdiction over \n``any commercial function'' of CBP or ICE, ``including matters related \nto trade facilitation and trade regulation.''\n  For example, the Finance Committee would retain jurisdiction over all \ncommercial aspects of the implementation of Customs' new computer \nsystem, the Automated Commercial Environment or ACE. ACE was conceived \nmany years ago long before 9/11--as a way to create a paperless \nenvironment that reduces paperwork and delays for goods clearing \nCustoms and enhances the efficiency of American businesses that depend \non those goods.\n  ACE has security applications. It can be used to flag entries with \nsuspicious documentation. And the Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee can certainly look into those issues. But it is not, \nand never has been, primarily a security-focused project.\n  A second example is the issue of container security. Customs is \nengaged in a program of public-private cooperation with shippers to try \nto balance security concerns with incoming cargo containers and the \neconomic concerns of shippers. Under this amendment, the Finance \nCommittee would retain jurisdiction over the trade facilitation aspects \nof Customs' inspection and clearance of cargo containers.\n  Trade is critical to the health of the America economy. Exports alone \naccounted for 25 percent of U.S. economic growth between 1990 and 2000. \nExports support an estimated 12 million jobs. Imports allow businesses \nand consumers more choice of goods and inputs and foster America's \ncompetitiveness in the global economy.\n\n[[Page S10674]]\n\n  For these reasons, Congress has a responsibility to ensure that \nCustoms continues to serve the needs of the business and trade \ncommunity. That can only be achieved by safeguarding a balance between \nCustoms' trade facilitation and homeland security functions. The \nGrassley-Baucus amendment promotes that balance.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3995, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier today there was a long deliberation \nand finally adoption of an amendment that had been earlier filed by \nSenator Bayh. It is my understanding that another amendment superseded \nthat. That amendment is pending. It is No. 3995.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, other \nthan conforming and technical managers amendments, the only remaining \nfirst-degree amendments be the following, which are filed at the desk: \nCollins, Nickles, Hutchison, Frist, Bingaman-Domenici, and Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that it \nbe in order to file timely second-degree amendments up until 9:15 \ntomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the unanimous consent agreement that was \nadopted by the Senate a few minutes ago, we want to make sure the \nRecord is clear that when we talk about Collins, Nickles, Hutchison, \nFrist, Bingaman, and Rockefeller, we are talking about one amendment \nper member, and I want the Record to reflect that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will so reflect.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to discuss H.R. 5107, the \nJustice for All Act that was just passed by the House, by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of 393 to 14. The bill is the result of \nthe hard work and dedication of many on both sides of the aisle.\n  In particular, I would like to commend Chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee Sensenbrenner and Ranking Democrat, Representative \nDelahunt for their outstanding leadership in shepherding this \ngroundbreaking crime bill that will allow us to further unleash the \nevidentiary power of DNA. It will provide law enforcement the ability \nto find and punish the guilty and give use the comfort of certainty in \ncriminal prosecutions. Moreover, the House attached Senator Kyl's and \nSenator Feinstein's critical Crime Victims Act that ensures victims' \nrights are protected in criminal prosecutions. That is very important.\n  This House passed bill is the result of months of intense \nnegotiations and addresses the concerns raised regarding title III of \nthe former DNA bill, including the major concerns, I believe, of \nSenators Kyl, Sessions, and Cornyn.\n  And let me say, the overwhelming support for this bill in the House \ncould not have been achieved without the hard work and dedication of \nthe Department of Justice. I would like to specifically thank Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft, Assistant Attorney General William Moschella, and \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Sean McLaughlin for bringing the \nparties together to create a truly bipartisan bill that meets the \ninterests of all parties. Without their constructive input we would \nhave never been able to get to where we are. I personally want to thank \nthem for their support.\n\n  But our work is not done. I call upon the Senate to act expeditiously \nto pass this anticrime bill so we can present it to the President for \nhis signature.\n  So we all know, there has been a tremendous amount of work done in \nthe 22-page memorandum by Mr. Moschella and the Justice Department. I \nthink we have made a monumental effort to address every one of those \nconcerns. We haven't been able to address every case exactly the way \nthe Justice Department requested, but there has been a good-faith \neffort on the part of the distinguished Senator from Vermont and \nCongressman Delahunt to be able to bring this Justice for All Act \nthrough to completion.\n  When it passed 393 to 14 yesterday in the House, I think that sent a \nmessage to everybody that not only would we get this DNA bill, but we \nwould also get the victims' rights bill for which Senators Kyl and \nFeinstein have worked so long and hard.\n  Rather than take the time of my distinguished friend from Arizona and \nany further time from the bill on the floor, I want to compliment the \nJustice Department.\n  I hope we can get the last few things resolved so that this bill can \npass, and that means working it out with a few of our colleagues in the \nSenate. I believe when they look at this bill and read it, they will \nrealize almost every one of those concerns have been addressed in good \nfaith. Senator Leahy and I have worked hand in hand trying to make sure \nthose matters were addressed.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can get this bill up and out so we can do \nwhat should be done for 400,000 rape kits--some of which are 20 years \nold--to help not only to discover those who are guilty but to put those \nwho are on the streets, who have raped women, in jail where they \nbelong. This bill will do exactly that. It is a very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Having said that, however, I want to make it clear that this \nadministration has done a great deal. Thus far, it has committed to \ndoing this, and it is the first administration that has done it. We \nhave known about these rape kits for years. This is the final touch in \nthe bill to help protect women in this country. It will be very \nimportant for us to pass it today. I hope we can get it done.\n  We are working very diligently to try to satisfy the concerns of all \nof our colleagues. Thus far, we are down to just one major concern, and \nhopefully when they read the bill they will realize we have addressed \nthat as well and will agree to satisfy this matter.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona and my colleague from Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a year ago this month, I stood with a \nbipartisan group of Senators and Representatives to announce the \nintroduction of the Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of \n2003. This is landmark legislation. It provides law enforcement with \nthe training and equipment required to effectively and accurately fight \ncrime in the 21st century. It enacts the President's DNA initiative, as \nthe Chair probably knows, authorizing more than $1 billion over the \nnext 5 years to eliminate the backlog crisis in the Nation's crime labs \nand fund other DNA-related programs. It also includes the Innocence \nProtection Act, a death penalty reform effort I launched more than 4 \nyears ago.\n  We introduced our bill on October 1, 2003. One month later, the House \npassed it with overwhelming support, 357 to 57. Among those supporting \nthe bill were the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, \nCongressman James Sensenbrenner, and virtually the entire Republican \nleadership, including Majority Leader DeLay. Clearly there was a broad \nconsensus for action. The House vote marked a major breakthrough in \nfinding solutions to these serious flaws in our criminal justice \nsystem.\n  Unfortunately, while the other body acted, we did not. Despite \nChairman Hatch's sponsorship of the bill and strong support of it, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee did not begin work on\n\n[[Page S10675]]\n\nthe bill until September, almost a year after the House had passed it. \nAt that point we were slowed by resistance from some Republican members \nof the panel, but after many hours we succeeded in working through the \n20-plus amendments that were offered. All of them were rejected. Then \nthe bill was approved by a strong bipartisan majority.\n  That was 3 weeks ago. Since then, this critical legislation has been \nblocked by the same Senators who tried blocking it in committee, and \nunfortunately they have been buttressed by opposition from President \nBush and Attorney General John Ashcroft.\n  Undeterred by the fact that the Senate has not moved on this very \nimportant legislation, the House acted again. Yesterday it voted on the \nJustice For All Act of 2004, H.R. 5107. This is a criminal justice \npackage that bundles the Senate DNA bill with another bill, already \npassed in the Senate, that would increase protection for victims of \nFederal crimes. Yesterday's House margin, 393 to 14, was even larger \nthan it was a year ago. In these times you rarely see such bipartisan \nsupport--393 to 14. I believe it sends a loud message to us here in \nthis body of: What are we waiting for? Let's pass this bill.\n  I want to take a moment to commend the Republican chairman of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, Jim Sensenbrenner, who spearheaded this \neffort in the House. The chairman deserves high praise for his \nleadership. We could never have come as far as we have without his \nsteadfast commitment, and the hard work of his impressive staff.\n  I also thank my long-term colleagues in this effort, Representative \nBill Delahunt from Massachusetts--I was honored to serve overlapping \ntime as prosecutors, me in Vermont, Mr. Delahunt in Massachusetts--and \nRepresentative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois. They worked \ntirelessly over many years to pass the Innocence Protection Act. They \ndeserve much of the credit for building the strong bipartisan support \nfor the bill in the House.\n  The House has spoken, not once but twice. I believe Senate action is \nlong overdue. It should not be threatened by a few holdouts in the \nSenate, even if they are emboldened by continuing help from the \nDepartment of Justice. I remind everybody, none of us here works for \nthe administration--I don't care whether it is a Republican \nadministration or a Democratic administration. We are elected as \nindividual Senators, independent of the executive branch or the \njudicial branch.\n  The Bush administration's role in the effort to kill this bill is \nsignificant and it is a matter of public record. On April 28 of this \nyear we received a 22-page letter from Assistant Attorney General \nWilliam Moschella, presenting ``the views of the Department of Justice \nand the administration'' regarding the bill the House of \nRepresentatives had earlier passed by a vote of 357 to 67. They \nexpressed the Administration's strong opposition to virtually every \naspect of the bill.\n  I have rarely seen a letter--in fact, I cannot remember a time I have \nseen a letter from an executive branch agency so hostile to a \nbipartisan legislative effort that had already passed one House of \nCongress. I was shocked the Department would write such a scathing \nletter about a bill that had been carefully negotiated by Chairman \nSensenbrenner and Chairman Hatch, working very closely together. In \nlight of the support of the congressional leadership, I thought the \nPresident would have supported the bill and worked to make the capital \npunishment system more fair. Instead, his Administration chose to \nstonewall the reforms and defend the injustices in current law.\n  The new House bill contains additional concessions to the Department \nof Justice and to the handful of Republican opponents in the Senate. \nBut despite these concessions, despite the urgent need for reform, the \nBush administration has obstinately refused to support the bill or even \nto withdraw its formal opposition to the bill. In particular, the \nDepartment has pressed its unreasonable demand for an arbitrary 3-year \ntime limit on obtaining a DNA test after conviction.\n\n  If the White House kills this bill that has passed so overwhelmingly \nin the House, it will be a travesty. It has, after all, been supported \nby key members of the Republican leadership in both the House and the \nSenate; it has passed by an overwhelming margin in the House. To put \nthis off another year may seem fine to the President and the Attorney \nGeneral, but another year is a long time if you are a crime victim and \nyou are hoping they may find the person who committed the crime, or if \nyou are wrongly accused and you are waiting on death row for the chance \nto prove your innocence. Another year will pile more untested rape kits \non to the thousands already piled up in labs across the country.\n  This bill is a rare example of bipartisan cooperation for a good \ncause, and instead of helping, the White House has actively hindered. \nThey have been unwilling to lead. They have been unwilling to follow. \nNow, when all it would take is for them to get out of the way, they are \neven unwilling to stand aside.\n  I think it is time for them to understand what is happening here, and \nto become part of the solution instead of part of the problem. An \noverwhelming bipartisan coalition in both the House and the Senate \nsupports this bill because it will mean more fair and effective \ncriminal justice in this country.\n  If Congress fails to enact this much-needed law this year, I do not \nlay the blame on leadership in the House or the Senate, because the \nleadership in both parties has supported it, just as Senator Hatch and \nChairman Sensenbrenner have. If the Congress fails to enact this law \nthis year, then I lay the responsibility directly at the feet of \nPresident Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft. They deserve to be held \naccountable, and will be if their stubborn opposition to the bill \ncauses it to die. The leaders of their own party support it, as the \nleaders of my party do. They ought to stand aside.\n  For all those victims' groups, all those church groups, all the \nothers who have supported this bill--as you know, if it doesn't go \nforward, it is not the fault of Congress. You should look down toward \nthe other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a longer statement in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                      Justice For All Act Of 2004\n\n                            October 7, 2004\n\n       A year ago this month, I stood with a bipartisan group of \n     Senators and Representatives to announce the introduction of \n     the Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003. \n     This landmark legislation provides law enforcement with the \n     training and equipment required to effectively, and \n     accurately, fight crime in the 21st Century. It enacts the \n     President's DNA Initiative, which authorizes more than $1 \n     billion over the next five years to eliminate the backlog \n     crisis in the Nation's crime labs, and to fund other DNA-\n     related programs. It also includes the Innocence Protection \n     Act, a death penalty reform effort I launched more than four \n     years ago.\n       DNA is the miracle forensic tool of our lifetimes. It has \n     the power to convict the guilty and to exonerate the \n     innocent. And as DNA testing has become more and more \n     available, it also has opened a window on the flaws of the \n     death penalty process.\n       Hearing after hearing before the House and Senate Judiciary \n     Committees has shown beyond any doubt that the death penalty \n     system is broken. These mistakes in our system of justice \n     carry a high personal and social price. They undermine the \n     public's confidence in our judicial system, they produce \n     unbearable anguish for innocent people and their families and \n     for the victims of these crimes, and they compromise public \n     safety because for every wrongly convicted person, there is a \n     real criminal who may still be roaming the streets. Indeed, \n     in dozens of cases in which DNA testing has exonerated a \n     wrongfully convicted person, the same test has identified the \n     real perpetrator.\n       Our bill would put this powerful tool into greater use in \n     our police departments and our courtrooms. It also takes a \n     modest step toward addressing one of the most frequent causes \n     of wrongful convictions in capital cases--the lack of \n     adequate legal counsel.\n\n\n        Broad Bipartisan Support In Congress And Around Country\n\n       We introduced our bill on October 1, 2003. One month later, \n     the House passed it with overwhelming support--357 to 57. \n     Among those supporting the bill were the Chairman of the \n     House Judiciary Committee, Congressman James Sensenbrenner, \n     and virtually the entire Republican leadership, including \n     Majority Leader DeLay. Clearly there was a broad consensus \n     for action. The House vote was a major breakthrough in \n     finding solutions to the serious flaws in our justice system.\n       Sadly, the House acted, but the Senate did not. Despite \n     Chairman Hatch's sponsorship of the bill, the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee did not begin work on the bill until \n     September, almost a year later. At that point,\n\n[[Page S10676]]\n\n     we were slowed by resistance from three Republican members of \n     the panel. After many hours, we succeeded in working through \n     the 20-plus amendments that were offered--all of which were \n     rejected--and the bill was approved by a strong bipartisan \n     majority.\n       It speaks volumes about the opposition to this bill that \n     one of the amendments offered in Committee sought to strike \n     the Innocence Protection Act in its entirety. Our opponents \n     want law enforcement to use DNA aggressively to fight crime, \n     and so do I. But they do not want to let those who are \n     wrongly convicted use DNA to prove their innocence. That is \n     wrong. DNA can convict the guilty, but it can also exonerate \n     the innocent. It should be available for both purposes.\n       That is why victims groups support the whole package of \n     reforms in this bill. They do not want the wrong guy locked \n     up while the real rapist or murderer is out committing other \n     crimes. Throughout the Committee's consideration of this \n     bill, there were two fixtures in the room--Kirk Bloodsworth \n     and Debbie Smith. Kirk was exonerated by DNA testing. In \n     Debbie's case, DNA testing led to the arrest and conviction \n     of her attacker. Both support the whole bill.\n       The Committee reported the bill to the full Senate three \n     weeks ago. Since then, this critical legislation has been \n     blocked by the same three Republican Senators who held up the \n     bill in Committee, buttressed by opposition from President \n     Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft.\n       This week, the House has acted again. It voted yesterday on \n     the Justice For All Act of 2004, H.R. 5107, a criminal \n     justice package that bundles the Advancing Justice Through \n     DNA Technology Act with another bill, already passed in the \n     Senate, which will increase protections for victims of \n     Federal crimes. Wednesday's House margin--393 to 14--was even \n     larger than the vote a year ago, and sends a loud and clear \n     message to the Senate: ``Pass this bill!''\n       I want to take a moment to commend the Republican Chairman \n     of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Sensenbrenner, who has \n     spearheaded this effort in the House. Chairman Sensenbrenner \n     deserves high praise for his leadership. We could never have \n     come as far as we have without his steadfast commitment and \n     the hard work of his impressive staff.\n       I also want to thank my longtime colleagues in this \n     endeavor, Representative Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts and \n     Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois. They have worked \n     tirelessly over many years to pass the Innocence Protection \n     Act, and deserve much of the credit for building the strong \n     support for the bill in the House.\n       The House has now spoken not once, but twice. Senate action \n     is long overdue. Sadly, Senate passage in the waning days of \n     this congressional session continues to be threatened by a \n     few holdout Republicans, emboldened by continuing opposition \n     from Department of Justice.\n\n\n                     Inaction Has Real Consequences\n\n       While Congress has failed to act, much has happened in the \n     real world. Over the last year, five more wrongfully \n     convicted individuals were cleared of the crimes that sent \n     them to death row, bringing to 116 the number of death row \n     exonerations since the reinstatement of capital punishment. \n     Also in the past year, another 10 wrongfully convicted \n     individuals were exonerated by DNA testing in non-capital \n     cases. That brings to 151 the number of post-conviction DNA \n     exonerations in this country in little over a decade.\n       What else has happened in the real world? Just last week, \n     Houston's top police official called for a moratorium on \n     executions of inmates who were convicted based on evidence \n     that was handled or analyzed by the Houston Police \n     Department's crime lab. In a floor statement in March 2003, I \n     described the widespread problems at that lab, which included \n     poorly trained technicians, shoddy recordkeeping, and holes \n     in the ceiling that allowed rain to possibly contaminate \n     samples. It turns out that the situation is even worse than \n     previously imagined.\n       In May, the Republican Governor of Texas pardoned Josiah \n     Sutton, who spent 4\\1/2\\ years in prison for a crime that he \n     did not commit. He was only a teenager when he was convicted \n     and sentenced to 25 years for rape, based largely on a bogus \n     DNA match by the Houston police lab. More recently, Houston's \n     district attorney admitted that chemical testing used to \n     convict another man was inaccurate. That was after six \n     forensic experts concluded that the lab's analysis of DNA \n     evidence in the case was ``scientifically unsound.''\n       The situation in Houston is appalling but it is not without \n     precedent. There have been similar problems in various State \n     crime labs, as well as in the once-distinguished FBI lab. \n     Crime labs across the country are suffering the consequences \n     of years of increased demand and decreased funding.\n       One consequence is sloppy lab work. Another consequence is \n     massive backlogs. In December 2003, the Department of Justice \n     estimated that there were more than 500,000 criminal cases \n     with biological evidence awaiting DNA testing. This estimate \n     included 52,000 homicide cases and 169,000 rape cases. Ten \n     months later, the situation has only gotten worse. While the \n     Senate has been idle on this bill, rape kits and other crime \n     scene evidence has been sitting on shelves, untested for lack \n     of funding. This bill would authorize the funding that our \n     labs so desperately need.\n\n\n    Bush Administration's Repeated Attempts To Sabotage Bipartisan \n                               Initiative\n\n       The Bush Administration's role in the effort to kill this \n     bill is a matter of public record. On April 28 of this year, \n     we received a 22-page letter from Assistant Attorney General \n     William Moschella presenting ``the views of the Department of \n     Justice and the Administration'' regarding the bill that the \n     House of Representatives had earlier passed by a vote of 357 \n     to 67. The letter expressed the Administration's strong \n     opposition to virtually every aspect of the bill.\n       I have rarely seen a letter from an Executive branch agency \n     so hostile to a bipartisan legislative effort that had \n     already passed one house of Congress. I was shocked that the \n     Department would write such a scathing letter about a bill \n     that had been carefully negotiated by Chairman Sensenbrenner \n     and Chairman Hatch. In light of the support of the Republican \n     congressional leadership, I expected that the President would \n     support this bill and work to make the capital punishment \n     system more fair and effective. Instead, he chose to \n     stonewall reform and defend the injustices in current law.\n       The Justice Department's criticisms of the bill are all \n     unfounded. Let me respond to just a few of the key claims in \n     the Department's April 28 letter.\n       The Department claimed that the post-conviction DNA testing \n     provisions in the bill would invite abusive prisoner \n     litigation. In fact, the bill includes numerous checks \n     against frivolous litigation, including the following: An \n     applicant seeking a test must assert his ``actual innocence'' \n     under penalty of perjury; The applicant must not have waived \n     the right to DNA testing, or knowingly failed to request DNA \n     testing in a prior post-conviction motion; A chain of custody \n     must be established; The proposed DNA testing must be \n     reasonable in scope; The applicant must identify a theory of \n     innocence not inconsistent with any affirmative defense \n     presented at trial; Testing may be ordered only if it could \n     produce ``new material evidence'' and raise a reasonable \n     probability that the applicant did not commit the offense; \n     And the bill establishes serious sanctions, including new \n     criminal charges, if DNA testing produces inculpatory \n     results.\n       The Department argued that the bill should bar post-\n     conviction DNA testing unless DNA technology was \n     ``unavailable'' at the time of the defendant's trial. But \n     witnesses at House and Senate hearings on the bill reported \n     numerous examples of defendants failing to request DNA \n     testing despite its availability at the time of trial because \n     the defense lawyers were incompetent or unfamiliar with the \n     technology, the defendant was mentally ill or retarded, or \n     the defense was simply unaware of the evidence, perhaps due \n     to government misconduct.\n       The Department complained that the bill would allow \n     prisoners who pleaded guilty to obtain a DNA test. But \n     witnesses at the hearings told Congress of the startling fact \n     that innocent defendants sometimes do plead guilty, due to \n     bad lawyers, mental retardation, or government intimidation. \n     David Vasquez in Virginia, Frank Townsend in Florida, and \n     Chris Ochoa in Texas are just three examples of this \n     disturbing phenomenon.\n       The Department claimed that the evidence retention \n     requirements in the bill were unduly burdensome. In fact, we \n     took every precaution to make sure that these requirements \n     would not pose an undue burden to law enforcement. Only \n     biological evidence must be preserved. Evidence need not be \n     preserved if the court denies a request for testing, the \n     defendant waives testing, or 180 days pass after the \n     defendant receives notice that the government intends to \n     destroy the evidence. If evidence would be impractical to \n     retain, the government need only take reasonable measures to \n     preserve a portion of the evidence. Finally, the failure to \n     retain evidence does not provide grounds for habeas corpus \n     relief.\n       The Department claimed that the counsel provisions in the \n     bill amounted to a Federal regulatory system for capital \n     defense. That characterization is grossly unfair. The Capital \n     Representation Improvement Grants authorized in the bill are \n     strictly voluntary. States are under no obligation to \n     participate. At House and Senate hearings on the bill, \n     witnesses enumerated numerous studies over 20 years that \n     document the failure of many States to provide competent \n     counsel in capital cases. In light of these long-standing \n     flaws, it is entirely appropriate for the Federal \n     government to offer financial assistance to those States \n     that seek it.\n       The Department claimed that the agencies responsible for \n     appointing capital defense lawyers would have limitless \n     resources. This criticism is unsupported and contrary to the \n     experience in states like North Carolina and New York that \n     have established independent defense entities which operate \n     within a budget.\n       If the White House kills this bill it will be a travesty. \n     Putting this off another year may seem fine to the President \n     or the Attorney General, but another year is a long time if \n     you are a crime victim or if you are wrongly accused, waiting \n     on death row for the chance to prove your innocence. Another \n     year will pile more untested rape kits on to the thousands \n     already piled up in labs across the country.\n       This bill is a rare example of bipartisan cooperation for a \n     good cause, and instead of helping, the White House has \n     actively hindered. They have been unwilling to lead.\n\n[[Page S10677]]\n\n     They have been unwilling to follow. Now, when all it would \n     take is for them to get out of the way, they're even \n     unwilling to stand aside. The time has come for the President \n     to understand what is happening here, and to become part of \n     the solution instead of part of the problem.\n\n\n           Bush Administration Ignores Efforts to Compromise\n\n       This bill is the product of years of work and many months \n     of intense negotiations. It reflects a lot of compromises by \n     all the principal sponsors. None of us is entirely happy with \n     everything in the bill. There are plenty of things that I \n     would do differently. There are plenty of things that Senator \n     Hatch and other cosponsors would do differently. Nobody got \n     everything they wanted.\n       But that is why the bill has such broad bipartisan appeal. \n     That is what the legislative process is all about--finding \n     the middle ground that a broad majority can support. That is \n     why 393 members of the House support this bill, and why a \n     substantial majority of the Senate would vote for it if our \n     opponents would allow it to come to a vote.\n       The new House bill reflects a number of additional \n     concessions to the Department of Justice and to our \n     Republican opponents in the Senate. Let me briefly describe \n     just a few of the changes that were made.\n       First, to address concerns raised in Committee by Senator \n     Sessions and others, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant \n     Program now authorizes the use of grant funds to address non-\n     DNA forensic science backlogs, but only if the State has no \n     significant DNA backlog or lab improvement needs relating to \n     DNA processing.\n       Second, the bill no longer prevents States from uploading \n     arrestee information into their own DNA databases, although \n     they must expunge such information if the charges are dropped \n     or result in an acquittal.\n       Third, the standard for getting post-conviction DNA testing \n     has been streamlined by striking unnecessary language that \n     required courts to assume exculpatory test results. Obviously \n     a court considering such an application cannot know for sure \n     what the test results would reveal and must consider the \n     application in a light most favorable to the applicant in \n     light of all the evidence.\n       Fourth, the bill no longer permits Federal inmates to \n     obtain DNA testing of evidence relating to a State offense, \n     except when that offense may have resulted in a Federal death \n     sentence.\n       Fifth, it is now presumed that a motion for post-conviction \n     DNA testing is timely if filed within five years of enactment \n     of the bill, or three years after the applicant was \n     convicted, whichever is later. Thereafter, it is presumed \n     that a motion is untimely, except upon good cause shown. \n     The Department has complained that the ``good cause'' \n     exception is so broad you could drive a truck through it, \n     and its continued opposition turns in large part on the \n     inclusion of this language. But while I agree that the \n     language is broad, it is intentionally so; I would not \n     agree to a presumption of untimeliness that could not be \n     rebutted in most cases. At the same time, this provision \n     should allow courts to deal summarily with the \n     Department's hypothetical bogeyman--the guilty prisoner \n     who ``games the system'' by waiting until the witnesses \n     against him are dead and retrial is no longer possible, \n     and only then seeking DNA testing.\n       Sixth, modifications were made to the standard for \n     obtaining a new trial based on an exculpatory DNA test \n     result; instead of establishing by ``a preponderance of the \n     evidence'' that a new trial would result in an acquittal, \n     applicants must now establish this by ``compelling \n     evidence.'' The point of this change, which I proposed, is to \n     require courts to focus on the quality of the evidence \n     supporting an applicant's new trial motion rather than trying \n     to calculate the odds of a different verdict.\n       Finally, the bill now specifies that 75 percent of funds \n     awarded under the new capital representation improvement \n     grant program must be aimed at improving trial counsel, \n     unless the Attorney General waives this requirement. This \n     change was included to assuage concerns that this program \n     will somehow resurrect the post-conviction resource centers \n     that Congress de-funded in the mid-1990s.\n       With few exceptions, these most recent changes to the bill \n     were made at the behest of the Department of Justice, after \n     weeks of negotiations aimed at securing the Department's \n     endorsement of the bill. Yet despite the changes, and despite \n     the urgent need for reform, the Bush Administration has \n     obstinately refused to support the bill or even to withdraw \n     its formal opposition to the bill. As Chairman Sensenbrenner \n     has said, we ``bent over backwards'' to try to satisfy the \n     Department's concerns, but ``no matter how much we bent, \n     nothing could satisfy them.'' In particular, the Department \n     pressed its unreasonable demand for an arbitrary three-year \n     time limit on obtaining a DNA test after conviction.\n       Let us be clear what this means. A DNA test is not a get-\n     out-of-jail-free card; it does not even guarantee someone a \n     new trial. All this is about is providing access to evidence \n     in the government possession for purposes of forensic \n     testing. Judge Michael Luttig, one of the most conservative \n     jurists in the country, has written that this is nothing less \n     than a constitutional right. Senator Specter took the same \n     position in the last Congress. A large majority of the States \n     that have passed post-conviction DNA testing laws have \n     rejected time limits, recognizing, as I do, that there should \n     never be a time limit on innocence.\n       The reforms proposed in the Justice for All Act will mean \n     more fair and effective criminal justice in this country. The \n     few remaining opponents of the bill still wave around the \n     April 28 letter from the Department of Justice. If Congress \n     fails to enact this needed law this year I lay responsibility \n     directly at the feet of President Bush and Attorney General \n     Ashcroft. They deserve to be held accountable if their \n     stubborn opposition to the bill causes it to die.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10677-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10677-S10678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my pleasure that \nyesterday the Senate incorporated an important amendment I authored \nwith my colleagues, Senators Bingaman and Harkin, into the National \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004. Our amendment strengthens Congress's \nrole in protecting our civil liberties as we move forward with the \nreform of our intelligence structure. The randomness of the terrorist \nacts of September 11, and the relative ease with which they were \nperpetrated, exposed serious gaps and deficiencies in our intelligence \nand security systems. In the aftermath of those attacks, we established \nthe 9/11 Commission, which through its seminal report and \nrecommendations has helped to clearly identify critical problem areas \nand recommend solutions to remedy them. And now, through this National \nIntelligence Reform Act, we are working to implement these \nrecommendations in a way that strengthens the intelligence \ninfrastructure and increases synergy and coordination within our \nintelligence community.\n  But in the aftermath of September 11--in our vigilance to protect \nagainst future attacks and to comprehensively overhaul our intelligence \nsystem--we run the risk of enacting procedures that could diminish or \noverrun our civil liberties. The Commission recognized this risk and in \none of its most important recommendations has wisely suggested the \nestablishment of a civil liberties oversight board within the executive \nbranch. In the spirit of that recommendation the authors of the \nunderlying bill have provided for such a board whose purpose it is to \ncontinuously review the impact on civil liberties of intelligence \ngathering initiatives and operations devised under the new National \nIntelligence Program, NIP. To that end, the board will be charged with \nreviewing new proposals under the NIP, advising on the civil rights \nimplications of those proposals, and determining whether proposals will \nexpand powers at the expense of our civil liberties.\n  The question arises, however, as to what the board can do with a \nfinding that a violation has occurred. Under the bill as currently \ndrafted the Board is not authorized to intervene or put any stopgaps in \nplace through the legislative or regulatory process. I recognize that \nthe intelligence community must have the ability to implement its \nproposals and operations with a level of flexibility and expedience. \nBut, I also recognize that the board must have the ability to check \ninitiatives that infringe on our most sacred constitutional rights. Our \namendment strikes a balance between these two goals by making Congress \naware of specific instances in which the board has significant concerns \nabout a given proposal's adverse effect on civil liberties. \nSpecifically, this amendment requires that the board include, within \nits biannual reports, a detailed accounting of each time the board \nfinds that: No. 1, a proposal to create a new means of gathering \nintelligence will unnecessarily infringe on civil liberties; and No. 2, \nthat finding is not adequately addressed by those implementing or \ncreating the means.\n  By receiving this information, Congress will be able to keep pace \nwith the implementation of national intelligence reform as well as \nprovide guidance on ways to refine and calibrate new intelligence \ngathering initiatives so that we balance security interests with \nconstitutional rights. In short, the amendment provides Congress the \ninformation it needs to accomplish a critical part of its oversight \nfunction, ensuring that while we work to keep our country safe we also \nsafeguard the constitutional freedoms upon which it was founded. Again, \nI thank the managers for including this important\n\n[[Page S10678]]\n\namendment in the underlying legislation.\n\n\n                            PUBLIC DIPLOMACY\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President. I commend the Senator from New York for her \nwork on the section of the McCain-Lieberman-Bayh-Specter amendment to \nthe 9/11 legislation that addresses education in the Muslim world. The \nprovision commits the United States to taking a comprehensive approach \nto universal basic education in Muslim countries and requires our \ngovernment to develop a cooperative plan to achieve this visionary \ngoal. The 9/11 Commission understood that expanding education that \nemphasizes moderation, tolerance and the skills needed to compete in \nthe global economy in these countries will create an alternative to \nhate and will show that the United States is committed to expanding \nopportunity in countries where we are often competing with our enemies \nfor hearts and minds. It is only through a long-term public diplomacy \nstrategy that we will win the war on terrorism, and modern education is \na foundation of that effort. I would like to thank Senator Clinton for \nher assistance in drafting the education provisions in this bill We \ncould not have achieved such a comprehensive approach to education \nwithout her involvement, and we appreciate her efforts.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I would like to thank Senator Bayh, along with Senators \nMcCain, Lieberman and Specter, for stepping forward to ensure that the \n9/11 Commission's recommendations on education become a key part of our \nNation's anti-terrorism strategy. As you know, I have introduced \nlegislation to promote universal basic education in all of the world's \ndeveloping countries by 2015. I am pleased that the Senators forging \nthis bipartisan bill have accepted many of these recommendations, \nincluding creating, for the first time, a strategy to promote universal \nbasic education in the Middle East and other significantly Muslim \ncountries. The bill also encourages countries to come forward with \nstrong national education plans for quality universal basic education \nand directs our efforts at providing support for such crucial systemic \nreform. The provisions included in this 9/11 bill represent an \nimportant step toward the goal of universal basic education. I want to \nthank all the leaders on this amendment for working with me on this \nissue, and I appreciate their leadership on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10678-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10678-S10680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, we passed an important bill \ngranting enormous additional authority and tools to the government to \nfight terrorism. We authorized the creation of a vast information \nsharing network that will allow officials throughout the U.S. \ngovernment to search databases containing extensive data about American \ncitizens. We also gave broad authority to implement new technologies, \nstandardize identification documents and enhance border security. These \nare great powers that, as the Commission noted, will have substantial \nimplications for privacy and civil liberties.\n  This bill was also notable because it balanced this grant of power \nwith the creation of a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. I \nthank Senator Lieberman for including this Board as part of the \nNational Intelligence Reform Act, and for working with Senator Durbin, \nme and others to make sure the Board had the necessary authority, \nmandate and tools to ensure that civil liberties and privacy are \nsafeguarded as we enhance our antiterrorism policies and tools.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I have been pleased to work with Senator Durbin, \nSenator Leahy and others in creating a Privacy and Civil Liberties \nBoard that is in keeping with the Commission's recommendation. The \nCommission recommended that we create an entity that could ``look \nacross the government at the actions we are taking to protect ourselves \nto ensure that liberty concerns are appropriately considered.'' Senator \nCollins and I appreciated the contributions of members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Their long-standing expertise in these issues was very \nhelpful to us in shaping the key provisions of the Board.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We all recognized that we were giving this Board \nsubstantial responsibility. Given the enormous powers we were granting \nthe government, we needed a Board capable of counter-balancing these \npowers. But we also know that this does not end our duty.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree. Accountability for this Board is essential. \nAs the 9-11 Commission stated, ``strengthening congressional oversight \nmay be among the most difficult and important'' of our recommendations. \nWe cannot assign the Board such significant responsibilities without \nregularly reviewing its progress to ensure that its mandates are being \nmet. We have an obligation to exercise vigorous oversight of its \nactions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Judiciary Committee and the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee have a shared history of working together to preserve privacy \nand civil liberties, and to promote open and accountable government. \nOur committee members have developed substantial expertise and \nexperience in these areas, and we have a duty to continue to oversee \nthese concerns. I thank the distinguished Ranking Member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee for working with us to ensure that the \nBoard's work on privacy and civil liberties matters be under the \njurisdiction of both these committees so that we can continue to \nprovide effective oversight.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree that joint jurisdiction over the Board's work \non privacy and civil liberties matters is the most effective and \nappropriate way to take advantage of our shared expertise and \nexperience. I thank the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee for \nhis commitment and dedication to fighting for the rights and liberties \nthat make this country worth preserving. As the Commission stated, \n``[w]e must find ways of reconciling security with liberty, since the \nsuccess of one helps protect the other.''\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters, \nwhich I sent to 9/11 Commission member Slade Gorton, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2004.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     Member, National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n         United States, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Slade: Thank you for sending me the two 9/11 \n     Commission staff statements in response to my April 23 letter \n     to you about the visa-processing policies of the State \n     Department. As you and the other Commissioners prepare to \n     write your final report, I offer what I hope will be taken as \n     constructive criticism of the statements.\n       What the Commission staff did not note is the most \n     important point of all: if the law had been followed, at \n     least 15 of the 19 9/11 terrorists would not have been in the \n     country on September 11. The visa applications of the \n     hijackers were so flawed that no reasonable person could have \n     believed that they met the standards for entry imposed by the \n     law for all visa applicants. Making matters worse, no matter \n     how deficient the paper applications, most of the Saudi \n     applicants were granted visas without an oral interview, \n     clearly contrary to both the spirit and intent of the law, \n     which makes clear that applicants for nonimmigrant visas are \n     considered ineligible for a visa until they prove their own \n     eligibility. In other words, our law creates a presumption \n     against granting the visa by putting the burden of proof on \n     the applicant.\n       Under Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     an alien applying to enter the U.S. shall be ``presume[d] to \n     be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of \n     the consular officer, at the time of application for \n     admission, . . . that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant \n     status.'' In other words, the law is intentionally designed \n     to force applicants to prove eligibility for a nonimmigrant \n     visa. For Saudi nationals, however, visas were all but \n     guaranteed to be issued--directly in conflict with the spirit \n     and intent of the law.\n       All 15 of the Saudi's applications contained inaccuracies \n     or omissions that should have prevented them from obtaining \n     visas; and, despite initial indications by the State \n     Department that almost all of the Saudi applicants had been \n     interviewed, only two of the 15 Saudi applicants were \n     interviewed by State.\n       The errors in the applications weren't trivial mistakes, \n     such as punctuation or spelling. Visas were granted to young, \n     single Saudi males who omitted fundamental information such \n     as: means of financial support (and it appears none of the 15 \n     hijackers whose applications survived provided supporting \n     documentation), home address, and destination or address \n     while in the U.S. The October 28, 2002 National Review \n     article by Joel Mowbray, ``Visas for Terrorists: They were \n     ill-prepared. They were laughable. They were approved,'' \n     provides the details about these mistakes.\n       In his article, Mowbray writes that, ``For almost all of \n     the applications, the terrorists\n\n[[Page S10679]]\n\n     filled out the `Present Occupation' field with `Student.' \n     Salem al Hamzi boldly wrote `unemployed,' while Khalid al \n     Mihdhar described himself as a `businessman.' Only on three \n     forms was the area marked `Name and Address of Present \n     Employer or School' even filled out. In answering the \n     question, `Who will furnish financial support,' most of them \n     listed `Myself,' while the rest cited family--despite a \n     complete failure in most applications to demonstrate the \n     requisite financial means.'' Mowbray goes on to write, \n     ``Unclear destination in the United States. On the visa form, \n     the applicant must identify the address where he will be in \n     the United States . . . But, only one of the 15 applicants \n     lists an actual address, with the rest stating locations . . \n     . such as `California,' `New York,' `Hotel.' Not one of these \n     woefully lacking answers warranted so much as a correction by \n     a consular officer, let alone an outright denial.''\n       Allowing for such incomplete attention to the visa \n     applicants was not uncommon practice in the State Department, \n     particularly in Saudi Arabia. The GAO's October 2002 report, \n     ``Border Security: Visa Process Should be Strengthened as \n     Antiterrorism Tool,'' said, ``At some posts we visited, \n     [consular officers] faced pressures to issue visas.'' In its \n     report the GAO concluded, ``A lack of clear guidance . . . \n     resulted in wide discrepancies among posts in the level of \n     scrutiny of visa applications and in factors used to refuse \n     visas to questionable applicants.'' In fact, the State \n     Department's written guidelines and resulting practices, as \n     outlined in the GAO report, allowed for widespread \n     discretionary adherence among consular officers in adhering \n     to the burden of proof requirements included in Section \n     214(b). As stated in the GAO report, the State Department's \n     ``Consular Best Practices Handbook'' gave consular managers \n     and staff the discretion to:\n       ``waive the personal appearance and interviews for certain \n     nonimmigrant visa applicants, and give the authority to use \n     third parties, such as travel agencies, to help persons \n     complete application. The written guidance did not specify \n     what documentation, if any, consular managers or officers \n     needed [to provide] support about their decisions to waive \n     personal appearances or interviews.''\n       This is exemplified by then-Assistant Secretary for \n     Consular Affairs Mary Ryan's cables and other written notices \n     to embassies telling them that eliminating the visa process \n     wherever possible was ``a very worthy goal,'' and the State \n     Department's design and implementation, under her watch, of \n     ``Visa Express,'' which formalized lax, expedited visa \n     policies for the first and only time for an entire nation, \n     Saudi Arabia.\n       Mary Ryan believed in the importance of interviews, but not \n     for purposes of screening out those who shouldn't be \n     receiving visas. She wrote in a 2001 cable, ``When it comes \n     to judging credibility, there is simply no substitute for a \n     personal interview.'' Sounds good, but Ryan's emphasis was on \n     admitting more people. She went on to write, ``Consular \n     officers should avoid keeping out `qualified aliens'' who \n     appeared weak on paper but could have overcome [that \n     appearance] with a strong showing of credibility.'' Mary Ryan \n     explains further that the intent of Consular Affair's policy \n     is to ``permit a waiver of the interview when it is clear \n     that the alien is eligible for the visa and an interview \n     would be an unnecessary inconvenience.'' (Emphasis added)\n       Rather than criticize State's policies, 9/11 Commission \n     staff statements excuse the actions of the State Department, \n     stating the Department followed its own policies. The \n     Commission report remarks, ``To our knowledge, State consular \n     officers followed their standard operating procedures in \n     every case.'' But that begs the question of whether that \n     policy was (a) allowed by the law, and (b) sensible under the \n     circumstances. The State Department should not be judged on \n     whether or not its policies were followed, but on whether its \n     policies followed the law, and whether the 9/11 terrorists, \n     who did not qualify for visas under the law, should have been \n     granted visas to enter the United States. The Commission \n     staff's second report essentially adopts the State \n     Department's assertion that better watchlisting by \n     intelligence agencies would have been the best prevention \n     measure. But this obscures the larger point--if the State \n     Department had followed immigration law, 9/11 would not have \n     happened. The terrorists would have had to find another way \n     to get into the country.\n       In addition to its silence about Consular Affairs' \n     dereliction of duty with respect to complying with \n     immigration law, that the Commission members did not comment \n     on why the Consular Affairs office of the State Department, \n     the lead agency before 9/11 on terrorism matters, believed \n     that it needed to be ``informed . . . that Saudi citizens \n     could pose security risks,'' is very troubling.\n       Either blatant disregard, or ignorance of the facts \n     surrounding Saudi Arabia (even though it was the Department's \n     responsibility to know the issues) allowed for the creation \n     of the now-defunct Visa Express program specifically for \n     Saudi Arabia. The formal exemption of Saudis from the \n     interview process and the acceptance of nearly all Saudi \n     applications through travel agents (with a financial interest \n     in the applicants' approval) gave non-governmental agents the \n     de facto ability to shape U.S. immigration policy. Three of \n     the hijackers, in late summer, entered the country through \n     this program.\n       The Commission staff, however, practically defends the \n     Saudi Visa Express program in its comments by stating that it \n     ``was established in part to keep crowds of people from \n     congregating outside the posts, which was a security risk to \n     the posts . . .'' The Commission report goes on to say that \n     it ``found no evidence that the Visa Express program had any \n     effect on the interview or approval rates for Saudi \n     applicants . . . or reduced scrutiny . . . `` Maybe not, but \n     it certainly took everything bad about visa processing policy \n     and rolled it into a formal program for Saudi Arabia, home to \n     many Islamic militants and to 15 of the 19 terrorists. \n     Secretary Lehman and Mr. Ben-Veniste, your Commission \n     members, pointed out during their exchange with Mary Ryan on \n     January 23, that it was common knowledge that Saudi Arabia \n     was home to many radical Islamists and some al Qaeda \n     operatives specifically, and by inference that a program \n     formalizing weak visa processing policies was wrong.\n       Mary Ryan's lack of common knowledge about the hostility of \n     many Saudi citizens toward the U.S., and, at the least, the \n     Saudi government's complacency about such fanaticism, caused \n     much concern for Lehman and Ben-Veniste. That these \n     exchanges, or at least their implications, did not warrant \n     even a mention from the Commission staff is disturbing.\n       On January 23, Ben-Veniste asked Mary Ryan the following, \n     `` Here, in the summer of '01 and somewhat before, you have \n     recognized that a crowd control at the embassy or at the \n     consular office, offices in Saudi Arabia posed a problem \n     because of the potential harm to individuals from those who \n     meant the United Sates and its interests harm. If we take \n     that just one step further, would you agree that the \n     individuals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who might pose \n     such a threat to cause harm to individuals at or about the \n     embassy would be Saudis rather than foreigners?''\n       ``[O]nce you acknowledge that there is certainly a number \n     of Saudis who might be in a position to do us harm through \n     violence against individuals at or near our consular offices, \n     it doesn't take a whole lot to go to the next step, even \n     without specific information from our intelligence agencies, \n     that such individuals who mean us harm might in fact wish to \n     come to the United Sates. So the notion, would you not agree, \n     of Saudis not posing a particular threat being taken out of \n     that threat matrix really doesn't stand up even on the basis \n     of cursory information that you had available?''\n       ``Saudis mean us harm in Saudi Arabia because they might \n     blow up the embassy or harm individuals in the vicinity of \n     the embassy but the Saudis who might seek entrance to the \n     United States were not considered a problem?''\n       In her response, Ryan continues to refuse to acknowledge \n     that for a number of reasons, the visas of Saudi citizens \n     should not have automatically been approved. She said, ``You \n     know, in the absence of information that someone is a threat \n     to the nation, we are dependent on the information that we \n     have in our system developed by intelligence and law \n     enforcement agencies about people who mean us harm.''\n       In her next interchange, with Secretary Lehman, Ryan's \n     response is similar. Secretary Lehman asked, ``In some of the \n     interviewing of some of your officials that were doing the \n     actual consular functions in Saudi Arabia at the time, they \n     said in so many words, gosh, if we only knew. If someone had \n     told us that Saudi Arabia was a threat. We thought that they \n     were our friends and all we were looking for were people who \n     were trying to immigrate and we weren't looking for \n     terrorists. Well, hello. I mean, did anybody read the \n     newspapers? I mean there were books. The literature was rife, \n     you know, books like ``Among the Believers'' that catalogued \n     this tremendous proselytizing of hatred and of fundamentalism \n     around the world, sourced in Saudi Arabia, with many Saudi \n     Arabian institutions and clerics the source of it. . . . So, \n     I don't think the record supports your view.''\n       Ryan responded, ``Before September 11, and I think even \n     after September 11th, until now, I think that this \n     government, our government, does regard Saudi Arabia as an \n     ally. In the current issue of Foreign Affairs, the deputy \n     secretary says that we have every confidence in the crown \n     prince of Saudi Arabia to carry out the reforms that he is \n     trying to carry out. I mean, that doesn't sound like we \n     regard Saudi Arabia as a state sponsor of terrorism. It was \n     never so identified before September 11, it was never so \n     identified after September 11.'' But the obvious fault \n     in Ryan's logic is that even if one considers the Saudi \n     government an ally, that does not mean that its nationals \n     pose no security threat to the United States.\n       The State Department has repeatedly claimed that its visa \n     policies in Saudi Arabia were reasonable since it lacked \n     specific intelligence to determine that it should have acted \n     otherwise. This claim, however, is dubious at best, \n     considering that pre-9/11, the State Department was \n     considered the lead agency on counterterrorism. While it is \n     often said that pre-9/11 actions can be excused because \n     terrorism was not deemed a primary concern, the fact is that \n     the top agency for counterterrorism before 9/11, the State \n     Department, knew, or should have known, the risks in \n     deliberately reversing the presumption in the immigration law \n     in order to make it as easy as possible for people to obtain \n     visas in a country with known terrorist elements. Even long \n     after State learned that 15 of the 19 terrorists were Saudi \n     nationals--\n\n[[Page S10680]]\n\n     and that their visas applications were clearly not sufficient \n     under the law--the Department adamantly refused to tighten \n     visa procedures and only began interviewing all nonimmigrant \n     applicants between the ages of 12 and 70, including Saudi \n     citizens, in July of 2002--a full ten months after the \n     terrorist attacks.\n       Although Saudi Arabia was and is considered a U.S. ally, it \n     was the responsibility of the Consular Affairs assistant \n     secretary to know, even before 9/11, the Saudi-terrorism \n     connection and how it might have been present among \n     individuals trying to get into the U.S. The Commission report \n     should have made this connection, but it did not. It found no \n     real fault of Consular Affairs in this regard.\n       As I mentioned at the outset, I hope you will use my \n     findings to advance constructively the final report of the 9/\n     11 Commission. I believe that if you are going to provide an \n     accurate picture to the American public about what caused the \n     tragic events of September 11, you must place greater \n     emphasis on our government's approach to visa processing and \n     its compliance with immigration law in this regard, and on \n     processing in Saudi Arabia in particular. As important as it \n     is to examine the intelligence failures before 9/11, it is no \n     less important to discuss how simple enforcement of the law \n     would have prevented at least 15 of the 19 9/11 terrorists \n     from being in the United States on that tragic day.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 2004.\n     The Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     Member National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n         United States, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Slade: I write to convey how important I believe it is \n     that the 9/11 Commission focus on the State Department's, and \n     to a lesser degree, Immigration and Naturalization Service's, \n     contribution to the dysfunction of our government before \n     September 11.\n       It is clear to me that the State Department's Office of \n     Consular Affairs, headed then by Mary Ryan, was utterly \n     ineffective in making sure U.S. security interests were \n     protected. Having read Ms. Ryan's January 24, 2004 testimony \n     before the Commission and her responses to its questions, I \n     have concluded, that, even today, she does not understand \n     that, if U.S. laws related to the processing and approving of \n     visa applications had been followed, September 11 could have \n     been prevented.\n       Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act \n     presumes that an alien who apples for a temporary visa \n     actually intends to stay here permanently ``until [the alien] \n     establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer'' \n     that he only intends to come here temporarily. The State \n     Department should not deem an applicant as having established \n     his intent until all processes related to the visa are \n     complete and until a face-to-face interview has been \n     conducted. Before September 11, consular officers were \n     allowed to regularly approve temporary visa applications even \n     when applications were incomplete and no face-to-face \n     interviews were conducted.\n       On January 24, in response to a question from Commissioner \n     Gorelick about ``how and in what circumstances the hijackers \n     got into this country,'' Mary Ryan declared that consular \n     officials ``adjudicated the visas correctly.'' This is simply \n     false. At a minimum, the applications of the hijackers were \n     incomplete. All 19 had omissions and inconsistencies on their \n     visa applications that should have raised concerns about why \n     they wanted visas (see Mowbray article enclosed). \n     Additionally, personal interviews should, in my view, have \n     been required of all intending immigrants in order for the \n     State Department to have been in compliance with 214(b). \n     Consular Affairs, contrary to its initial statements about \n     this matter, failed to personally interview 13 of the 15 \n     terrorists who were from Saudi Arabia.\n       Since these processes were not successfully completed, the \n     visas, by law, should have been denied.\n       In October 2002, Senator Feinstein and I, as ranking member \n     and chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, \n     wrote to Secretary of State Powell to impress upon him that \n     the manifest weaknesses of our nation's visa system \n     contributed, and will continue to contribute, to the risk of \n     terrorism against the United States and its citizens. I \n     enclose for your review our letter, a list of 20 additional \n     questions we submitted to Secretary Powell about visa \n     processing, and the State Department's answers. As you will \n     see from its answers, the Department refuses to acknowledge \n     that, if it had exercised its obligations under the law, and \n     refused visas to the terrorists, September 11 might have been \n     prevented.\n       Enclosed as well is a copy of the additional views Senator \n     Roberts and I appended to the December 2002 Intelligence \n     Committees' Joint Inquiry Staff Report. In our statement, we \n     make clear that these deficiencies, and an evident \n     unwillingness to make existing State Department security \n     mechanisms work properly, contributed to the tragedy.\n       I also urge you to review the exchange Ms. Ryan had with \n     Commissioners Ben-Veniste and Lehman wherein she shows a lack \n     of comprehension that special treatment of Saudis seeking \n     U.S. visas simply should not have occurred, given the \n     prevalence in Saudi Arabia of Wahhabism, a virulently anti-\n     American strain of Islam. I enclose, in addition, articles by \n     investigative reporter Joel Mowbray that provide details \n     about State Department activities, and particularly about the \n     issuance of visas to Saudi citizens. The State Department's \n     presumption that most Saudis were eligible for visas was \n     inexcusable and, I believe, definitively contributed to the \n     terrorist attacks on our nation.\n       Bottom line: 9-11 could have been prevented if State \n     Department officials had done their job. What are we doing to \n     ensure they do so in the future?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10680-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICAN MUSIC MONTH\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. A few years ago, a New York Times story reported that \n``Lamar Alexander grew up in a lower, middle class family in the \nmountains of East Tennessee.'' The article so offended my mother I \nfound her reading Thessalonians to help deal with what she regarded as \na ``slur on our family.''\n  ``We never thought about ourselves that way,'' she told me. ``You had \na library card from the day you were three and a music lesson from the \nday you were four. You had everything you needed that was important.''\n  I was 4 years old in Maryville, TN, a town of about 10,000 then, when \nmy mother took me to Maryville College to learn how to play the piano. \nOne of the college professors loaned us a battered upright piano which \nsat in our living room for several years. Every day before school, I \nwould bang away on Czerny, Bach, Beethoven and Mozart--and throw in a \nlittle Jerry Lee Lewis when I thought no one was around to correct me.\n  I participated in annual piano contests sponsored by the National \nFederation of Music Clubs. I played in the Maryville High School band \nand played piano at revival meetings while my father--who had a \nbeautiful tenor voice--led the singing.\n  After working during the day as a law clerk in New Orleans for Judge \nJohn Minor Wisdom I played trombone, tuba and washboard in the band at \nYour Father's Moustache on Bourbon Street to earn a little extra money.\n  When I walked across the State in a winning campaign for Governor I \ntook four students from the University of Tennessee marching band with \nme. We performed as Alexander's Washboard Band dozens of times from the \nback of a flatbed truck.\n  As Governor, I could think of only one way to unify our State that \nwas made up of so many different climates, political beliefs and \npeople, and that was our music. From the Carter family in Bristol, to \nMusic City in Nashville, to the blues and gospel of Beale Street in \nMemphis. Tennessee can be said to be the home of American music.\n  As Education Secretary in the first Bush administration I was asked \nto be the Republican speaker at the annual Gridiron Dinner, a press \ngathering where public careers are made or broken. When I found that \nTexas Governor Ann Richards was the Democrat speaker I decided that was \nnot a contest I was likely to win. So instead of speaking, I wrote some \nlyrics to country music songs and sang and played the piano.\n  Music has been throughout my life a source of inspiration and joy. I \nsuspect that is true for most Americans. It is a rare American who does \nnot have some story about how music has made our lives richer and more \ninteresting, how it has changed our moods, brought out the best in our \ncharacter and even sometimes helped us earn a living.\n  So I am proud to join with the Senator from Illinois and co-sponsor \nthis important resolution declaring American Music Month. Our music is \nan integral part of the American character, and we should celebrate it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10680-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10680-S10681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the educators, \nadministrators, parents, and children of my home State of Wyoming. \nSince the implementation of No Child Left Behind in 2001, our students \nhave increased their test scores, proving that our schools are taking \nthe adequate steps needed to ensure academic proficiency for all \nstudents, including those who are disadvantaged. The basis of No Child \nLeft Behind is simple. It says that every 4th grader should be able to \nread, and do mathematics at a 4th\n\n[[Page S10681]]\n\ngrade level; every 8th grader at an 8th grade level, and every 11th \ngrader at an 11th grade level. But making it work calls for the hard \nwork and dedication of all individuals involved with education--from \nthe parents to the teachers, to the legislators and administrators. By \nputting the children first, our schools are making the progress needed \nfor students to perform at their intended level, which will help them \nexcel later in life.\n  The 2004 results of the WyCAS, our State's assessment, show that 47 \npercent of fourth graders in Wyoming tested as advanced or proficient \nin reading, 40 percent in writing, and 39 percent in mathematics. While \nthere is still room for improvement, all three are increases from last \nyear's scores of 44, 37, and 37 percent respectively. In addition, 57 \npercent of the 8th grade students tested as advanced or proficient in \nwriting, almost a 10-percent increase from the previous year, when they \nscored 48 percent.\n  A few schools that made tremendous growth this year should be \nespecially proud of themselves. Moorcroft Junior High now has 81 \npercent of their students proficient in writing as compared to only 38 \npercent last year. Sundance Junior High also produced exceptional \nresults in math, with 74 percent of their students performing at \nproficient or advanced level, compared to 39 percent last year.\n  Improvements have not only been made from last year to this year but \nover time as well. The 11th graders, who took the WyCAS as 8th graders \nin 2001, improved their mathematics scores from 32 percent being \nadvanced or proficient to 44 percent. In reading, the results were \nsimilar. They jumped from 39 percent as 8th graders to 50 percent as \n11th graders.\n  The results are a good indication that our students are learning and \nour teachers are working hard to leave no child behind. I am pleased \nwith Wyoming's dedication to education, and I look forward to learning \nthe results of other indicators that No Child Left Behind uses to \nassure schools are making adequate yearly progress. I encourage Wyoming \nschools to keep up the good work and continue to put the children \nfirst.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10681-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10681-S10682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SPEECH TO THE UNITED NATIONS BY TASSOS PAPADOPOULOS, PRESIDENT OF \n                                 CYPRUS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance \nof continuing every effort to help achieve a workable and lasting peace \nfor the people of Cyprus.\n  I would like to read some of the comments recently delivered by \nCypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos in his recent address to the \nUnited Nations General Assembly.\n  As President Papadopolous told members of the General Assembly:\n\n       Surely the aspiration of humanity revolves around achieving \n     the full respect of human rights, democracy, and the rule of \n     law. The collective vision and effort required to fulfill \n     this massive endeavor demands the contribution of all, to the \n     extent of their capabilities.\n\n  The President further stated:\n\n       We are committed and dedicated to a bizonal, bicommunal \n     federal solution that would bring about the reunification of \n     our homeland which would be workable, viable and make a \n     reality the gradual rapprochement of the communities in \n     Cyprus, the social and economic reunification and which will \n     not institute the division of the communities and \n     institutions.\n\n  Cyprus' European Union accession marks a great milestone and the \nbeginning of a new era for the people of Cyprus.\n  Cyprus and the United States are bound together by common democratic \ntraditions, values, ideas and interests. We have a history of working \ntogether effectively to fight threats to global security. We in the \nUnited States must continue to push for a peace plan that will be \nacceptable to the people of Cyprus.\n  I am firmly convinced that the people of Cyprus want peace. The road \nto peace will only come through a plan that is fair and that is \nworkable. I join with the leadership of the Greek American national \norganizations in their commendable efforts to move the peace process \nahead in a positive and constructive way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the Record, the recent address by \nthe President of Cyprus, Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos to the General \nAssembly of the United Nations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Address by the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Tassos \nPapadopoulos, at the General Assembly of the United Nations, September \n                                23, 2004\n\n       Mr. President, I wish to start by conveying to you my most \n     sincere congratulations on your election as President of this \n     session of the General Assembly and wish you every success in \n     steering the work of this august body. I would also like to \n     extend our thanks and appreciation to the President of the \n     58th Session of the General Assembly, especially for his \n     inspired efforts to promote so vigorously the agenda of \n     United Nations reform and the revitalisation of the General \n     Assembly.\n       As this is the last Session of the General Assembly ahead \n     of the 2005 Major Event, we must proceed to evaluate the \n     prospect of attaining the ambitious targets we set at the \n     turn of the Millennium. Determining a hierarchy in our \n     priorities and identifying and pursuing specific targets, has \n     been a major step in fostering the values, principles, and \n     objectives embodied in the Millennium Declaration. The Major \n     Event, however, will be the first real assessment of our \n     progress towards the implementation of the Declaration and of \n     the outcome of major world Conferences, and of initiatives \n     such as the one launched by the Presidents of Brazil, France, \n     Chile and the Prime Minister of Spain to eradicate poverty \n     and hunger, as well as the initiative of the Presidents of \n     Finland and Tanzania on the social dimension of \n     globalisation.\n       Specifically with regard to the Millennium Development \n     Goals, we believe that the ability to make development on the \n     ground an issue of global concern as a result of these \n     pledges, will measure the ability of the United Nations to \n     induce significant change and advances where they are most \n     needed. At the same time, the achievement of these \n     objectives, which form an essential part of the Millennium \n     Declaration, will judge to a great extent the efficacy of \n     the United Nations in pursuing successfully a global and \n     comprehensive agenda, which pertains to the prosperity of \n     the population of a significant number of its member \n     states.\n       The Republic of Cyprus supports the strengthening of the \n     United Nations system through the reform process underway, \n     and looks forward to the Report of the High-Level Panel and \n     the recommendations of the Secretary-General. We attach \n     particular importance to the revitalisation of the General \n     Assembly and to the reform of the Security Council, so that, \n     its structure will reflect contemporary political realities \n     and a more balanced geographical representation. In the \n     spirit of these two principles and with the aim of \n     reinforcing the legitimacy and efficacy of the Council, \n     Cyprus is supportive of increasing both permanent and non-\n     permanent membership. In this respect, we believe that the \n     joint French and German position on the enlargement of the \n     Council could provide a basis for achieving the above \n     mentioned objectives.\n       We share the assessment of the Secretary-General in his \n     Report that our endeavour of consolidating effective \n     multilateralism in a flexible and versatile United Nations, \n     is the best way to address the complete spectrum of global \n     crises and ensure that there exist preventive mechanisms to \n     avert each one. Such consolidation also applies to security \n     deficits and particularly terrorism the underlying causes of \n     which, we have been unable to eliminate despite our concerted \n     efforts. We consider that the conclusion of a United Nations \n     comprehensive convention against terrorism is important in \n     order to facilitate the elimination of the threat posed by \n     terrorism, in the framework of international legality.\n       Addressing other deficiencies in the international system, \n     particularly the ones which give rise to crisis situations \n     and humanitarian disasters, should also be considered a \n     matter of both urgency and priority. Darfur is one such \n     crisis, which, following many others like it, keeps Africa at \n     the heart of our concerns. It manifests why we should not \n     only focus the majority of our humanitarian resources and \n     peace-keeping efforts to it but why we should make every \n     possible effort to make sustainable development a global \n     reality. We welcome also the expanding co-operation between \n     the United Nations and regional Organisations, which we \n     consider to be the most effective method of addressing such \n     issues. Of course, we attach particular significance to the \n     collaboration between the United Nations and the European \n     Union in managing crisis situations.\n       The Middle East is another region which remains volatile \n     despite growing global concern and in spite of many attempts \n     to restore the Peace Process in the Israeli-Palestinian \n     conflict. So long as violence remains a vivid reality in the \n     region it will not be possible to create those conditions \n     under which peace building can be accomplished. We deem \n     necessary a more active involvement of the Quartet in the \n     efforts to implement the road map and intercept the cycle of \n     violence. More emphasis should also be given to the task of \n     improving living conditions in order to normalise people's \n     lives to the greatest possible extent. Our support remains \n     focused on the end of the occupation and on a just and viable \n     settlement, based on UN Resolutions and for the realisation \n     of the aspirations of the Palestinian people for the\n\n[[Page S10682]]\n\n     establishment of an independent state, living side by side \n     with Israel, in conditions of sustainable peace and security.\n       Surely the aspiration of humanity revolves around achieving \n     the full respect of human rights, democracy, and the rule of \n     law. The collective vision and effort required to fulfil this \n     massive endeavour demands the contribution of all, to the \n     extent of their capabilities. Cyprus is prepared to play its \n     part from its vantage point in the European Union whilst \n     drawing upon its traditional participation in Fora dedicated \n     to promoting agendas pertaining to these values. This \n     affiliation has been a source of support for us since Cyprus' \n     independence, and its impact not only makes us grateful but \n     has also endowed us with sensitivities that will continue to \n     be an integral part of our approach.\n       I would like to emphasise how proud we are that Cyprus is \n     now a full member of the European Union. The European Union \n     has outlined an extensive set of priorities for this Session \n     of the General Assembly. As the statement delivered by the \n     Dutch Presidency has delineated these priorities, I will not \n     elaborate on them any further.\n       This year marks 30 years since the occupation of 37% of \n     Cyprus' territory as a result of the invasion of the island \n     by Turkish troops. It also marks 30 years of relentless \n     efforts by the Greek Cypriots to achieve a just and peaceful \n     settlement, with the support of the international community, \n     to which I would like here to express our deep appreciation.\n       The Greek Cypriot side has repeatedly demonstrated in the \n     past thirty years, its readiness to move forward by making \n     many painful sacrifices and concessions, while the Turkish \n     Cypriot leadership always lacked the necessary political \n     will. The quest and eagerness of Greek Cypriots for a \n     solution never meant, however, that they would accept any \n     settlement proposed to them nor that they would be ready to \n     embark on an adventure, in all probability condemned to \n     failing, with irreversible consequences.\n       The latest effort by the UN Secretary-General to solve the \n     Cyprus problem resulted in a Plan, which, by some was \n     described as a historic opportunity to solve one of the \n     longest standing international problems. I will only briefly \n     outline why, despite the hard work invested in the process by \n     all involved, the end product of this effort was judged to be \n     inadequate and fell short of minimum expectations from a \n     settlement for Greek Cypriots.\n       Firstly, the Annan Plan was not the product of negotiation \n     nor did it constitute an agreed solution between the parties. \n     Secondly, the Plan did not place the necessary emphasis on \n     achieving a one State solution with a central government able \n     to guarantee the single sovereign character of Cyprus. \n     Thirdly, it failed to address the serious concerns of the \n     Greek Cypriot Community regarding their security and \n     effective implementation of the Plan.\n       In rejecting the Plan as a settlement for the Cyprus \n     problem the Greek Cypriots did not reject the solution or the \n     reunification of their country. They have rejected this \n     particular Plan as not effectively achieving this objective. \n     We remain committed to a solution which will ensure the \n     reunification of the country, its economy, and its people.\n       We are committed to reaching a solution on the basis of a \n     bizonal, bicommunal federation. However, there are a number \n     of essential parameters the Greek Cypriot Community insist \n     this solution to be founded on. The withdrawal of troops and \n     settlers and the respect of human rights for all Cypriots, \n     the underlying structures for a functioning economy, the \n     functionality and workability of the new state of affairs, \n     the just resolution of land and property issues in accordance \n     with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, and \n     the respect of the right of return of refugees. To this end, \n     we welcome the recent Pinheiro Progress Report on property \n     restitution in the context of the return of refugees and \n     internally displaced persons.\n       Simultaneously, it pains me to bring to your attention, Mr. \n     President, that certain provisions of the Annan Plan have \n     encouraged an unprecedented unlawful exploitation of occupied \n     properties in northern Cyprus, something alluded to even in \n     statements by officials of the occupying power itself.\n       The most paramount feature of any settlement is the ability \n     to install a sense of security to the people. The mistakes of \n     the past must not be repeated. Cyprus must in its future \n     course, proceed without any grey areas with regard to its \n     sovereignty or its relation to third states. If the people \n     feel that their needs have not formed the basis of any \n     solution reached or that the characteristics of this solution \n     have been dictated by the interests of third parties, then \n     this solution will unsurprisingly be bypassed. Indeed, the \n     spirit and practice of effective multilateralism not only \n     encompasses, but also derives from, the comprehension and \n     consideration of local realities and particulars, on which \n     it must then proceed to formulate proposals.\n       This should not be interpreted by third parties as a lack \n     of will to solve the Cyprus problem. Instead, it must be \n     unequivocally understood that the people who will have to \n     live with this solution are in the best position to judge \n     what is suitable for them, that it is imperative for the \n     people to be called upon to ratify any plans that are drawn \n     to this effect, and that their verdict must be respected.\n       In the framework of the European Union, and with the aim of \n     promoting reunification and reconciliation, my Government, \n     despite the obstacles placed by the current status quo, is \n     consistently pursuing policies aiming to enhance the economic \n     development of the Turkish Cypriots. While not intended to \n     serve as a substitute for a solution, such policies are in \n     our view the most effective way to foster the maximum \n     economic integration of the two Communities, and increase \n     contact between them, so as to ensure the viability of a \n     future solution.\n       Responding to the expanding possibilities on the ground, we \n     have intensified our efforts to ameliorate the situation and \n     seek ways to benefit citizens. In this context, my Government \n     has recently proposed the withdrawal of military forces from \n     sensitive areas and refraining from military exercises, the \n     opening of eight additional crossing points across the cease \n     fire line and the facilitation of the movement of persons, \n     goods and services across the Green Line, as well as the \n     extension of the so far unilateral de-mining process \n     initiated by my Government.\n       We have also declared our readiness to make special \n     arrangements whereby Turkish Cypriots will utilise Larnaca \n     Port for the export of their goods. Furthermore, subject to \n     the area of Varosha being returned under the control of the \n     Government of Cyprus and to its legitimate inhabitants, we \n     could accommodate the lawful operation of the port of \n     Famagusta.\n       The Cyprus problem is not always perceived in its correct \n     parameters. The fact remains that this problem is the result \n     of a military invasion and continued occupation of part of \n     the territory of a sovereign state. This fact should not be \n     conveniently overlooked in people's perception, by \n     concentrating on peripheral parameters. Any initiative to \n     solve the problem must have at its core, this most basic and \n     fundamental fact and be based on the premise that \n     international legality must be served and the occupation \n     lifted.\n       Unfortunately, the fundamentals of the situation on the \n     ground remain unchanged for the past 30 years since the \n     Turkish invasion in Cyprus. This situation is one comprising \n     of severe violations of the most fundamental human rights. \n     The yet unresolved issues of the missing persons, an issue of \n     a purely humanitarian nature, as well as that of the enclaved \n     of the Karpass peninsula, are in themselves an indication of \n     Cyprus' enduring suffering. This should not only point \n     towards the specifics of the solution to be pursued but must \n     also guide our actions with regard to managing the current \n     status quo. For instance, the United Nations Force in Cyprus \n     (UNFICYP), assigned with the task to manage the status quo \n     inflicted 30 years ago, should remain specific to the \n     situation on the ground.\n       The accession of Cyprus to the European Union, in \n     conjunction with the lack of an agreement on the settlement \n     of the Cyprus problem, in spite of our efforts and our \n     preference for a settlement prior to accession, signifies the \n     end of an era and the beginning of a new one. I firmly \n     believe that the new context defined by the accession of my \n     country to the EU and by the expressed will of Turkey to \n     advance on the European path offers a unique opportunity and \n     could have a catalytic effect in reaching a settlement in \n     Cyprus. Our vocation is to be partners and not enemies.\n       Hence, in this new era, we plea to Turkey, to join us in \n     turning the page and seeking ways to mutually discover, \n     mutually beneficial solutions to the various aspects that \n     compose the Cyprus problem. The mere realisation that peace \n     and stability in our region serve the interests of both our \n     countries is ample evidence to prove that what unites us is \n     stronger than what divides us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10682-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10682-S10685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 2773\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a cost \nestimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office to accompany \nSenate Report 108-314, the committee report to S. 2773, the Water \nResources Development Act of 2004, be printed in the Record. The \nestimate was not available when the report was filed by the Committee \non Environment and Public Works on August 25, 2004.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Cost of Legislation\n\n       Section 403 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \n     Control Act requires that a statement of the cost of the \n     reported bill, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, \n     be included in the report. That statement follows:\n                               __________\n                               \n\n\n                      CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE\n\n     S. 2773, Water Resources Development Act of 2004, as reported \n         by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works \n         on August 25, 2004.\n     Summary\n       S. 2773 would authorize the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) \n     to conduct water resource studies and undertake specified \n     projects and programs for flood control, inland navigation, \n     shoreline protection, and environmental restoration. The bill \n     would authorize the agency to conduct studies on water \n     resource needs and feasibility studies for specified projects \n     and to convey ownership of certain Federal properties. \n     Finally, the bill would extend, terminate, or modify existing\n\n[[Page S10683]]\n\n     authorizations for various water projects and would authorize \n     new programs to develop water resources and protect the \n     environment.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, including \n     adjustments for increases in anticipated inflation, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 2773 would cost about $2.9 \n     billion over the 2005-2009 period and an additional $4 \n     billion over the 10 years after 2009. (Some construction \n     costs and operations and maintenance would continue or occur \n     after this period.)\n       S. 2773 also would allow for the spending of certain \n     receipts from hydroelectricity sales associated with Army \n     Corps of Engineers projects for facility planning, operation, \n     maintenance, and upgrades, without further appropriation. \n     Most of the receipts would come from electricity sold by the \n     government's power marketing administrations (PMAs), \n     including the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). This \n     provision also would direct the PMAs to reduce the \n     maintenance component of the electricity rate charged to \n     customers. The bill would convey parcels of land to various \n     nonFederal entities and would forgive the obligation of some \n     local government agencies to pay certain project costs. \n     Finally, the bill would allow the Corps to collect and spend \n     fees related to training courses and permit processing. CBO \n     estimates that enacting those provisions would increase \n     direct spending by $803 million in 2005, $5.3 billion over \n     the 2005-2009 period, and $10.8 billion over the 2005-2014 \n     period. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues.\n       S. 2773 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). Federal participation in water resources projects and \n     programs authorized by this bill would benefit state, local, \n     and tribal governments, and any costs to those governments to \n     comply with the conditions of this Federal assistance would \n     be incurred voluntarily.\n     Estimated Cost to the Federal Government\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 2773 is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget functions 300 (natural resources and the environment) \n     and 270 (energy).\n\n                    TABLE 1.

This bill also would modify many existing Corps \n     projects and programs by increasing the amounts authorized to \n     be appropriated to construct or maintain them or by \n     increasing the Federal share of project costs. Assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary funds, CBO estimates that \n     implementing this bill would cost $2.8 billion over the 2005-\n     2009 period and an additional $4 billion over the 10 years \n     after 2009. For ongoing construction costs of previously \n     authorized projects, the Corps received a 2004 appropriation \n     of $1.6 billion.\n       For new water projects specified in the bill, the Corps \n     provided CBO with estimates of annual budget authority needed \n     to meet design and construction schedules. CBO adjusted those \n     estimates to reflect the impact of anticipated inflation \n     during the time between project authorization and \n     appropriation of construction costs. Estimated outlays are \n     based on historical spending rates for Corps projects.\n       Significant New Authorizations. S. 2773 would authorize the \n     Army Corps of Engineers to conduct water resource studies and \n     undertake specified projects and programs for flood control, \n     inland navigation, shoreline protection, and environmental \n     restoration. For example, the bill includes authorizations \n     for enhanced navigation improvements on the Upper Mississippi \n     River at an estimated Federal cost of $1.7 billion and an \n     ecosystem restoration project, also on the Upper Mississippi \n     River, at an estimated Federal cost of $1.46 billion. Another \n     large project authorized by this bill is the Indian River \n     Lagoon project in the Florida Everglades at an estimated \n     Federal cost of $604 million. Construction of those projects \n     would likely take more than 15 years.\n       Fish and Wildlife Mitigation. Section 1011 would amend the \n     Water Resources Act of 1986 to establish a standard for fish \n     and wildlife habitat mitigation on certain Corps projects. S. \n     2773 would require the Corps to develop a mitigation plan \n     that restores the same number of acres of habitat that would \n     fully replace the hydrologic and ecological functions that \n     are lost because of construction of a Corps project. For this \n     estimate, CBO assumes that this provision would apply to \n     potential projects that are being studied but have not yet \n     been submitted to the Congress for authorization. CBO \n     estimates this provision would have no significant cost. \n     However, it is possible that the Administration could \n     interpret this provision to be applicable to authorized \n     projects that have not yet begun or completed construction. \n     Under that interpretation, this provision would increase \n     future construction costs significantly.\n       Deauthorizations. S. 2773 would withdraw the authority for \n     the Corps to build over 55 projects authorized in previous \n     legislation. Based on information from the Corps, however, \n     CBO does not expect that the agency would begin most of those \n     projects over the next 5 years. Some do not have a local \n     sponsor to pay nonFederal costs, others do not pass certain \n     tests for economic viability, and still others do not pass \n     certain tests for environmental protection. Consequently, CBO \n     estimates that canceling the authority to build those \n     projects would provide no significant savings over the next \n     several years.\n       Direct Spending\n       Based on information from affected agencies, CBO estimates \n     that enacting S. 2773 would increase direct spending by about \n     $800 million in 2005 and $10.8 billion over the 2005-2014 \n     period. Table 2 presents the direct spending components of \n     the bill. Most of the direct spending under the bill would \n     stem from provisions to allow for the spending of certain \n     receipts associated with Corps projects for facility \n     planning, operation, maintenance, and upgrades without \n     further appropriation.\n       Improvement of Water Management at Corps of Engineers \n     Reservoirs. Section 1006 of the bill would designate that all \n     receipts associated with Corps projects be spent, without \n     further appropriation, on operations, maintenance, and \n     upgrades at its facilities. The Federal power marketing \n     administrations (including the Bonneville Power \n     Administration) collect receipts from the sale of \n     hydroelectric power at Corps dams. The Corps also collects \n     fees associated with other activities at its projects. \n     Overall, the bill would make available for spending, on \n     average, about $1 billion per year of those receipts. Because \n     those receipts would otherwise be deposited in the Treasury, \n     CBO estimates that enacting section 1006 would increase \n     direct spending by $595 million in 2005 and $9.7 billion over \n     the 2005-2014 period.\n       The bill specifies how the funds would be spent. Most of \n     the funds, 80 percent, would be spent within the same Corps \n     district from which they are collected. The remaining 20 \n     percent would be available agencywide for any Corps project.\n       Spending of Receipts Collected by the Bonneville Power \n     Administration. The bill would make receipts collected by BPA \n     from the sale of hydroelectric power at Corps dams available \n     for spending by the Corps. Unlike hydroelectricity receipts \n     collected by the other PMAs, all receipts collected by BPA go \n     into a revolving fund and are spent for operating its \n     electricity system and repaying previous appropriations and \n     Treasury borrowing. Because a portion of BPA's generating \n     revenues from Corps dams are used to keep its system \n     functioning, CBO assumes that only those receipts that would \n     be used to repay previous appropriations and Treasury \n     borrowing, that is, BPA's intergovernmental payments, would \n     be available for spending by the Corps.\n       Under current law, CBO estimates that BPA's \n     intergovernmental payments will be, on average, about $730 \n     million per year over the 2005-2014 period. Under S. 2773, we \n     assume that such payments would continue to made but would be \n     spent without further appropriation for operations and \n     maintenance at Corps facilities. BPA's Treasury payments \n     fluctuate from year to year based on how much cash is \n     available at the end of each fiscal year (changing water \n     conditions and electricity prices can swing BPA's annual \n     revenues significantly) and the maturities and interest rates \n     of Treasury bonds issued on BPA's behalf. CBO estimates that \n     spending of BPA receipts by the Corps would total $457 \n     million in 2005 and $7.1 billion over the 2005-2014 period.\n       Spending of Receipts Collected by the Other Power Marketing \n     Administrations. Receipts collected by the Southwestern, \n     Southeastern, and Western Power Administrations from the sale \n     of hydroelectric power at Corps dams are currently deposited \n     in the Treasury. Under this bill, those funds would be spent \n     by the Corps, without further appropriation, for operations \n     and maintenance at its facilities. CBO estimates that \n     spending of PMA receipts by the Corps would total $117 \n     million in 2005 and $2.4 billion over the 2005-2014 period.\n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\n\n\n                                TABLE 2.

S. 2773 also \n     would allow the Corps to spend any proceeds that it collects \n     in grazing fees, shoreline management permit fees, and \n     municipal and industrial water supply fees. The Corps could \n     spend such funds for operations and maintenance at its \n     facilities. CBO estimates that spending of such receipts \n     would total $21 million in 2005 and $288 million over the \n     2005-2014 period.\n       Impact on Future Corps Appropriations. By making about $1 \n     billion a year available for operations and maintenance at \n     Corps facilities without further appropriation, the bill \n     could lead to future reductions in the amounts appropriated \n     for such purposes. In fiscal year 2004, the Corps received an \n     appropriation of almost $2 billion for operations and \n     maintenance costs. Enacting this bill could result in a \n     reduction in future appropriations if the Congress chose to \n     maintain total Corps spending at a level similar to the \n     amount appropriated in 2004. For this estimate, however, CBO \n     assumes that Corps appropriations would remain at current \n     levels and that new spending authorized by the bill would be \n     in addition to what is annually made available.\n       Reduction in the Maintenance Component of Electricity \n     Rates. CBO assumes that section 1006 of S. 2773 would result \n     in an overall reduction in electricity receipts collected by \n     the PMAs. Under current law, electricity sales rates charged \n     by the PMAs are set to recover the cost of generating \n     electricity, including operations and maintenance expenses \n     associated with hydroelectricity generation at Corps \n     projects. Over the 2005-2010 period, the bill would lower the \n     portion of electricity rates charged to PMA customers for \n     Corps-related expenses to 0.22 cents per kilowatt-hour. (BPA \n     rates are explicitly exempted by that provision.)\n       The PMAs currently charge their electricity customers for \n     Corps-related expenses more than the 0.22 cents per kilowatt-\n     hour that would be mandated by the bill. Such rates range \n     from as much as 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour to 0.4 cents per \n     kilowatt-hour for the various Corps projects associated with \n     the Western Area Power Administration. CBO estimates that \n     this provision would reduce electricity receipts collected by \n     the PMAs by an average of about $180 million a year, over the \n     2005-2010 period.\n       Spending of Recreation Fees. Section 1004 would direct the \n     Corps to establish a new system of recreation fees, including \n     charges for admission to Corps recreationsites and for the \n     use of recreation facilities, visitor centers, equipment, and \n     services. Under the bill, the new fees (which would be based \n     on the value of the admission or service purchased) would \n     replace charges authorized under the more-restrictive fee \n     authority contained in the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     Act (LWCFA), which currently governs the Corps' recreation \n     fee program. The bill also would authorize the agency to \n     provide recreational services through contractors by leasing \n     Federal land or establishing other concession-like \n     arrangements with nonFederal entities. Finally, section 1004 \n     would allow the Corps to retain and spend without further \n     appropriation all recreation user and admission fees it \n     collects under the LWCFA. CBO estimates that enacting this \n     provision would have a net cost of $27 million in 2005 and \n     $21 million over the 2005-2009 period. We estimate the \n     provision would result in a net reduction in direct spending \n     of $14 million over the next 10 years.\n       CBO estimates that, once the fee authority that would be \n     provided by this section has been fully implemented, Corps \n     offsetting receipts would increase by $7 million a year from \n     the current annual level of about $34 million. (We estimate \n     that the increase would begin in fiscal year 2006 and would \n     initially amount to $4 million to $5 million a year because \n     of delays in determining the market value of similar local \n     recreation opportunities and establishing appropriate fee \n     schedules.) We estimate that the contracting and leasing \n     provisions of this section would have no effect on the budget \n     because such authorities already exist.\n       CBO further estimates that the authority that would be \n     provided by the bill to spend without appropriation any \n     offsetting receipts earned under the LWCFA would increase \n     direct spending by $27 million in fiscal year 2005 and by $17 \n     million in 2006. After the Corps implements the new fee \n     program mandated by the bill (in mid-2006), no additional \n     receipts would be earned under the LWCFA, and the authority \n     to spend such amounts would no longer be in effect. Because \n     the bill would not specifically authorize the appropriation \n     of, or spending of, any fees collected under the new program, \n     CBO assumes that those recreation receipts would be deposited \n     into the general fund of the Treasury.\n       Various Land Conveyances. S. 2773 would authorize the Corps \n     to convey certain land in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and \n     Missouri. CBO estimates that those conveyances would have no \n     significant impact on the Federal budget.\n       The bill also would convey at fair market value 13 acres of \n     land and the structures on the land, including a loading dock \n     with mooring facilities, in Alabama. In addition, S. 2773 \n     would convey at fair market value 650 acres at the Richard B. \n     Russell Lake in South Carolina to the state. Based on \n     information from the Corps, CBO estimates that the Federal \n     Government would receive about $7 million in 2008 from this \n     sale.\n       Arcadia Lake, Oklahoma. Section 5303 would eliminate the \n     obligation of the city of Edmond, Oklahoma, to pay \n     outstanding interest due on its water storage contract with \n     the Corps. CBO estimates that this provision would result in \n     a loss of receipts of about $8 million in 2005.\n       Waurika Lake Project. Section 5304 would eliminate the \n     obligation of the Waurika Project Master Conservancy District \n     in Oklahoma to pay its outstanding debt related to the \n     construction of a water conveyance project. Due to an \n     accounting error, the Corps inadvertently undercharged the \n     district for costs associated with a land purchase related to \n     the water project in the early 1980's. Under terms of the \n     construction contract, the district is required to pay all \n     costs associated with building the project, including the \n     full cost of the land purchases. CBO estimates that enacting \n     this section would cost less than $200,000 a year over the \n     2005-2014 period.\n       Funding to Process Permits. Section 5401 would extend the \n     Corps' current authority for two more years to accept and \n     spend funds contributed by private firms to expedite the \n     evaluation of permit applications submitted to the Corps. CBO \n     estimates that the Corps would accept and spend less than \n     $500,000 during each year of this extension and that the net \n     budgetary impact of this provision would be negligible.\n       Training Funds. Section 1003 would allow the Corps to \n     collect and spend fees collected from the private sector for \n     training courses. CBO estimates that the Corps would accept \n     and spend less than $500,000 annually and that the net \n     budgetary impact would be negligible.\n     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact\n       S. 2773 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in UMRA. Federal participation in water \n     resources projects and programs authorized by this bill would \n     benefit state, local, and tribal governments, and any costs \n     to those governments to comply with the conditions of this \n     Federal assistance would be incurred voluntarily.\n     Previous CBO Estimate\n       On September 3, 2003, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for \n     H.R. 2557, the Water Resources Development Act of 2003, as \n     ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure on July 23, 2003. CBO estimated that enacting \n     H.R. 2557 would increase direct spending by $32 million over \n     the 2004-2013 period. In addition, assuming appropriation of \n     the necessary amounts, CBO estimated that implementing H.R. \n     2557 would cost about $2.6 billion over the 2004-2008 period. \n     The differences in the cost estimates stem from different \n     levels of authorized funding.\n       Estimate Prepared By: Federal Costs: Julie Middleton, Lisa \n     Cash Driskill, Deb Reis, and\n\n[[Page S10685]]\n\n     Mike Waters; Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Marjorie Miller; Impact on the Private Sector: Karen Raupp.\n       Estimate Approved By: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would also like to take this opportunity to note for \nthe record that I believe there are several unrealistic sections of the \nCBO score that appear to be based on several unconventional \ninterpretations of the Committee reported bill.\n  CBO estimates that the recreation fee program will result in $27 \nmillion in estimated outlays for 2005 and $13 million in estimated \noutlays for 2006, at which point CBO assumes that the outlays become a \n$7 million annual revenue. The recreation user fee program established \nin the bill, creates a program to directly fund the operation and \nmaintenance needs associated with recreation at Corps reservoirs. The \ncommittee reported bill amends section 225 of WRDA 1999. That \nparticular section of WRDA 99 provides the Secretary of the Army a \ntemporary authority under the Land and Water Conservation Fund, to \nwithhold a limited portion of recreation user fees and provides \nauthority to spend those revenues on the operation and maintenance of \nrecreation facilities at Corps reservoirs. The committee bill further \namended this authority to allow the Corps to withhold 100 percent of \nthe recreation fees, on a permanent basis and directed the Corps to \nestablish a progrm to facilitate the efficient collection of revenues. \nThe CBO interpretation of this section assumes that the Corps will \nwithhold the recreation fees it currently collects and spend them \ndirectly on O However, when the Corps implements the program for \nfees CBO assumes that the agaency's authority for withholding such fees \ndisappears, and the agency will blithely turn them over to the General \nTreasury leaving their O budget in shambles. Such an outcome is in \ndirect contravention of the obvious purpose of the entire section. And \nwhile such an interpretation of the section is possible, I have yet to \nencounter a situation where an agency turned funds over to the Treasury \nwhen they were authorized to withhold and spend them directly.\n  Section 1006 authorizes the Corps to deposit revenues collected in \nconjunction with operations at Corps reservoirs. With respect to the \ngeneration of hydro-power, the Corps does not currently collect any \nfees from the Power Marketing Administrations, PMAs. In the case of PMA \nrevenue, the PMAs send a portion of their revenue to the Treasury. In \norder to provide direct funding for the Corps, the committee bill \nprovides for a 0.22 cent charge per kilowatt of electricity produced. \nBonneville Power Administration is specifically exempt from the 0.22 \ncent per kilowat hour fee. Despite this exemption, CBO assumes that \nBonneville Power will ignore it's other authorizing statutes and \nturn over more than $800 million a year to the Corps. I would point out \nthat the 0.22 cent per kilowatt fee, was the committee's best estimate \nat the size of a fee that would be required to directly fund $150 \nmillion for O, which was the amount recommended in the president's \nbudget. Excluding Bonneville Power Administration, CBO estimated that \nthe 0.22 cent per kilowatt hour would result in $173 million in direct \nO outlays. I believe that CBO erroneous included Bonneville Power \nAdministration in the estimate of direct spending. Bonneville Power \nAdministration receipts, if collected by the Corps, would total $7.1 \nbillion over a 10-year period.\n\n  While CBO erroneously overestimates, the direct spending associated \nwith O at Corps reservoirs, it completely underestimates the direct \nspending that will likely be required should the Fish and Wildlife \nmitigation provision become enacted. Section 1011 establishes a new \nstandard for fish and wildlife mitigation for Corps of Engineers \nprojects. Because the standard specifically amends WRDA 1986 with \nchanging the dates specified in WRDA 86 with respect to the \napplicability of the standard to completed and on going projects, a \nstrict reading of the new standard makes it applicable to all projects \nauthorized after November 17, 1986. Moreover, the standard sets a very \nhigh bar by requiring the Corps to ``acquire and restore the same \nnumber of acres of habitat'' to fully replace the hydrologic and \necological functions of ``each acre of habitat adversely affected.'' \nWhile on its face such a requirement may seem innocuous, there is no \ndeminimus level for the determination of an adverse effect. Strictly \nspeaking, even relatively minor changes to land use or hydrology would \ntrigger the requirement for the Corps to acquire an equal number of \nacres as those that are modified, and restore all of those acres. The \nliability that this imposes on the Corps for mitigation of projects to \nthis standard for everything since 1986 is likely substantial. Given \nthat most non-Federal sponsors are local and State governments, this \npotentially represents a significant unfunded mandate as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10685-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL RUNAWAY PREVENTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate for \npassing S. Res. 430, a resolution designating November 2004 as National \nRunaway Prevention Month. National Runaway Prevention Month is a public \neducation initiative to increase awareness of issues facing runaways. \nThis resolution will sensitize the public about solutions to the \nrunaway dilemma and educate them on the role they play in preventing \nyouth from running away.\n  Runaway and ``throwaway'' episodes among our Nation's youth are a \nwidespread problem, with one out of every seven children and youth in \nthe United States running away or being turned out of their home before \nthe age of 18. A recent study by the Department of Justice's Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention estimates that nearly 1.7 \nmillion youth experienced a runaway or throwaway episode in a single \nyear. The primary causal factors of running away or being turned out \nare severe family conflict, abuse and neglect, and parental abuse of \nalcohol and drugs.\n  All of the conditions that lead young people to leave or be turned \nout of their homes are preventable. However, we need to make \ninterventions available to strengthen families and support youth in \nhigh-risk situations. Successful interventions are grounded in \npartnerships among families, community-based human service agencies, \nlaw enforcement agencies, schools, faith-based organizations, and \nbusinesses.\n  Preventing young people from running away and supporting youth in \nhigh-risk situations are a family, community, and national \nresponsibility. Please join us in increasing public attention to the \nchallenges that youth are facing today and in encouraging all Americans \nto play a role in supporting the millions of young people who have run \naway from their home environments or who are at-risk of doing so each \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10685-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10685-S10686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL SEVERE STORMS LABORATORY 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in Oklahoma, we know the importance of \npredicting and tracking severe weather. Each spring, during tornado \nseason, people in Oklahoma brace themselves for dangerous storms. \nHowever, instead of hiding in the dark, like they used to do, today, \nthey can depend on a stellar source for up-to-date, real-time \ninformation. The National Severe Storms Labs NSSL has played a vital \nrole in providing research for predicting and tracking this harmful \nweather. In light of this, I rise today to recognize the 40th \nanniversary of the vital office of the NSSL within the Department of \nCommerce/National Oceanic and Atmoheric Administration, in Norman, \nOklahoma.\n  The National Severe Storms Laboratory was established in 1964 and \nleads the way in investigations of all aspects of severe and hazardous \nweather. NSSL is a vital part of NOAA Research and the only federally \nsupported laboratory focused on severe weather. The lab's scientists \nand staff constantly explore new ways to improve understanding of the \ncauses of severe weather and ways to use weather information to assist \nNational Weather Service, NWS, forecasters, as well as Federal, \nuiversity and private sector partners.\n  These scientists are working on ways to improve short-term weather \nforecasting computer models for the National Weather Service's basic \ntornado research to understand how tornadoes form, as well as real-time \ndelivery of\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\nradar data to the meteorological community and interested partners. \nResearch at NSSL has led to greater knowledge and improved forecasts of \ntornadoes, flash floods, damaging winds, hail, lightning, heavy snow, \nice and freezing rain.\n  Early on, NSSL researchers recognized the potential of Doppler radar \nto improve the detection and warning of severe weather. NSSL built the \nfirst real-time displays of Doppler velocity data, which led to \ndiscoveries of tornado-related radar ``signatures.'' The successful \ndemonstration that Doppler radar could help forecasters provide much \nimproved severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings led to the deployment \nof the Next Generation Weather Radar, NEXRAD, WSR-88D, network of \nDoppler radars throughout the United States. This important \ncontribution to the Nation was recognized by a Department of Commerce \ngold medal award, and was the only NOAA research laboratory so \nrecognized.\n  NSSL continues to be a pioneer in the development of weather radar. \nThe lab is working with the NWS to deploy dual polarization, a planned \nupgrade to the current NEXRAD Doppler radar hardware that provides more \ninformation about precipitation in clouds to better distinguish between \nrain, ice, hail and mixtures. Such information will help forecasters \nprovide better forecasts and warnings for flash floods, the number one \nsevere weather threat to human life.\n  In addition, NSSL researchers are adapting state-of-the-art radar \ntechnology currently deployed on Navy ships for use in tracking severe \nweather. Phased array radar reduces the scan or data collection time \nfrom 5 or 6 minutes to less than 1 minute, potentially extending the \nlead time for tornado warnings beyond the current average of 12 \nminutes. When combined with other technology being developed at NSSL, \nwarning lead times may be extended even farther.\n  Recently, NSSL collaborated with the University of Oklahoma, Texas \nTech, and Texas A University to build two new 5-cm mobile Doppler \nradars. These SMART-Radars--Shared Mobile Atmospheric Research and \nTeaching Radars--are capable of scanning and penetrating an entire \ntornadic storm or hurricane, providing critical data needed to \nunderstand the mysteries of how tornadoes form and for eventually \nimproving severe storm forecasts and warnings.\n  During the past few years, scientists from NSSL completed several \nfield experiments to study severe and hazardous weather. In 2003 and \n2004, researchers launched weather balloons loaded with instruments \ninto thunderstorms during the Thunderstorm Electrification and \nLightning Experiment, or TELEX. The lightning observations they made \nwill be used to improve forecasts and warnings of hazardous weather. In \n2002, NSSL hosted the International H2O Project or IHOP, one of the \nlargest weather-related studies ever conducted in the U.S.\n  NSSL has a research partnership with the Cooperative Institute for \nMesoscale Meteorological Studies, a cooperative institute between the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of \nOklahoma. Additionally, NSSL conducts collaborative research with other \nNOAH laboratories including the Forecast Systems Laboratory, the \nEnvironmental Technologies Laboratory, and the Great Lakes \nEnvironmental Research Laboratory, as well as the U.S. Navy, Air Force, \nArmy, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, \nTexas A, Texas Tech University, Lockheed Martin, Basic Commerce and \nIndustries, Weather Decision Technologies, WeatherNews International, \nInc., WeatherData, Inc., and Salt River Project.\n  I congratulate the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, OK, \non their first 40 years. Based on their performance since 1964, I \nbelieve we can expect many more years of pioneering scientific research \nfrom this outstanding institution, their academic, government and \nprivate sector partners, and their many scientists and technicians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10686-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LOSING GROUND\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it has been nearly a month since Republican \ncongressional leadership and the President allowed the assault weapons \nban to expire. This lack of action made it potentially easier for \ncriminals and terrorists to acquire 19 previously banned assault \nweapons that could be used to harm innocent Americans. Adding insult to \ninjury, the House of Representatives last week passed legislation that \nwould make families in the Nation's capital even more susceptible to \ngun crime.\n  The misnamed District of Columbia Personal Protection Act, which \npassed the House last week, would repeal a local law in Washington, DC \nthat bans the sale and possession of unregistered firearms, requires \nfirearm registration, imposes commonsense safe storage requirements, \nand bans semiautomatic weapons in the District. Should this bill become \nlaw, tourists and especially those who live and work in our Nation's \ncapital will face a considerably greater threat of gun violence.\n  According to the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence, this bill \nwould roll back gun laws in D.C. to a point that it would be legal to \npossess a loaded assault rifle on city streets without a permit. Over \nthe strong objections of local leaders, the Republican-controlled House \nmade the unwise decision to take up and pass this legislation even as \nwe face the increased threat of terrorism. Hopefully the Senate will \nnot make the same mistake.\n  Unfortunately, instead of making progress on the issue of gun safety, \nwe seem to be retreating. Instead of strengthening laws that would help \nprevent future gun crimes and terrorist attacks, they are being \nweakened giving potential criminals and terrorists easier access to \nweapons that have no place on our streets. I will continue to work \ntoward reversing this course and toward passing sensible gun safety \nlegislation that will make our communities more, instead of less, safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10686-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ANABOLIC STEROID CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, this summer and fall, a lot of us have \nbeen drawing comparisons between Sudan today and Rwanda a decade ago. \nThe October 4, 2004 edition of the New York Times contains a piece \nfurthering this argument by one who is uniquely qualified to do so: \nretired General Romeo Dallaire, who was the commander of the United \nNations forces in Rwanda during the genocide.\n  Ten years ago, General Dallaire pleaded for more troops to stem the \nrising tide of murders that were sweeping across Rwanda. Instead of \nsending reinforcements, the United Nations cut his peacekeeping force \nfrom 3,000 to 500, leaving Dallaire and his troops to witness the mass \nkillings that they did not have a prayer of stopping. In the aftermath \nof this decision, 800,000 people died in 100 days.\n  Ten years ago, the African Union promised battalions to stop the \nkilling but lacked the equipment and logistical support to come to the \nassistance of Dallaire and the people of Rwanda. Those forces never \narrived in any numbers.\n  Today, genocide is again taking place, this time in Sudan. Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan has recognized it. President Bush has recognized it. \nBut\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\nagain the world is essentially standing by.\n  Last month, the Senate passed an amendment to the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill which provided $75 million to support an expanded \nAfrican Union mission in Darfur, Sudan. This bill is now in conference. \nIt is vitally important that it pass with this measure and additional \nassistance for Sudan relief efforts intact.\n  President Clinton has said that failure to act in Rwanda constitutes \nhis greatest regret as president. That is not a failure that we can \nbear to repeat. It is not enough for the international community to \nrecognize genocide. This time, we actually have to stop it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that General Dallaire's op-ed from the New \nYork Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 4, 2004]\n\n                    Looking at Darfur, Seeing Rwanda\n\n                          (By Romeo Dallaire)\n\n       Montreal.--Each day the world is confronted by new reports \n     of atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan. President Bush, \n     in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last \n     month, referred to the situation as ``genocide,'' and he and \n     Secretary General Kofi Annan pledged support for sanctions \n     against the Sudanese government and a Security Council \n     resolution to expand the African Union force on the ground \n     there. But I am afraid that moral condemnation, trade \n     penalties and military efforts by African countries are \n     simply not going to be enough to stop the killing--not nearly \n     enough.\n       I know, because I've seen it all happen before. A decade \n     ago, I was the Canadian general in command of the United \n     Nations forces in Rwanda when that civil war began and \n     quickly turned into genocide. The conflict was often \n     portrayed as nothing more than an age-old feud between \n     African tribes, a situation that the Western world could do \n     little to stop. All that was left to do was wait to pick up \n     the pieces when the killing stopped and to provide support to \n     rebuild the country.\n       Although the early stages of the Darfur situation received \n     more news coverage than the Rwanda genocide did, at some \n     level the Western governments are still approaching it with \n     the same lack of priority. In the end, it receives the same \n     intuitive reaction: ``What's in it for us? Is it in our \n     `national' interest?''\n       Sudan, an underdeveloped, orphan nation, with no links to \n     colonial masters of its past, is essentially being left to \n     its own devices. The Islamic Janjaweed militias of Darfur, \n     with the complicit approval of the government, are bent on \n     ridding the region of its residents, primarily black \n     Africans--killing, raping and driving refugees into camps \n     along the border with Chad.\n       The United Nations, emasculated by the self-interested \n     maneuverings of the five permanent members of the Security \n     Council, fails to intervene. Its only concrete step, the \n     Security Council resolution passed in July, all but \n     plagiarized the resolutions on Rwanda 10 years earlier. When \n     I read phrases like ``reaffirming its commitment to the \n     sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and independence of \n     Sudan'' and ``expressing its determination to do everything \n     possible to halt a humanitarian catastrophe, including by \n     taking further action if required,'' I can't help but think \n     of the stifling directives that were imposed on the United \n     Nations' department of peacekeeping operations in 1994 and \n     then passed down to me in the field.\n       I recall all too well the West's indifference to the \n     horrors that unfolded in Rwanda beginning in April 1994. \n     Early warnings had gone unheeded, intervention was ruled out \n     and even as the bodies piled up on the streets of Kigali and \n     across the countryside, world leaders quibbled over the \n     definition of what was really happening. The only \n     international forces they sent during those first days and \n     weeks of the massacres were paratroopers to evacuate the \n     foreigners. Before long, we were burning the bodies with \n     diesel fuel to ward off disease, and the smell that would \n     cling to your skin like an oil.\n       Several African countries promised me battalions of troops \n     and hundreds of observers to help come to grips with the \n     relentless carnage. But they had neither the equipment nor \n     the logistical support to sustain themselves, and no way to \n     fly in the vehicles and ammunition needed to conduct \n     sustained operations.\n       Today, to be sure, the international community is caught in \n     the vicissitudes of complex political problems--particularly \n     the fragile cease-fire between the Islamic government and the \n     largely Christian population in southern Sudan. Powerful \n     nations like the United States and Britain have lost much of \n     their credibility because of the quagmire of Iraq. And \n     infighting at the United Nations has bogged down an American \n     proposed second resolution that probably wouldn't do much \n     more than the one passed in July.\n       So in the end we get nothing more than pledges to support \n     the international monitoring team of a few hundred observers \n     from the African Union (on Friday, Sudan agreed that this \n     force could expand to 3,500 soldiers). Nigeria and other \n     countries are willing to send a larger intervention force, \n     but they can't do so effectively without the kind of \n     logistical and transportation support Western countries could \n     provide.\n       Sudan is a huge country with a harsh terrain and a \n     population unlikely to welcome outside intervention. Still, I \n     believe that a mixture of mobile African Union troops \n     supported by NATO soldiers equipped with helicopters, \n     remotely piloted vehicles, night-vision devices and long-\n     range special forces could protect Darfur's displaced people \n     in their camps and remaining villages, and eliminate or \n     incarcerate the Janjaweed.\n       If NATO is unable to act adequately, manpower could perhaps \n     come individually from the so-called middle nations--\n     countries like Germany and Canada that have more political \n     leeway and often more credibility in the developing world \n     than the Security Council members.\n       In April, on the 10th anniversary of the start of his \n     country's genocide, President Paul Kagame told his people and \n     the world that if any country ever suffered genocide, Rwanda \n     would willingly come to its aid. He chastised the \n     international community for its callous response to the \n     killing spree of 1994, during which 800,000 people were \n     slaughtered and three million lost their homes and villages. \n     And sure enough, Rwanda sent a small contingent to Darfur. \n     President Kagame kept his word. Having called what is \n     happening in Darfur genocide and having vowed to stop it, it \n     is time for the West to keep its word as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10687-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10687-S10688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MAKING THE MOST OF FOREIGN ASSISTANCE: FAMILY PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I would like to talk about a \ncritical subject, the need to support family planning as part of our \ninternational development agenda.\n  Family planning saves lives. It is a basic health service, especially \nin parts of the world such as Malawi where 1 in 7 mothers die in \nchildbirth or Mozambique where 137 infants die per 1,000 live births \nand where life expectancy is just 37 years.\n  This is a health issue and it is a development issue because the two \nare virtually always related.\n  Ten years ago, members of the United Nations met in Cairo to draft a \n20-year action plan to alleviate poverty through women's empowerment \nand universal access to reproductive healthcare.\n  Recently, a new report by UNFPA has come out, ``The Cairo Consensus \nat Ten: Population, Reproductive Health, and the Global Effort to End \nPoverty.'' This report assesses how far we have come and how far we \nhave to go and argues that we have to mobilize political will and \ninternational assistance if we are going to build on previous gains.\n  This report revealed that, a decade after the Cairo meeting, more \nthan 350 million couples still lack access to a full range of family \nplanning services. It found that almost 530,000 women die each year \nfrom complications of pregnancy and childbirth, mostly from preventable \ncauses. It also found that 2 out of every 5 people on the planet still \nstruggle to survive on less than $2 a day, and many of them earn less \nthan half that tiny amount.\n  The report concluded:\n\n       Policy makers have been slow to address the inequitable \n     distribution of health information and services that helps \n     keep people poor . . . Developing countries that have reduced \n     fertility and mortality by investing in health and education \n     have higher productivity, more savings and more productive \n     investment, resulting in faster economic growth. Enabling \n     people to have fewer children, if they want to, helps to \n     stimulate development and reduce poverty, both in individual \n     households and in societies. Smaller families have more to \n     invest in children's education and health. Rapid population \n     growth contributes to environmental stress, uncontrolled \n     urbanization and rural and urban poverty.\n\n  However, United States funding for UNFPA, which Congress has \nrepeatedly passed, has not been distributed because the administration \nhas refused to do so. Releasing the funds for UNFPA, which the \nadministration has cancelled for the last 3 years, is a great way to \nhelp countries alter this template of maternal and child mortality, \npoverty, and under development.\n  This issue isn't about coercive abortion in China. UNFPA has a \nprogram to end coercive abortion in China. It is not about abortion at \nall. The UNFPA does not provide any support for abortion.\n  This is about providing health services for desperately poor women \nand their families.\n  The administration's own investigative team looked into UNFPA and\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\nfound no evidence of wrongdoing and urged immediate and unconditional \nrelease of these funds.\n  Study after study has shown that development is fundamentally about \nwomen: dollars go further and programs mean more when they reach women. \nIncreasing women's access to education, health care, and human rights \nbrings enhanced child health, improved food production, lower \npopulation growth rates, and higher incomes--in short, better quality \nof life for women and their families.\n  Reproductive health is an important component of this agenda, \nespecially when we look at maternal and child mortality rates. That is \nwhy it is so important that we support the UNFPA and in the process \nadvance our other foreign assistance goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10688-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NUCLEAR ENERGY FOR A BALANCED ENERGY PORTFOLIO\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to endorse S. Con. Res. 141 \noffered by Senator Domenici recognizing the essential role that nuclear \npower plays in our society.\n  The U.S. Senate must recognize the important role that nuclear energy \nplays in our Nation's economy, our Nation's energy independence and \nsecurity, and our Nation's environmental goals. And, we need to \nacknowledge that like nearly every other source of energy, nuclear \npower needs our help to continue playing its important role in our \nNation's energy policy.\n  Nuclear energy currently generates electricity for one in every five \nhomes and businesses today. It is important not only in Louisiana, \nwhere two nuclear plants produce nearly 17 percent of my State's \nelectricity, but also in States such as Connecticut, Illinois, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, South Carolina and Vermont where nuclear \ngenerates more electricity than any other source. Nationwide, 103 \nreactors provide 20 percent of our electricity--the largest source of \nU.S. emission-free power provided 24-7.\n  Nuclear energy is also vitally important for our environment and our \nNation's clean air goals. Nuclear power is the Nation's largest clean \nair source of electricity, generating three-fourths of all emission-\nfree electricity. For future generations of Americans, whose reliance \non electricity will increase and who rightfully want a cleaner \nenvironment and the health benefits that cleaner air will provide \nnuclear energy will be an essential partner.\n  Just this past Sunday, the Washington Post highlighted the problems \nthat the Shenandoah National Forest now faces with pollution. Think how \nmuch worse our Nation's air pollution would be if nuclear energy did \nnot generate one fifth of our electricity.\n  According to the Department of Energy the demand for electricity is \nexpected to grow by 40 percent by 2020. In order to continue producing \nat least one-third of our total electricity generation from emission-\nfree sources, we must build 50,000 megawatts of new nuclear energy \nproduction. If we do that, we are just preserving our current levels of \nemission-free generation, not improving them.\n  And, we need to recognize that nuclear power, by providing a stable, \ndependable source of electricity, is vital to our Nation's energy \nsecurity and independence. Nuclear power is essentially an American \ninvention. We generate nearly a fourth of the world's total nuclear \npower and we can do so with domestic energy sources. Hydrogen holds the \npromise of helping us lessen our dependence on imported oil and nuclear \npower is one of the most promising ways that we can produce hydrogen \neconomically and efficiently.\n  There is a nuclear power renaissance in the making. Three of the \nNation's leading nuclear power operators have already applied for an \nearly site permit to build a new nuclear plant next door to an existing \nnuclear plant they operate, testing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's \nnew licensing process for the first time. Also, just a few months ago, \nnine nuclear operating companies and the two major U.S. power reactor \nmanufacturers formed the NuStart Energy consortium to apply for a \nconstruction and operating license, COL, to test the regulatory process \nfor actually building and operating the next generation of nuclear \npower plants.\n  These are positive signs that the U.S. nuclear power industry is \nalive and ready to build and operate the next generation of nuclear \npower--still without emitting any air pollutants, increasing our energy \nindependence, and using the safest designs ever.\n  Today 29 new plants are being built around the world in 16 counties--\nmost using a design that originated here in America--but not one of \nthem is in the U.S. That must change.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical resolution which will \nfurther promote a vital source of energy while helping to pave the way \ntowards improving our Nation's energy security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10688-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10688-S10689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ART THERAPISTS VITAL TO THE CARE OF VETERANS\n\n  Mr GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, today I bring attention to the \nimpressive work that art therapists do with our Nation's veterans and \nthe significant accomplishments they have made in this field. Art \ntherapists provide effective treatment and health maintenance \nintervention for veterans, focusing on all of their life challenges, \nsuch as mental, physical, and cognitive impairments. Intense emotion \nand memory, often difficult to convey in words, often are more easily \nexpressed in images with the guidance of a trained clinician.\n  Art therapists are master's level mental health practitioners trained \nin psychology, psychotherapy, and the interface with the arts modality. \nThe American Art Therapy Association establishes national academic \nstandards of education and clinical practice. After September 11, art \ntherapists assisted both survivors and the bereaved, drawing out their \ntraumatic experiences and dealing pictorially with the horror as they \nmoved through the various stages of grief. Similarly, art therapy is \nused with veterans who struggle with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD).\n  Research has demonstrated that traumatic memory is not stored in a \nfashion that can be expressed only through words. Instead, it is \nretained as visual, auditory, olfactory, and other sense mechanisms. \nImages may return as flashbacks or nightmares that the veteran is \nunable to integrate as memory. As a result, these impressions remain a \ntoxic force, causing intense fear and leading the veteran to try to \nshut off all memory and emotion and possibly leading to depression, the \ninability to properly function day to day, and estrangement from \nfamily. The traumatic experiences that a veteran is unable to discuss \nor confront, however, can instead surface through artwork. The process \nof creating the artwork and externalizing intense issues help the \nveteran to regain control, integrate horrors into manageable memory, \nand allow feelings to be experienced again.\n  For example, a former Marine who served in Vietnam and struggled for \nyears with feelings of inadequacy and fear in crowds benefitted \nconsiderably from art therapy. He has said that it enabled him to \naddress problems he otherwise did not have access to, thereby helping \nhim to ``mourn the pain. . . overcome . . . and feel comfortable \nwithin'' himself. Another serviceman drew out his dreams as a way of \nplacing combat experiences into the past and therefore to function more \neffectively in the present. Such life-enhancing and cost-efficient \nintervention is not only viable as a treatment option, but may be \npreventive by forestalling full-blown PTSD. Given the number of \nveterans gradually returning from the current war in Iraq, art therapy \nhas the potential to assist them as a form of rehabilitation. The \nAmerican Art Therapy Association is currently investigating possible \nsites and funding sources for conducting outcome studies on the \nefficacy of art therapy with veterans.\n  I would also like to mention with pride that more than 100 registered \nart therapists live and work in my home State of Florida. These \ntherapists practice all across the State, from my hometown of Miami all \nthe way up to the Panhandle. I am so pleased that almost every \nveteran--or anyone else--residing in Florida has access to the benefits \nart therapy can offer.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I support \nthe use of art therapy programs in the Department of Veterans Affairs \nhealth care facilities, and I recognize the contribution of art \ntherapists to the effective reintegration, enhanced coping,\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\nand quality of life for our veterans. During this crucial time in the \nhistory of our Nation, I encourage my colleagues in Congress to do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10689-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SUPPORTING DEMOCRACY IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I welcome the unanimous passage of the \nBelarus Democracy Act, BDA, by the United States Senate last night \nfollowing similar action by the House of Representatives earlier this \nweek. As co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am particularly \npleased at timely adoption of this important legislation. I thank \nChairman Lugar and Senator Biden for their assistance in facilitating \nconsideration of this bill by the full Senate.\n  Repression and stagnation have been the hallmarks of the regime of \nAleksandr Lukashenka, the leader of Belarus who increasingly tightened \nthe noose around those who express independent views. A series of \nfundamentally flawed elections have left Belarus without legitimate \nexecutive and parliamentary leadership. Against this backdrop, \npreparations are underway for parliamentary elections and a referendum \nlater this month. The elections take place in an environment in which \nthe regime has intensified its repression of the remaining independent \nmedia and vilification of the opposition and their supporters. \nLukashenka is also seeking to manipulate the situation to extend his \nrule by eliminating constitutional term limits for president, possibly \npaving the way for him to become a ``president-for-life.''\n  As co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I have maintained a strong \ninterest in Belarus and have tried to inform my Senate colleagues about \nthe increasingly troubling developments in that strategically located \ncountry, whose 10 million people have suffered cruelty at the hands of \nczars, Nazis, Communists and now, Aleksandr Lukashenka. During my \nservice on the Commission, I have met and come to know many of the \ncourageous individuals, who often at personal risk have spoken out in \nsupport of democracy in the face of Europe's last dictatorship, \nincluding the spouses of opposition leaders and a journalist who \ndisappeared in 1999 and 2000 because they dared speak to the truth.\n  Belarus, under Lukashenka, has the worst human rights record in \nEurope. His regime has increasingly violated basic human rights and \nfreedoms. The goal of the Belarus Democracy Act is to help put an end \nto repression and human rights violations in Belarus and to promote \nBelarus' entry into a democratic Euro-Atlantic community of nations \nfollowing years of self-imposed isolation.\n  The Belarus Democracy Act authorizes additional assistance for \ndemocracy-building activities such as support for NGOs, independent \nmedia, including radio broadcasting to Belarus, and international \nexchanges. It also encourages free and fair parliamentary elections, \nwhich have been notably absent in Belarus and which look to be highly \nproblematic when they are held on October 17, judging by the pre-\nelection environment and the regime's tight control over the electoral \nprocess.\n  The BDA includes sense of the Congress language that would prohibit \nU.S. Government financing, except for humanitarian reasons and U.S. \nexecutive directors of the international financial institutions would \nbe encouraged to vote against financial assistance to the Government of \nBelarus except for loans and assistance for humanitarian needs. The \nbill also requires a report from the President concerning the sale of \ndelivery of weapons or weapons-related technologies from Belarus to \nrogue states and on the personal wealth and assets of Lukashenka.\n  Nearly 2 years after the introduction of the Belarus Democracy Act \nthe situation in that country has spiraled downward. Adoption and \nimplementation of the Belarus Democracy Act will offer hope that the \ncurrent period of political, economic and social stagnation will indeed \nend. It shows our concrete support for the courageous individuals, non-\ngovernmental organizations, independent media and independent trade \nunions struggling mightily against the machine of repression. And it \nshows our support for the people of Belarus, who deserve a chance for a \nbrighter future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10689-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DISPERSAL BARRIER\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Jeffords from \nVermont for his recognition of the situation we are facing in the Great \nLakes with Asian carp. We are currently trying to keep this invasive \nspecies out of the Great Lakes ecosystem by constructing a dispersal \nbarrier in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. It is very important \nthat this barrier be completed soon before this destructive invasive \nspecies makes it way to the Lakes. I know that my colleague from \nVermont has the same problem in Lake Champlain, and I plan to do \neverything I can in the next Congress to work with him to authorize and \nfund a dispersal barrier for Lake Champlain.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Invasive species are a problem in Lake Champlain in my \nhome State of Vermont. The Lake Champlain ecosystem and regional \neconomy have been seriously impacted already by invasive species, many \nof which dispersed to the lake from the Hudson River by way of the \nChamplain Canal. Eurasian Milfoil and Water chestnut have rendered much \nof southern Lake Champlain unusable for recreation and stripped value \nfrom waterfront properties. Hundreds of thousands of dollars each year \nare spent to control these plants. The sea lamprey has devastated our \nsport fishery, and large amounts of money are being spent on control, \nwith only mixed results. These are just a few species. Once here it is \nnearly impossible to eliminate these invaders and even marginally \ncontrolling them is hugely expensive.\n  Other invasive species have not yet reached Lake Champlain but have \nspread widely throughout the Hudson and/or Great lakes drainages. We \nknow they are coming and must act now to keep them out. These include \nfish like the Asian carp, Eurasian ruff, round goby, alewife and tench. \nAny one of these could change the Lake Champlain ecosystem in \ncatastrophic ways, and each is moving toward the basin. Invertebrate \nspecies such as the spiny waterflea and fish hook flea, as well as \naquatic plants are also of concern.\n  Because of the success of the dispersal barrier in the Chicago \nSanitary and Ship Canal, we are looking for a similar barrier for the \nLake Champlain Canal to keep more invasive species out of Lake \nChamplain. A barrier will also protect the Hudson River drainage from \ninvasive species that may arrive first from the north, like a \nparticularly damaging fish, the tench.\n  We must move quickly to complete design, and to construct a dispersal \nbarrier in the Lake Champlain Canal. Time is of essence.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator from Vermont and recognize that \nhis State is facing similar problems and I pledge to work with him and \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee to advance authorization for \na Lake Champlain Canal dispersal barrier through both the Water \nResources Development Act and the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act \nin the next Congress.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to join my colleagues in supporting the need \nfor the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal dispersal barrier and pledge to \nwork with my Great Lakes colleagues and Senator Jeffords to address the \ninvasive species problems in Lake Champlain through the authorization \nof a dispersal barrier. I also am pleased to join my colleagues in our \npledge to move the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act forward in the \nnext Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10689-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10689-S10690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On January 25, 2001 in Washington, D.C., police arrested a 17-year-\nold in a gay bashing incident in the Dupont Circle area after the youth \nand another young man followed two men leaving a\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\ngay bar while shouting ant-gay epithets at them. After attacking the \nvictims, the youths fled when passerby said they had called the police.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10690-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10690-S10691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING FAVORITE TEACHERS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, as we contemplate reforms to better equip \nus to prevent and fight terrorism, I hope we will bear in mind the \nimportance of the Western Hemisphere. As chairman of the Western \nHemisphere Subcommittee, I am encouraged by the opportunities we have \nto work cooperatively with our regional neighbors on issues we all can \nbenefit from. We have shared interests in promoting democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law. We are stronger when we stand together as \na hemisphere against terrorism, money laundering, and the trafficking \nof drugs, weapons, and people. Our greatest asset in the war on terror \nin Latin America and the Caribbean is the fact that we have so many \nwilling partners throughout the region who share our values.\n  I recently came across an interesting study, written by Michael \nJohnson of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, that discusses the \nthreat of international terrorist groups in the Triborder region of \nParaguay, Brazil and Argentina. I hope my colleagues will read this \nstudy and reflect upon the importance of addressing terrorism wherever \nit exists around the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that study be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        U.S. Foreign Policy in South America's Triborder Region\n\n\n                      A REGION IN NEED OF SECURITY\n\n       Unstable institutions, rampant corruption and a struggling \n     economy made Paraguay appear as an attractive venue for \n     would-be terrorists to base their operations just a few years \n     ago. However, with the newly formed Three Plus One \n     Counterterrorism Dialogue consisting of Argentine, \n     Paraguayan, Brazilian and an American intelligence-gathering \n     team, terrorists seem to have decided to shy away from \n     creating havoc in the region. Though no terrorist initiatives \n     seem to have occurred in the tri-border region of Paraguay, \n     Argentina and Brazil, experts from each of the countries feel \n     that significant amounts of money laundering is taking place \n     in the area--ending up funding terrorist acts in the Middle \n     East. Current U.S. foreign policy in the area, therefore, \n     will play an integral role in cleansing the area of \n     terrorists as well as contain other illicit activities \n     endemic to the region.\n       U.S. agencies have been monitoring clandestine activity in \n     Paraguay for a number of years. However, only recently have \n     they begun to increase their physical presence. According to \n     various reports, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has more \n     than doubled the size of its office in Asuncion. However, \n     this does not automatically represent any change in the \n     status quo. In the wake of terrorist strikes in the U.S., \n     Paraguay's recent history of allegedly serving as a staging \n     ground for militant Islamic groups such as Hezbollah and the \n     Islamic Jihad certainly is drawing closer scrutiny.\n       On September 21, 2003, foreign ministers from the \n     Organization of American States (OAS) nations met to discuss \n     terrorism-related hemispheric security concerns. Portions of \n     the talks dealt with the Southern Cone countries' long-\n     standing belief that Paraguay has shown little concern in \n     addressing the terrorist elements operating within its \n     borders. Evidence shows that the U.S. has stepped up pressure \n     on the tri-border countries to clean up the area and \n     eliminate ``rogue elements.'' Hopefully, such an increase in \n     the U.S. presence will yield all the returns that the \n     Pentagon anticipates.\n\n\n              U.S. FOREIGN POLICY IN THE TRI-BORDER REGION\n\n       President Bush's call to sustain the war ``until every \n     terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and \n     defeated'' explains U.S. authorities' increase in the \n     monitoring of developments in the tri-border area. For their \n     part, tri-border countries have indicated that they intend to \n     fully cooperate in helping the U.S. eliminate any terrorist \n     threats in the region. Although Brazil and Argentina have \n     increased their border security, Paraguay has perhaps assumed \n     the strongest position in support of U.S. anti-terrorism \n     efforts by asking the OAS to firmly support any U.S.-led \n     retaliation.\n       Nevertheless, rhetoric and strong anti-terrorism stances by \n     these nations fail to quell fears about the potential \n     terrorist threat posed by illicit forces in the region. \n     Paraguay's Foreign Minister, Jose Antonio Moreno, stated that \n     40 FBI agents arrived in Paraguay and were headed to Ciudad \n     del Este, a ``transit point for shadowy groups.'' The \n     inevitability of U.S. involvement in the area was reflected \n     in statements made by the State Department and the former \n     director of the FBI, Louis J. Freeh. The FBI's concern was \n     rooted in a trip that Freeh took to South America in 1998 to \n     assess security concerns. At the time, Freeh called for a \n     multinational crackdown on crime, something he saw as an \n     important step to establishing a hemispheric police alliance. \n     He called the tri-border region ``a free zone for significant \n     criminal activity, including people who are organized to \n     commit acts of terrorism.'' Last April, the State \n     Department warned that the governments of Paraguay, Brazil \n     and Argentina are not capable of preventing Islamic \n     terrorist actions originating from Paraguay's hub of \n     militancy, Ciudad del Este.\n       The U.S. has offered its Special Forces to train and advise \n     the Paraguayan military and national police in anti-terrorism \n     and anti-drug tactics to combat the identified groups. U.S. \n     Special Forces took a first step to making their presence \n     felt in Paraguay earlier this year by participating with the \n     country's military in a ``training exercise'' focused on \n     combating drug traffickers. At the time, many thought that \n     this maneuver closely resembled an anti-insurgency operation. \n     Such an approach could signal a change in U.S. military \n     policy in Paraguay, as further training could focus on anti-\n     terrorism tactics.\n\n\n                            9/11 Connection\n\n       Ciudad del Este provides the kind of uncontrolled \n     environment that can sustain criminal organizations--and \n     terrorists. The 1992 Israeli Embassy bombing and the 1994 \n     Argentine-Israeli Community Center bombing cast a spotlight \n     on the baleful role being played by some elements of the Arab \n     community in Ciudad del Este that it has since been unable to \n     avoid. Because much of Paraguay's export business is \n     underground, basically based on contrabanding, the situation \n     leaves the Arab community suspect of helping to financially \n     support Arab terrorist groups, although without clear proof \n     is wanting. Although it may be unwise to assume that all \n     black-market contrabandists are terrorists, police \n     authorities believe that the amount of funds being generated \n     by smuggling and money laundering that is being transferred \n     within Paraguay to overseas banks is far more than any \n     presumptive business activity in the country. It raises some \n     suspicions in the minds of local police officials that some \n     in the Arab community are supporting radical terrorism with \n     the spoils of illegal trade.\n       Indeed, the U.S. State Department clearly advises that \n     there are individuals and organizations operating in Ciudad \n     de Este and along the tri-border area between Paraguay, \n     Brazil, and Argentina, with ties to extremist groups. \n     Brazilian Judge Walter Fanganiello Maierovitch, former \n     National Drug Enforcement Secretary and now with the Giovanni \n     Falconi Brazilian Criminal Sciences Institute, reports that \n     Osama bin Laden is setting up an al-Qaeda unit near Ciudad \n     del Este under the cover of the Arab community. The U.S. \n     Government cannot confirm an al-Qaeda presence in the tri-\n     border area. However, other radical Islamic extremists \n     routinely rely upon illegal activities, such as drug and arms \n     trafficking, to help fund terrorist activities throughout the \n     world.\n       To achieve some control, 10 member countries of the OAS \n     Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) \n     participated in exercises in the tri-border area to highlight \n     solidarity against extremist activities. The United States, \n     Argentina, and experts from other countries are providing \n     training to Paraguayan anti-terrorist police and military \n     personnel. The objective is to ``maintain a presence in the \n     area and to be able to raid homes of persons suspected of \n     being involved in financing terrorism or of radicalized \n     members of Islam residing in the tri-border area.''\n\n\n                Three Plus One Counterterrorism Dialogue\n\n       In 1998, Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay formed the Comando \n     Tripartito--an operational body in which the three countries \n     exchange information and perform work on the ground dealing \n     with specific regional problems. This Tripartite Commission \n     of the Triple Frontier served as a security mechanism, \n     meeting several times a year in each of the member countries. \n     However, due to the sensitive nature of the information \n     exchanged, the data swapped between countries is not \n     available to public scrutiny. In reality, the Comando \n     Tripartito did little more than serve as a nominal \n     organization, doing little to clamp down on money launderers \n     and neutralize drug traffickers in the region.\n       Talks began to take on a more serious nature in the post 9/\n     11 atmosphere, and the Southern Cone joined the bandwagon of \n     anti-terrorist rhetoric. December of 2002 marked the first \n     3+1 Counterterrorism Dialogue between the tri-border \n     countries and the U.S.\n\n[[Page S10692]]\n\n     According to official State Department records, dialogue \n     between the countries ``serves as a continuing forum for \n     counterterrorism cooperation and prevention among all four \n     countries.'' Argentine Embassy Political Counselor, Jose Luis \n     Sutera, in an interview with COHA asserted, ``The 3 +1 \n     Counterterrorism Dialogue, without question, is the chief \n     board of exchanging information. The first meeting in Buenos \n     Aires stemmed from American suspicions that Hezbollah and \n     Hamas groups were harbored in the [tri-border region].'' The \n     next meeting is scheduled to take place in Washington, DC on \n     December 6, 2004.\n\n\n    ``No Operational Terrorist Organizations, No al-Qaeda Presence''\n\n       In an interview with COHA, Dr. Jorge Brizuela, a high-\n     ranking official in the Paraguayan Embassy in Washington, DC, \n     stated, ``Terrorists have not been found in the zone. No \n     information would indicate that terrorist activities exist in \n     the zone--this has been reiterated on various occasions by \n     the corresponding authorities and the necessary steps are \n     being taken so money obtained in the tri-border region is not \n     being sent to Arab countries.'' Though he agrees with \n     Brizuela's assertion that ``al-Qaeda is not in Ciudad del \n     Este,'' Argentina's Sutera recognized that ``suspicions still \n     loom over Arabs who are sending money to terrorist groups in \n     the Middle East.'' Such groups pose as charity organizations \n     that seek to aid socially and economically stricken areas of \n     Iran, while what they do is to donate the newly acquired \n     funds to the terrorist cause of Hamas and Hezbollah.\n       The transcript of the 3+1 Counterterrorism Dialogue's \n     December 3, 2003 meeting held in Asuncion emphasized the \n     delegation's stance that ``Although there continued to be \n     reports in 2003 of an al-Qaeda presence in the tri-border \n     area, these reports remained uncorroborated by intelligence \n     and law-enforcement officials.'' Still, those assembled \n     agreed that international terrorist funding and money \n     laundering in the area remained an area of primary concern. \n     Considering the priorities of money launderers and piracy \n     crooks, the 3+1 understandably has organized a Financial \n     Intelligence Organization under the umbrella of the \n     Counterterrorism Dialogue. Last May in Buenos Aires, the four \n     government delegations discussed the threats of banking \n     activities that could lead to funding of terrorist \n     organizations. Sutera has concluded that most of the \n     terrorist-funding organizations had traveled to other parts \n     of South America, though he declined to comment where he \n     believed such groups had gone.\n\n\n                        argentina's cooperation\n\n       In separate interviews with COHA, Argentine officials like \n     Sutera and Congressional Liaison, Mariano Enrico, both \n     expressed the belief that Argentine authorities had initiated \n     and bolstered Southern Cone efforts to clean up the tri-\n     border region. According to a recent State Department \n     document, ``Argentina continues to express strong support for \n     the global war on terrorism and worked closely with the UN, \n     the OAS, MERCOSUR and the U.S. to ensure full implementation \n     of existing agreements.'' In particular, Argentine officials \n     have shown their disposition to freeze assets of alleged \n     terrorist-funding organizations/individuals.\n       Among the channels of communication connecting U.S. and \n     Argentine officials is the line between the CIA and SIDE \n     (Intelligence Sector of the Argentine State). Both SIDE and \n     the CIA work in concert with Brazilian and Paraguayan secret \n     service personnel. Another perhaps more crucial element in \n     the war on terrorism in Latin America began as a result of an \n     Argentine initiative; CICTE was organized in 1998 as a multi-\n     nation security plan for the region. Since then, Paraguay has \n     cooperated openly with the Argentines. But, Brazil has had \n     some reservations about instigating any anti-terrorism plans \n     without proof of terrorism. However, since 9/11 the Brazilian \n     sector of the CICTE team has offered full support for the \n     organization as information among the three countries has \n     passed with little inhibition.\n\n\n                         paraguay's cooperation\n\n       Paraguay's role in the war on terrorism has never held a \n     more important role than it does now. Though few terrorists \n     per se have surfaced in the region, rumors of the possibility \n     of some al-Qaeda connections to the region simply will not go \n     away. While President Nicanor Duarte Frutos has determined \n     that there is a domestic problem in Paraguay with fundraising \n     that might support terrorist causes, many State Department \n     officials have concluded that Paraguay's greatest impediment \n     to the prosecution of suspected terrorists is the absence of \n     an anti-terrorist law.\n\n\n                          brazil's cooperation\n\n       President Luiz Inacio Lula has taken a greater initiative \n     than perhaps has been the case of his predecessors in terms \n     of combating terrorism, especially in the tri-border region. \n     Foz do Iguacu, Brazil's portion of the region, has received \n     considerable scrutiny from the once aloof, but now rather \n     concerned, Lula administration. The Brazilian president has \n     ``vigorously condemned terrorism'' and calls such acts ``the \n     insanity of perpetrators of terrorism.''\n       Though Lula's intentions merit praise, his country's \n     shortage of resources and training have hindered its role in \n     acting as a watchdog over the region. In an exclusive \n     interview with COHA, Brazilian Embassy First Secretary of \n     Political Section, Breno Costa, offered an explanation as to \n     why Brazilian officials appear to act lethargically when it \n     comes to terrorist concerns: ``At first it seemed like the \n     U.S. was constantly alleging that the tri-border area \n     harbored criminals and terrorists, yet they never specified \n     where exactly in the region such evidence was forthcoming. So \n     Brazil asked the U.S. for concrete evidence and, of course, \n     not one piece of evidence. Just as the State Department \n     reported last year, no terrorist cells are acting in the \n     region.'' Costa went on to say that once evidence of money \n     laundering was presented to the Brazilian government, \n     officials in Foz do Iguacu began to examine cash flow \n     entering and leaving the city. Overall, Brazil has \n     cooperated considerably with the other three countries \n     involved in the counterterrorism dialogue, having signed \n     all of the 12 UN conventions on terrorism and is a party \n     to nine of them.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Clearly, the effort to prevent terrorism in Latin America \n     has become a more salient issue since 9/11. With cooperation \n     among the Southern Cone countries in conjunction with \n     participation of the U.S., terrorist acts have a lower \n     likelihood of occurring. Still, as the Afghanistan mountains \n     provide a haven for terrorists in the Middle East, Ciudad del \n     Este--if not properly monitored--could evolve as yet another \n     hub for terrorism. Whereas the U.S. has supported and \n     participated in the 3+1 Counterterrorism Dialogue, American \n     leaders merit commendation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10692-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAM BULINE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a key member of \nmy team who I have worked alongside for almost 10 years now and most \nimportantly, to mark a milestone of dedicated service to this body, the \nU.S. Senate.\n  On September 24, 2004, Pam Buline marked her 25th anniversary of \nworking for the U.S. Senate. Twenty-five years all spent as a valuable \naide to two Senators from the great State of Wyoming.\n  Pam began her career in the Senate back in 1979, working for former \nSenator Malcolm Wallop. In those days, Pam worked out of a little \noffice in a town called Lander, WY. Upon my election to the U.S. \nSenate, Pam agreed to join my staff and continue her efforts to serve \nconstituents in our State. I was extremely pleased to have a person \nwith her degree of knowledge on so many important issues--she is \ninvaluable.\n  Pam remains a crucial person on my staff. Her domain in Wyoming \ncovers a wide array of issues, from land swaps, to American Indian \nissues, to snowmachines in Yellowstone and Grand Teton. I can always \nturn to Pam for good advice and a very thorough explanation of the \nissue at hand or as she says, ``the long and the short of it.'' Pam \nloves her job and the people she works with and I am extremely grateful \nthat she is on my staff.\n  We are part of a team, my staff and I. Along with my wife, Susan, we \nall feel strongly bound to service for the people of Wyoming. Pam \ncontinues to be an invaluable member of that team. Her loyalty, while \nnot rare in this great body, is special nonetheless.\n  As U.S. Senators, we all know how important it is to have staff \naround us that are trustworthy, and will do whatever it takes to make \nthings work. I have been particularly fortunate to know Pam and work \nwith her for the past 9 years. Wyoming and the U.S. Senate have been \nblessed by her service for the past 25 years. I know my colleagues, and \nher husband Jim, and son Robert, join me in saluting Pam. I look \nforward to working with her for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10692-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10692-S10693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to note the \nimportance of the week of October 3-9, 2004, which is National Mental \nHealth Week. This annual event was created in the hopes that Americans \nwould recognize and honor the challenge encountered by the mentally ill \nand their loved ones. This year, the theme of the National Mental \nHealth Week is ``unity through disparities''.\n  Mental illnesses affect 22.1 percent of Americans over the age of 18. \nAccording to a National Institute of Mental Health 2001 survey, \napproximately 44.3 million Americans suffer from some form of mental \nillness. Conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, \nschizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder, together are ranked \nfourth of the ten leading causes of disabilities in\n\n[[Page S10693]]\n\nthe United States. Such statistics clearly indicate that we cannot \nafford to ignore the needs of those living with a mental illness.\n  The impact of mental illnesses on the productivity of the United \nStates is greatly underestimated. The Global Burden of Disease study, \npublished by the National Institute of Mental Health, exposed that \nmental illness, including suicide, accounts for 15 percent of the \nburden of disease in established market economies. This study reveals \nthat mental illness places a larger burden on the productivity of the \nUnited States than all cancers combined. Such findings reemphasize that \nmore attention and resources need to be directed towards supporting the \nmentally ill.\n  Today millions of Americans living with some form of mental illness \ncontinue to be discriminated against on a daily basis by their \ninsurance companies. Congress passed mental health parity legislation \nthat went into effect January 1, 1998 to try and address this problem. \nThis legislation was intended to require insurance companies that \nchoose to provide coverage for mental health to offer the same lifetime \ncap as they do for physical illness. This legislation was meant to be a \nmonumental first step in preventing discrimination against individuals \nwith mental illness.\n  Since enactment of this legislation, insurance companies have not \nexpanded their coverage, but instead have maintained just enough \ncoverage to remain within the legal limits of the law. Today I call on \nmy fellow Senators to support the Senator Paul Wellstone Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act of 2003, S. 486. Under this bill, full coverage \nequality with respect to health insurance coverage will be provided to \nthose who are mentally ill. It is my hope that in the closing weeks \nbefore the close of the 108th Congress, that we can come together in a \nbipartisan manner and support S. 486, not only for those who suffer \nfrom mental illness and their families, but also to pay tribute to our \ncolleague, the late Senator Paul Wellstone, who continuously fought for \nsuch parity during his service in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10693-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF CARL AND HESTER WHITE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

This \nkind of faithfulness in marriage is no less than perseverance in the \nmost important virtue of all, love of your fellow man.\n  Marriages are the bedrock of society and the foundation of \nresponsible citizenship.

He chose New Mexico \nas one of several centers of business and residence in the United \nStates, and it was at his home in Espanola that he died with family and \nfriends near.\n  I have the privilege of Yogi Bhajan's friendship and support for more \nthan 20 years. He was a dynamic, powerful person with a strong devotion \nto human rights, religious freedom, and good health. He was also a \nmasterful businessman with a degree in economics who intimately \nunderstood the connection between food and health, and made health food \na foundation for several hugely successful companies. ``Yogi Tea,'' for \ninstance, is found in households around the world.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Bibiji and their children, \nhis followers and his other friends. He was a teacher of all who came \nto know him. We have learned much from this man, and with his death we \nhave lost a great and good friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10693-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TULSA HISPANIC COMMISSION 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

On this occasion it is important to recognize the \naccomplishments of the commission such as it was only the second \ncommission of its type to be established in the U.S.A. The commission \nhas helped countless people in the Hispanic community in Tulsa to find \nhelp in the areas of health, education and economic development. Also, \nthe commission has played a fundamental role in promoting the values \nand cultural richness of the Hispanic community in Tulsa. The \ncommission has organized numerous community festivals and cultural \nprograms and has actively promoted teaching of Spanish, as well as \nEnglish. Finally, the commission aided in the establishment of the \nsister city program between Tulsa, OK, and San Luis Potosi, Mexico, \nthat to this day promotes friendship and understanding between the \npeople of the United States of America and Mexico.\n  Today, I, James M.

He has achieved a great deal and has \ncontributed tremendously to his State and his country.\n  As a United States Marine in the Pacific Theater during World War II, \nBill saw some of the fiercest fighting of the war. He served bravely \nfor 3 years until he was honorably discharged in 1945.\n  Bill chose not to end his devotion to the military when he left the \nPacific, and he has been a very active and highly effective veteran. He \nhas served as chairman of the St. Peters Veterans Memorial Commission \nand helped design and coordinated the city's Veterans' Memorial site. \nHe was also instrumental in the construction of St. Peters' Korean War \nMemorial. Bill is a member of Congressman Todd Akin's Veteran Memorial \nCommission and Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10838, where he has served \nas Commander, All-State Quartermaster, Safety Chair, Hospital Chair, \nMilitary Assistance Chair and Deputy Inspector.\n  In addition to veterans' affairs, Mr. Rupp has been involved in other \nimportant civic matters. While his children were in school, he served \nwith distinction as president of the McBride High School Father's Club, \npresident of the Rosary High School Parent Teacher Association and as a \njudge for the Amateur Athletic Union's 75th track meet.

Mr. President, it has been 50 years since the \nU.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1954 landmark decision of Brown v. \nBoard of Education that separate was not equal when it came to our \nchildren's education. That ruling changed the way that Americans are \neducated and opened up countless opportunities for all children, both \nblack and white, to learn about and from one another.\n  Hoxie, AR, is a small town in the northeast corner of my state, with \na population of just about 3,000 people. Prior to 1954, like many other \nschools in Arkansas and across the South, the Hoxie School District was \nsegregated. To get an education, black children had to travel thirty \nminutes by bus to the neighboring town of Jonesboro where they attended \nBooker T. Washington School with other black students from around the \nregion.\n  Following Brown, the Hoxie School Board unanimously voted to become \none of the first schools in the South to begin integration. In the fall \nof 1955, Hoxie School Board members, faculty, students, and citizens \nstood together with 21 black children who enrolled and became the first \nblack students to attend the Hoxie School system. This courageous step, \nin the face of opposition from around the state and across the Nation, \nhelped open doors for future generations of students in Arkansas.\n  I recently had the honor of attending a reunion for the Hoxie Twenty-\nOne, as they have come to be known in Arkansas. It was a wonderful \nevent in which the community gathered to commemorate the integration of \nHoxie School District. We paid tribute to the Hoxie Twenty-One and \ntheir families, as well as to the school officials and community \nleaders who paved the way for integration at Hoxie. The courage and \nresolve that the citizens of Hoxie showed in 1955 is an example of \nthose who are willing to embrace the spirit of equality and to do what \nis right for every child in the community.\n  Today, Arkansas' children go to school in a different environment \nthan that confronted by the Hoxie Twenty-One back in 1955. We certainly \nhave more work to do to ensure that all of our children receive the \nbest possible education, but I am pleased with the progress we have \nmade over the last 50 years. It is my hope that America can continue to \nbuild on the foundation that Hoxie School District helped to create to \nensure that all of our nation's children, no matter their race, are \nprovided with the best educational opportunities available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10694-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING THE McLEAN GIRLS LITTLE LEAGUE SOFTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to recognize \nthe 2004 McLean Girls Little League Softball team for their hard work \nand determination in representing both Virginia and the South in the \n2004 Girls Little League World Series tournament.\n  These young athletes, under the strong coaching of Jamie Loving, \ndevoted a tremendous amount of time and energy in their efforts to make \nit to the World Series tournament in Portland, Oregon. Throughout their \nseason, they showed courage and fortitude in winning the State \ncompetition with a record of 5-1 and the regional competition with a \nperfect record of 5-0. The team then went on to compete in the World \nSeries tournament against teams across the United States, Canada, the \nPhilippines, Europe and Puerto Rico. This is a great accomplishment for \nthese Virginia girls, especially since this is the first time in the \nhistory of the tournament that a team from Virginia has made it to the \nWorld Series.\n  I would like to congratulate each of the members of the McLean Girls \nLittle League Softball team: Brooke Brown, Sarah Eidt, Michelle Tilson, \nLauren Sanata, Megan Sullivan, Brittany McCray, Lauren Sutherland, \nMadeleine Giaquinto, Adrianne Engel, Jamie Bell, Kukana Ho'opi'i, \nShannon Engel, Lauren McColgan, Rachel Ing and their coaches, Jamie \nLoving, Darrell Tilson and Kurt Brown.\n  As a former student-athlete, I understand the impact that athletics \nplay in the development of an individual's character and life. Sports \nteach us important lessons of self-discipline, perseverance, teamwork, \nsportsmanship and self-confidence. The benefits of participating in \nathletics can prove valuable in the daily lives of student-athletes \nwhether at school or at work in their communities. I wish all of the \nmembers of the team and their coaches continued success in the future. \nKeep Winning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10694-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10694-S10695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. LINDA CRNIC\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. \nLinda Crnic, of Denver, CO, who passed away unexpectedly on September \n10, 2004.\n  Dr. Crnic was a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the \nUniversity of Colorado Health Sciences Center and director of the \nColorado Mental Retardation and Developmental Disability Research \nCenter. She was also an inspiration to thousands of families across the \nNation for her internationally recognized research on Down syndrome and \nFragile X.\n  Down syndrome and Fragile X are the two leading genetic disorders \ncausing mental retardation. Fragile X is an inherited disorder caused \nby a defect in one gene on the X chromosome. It is also the most common \nknown cause of Autism.\n  While I did not know Linda personally, many individuals have reached \nout to me in recent weeks with stories and tributes about the impact \nLinda made as a mother, as a colleague, as a friend, and through her \nresearch.\n  Dr. Crnic's research helped individuals with Down syndrome and \nFragile X become increasingly integrated into society and live fuller \nand more active lives.\n  Through the efforts and outreach of professionals like Linda Crnic, \nall of us benefit as research about these disorders have also led to \nnew medical insights and treatments.\n  According to those families, whose lives she touched so profoundly, \none cannot begin to describe the high regard and affection in which Dr. \nCrnic\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\nwas held. She was a researcher to whom parents of children with Fragile \nX and Down syndrome could always go to with their concerns, regardless \nof whether or not their concerns were related to Dr. Crnic's area of \nresearch. She listened and responded. This loss, for the Fragile X and \nDown syndrome communities is incalculable.\n  I send my deepest condolences to Linda Crnic's family. I hope they \nare comforted with her memory and knowledge that their loss is shared \nby so many in her community and across this nation.\n  I ask that the following news story about the life of Linda Crnic \nfrom the Rocky Mountain News be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Rocky Mountain News, Sept. 22, 2004]\n\n               Crnic, 56, Championed Down Syndrome Causes\n\n                             (By Mark Wolf)\n\n       Linda Crnic addressed the National Down Syndrome Congress \n     last month on The Dawn of a New Era in biomedical research, \n     then spent the evening dancing with children with Down \n     syndrome.\n       ``She spent hours on the dance floor,'' said Lloyd Lewis, \n     of Lafayette, father of a child with Down syndrome, who \n     addressed the association from a parent's perspective. \n     ``There was a particularly moving moment when a 50-year-old \n     woman was confused at not being able to find her purse. Linda \n     spent an hour looking under every table for it.''\n       Crnic, an internationally prominent Down syndrome \n     researcher, died Sept. 11 from injuries suffered in a bicycle \n     accident. She was 56.\n       She was a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the \n     University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and, since \n     2001, director of the Colorado Mental Retardation and \n     Developmental Disabilities Research Center.\n       ``A topic like (Down syndrome and other developmental \n     disabilities) is never something you can approach with one \n     particular line of investigation,'' said Dr. Doug Jones, \n     chairman of pediatrics at the Health Sciences Center. ``You \n     have to look at genetics, what determines behavior, a whole \n     range of things to understand how to help these children be \n     as normal as possible.\n       ``You have to have a psychologist, physician, geneticist. \n     It requires a broad range of disciplines. Linda's great \n     strength was that she saw how to do that, not just within the \n     School of Medicine, but within the entire University of \n     Colorado system and CSU, DU and ultimately across the \n     country.''\n       Born in Fort Wayne, Ind., she moved to Naperville, IL., \n     when she was 12. She earned a bachelor's degree from the \n     University of Chicago and master's and doctoral degrees in \n     experimental psychology from the University of Illinois at \n     Chicago.\n       She joined the CU Medical School as a postdoctorate fellow \n     in 1975 and became a full professor in 1994.\n       ``She was just the kindest, most loving person that you \n     would ever meet in your life,'' said Stan Wilks, her husband. \n     ``She was actively involved and mentored a lot of people in \n     their scientific careers.''\n       Their son, Michael, 13, plays cello, and his mother would \n     sit with him while he practiced.\n       ``She made that commitment to him,'' said her husband.\n       The family loved hiking and camping and had just purchased \n     an A-frame chalet in Hartsell.\n       ``We spent two of the last three weekends up there. We \n     bought it as a little family getaway to have some real \n     private times,'' Wilks said.\n       The weekend she died, Mrs. Crnic had traveled to Bend, \n     Ore., for a reunion weekend with several women with whom she \n     had attended leadership training. During a leisurely bike \n     ride she fell and fractured her skull.\n       ``The tragedy of that is that she was an expert bike rider \n     and practiced safety. She would never go biking without a \n     helmet, and here she was without a helmet,'' Wilks said.\n       She was in demand as a speaker to professional \n     organizations nationally and internationally and was a strong \n     advocate for increased support and research for Down syndrome \n     families.\n       ``She took the time and was genuinely interested in parents \n     and kids. She stimulated in me the notion that parents could \n     be very active and influential in funding research from \n     various avenues: the National Institutes of Health, Congress \n     and private benefactors,'' Lewis said.\n       Surviving in addition to her husband and son are sisters \n     Jacqueline Susmark, of Lakewood, and Janine Bisbee, of \n     Warren, N.J., and brother Brent Smith, of Salida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10695-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10695-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10695-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10695-S10696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5185.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to Pennsylvania's Nutrition \n     Education Program; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 770\n\n       Whereas, poor nutrition is a serious problem within the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania due to a lack of understanding \n     of the health impact of too much sugar, fat and salt in a \n     persons diet;. and\n       Whereas, the problem of poor nutrition is particularly \n     acute among low-income households which often lack the \n     resources for a balanced and nutritious diet; and\n       Whereas, PA NEP has developed an effective program of \n     bringing nutrition education to community food pantries and \n     other community partners and has impacted the dietary \n     practices of low-income households that access food there; \n     and\n       Whereas, this commendable and important result has been \n     achieved with the support of the United States Department of \n     Agriculture over the past six years, including recognition \n     that a portion of the food provided by the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania through the State Food Purchase Program \n     qualifies as ``nutrition education'' when that food is used \n     to reinforce and/or replicate a nutrition lesson; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Agriculture has \n     informed the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare that \n     it will no longer permit State Food Purchase Program food to \n     qualify as ``nutrition education''; and\n       Whereas improvement, in the dietary practices of \n     Pennsylvania residents is a matter of urgent public health; \n     and\n       Whereas, the use of food provided by the State Food \n     Purchase Program to reinforce and/or replicate nutrition \n     lessons is a highly appropriate way to impact the dietary \n     practices of low-income households and is fully consistent \n     with legislative intent; and\n       Whereas, the decision of the United States Department of \n     Agriculture to no longer consider the cost of food used in \n     the manner as ``nutrition education'' will cause nutrition \n     education in Pennsylvania's food distribution programs to \n     largely cease: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives call upon the \n     United States Department of Agriculture to recognize that \n     food provided to low-income households through the State Food \n     Purchased Program may be properly considered ``nutrition \n     education'' when used to reinforce and/or replicate a \n     nutrition lesson; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States Department of Agriculture \n     reconsider its recent policy change and once again permit \n     State Food Purchase Program food to qualify as ``nutrition \n     education'' under Pennsylvania's Nutrition Education Program; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture \n     and to each member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-517. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of California relative to food \n     marketing and advertising directed to children; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 29\n\n       Whereas, California is in the midst of a growing epidemic \n     of overweight children and childhood obesity due to poor diet \n     and physical inactivity, putting growing numbers of \n     California children at increased risk for type II diabetes, \n     hypertension, heart disease, and cancer, along with \n     psychosocial problems including low self-esteem, poor body \n     image, and symptoms of depression; and\n       Whereas, a recent study showed that 26.5 percent of \n     California youth in grades 5, 7, and 9 are overweight, with \n     rates being even higher for African-American children (28.6 \n     percent) and Latino children (33.7 percent); and\n       Whereas, in California, annual obesity-attributable medical \n     expenditures were estimated at $7.7 billion in 2003, with \n     approximately one-half of these expenditures financed by \n     Medicare and Medi-Cal; and\n       Whereas, healthy eating and physical activity, including \n     eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables every \n     day, are vital to preventing people from being overweight or \n     suffering from heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, and \n     ensuring children's health and well-being; and\n       Whereas, poor diet and physical inactivity are responsible \n     for 400,000 deaths in the United States annually and may soon \n     overtake tobacco as the leading cause of preventable death; \n     and\n       Whereas, the growing epidemic of childhood obesity has \n     brought renewed attention to the role that food and beverage \n     advertising and marketing play in negatively influencing \n     eating habits of youth; and\n       Whereas, the food, beverage, and restaurant industries \n     recognize children as a major market force because of their \n     spending power, purchasing influence, and anticipated brand \n     loyalty as adult consumers, with children under 14 years of \n     age purchasing $24 billion in products and influencing \n     $190 billion in family purchases each year; and\n       Whereas, children are being exposed to increasing amounts \n     of marketing and advertising, with $15 billion spent \n     marketing to children in the United States in 2002, double \n     the amount spent in 1992; and\n       Whereas, the food, beverage, and restaurant industries \n     utilize multiple strategies to market their products to \n     children, including television advertising, in-school \n     marketing, the Internet, product placements, toys, books, and \n     clothes with food-brand logos, contests, celebrity and \n     cartoon spokespeople, and child targeted in-store and \n     restaurant promotions; and\n       Whereas, children view an estimated 40,000 commercials each \n     year, 50 percent of which advertise food products--most often \n     products that are high in calories, fats, sugars, and salt, \n     with almost no references to fruits or vegetables. Children \n     watch an average of one food commercial every five minutes of \n     television viewing time, and as many as three hours of food \n     commercials each week. Latino and African-American children \n     are exposed to more television food advertising than other \n     children; and\n       Whereas, in-school marketing of food and beverages has \n     become increasingly prevalent in recent years and includes: \n     (1) product sales, including sales through vending machines, \n     a la carte, snack bars, soft drink ``pouring-rights'' \n     agreements through exclusive contracts, branded fast food, \n     and fundraisers; (2) direct advertising, such as food and \n     beverage ads in schools; and (3) indirect advertising, such \n     as corporate-sponsored educational programs, sports team \n     sponsorships, and incentive programs using contests and \n     coupons; and\n       Whereas, the majority of the foods and beverages sold in \n     school vending machines and school stores are calorically \n     dense and low in nutrients, which promotes purchasing and \n     consumption of these foods while children are away from their \n     parents in a captive environment that is supposed to be \n     dedicated to education; and\n       Whereas, studies show that food advertising and marketing \n     result in more favorable attitudes, preferences, and \n     behaviors among children towards the advertised products and \n     that children's food preferences and food purchase requests \n     for high sugar and high fat foods are influenced by \n     television exposure to food advertising; and\n       Whereas, parents face increasing strain between their \n     desire to feed their children well and the intense marketing \n     of high calorie, low-nutrition food and beverages to their \n     children; and\n       Whereas, in 2003, the World Health Organization concluded \n     that the extensive marketing to children of fast food and \n     high calorie, micronutrient-poor foods and beverages is a \n     probable causal factor for the accelerating global trend \n     in weight gain obesity; and\n       Whereas, children are particularly vulnerable to marketing \n     of unhealthy foods and beverages because children under the \n     age of 4 or 5 years cannot distinguish between television \n     programming and advertisements, and children age 8 and under \n     are unable to comprehend the persuasive intent and biased \n     nature of advertising, making advertising to young children \n     fundamentally unfair: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the Congress and the President of the \n     United States to require the Federal Trade Commission to (1) \n     develop and implement nutrition standards for foods and \n     beverages that are acceptable to advertise or market to \n     children, including foods and beverages that make a positive \n     contribution to children's diets and health by being moderate \n     in portion size, calories, saturated fat, trans fat, refined \n     sugars, and sodium, and provide key nutrients and (2) \n     prohibit advertising and marketing of foods and beverages \n     that do not meet those standards through broadcast, print, \n     Internet, or other marketing venues for which a significant \n     portion of the audience is children; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the Congress \n     and the President of the United States to require the Federal \n     Communications Commission to ensure that equal time is given \n     during television programs that have a significant youth \n     audience to encourage fruit and vegetable consumption and \n     physical activity, and discourage consumption of low nutrient \n     foods and beverages. These messages must be produced and \n     delivered by individuals and organizations that have no \n     financial interest in the message; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the Congress \n     and the President of the United States to fund new and \n     existing media campaigns to promote healthy eating and \n     physical activity, such as the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention's VERB campaign and the National 5 A Day \n     program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of \n     Health to fund research studies to further assess the effects \n     of food and beverage advertising and marketing on the diets \n     and health of children and adolescents; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature calls on food and beverage \n     companies, restaurants, retail\n\n[[Page S10698]]\n\n     stores, advertising agencies, sports and entertainment \n     industries, and print, broadcast, and Web-based media \n     operating in California to adhere to a voluntary code of \n     practice, developed by experts, that would contain guidelines \n     and standards for responsible food and beverage advertising \n     and marketing aimed at children; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Majority Leader of the Senate, and each Senator and \n     Representative from California in Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-518. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to property \n     in the Waikane Valley, Hawaii; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 212\n\n       Whereas, Waikane Valley contains undeveloped land in the \n     ahupuaa of Waikane on Oahu's windward side; and\n       Whereas, 33 years ago, the United States Marine Corps \n     obtained 187 acres in Waikane Valley, commonly referred to as \n     the ``Waikane Training Area,'' for military jungle and live \n     ordnance training; and\n       Whereas, the United States Marine Corps has announced its \n     intention to close the Waikane Training Area, but as recently \n     as last year, the United States Marine Corps has sought to \n     use Waikane Valley for more military jungle training; and\n       Whereas, ironically, Waikane Valley was abandoned as a \n     training site by the United States Marine Corps because of \n     safety concerns over the use of high explosive anti-tank and \n     bazooka rounds used in the past and the insufficient data to \n     determine the exact number of ammunition rounds fired in the \n     valley; and\n       Whereas, the United States Marine Corps originally obtained \n     the right to use the Waikane Training Area by a lease from \n     the McCandless Estate and Waiahole Water Company in 1953 and \n     subsequently by a lease from the same parties and the heirs \n     of John Kamaka; and\n       Whereas, the Kamaka heirs acquired title to the Waikane \n     Training Area by quitclaim deed in June of 1972 and \n     terminated the lease with the United States Marine Corps in \n     1976; and\n       Whereas, between 1976 and 1993, the United States Marine \n     Corps conducted several investigations and ordnance removal \n     efforts on the property and concluded that the Waikane \n     Training Area could never be certified as being clear of \n     ordnance; and\n       Whereas, the United States Navy and Marine Corps acquired \n     title to the Waikane Training Area in 1993 by condemnation as \n     a means to address the problem of not being able to fulfill \n     their lease obligations to return the property to the Kamaka \n     heirs in an ordnance-free and safe condition; and\n       Whereas, land in Hawaii, and particularly agricultural and \n     conservation land, is Hawaii's most precious and limited \n     resource; and\n       Whereas, Waikane Valley has served historically as \n     important agricultural area for the island of Oahu and \n     contains precious archaeological and historic sites; and\n       Whereas, regardless of the 1993 condemnation, members of \n     the Waikane community believe that the United States Marine \n     Corps should live up to their commitment of cleaning up the \n     land, and they have expressed their desire to have the \n     Waikane Training Area restored to a condition that will \n     permit them to return to the aina and engage in farming and \n     other agricultural activities that would be appropriate based \n     on the condition of the remediated property; and\n       Whereas, the federal government and military have \n     previously demonstrated their will and capacity to honor \n     their obligations to remediate and restore other equally or \n     more severely contaminated installations upon closure under \n     the Formerly Used Defense Site Program, Defense Environmental \n     Restoration Program, Installation Restoration Program, other \n     Department of Defense initiatives and programs, and with \n     special appropriations from Congress; and\n       Whereas, the current official position of United States \n     Department of Defense is that no ordnance-contaminated site \n     can ever be certified as being clear of unexploded ordnance; \n     and\n       Whereas, based on the inability to certify the Waikane \n     Training Area as being clear of unexploded ordnance, the \n     United States Navy and Marine Corps are considering permanent \n     closure of the property to the general public by erecting a \n     security fence around the area; and\n       Whereas, the permanent closure of the Waikane Training Area \n     would be a devastating loss of precious agricultural, \n     historical, cultural, and natural resources to Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, with sufficient funding from existing restoration \n     programs or special appropriations from Congress, or both, \n     the United States Navy and Marine Corps have the means to \n     clean-up the Waikane Training Area to a condition that is \n     reasonably safe for certain restricted uses, provided long-\n     term monitoring and guidelines are established: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-Second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the federal government is \n     requested to conduct a thorough evaluation of the condition \n     of the Waikane Training Area, particularly with regard to \n     environmental and ordnance-related hazards that exist on the \n     property; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is requested to plan \n     for and conduct as thorough a clean-up of the Waikane \n     Training Area as is technologically possible, including the \n     remediation or removal of all environmental hazards and \n     contamination and removal of all practice and live ordnance; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is requested to \n     conduct a post-clean-up environmental assessment of the \n     Waikane Training Area evaluating the potential risks to human \n     health and safety, for the purpose of determining the types \n     of uses and activities that could appropriately be conducted \n     on the property with minimal risk to potential users and the \n     community at large; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is requested to \n     return the Waikane Training Area to the State of Hawaii upon \n     completion of the clean-up; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is requested to \n     appropriate sufficient funds to plan for, implement, and \n     complete the rehabilitation and transfer of the Waikane \n     Training Area; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation are requested to assist in seeking and obtaining \n     the relief sought above; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to President of the United States, \n     President of the United States Senate, Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, members of Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, \n     and the Secretary of the Navy.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-519. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to passage of the defense \n     appropriations bill; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 114\n\n       Whereas, the security of our nation and people is the first \n     and foremost obligation of the Federal Government; and\n       Whereas, the men and women of our armed forces serving in \n     the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, \n     Merchant Marine, National Guard and Reserves have shown great \n     courage and self-sacrifice and deserve to be equipped with \n     the best weapons and resources to protect our nation; and\n       Whereas, in past years politicians have delayed passing the \n     defense appropriations bill until late in the budget year so \n     that the defense appropriations bill was misused as a dumping \n     ground for pork-barrel spending and as a political hostage to \n     pork-barrel spending in other appropriations bills; and\n       Whereas, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September \n     11, 2001, the President has asked that the Congress of the \n     United States pass the defense appropriations bill before \n     passing other spending bills; and\n       Whereas, Congress acted responsibly in Fiscal Years 2002 \n     and 2003 when it passed the defense appropriations bill \n     first, protecting the men and women of our armed forces from \n     becoming political pawns for politicians' spending maneuvers: \n     Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania commend Congress for making our \n     nation's defense its first priority in Fiscal Years 2002 and \n     2003 and request Congressmen and Senators from Pennsylvania \n     to continue this policy by passing defense appropriations \n     legislation before all other spending bills in 2004 and in \n     the future; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each House of Congress and to each \n     Member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-520. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to the Congressional Medal of Honor; \n     to the Committee on Armed Services.\n       Whereas, United States Army and Department of Defense \n     officials are reviewing a recommendation to upgrade Major \n     Winters' Distinguished Service Cross to the Congressional \n     Medal of Honor; and\n       Whereas, Major Winters was originally nominated for the \n     Medal of Honor by Colonel Robert F.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to the regulation of \n     financial institutions; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, the Senate and Assembly Banking Committees of the \n     California Legislature have held an informational hearing on \n     the doctrine of federal preemption of state laws and the \n     impact on California and its financial regulators; and\n       Whereas, the California Constitution provides that an \n     administrative agency of the state has no authority to \n     declare a state law unenforceable unless an appellate court \n     determines that the statute is prohibited by federal laws or \n     regulations; and\n       Whereas, there are two areas where tension exists between \n     federal and state law in the fields of regulation of \n     financial institutions, which are the areas relating to the \n     jurisdiction over the operating subsidiaries of national \n     banks and consumer protection; and\n       Whereas, operating subsidiaries of national banks engage in \n     various financial services such as mortgages, insurance, and \n     securities-brokerage services that are beyond the scope of \n     the business of banking as originally conceived in the \n     National Bank Act of 1864; and\n       Whereas, operating subsidiaries of national banks are \n     creatures of state law, not federal law, and are incorporated \n     under state law and in the past have applied for licenses \n     from state regulatory authorities to operate within \n     California; and\n       Whereas, in August of 2001, and in January of 2004, the \n     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) promulgated a \n     regulation that effectively stated that the OCC was the \n     exclusive regulator of national banks and their operating \n     subsidiaries and this regulation placed the OCC on a \n     collision course with California regulators of financial \n     institutions; and\n       Whereas, the OCC has appeared as amicus curiae in several \n     recent federal court cases opposing consumer protection \n     legislation that has been passed by the California \n     Legislature, on the basis that the legislation interfered \n     with the power of national banks and their operating \n     subsidiaries to engage in the business of banking; and\n       Whereas, there has been a clear, consistent, and \n     premeditated effort by the federal government, specifically \n     on the part of the OCC, to exercise jurisdiction in financial \n     regulation matters that were previously the jurisdictional \n     domain of the states, and the exercise of the jurisdiction \n     has been assisted by a complacent United States Congress and \n     deferential court system; and\n       Whereas, certain interpretations of law by the OCC and the \n     Office of Thrift Supervision have prevented the application \n     of state consumer protections to federally-chartered \n     financial institutions, and frustrate the efforts of state \n     regulators and legislators to extend these protections to all \n     citizens; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California, recognizing that the authority to resolve these \n     issues rests with the federal courts and the United States \n     Congress, respectfully requests that the United States \n     Congress disapprove the rule submitted by the Office of \n     Comptroller of the Currency relating to bank activities and \n     regulations published at 69 Federal Register 1895 (January \n     13, 2004), so the rule will have no force or effect, and if \n     necessary, consider legislation that will prevent the \n     unilateral expansion of jurisdiction over financial \n     institutions by federal regulators without the specific \n     endorsement of the elected representatives of the United \n     States Congress; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, to the \n     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and to the Office \n     of Thrift Supervision.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-522. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to federal Section 8 \n     funding; to the Committee on Baking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 185\n\n       Whereas, since established in 1974, the Section 8 housing \n     assistance program has been an integral part of one of our \n     nation's most important social goals, that of providing \n     housing opportunities for low-income families, the elderly \n     and the disabled; and\n       Whereas, today, the Section 8 housing voucher program is \n     the principal federal housing assistance program for low-\n     income household, helping 2 million families across the \n     country to secure modest, decent housing in the private \n     housing market; and\n       Whereas, the 2005 federal budget proposes to reduce Section \n     8 voucher funding by $1 billion below the 2004 level, and \n     also proposes radical changes in the program's structure that \n     would leave Section 8 vulnerable to further reductions in \n     federal funding over time; and\n       Whereas, in 2005, the proposed cuts could reduce the number \n     of families currently assisted nationwide by 250,000, and the \n     funding currently projected by this Administration could \n     eventually reduce the number of vouchers by 600,000 in 2009; \n     and\n       Whereas, in New Jersey alone, the existing 64,160 Section 8 \n     housing vouchers could be reduced by 7,780 in 2005, and by \n     18,660 in 2009; and\n       Whereas, given these circumstances, it is fitting and \n     proper for this House to respectfully urge Congress and \n     President George W. Bush not to reduce funding for the \n     Section 8 program, as thousands of families in New Jersey and \n     nationwide depend on Section 8 in order to secure affordable \n     housing and avoid homelessness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House urges Congress and President George W. Bush \n     to fully fund the Section 8 housing voucher program, in \n     recognition of the integral part this program plays in \n     providing decent and affordable housing for thousands of our \n     nation's low-income families, the elderly and the disabled.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker Of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate and \n     House of Representatives, and every member of the New Jersey \n     Congressional Delegation.\n       This Assembly resolution urges Congress and President \n     George W. Bush to fully fund the Section 8 housing assistance \n     program.\n       The proposed 2005 federal budget reduces funding for this \n     program by $1 billion below 2004 levels. According to the \n     Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and housing advocates \n     across the country, this reduction could lead to a decrease \n     of 250,000 vouchers from the current 2 million in use \n     nationwide. Furthermore, the budget proposes a transformation \n     of the Section 8 program from a so-called ``unit-based'' to a \n     ``dollar-based'' funding system, which would leave the \n     program vulnerable to further reductions in federal funding \n     over the years. It is estimated that these changes could \n     further reduce the number of vouchers nationwide by 30% in \n     2009, a reduction of 600,000 vouchers below 2004 levels.\n       In New Jersey alone, the 2005 cuts could reduce the current \n     64,160 vouchers by 7,780, and further reductions could lead \n     to an 18,660 decrease in 2009.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-523. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan relative to the dredging of canals \n     around the city of Gibraltar; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 41\n\n       Whereas, the city of Gibraltar in Wayne County is a unique \n     community, with more than five miles of canals bisecting the \n     city and its four islands of residences. These public \n     transportation routes include access to public and private \n     facilities, including boat ramps and marinas. Thousands of \n     people use the canals each year; and\n       Whereas, with no dredging of the Gibraltar canals since the \n     late 1950s, the use of the canals is today significantly \n     threatened by the buildup of sediment throughout the system. \n     Boating traffic is hampered by the buildup. The task of \n     dealing with the Gibraltar canals is made more complex by the \n     results of testing that has identified contamination in the \n     sediment. This fact will greatly increase the costs of \n     dredging and disposal of the sediment; and\n       Whereas, the costs of dredging the canals is far beyond the \n     resources available within the community of Gibraltar, and \n     the canals are available to and used by many more people than \n     residents of Gibraltar. This work clearly needs to be \n     completed. The Gibraltar canals are notable components of the \n     Detroit River system, and maintaining the quality of the \n     canals is work that is strongly related to the quality of \n     this vital part of our water transportation network. It is \n     essential that necessary resources be directed to this task: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to provide funding for the dredging of canals around \n     the city of Gibraltar; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-524. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to competition in the cable \n     television industry; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 156\n\n       Whereas, cable television is an important source of state \n     and local news, public affairs programming, emergency \n     information and other broadcast services critical to an \n     informed and safe electorate; and\n       Whereas, the cable television industry has become highly \n     concentrated in New Jersey with most areas having only one \n     cable service provider and such concentration can be a \n     barrier to entry for new programmers resulting in fewer \n     choices of programming for New Jersey consumers; and\n       Whereas, the rates for cable service in New Jersey have \n     increased by over 60 percent\n\n[[Page S10700]]\n\n     since 1996 according to the New Jersey Board of Public \n     Utilities and none of this increase is attributable to State \n     legislation or regulation; and\n       Whereas, cable television companies are allowed to \n     construct and maintain cables, conduits, poles, and other \n     equipment upon, under or over highways and other public \n     places and are permitted to use utility easements on private \n     property; and\n       Whereas, there are significant societal benefits, \n     especially the freedom of speech, in having multiple \n     providers of programming services because a cable television \n     provider controls much of the programming available to its \n     subscribers; and\n       Whereas, competition in the cable television industry will \n     encourage the availability of a wider array of ideas and \n     information, better rates, and improved services for New \n     Jersey consumers; and\n       Whereas, it is in the public interest to further \n     competition in the cable television industry in New Jersey in \n     order to promote the availability of diverse views and \n     information, to ensure cable service providers expand their \n     capacity and program offerings, to ensure cable service \n     providers do not have undue market power or undue influence \n     over the distribution of information and to protect the best \n     interests of consumer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The General Assembly urges the President and Congress of \n     the United States to allow the states to require that cable \n     television companies shall not receive consent to operate in \n     their municipalities or franchise territories, at issuance or \n     renewal of that consent, until a cable television company \n     has:\n       a. certified that there is another cable television company \n     operating in the municipality; or\n       b. designated channels for commercial use as set forth in \n     47 U.S.C. s.532 and has leased two-thirds or more of the \n     channels required to be set aside to persons unaffiliated \n     with the cable television company; or\n       c. implemented an open video system in accordance with 47 \n     U.S.C. s.573, where ``open video system'' means a facility \n     consisting of a set of transmission paths and associated \n     signal generation, reception, and control equipment that is \n     designed to provide cable service which includes video \n     programming which is provided to multiple subscribers within \n     a community and which has been certified by the Federal \n     Communications Commission as being in compliance with Part 76 \n     ``Multichannel Video and Cable Television Service'' of Title \n     47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested to by the \n     Clerk thereof, shall be transmitted to the President of the \n     United States, the presiding officers of the United States \n     Senate and House of Representatives, and to each member of \n     Congress elected from this State.\n       This Assembly resolution urges the President and Congress \n     of the United States to allow the states to require that \n     cable television companies shall not receive consent to \n     operate in their municipalities or franchise territories at \n     issuance or renewal of that consent until a cable television \n     company has: certified that there is another cable television \n     company operating in the municipality or territory; or \n     designated channels for commercial use as set forth in 47 \n     U.S.C. s.532 and has leased two-thirds or more of the \n     channels required to be set aside to persons unaffiliated \n     with the cable television company; or implemented an open \n     video system in accordance with 47 U.S.C. s.573.\n       The leased commercial access provisions of 47 U.S.C. s.532 \n     require a television cable company to designate channel \n     capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the \n     cable television company. Smaller companies must designate 10 \n     percent of their channel capacity and larger companies must \n     designate 15 percent of their channel capacity. Channels \n     designated for public, educational, or governmental use may \n     not satisfy the requirement for leased commercial access \n     channels. If the designated channels are not leased, the \n     television cable company may continue to use them for its own \n     programming. Consumers do not receive a separate charge for \n     the programming on leased commercial access channels. An \n     example of leased commercial access channel use would be an \n     ``informercial'' channel.\n       In an open access video system, as established in 47 U.S.C. \n     s.573, the operator of an open video system is released from \n     certain federal regulatory burdens in exchange for opening up \n     one-third of its activated channel capacity to bidding by \n     those who wish to contract for carriage of specific video \n     programming on an open video system. Consumers would have the \n     choice to receive and pay for this specific video \n     programming.\n       The states' ability to regulate these aspects of the cable \n     television industry will lead to greater competition and will \n     encourage the availability of a wider array of ideas and \n     information, better rates, and improved services for New \n     Jersey consumers.\n       POM-525. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to the Marshall Islands \n     Nuclear Claims Tribunal; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n       Whereas, fifty years ago on March 1, 1954, at 6:45 a.m., \n     the United States of America tested the ``Bravo'' hydrogen \n     bomb on Bikini Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, \n     resulting in an explosion that is now acknowledged as by far \n     the most destructive nuclear detonation ever; and\n       Whereas, scientists involved in the test known as ``Bravo'' \n     have maintained that they expected a yield equivalent to five \n     megatons; and\n       Whereas, the ``Bravo'' bomb actually yielded 15 megatons, \n     or a thousand times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb; \n     and\n       Whereas, while U.S. servicemen on Rongerik Atoll were \n     evacuated within hours of the blast, Marshallese residents of \n     Utirik and Rongelap, all within the hazardous range of the \n     explosion, were left on their contaminated islands for at \n     least a day longer, resulting in their exposure to \n     significant radiation; and\n       Whereas, the men, women, and children of these atolls were \n     already suffering burns and loss of hair at the time of their \n     removal from their homes; and\n       Whereas, 23 crewmembers of the Japanese fishing boat, Lucky \n     Dragon, were also exposed to severe radiation from Bravo; and\n       Whereas, a total of 67 nuclear tests were conducted in \n     Bikini and Enewetak between 1946 and 1958, exposing the \n     people of the Marshall Islands to severe health problems and \n     genetic anomalies during the tests and for generations to \n     come; and\n       Whereas, if one were to calculate the net yield of all the \n     tests conducted in the Marshall Islands, it would be \n     equivalent to the detonation of 1.7 Hiroshima bombs every day \n     for 12 years; and\n       Whereas, Enewetak Atoll served as ground zero for 43 tests \n     including the first-ever hydrogen device, resulting in the \n     loss of eight percent of their land, and even after a massive \n     cleanup program by the United States, the Marshallese have no \n     safe access to more than 57 percent of their land; and\n       Whereas, the people of Enewetak were exiled from their home \n     for more than 33 years in spite of assurances from U.S. \n     officials that they would be repatriated in three to five \n     years after their original removal in 1946; and\n       Whereas, similar promises made to Bikini residents forced \n     the surrender of their land supposedly for the ``betterment \n     of mankind''; and\n       Whereas, on advice from the United States, the people of \n     Bikini were repatriated in 1967 only to be evacuated seven \n     years later when high levels of radionuclides were discovered \n     in their bodies; and\n       Whereas, the people of Rongelap and Utirik were returned \n     prematurely to their atolls and received additional exposure, \n     causing many to believe that they were used to study the \n     effects of radiation on human being as contemplated in the \n     Atomic Energy Commission's now infamous Project 4.1; and\n       Whereas, recently declassified information contains strong \n     indications that human experimentation using the people of \n     the exposed atolls was indeed part of the nuclear testing \n     program in the Marshall Islands; and\n       Whereas, in its Compact of Free Association (Compact), the \n     United States of America accepts the responsibility for \n     compensation owing to the citizens of the Marshall Islands . \n     . . for loss or damage to property and person . . . resulting \n     from the nuclear testing program which the Government of the \n     United States conducted in the Northern Marshall Islands \n     between June 30, 1946 and August 18, 1959'': and\n       Whereas, the pertinent provisions of the Compact were \n     negotiated based on limited and misleading information \n     provided by the United States Government to the Marshallese \n     representatives, a fact exposed only recently in material \n     declassified by the United States and acknowledged by their \n     officials; and\n       Whereas, the funds provided under the Compact agreement are \n     grossly inadequate to provide for health care and \n     environmental monitoring, personal injury claims, or land and \n     property damage; and\n       Whereas, the ``changed circumstances'' provision of section \n     177 of the Compact provides that if the agreement on nuclear \n     matters is manifestly inadequate to meet the technological \n     and financial requirements anticipated during the \n     negotiations, or if new information emerges which renders \n     those agreements insufficient for the purpose of concluding \n     full and just compensation, the Congress of the United States \n     would consider a request for proper compensation; and\n       Whereas, the Government of the Marshall Islands submitted \n     such a petition on September 11, 2000; and\n       Whereas, just compensation and continued funding for \n     promised medical and health programs for survivors of the \n     atomic tests depend upon Congress' favorable consideration of \n     this petition; and\n       Whereas, over the past 15 years Hawaii has provided \n     medical, educational, and other supportive services to lawful \n     nonimmigrants from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, \n     without reimbursement from the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the United States Congress \n     is respectfully requested to take appropriate measures to \n     provide for the compensation of awards including property \n     damage claims, to the fullest extent, as determined by the \n     Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal, and to provide for \n     the costs of cleaning up nuclear sites in the Marshall \n     Islands;

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to gasoline types; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 272\n\n       Whereas, while there are many factors that are contributing \n     to the recent swift rise in pump prices for gasoline, a \n     significant element is the number of gasoline types \n     refineries must produce to meet environmental standards of \n     various metropolitan regions across the country. Over the \n     years, federal mandates to improve air quality in areas with \n     problems have resulted in a complicated patchwork of fuel \n     requirements. The Large number of fuels is also the result of \n     the strategies individual states have developed to meet \n     federal standards; and\n       Whereas, while the goals of cleaner air are important \n     challenges that must be met, it seems inefficient on many \n     levels for refineries to have to develop, produce, and \n     deliver so many different types of gasoline. In the Midwest \n     alone, at least seven types of fuel must be made. The impact \n     of these requirements is to raise costs, delay production, \n     disrupt distribution, and reduce the supply. These problems, \n     as Michigan has learned all too well, become far more severe \n     when any unforeseen events, such as a gasoline pipeline \n     accident or a refinery fire, take place; and\n       Whereas, although the ultimate goal of a single gasoline \n     type for the entire country at any given time may not be \n     attainable because of the enormous variations in geographical \n     and climatic conditions across America, requiring the country \n     to sharply reduce the number of gasoline types can bring \n     great benefits. In addition, using cleaner fuels may enhance \n     air quality not only in ozone nonattainment areas, but \n     everywhere: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     issue of the number of gasoline types refined across the \n     country and to enact legislation that will sharply reduce the \n     number of gasoline types required to meet local environmental \n     standards; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-527.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to Pennsylvania's Nutrition \n     Education Program; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 770\n\n       Whereas, poor nutrition is a serious problem within the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania due to a lack of understanding \n     of the health impact of too much sugar, fat and salt in a \n     persons diet;. and\n       Whereas, the problem of poor nutrition is particularly \n     acute among low-income households which often lack the \n     resources for a balanced and nutritious diet; and\n       Whereas, PA NEP has developed an effective program of \n     bringing nutrition education to community food pantries and \n     other community partners and has impacted the dietary \n     practices of low-income households that access food there; \n     and\n       Whereas, this commendable and important result has been \n     achieved with the support of the United States Department of \n     Agriculture over the past six years, including recognition \n     that a portion of the food provided by the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania through the State Food Purchase Program \n     qualifies as ``nutrition education'' when that food is used \n     to reinforce and/or replicate a nutrition lesson; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Agriculture has \n     informed the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare that \n     it will no longer permit State Food Purchase Program food to \n     qualify as ``nutrition education''; and\n       Whereas improvement, in the dietary practices of \n     Pennsylvania residents is a matter of urgent public health; \n     and\n       Whereas, the use of food provided by the State Food \n     Purchase Program to reinforce and/or replicate nutrition \n     lessons is a highly appropriate way to impact the dietary \n     practices of low-income households and is fully consistent \n     with legislative intent; and\n       Whereas, the decision of the United States Department of \n     Agriculture to no longer consider the cost of food used in \n     the manner as ``nutrition education'' will cause nutrition \n     education in Pennsylvania's food distribution programs to \n     largely cease: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives call upon the \n     United States Department of Agriculture to recognize that \n     food provided to low-income households through the State Food \n     Purchased Program may be properly considered ``nutrition \n     education'' when used to reinforce and/or replicate a \n     nutrition lesson; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States Department of Agriculture \n     reconsider its recent policy change and once again permit \n     State Food Purchase Program food to qualify as ``nutrition \n     education'' under Pennsylvania's Nutrition Education Program; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture \n     and to each member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-517. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of California relative to food \n     marketing and advertising directed to children; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 29\n\n       Whereas, California is in the midst of a growing epidemic \n     of overweight children and childhood obesity due to poor diet \n     and physical inactivity, putting growing numbers of \n     California children at increased risk for type II diabetes, \n     hypertension, heart disease, and cancer, along with \n     psychosocial problems including low self-esteem, poor body \n     image, and symptoms of depression; and\n       Whereas, a recent study showed that 26.5 percent of \n     California youth in grades 5, 7, and 9 are overweight, with \n     rates being even higher for African-American children (28.6 \n     percent) and Latino children (33.7 percent); and\n       Whereas, in California, annual obesity-attributable medical \n     expenditures were estimated at $7.7 billion in 2003, with \n     approximately one-half of these expenditures financed by \n     Medicare and Medi-Cal; and\n       Whereas, healthy eating and physical activity, including \n     eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables every \n     day, are vital to preventing people from being overweight or \n     suffering from heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, and \n     ensuring children's health and well-being; and\n       Whereas, poor diet and physical inactivity are responsible \n     for 400,000 deaths in the United States annually and may soon \n     overtake tobacco as the leading cause of preventable death; \n     and\n       Whereas, the growing epidemic of childhood obesity has \n     brought renewed attention to the role that food and beverage \n     advertising and marketing play in negatively influencing \n     eating habits of youth; and\n       Whereas, the food, beverage, and restaurant industries \n     recognize children as a major market force because of their \n     spending power, purchasing influence, and anticipated brand \n     loyalty as adult consumers, with children under 14 years of \n     age purchasing $24 billion in products and influencing \n     $190 billion in family purchases each year; and\n       Whereas, children are being exposed to increasing amounts \n     of marketing and advertising, with $15 billion spent \n     marketing to children in the United States in 2002, double \n     the amount spent in 1992; and\n       Whereas, the food, beverage, and restaurant industries \n     utilize multiple strategies to market their products to \n     children, including television advertising, in-school \n     marketing, the Internet, product placements, toys, books, and \n     clothes with food-brand logos, contests, celebrity and \n     cartoon spokespeople, and child targeted in-store and \n     restaurant promotions; and\n       Whereas, children view an estimated 40,000 commercials each \n     year, 50 percent of which advertise food products--most often \n     products that are high in calories, fats, sugars, and salt, \n     with almost no references to fruits or vegetables. Children \n     watch an average of one food commercial every five minutes of \n     television viewing time, and as many as three hours of food \n     commercials each week. Latino and African-American children \n     are exposed to more television food advertising than other \n     children; and\n       Whereas, in-school marketing of food and beverages has \n     become increasingly prevalent in recent years and includes: \n     (1) product sales, including sales through vending machines, \n     a la carte, snack bars, soft drink ``pouring-rights'' \n     agreements through exclusive contracts, branded fast food, \n     and fundraisers; (2) direct advertising, such as food and \n     beverage ads in schools; and (3) indirect advertising, such \n     as corporate-sponsored educational programs, sports team \n     sponsorships, and incentive programs using contests and \n     coupons; and\n       Whereas, the majority of the foods and beverages sold in \n     school vending machines and school stores are calorically \n     dense and low in nutrients, which promotes purchasing and \n     consumption of these foods while children are away from their \n     parents in a captive environment that is supposed to be \n     dedicated to education; and\n       Whereas, studies show that food advertising and marketing \n     result in more favorable attitudes, preferences, and \n     behaviors among children towards the advertised products and \n     that children's food preferences and food purchase requests \n     for high sugar and high fat foods are influenced by \n     television exposure to food advertising; and\n       Whereas, parents face increasing strain between their \n     desire to feed their children well and the intense marketing \n     of high calorie, low-nutrition food and beverages to their \n     children; and\n       Whereas, in 2003, the World Health Organization concluded \n     that the extensive marketing to children of fast food and \n     high calorie, micronutrient-poor foods and beverages is a \n     probable causal factor for the accelerating global trend \n     in weight gain obesity; and\n       Whereas, children are particularly vulnerable to marketing \n     of unhealthy foods and beverages because children under the \n     age of 4 or 5 years cannot distinguish between television \n     programming and advertisements, and children age 8 and under \n     are unable to comprehend the persuasive intent and biased \n     nature of advertising, making advertising to young children \n     fundamentally unfair: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the Congress and the President of the \n     United States to require the Federal Trade Commission to (1) \n     develop and implement nutrition standards for foods and \n     beverages that are acceptable to advertise or market to \n     children, including foods and beverages that make a positive \n     contribution to children's diets and health by being moderate \n     in portion size, calories, saturated fat, trans fat, refined \n     sugars, and sodium, and provide key nutrients and (2) \n     prohibit advertising and marketing of foods and beverages \n     that do not meet those standards through broadcast, print, \n     Internet, or other marketing venues for which a significant \n     portion of the audience is children; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the Congress \n     and the President of the United States to require the Federal \n     Communications Commission to ensure that equal time is given \n     during television programs that have a significant youth \n     audience to encourage fruit and vegetable consumption and \n     physical activity, and discourage consumption of low nutrient \n     foods and beverages. These messages must be produced and \n     delivered by individuals and organizations that have no \n     financial interest in the message; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the Congress \n     and the President of the United States to fund new and \n     existing media campaigns to promote healthy eating and \n     physical activity, such as the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention's VERB campaign and the National 5 A Day \n     program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of \n     Health to fund research studies to further assess the effects \n     of food and beverage advertising and marketing on the diets \n     and health of children and adolescents; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature calls on food and beverage \n     companies, restaurants, retail\n\n[[Page S10698]]\n\n     stores, advertising agencies, sports and entertainment \n     industries, and print, broadcast, and Web-based media \n     operating in California to adhere to a voluntary code of \n     practice, developed by experts, that would contain guidelines \n     and standards for responsible food and beverage advertising \n     and marketing aimed at children; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Majority Leader of the Senate, and each Senator and \n     Representative from California in Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-518. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to property \n     in the Waikane Valley, Hawaii; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 212\n\n       Whereas, Waikane Valley contains undeveloped land in the \n     ahupuaa of Waikane on Oahu's windward side; and\n       Whereas, 33 years ago, the United States Marine Corps \n     obtained 187 acres in Waikane Valley, commonly referred to as \n     the ``Waikane Training Area,'' for military jungle and live \n     ordnance training; and\n       Whereas, the United States Marine Corps has announced its \n     intention to close the Waikane Training Area, but as recently \n     as last year, the United States Marine Corps has sought to \n     use Waikane Valley for more military jungle training; and\n       Whereas, ironically, Waikane Valley was abandoned as a \n     training site by the United States Marine Corps because of \n     safety concerns over the use of high explosive anti-tank and \n     bazooka rounds used in the past and the insufficient data to \n     determine the exact number of ammunition rounds fired in the \n     valley; and\n       Whereas, the United States Marine Corps originally obtained \n     the right to use the Waikane Training Area by a lease from \n     the McCandless Estate and Waiahole Water Company in 1953 and \n     subsequently by a lease from the same parties and the heirs \n     of John Kamaka; and\n       Whereas, the Kamaka heirs acquired title to the Waikane \n     Training Area by quitclaim deed in June of 1972 and \n     terminated the lease with the United States Marine Corps in \n     1976; and\n       Whereas, between 1976 and 1993, the United States Marine \n     Corps conducted several investigations and ordnance removal \n     efforts on the property and concluded that the Waikane \n     Training Area could never be certified as being clear of \n     ordnance; and\n       Whereas, the United States Navy and Marine Corps acquired \n     title to the Waikane Training Area in 1993 by condemnation as \n     a means to address the problem of not being able to fulfill \n     their lease obligations to return the property to the Kamaka \n     heirs in an ordnance-free and safe condition; and\n       Whereas, land in Hawaii, and particularly agricultural and \n     conservation land, is Hawaii's most precious and limited \n     resource; and\n       Whereas, Waikane Valley has served historically as \n     important agricultural area for the island of Oahu and \n     contains precious archaeological and historic sites; and\n       Whereas, regardless of the 1993 condemnation, members of \n     the Waikane community believe that the United States Marine \n     Corps should live up to their commitment of cleaning up the \n     land, and they have expressed their desire to have the \n     Waikane Training Area restored to a condition that will \n     permit them to return to the aina and engage in farming and \n     other agricultural activities that would be appropriate based \n     on the condition of the remediated property; and\n       Whereas, the federal government and military have \n     previously demonstrated their will and capacity to honor \n     their obligations to remediate and restore other equally or \n     more severely contaminated installations upon closure under \n     the Formerly Used Defense Site Program, Defense Environmental \n     Restoration Program, Installation Restoration Program, other \n     Department of Defense initiatives and programs, and with \n     special appropriations from Congress; and\n       Whereas, the current official position of United States \n     Department of Defense is that no ordnance-contaminated site \n     can ever be certified as being clear of unexploded ordnance; \n     and\n       Whereas, based on the inability to certify the Waikane \n     Training Area as being clear of unexploded ordnance, the \n     United States Navy and Marine Corps are considering permanent \n     closure of the property to the general public by erecting a \n     security fence around the area; and\n       Whereas, the permanent closure of the Waikane Training Area \n     would be a devastating loss of precious agricultural, \n     historical, cultural, and natural resources to Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, with sufficient funding from existing restoration \n     programs or special appropriations from Congress, or both, \n     the United States Navy and Marine Corps have the means to \n     clean-up the Waikane Training Area to a condition that is \n     reasonably safe for certain restricted uses, provided long-\n     term monitoring and guidelines are established: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-Second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the federal government is \n     requested to conduct a thorough evaluation of the condition \n     of the Waikane Training Area, particularly with regard to \n     environmental and ordnance-related hazards that exist on the \n     property;

\n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is requested to \n     conduct a post-clean-up environmental assessment of the \n     Waikane Training Area evaluating the potential risks to human \n     health and safety, for the purpose of determining the types \n     of uses and activities that could appropriately be conducted \n     on the property with minimal risk to potential users and the \n     community at large;

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to federal Section 8 \n     funding; to the Committee on Baking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 185\n\n       Whereas, since established in 1974, the Section 8 housing \n     assistance program has been an integral part of one of our \n     nation's most important social goals, that of providing \n     housing opportunities for low-income families, the elderly \n     and the disabled; and\n       Whereas, today, the Section 8 housing voucher program is \n     the principal federal housing assistance program for low-\n     income household, helping 2 million families across the \n     country to secure modest, decent housing in the private \n     housing market; and\n       Whereas, the 2005 federal budget proposes to reduce Section \n     8 voucher funding by $1 billion below the 2004 level, and \n     also proposes radical changes in the program's structure that \n     would leave Section 8 vulnerable to further reductions in \n     federal funding over time; and\n       Whereas, in 2005, the proposed cuts could reduce the number \n     of families currently assisted nationwide by 250,000, and the \n     funding currently projected by this Administration could \n     eventually reduce the number of vouchers by 600,000 in 2009; \n     and\n       Whereas, in New Jersey alone, the existing 64,160 Section 8 \n     housing vouchers could be reduced by 7,780 in 2005, and by \n     18,660 in 2009; and\n       Whereas, given these circumstances, it is fitting and \n     proper for this House to respectfully urge Congress and \n     President George W. Bush not to reduce funding for the \n     Section 8 program, as thousands of families in New Jersey and \n     nationwide depend on Section 8 in order to secure affordable \n     housing and avoid homelessness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House urges Congress and President George W. Bush \n     to fully fund the Section 8 housing voucher program, in \n     recognition of the integral part this program plays in \n     providing decent and affordable housing for thousands of our \n     nation's low-income families, the elderly and the disabled.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker Of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate and \n     House of Representatives, and every member of the New Jersey \n     Congressional Delegation.\n       This Assembly resolution urges Congress and President \n     George W. Bush to fully fund the Section 8 housing assistance \n     program.\n       The proposed 2005 federal budget reduces funding for this \n     program by $1 billion below 2004 levels. According to the \n     Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and housing advocates \n     across the country, this reduction could lead to a decrease \n     of 250,000 vouchers from the current 2 million in use \n     nationwide. Furthermore, the budget proposes a transformation \n     of the Section 8 program from a so-called ``unit-based'' to a \n     ``dollar-based'' funding system, which would leave the \n     program vulnerable to further reductions in federal funding \n     over the years. It is estimated that these changes could \n     further reduce the number of vouchers nationwide by 30% in \n     2009, a reduction of 600,000 vouchers below 2004 levels.\n       In New Jersey alone, the 2005 cuts could reduce the current \n     64,160 vouchers by 7,780, and further reductions could lead \n     to an 18,660 decrease in 2009.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-523.

These public \n     transportation routes include access to public and private \n     facilities, including boat ramps and marinas. Thousands of \n     people use the canals each year; and\n       Whereas, with no dredging of the Gibraltar canals since the \n     late 1950s, the use of the canals is today significantly \n     threatened by the buildup of sediment throughout the system. \n     Boating traffic is hampered by the buildup. The task of \n     dealing with the Gibraltar canals is made more complex by the \n     results of testing that has identified contamination in the \n     sediment. This fact will greatly increase the costs of \n     dredging and disposal of the sediment; and\n       Whereas, the costs of dredging the canals is far beyond the \n     resources available within the community of Gibraltar, and \n     the canals are available to and used by many more people than \n     residents of Gibraltar. This work clearly needs to be \n     completed. The Gibraltar canals are notable components of the \n     Detroit River system, and maintaining the quality of the \n     canals is work that is strongly related to the quality of \n     this vital part of our water transportation network. It is \n     essential that necessary resources be directed to this task: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to provide funding for the dredging of canals around \n     the city of Gibraltar; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-524.

The General Assembly urges the President and Congress of \n     the United States to allow the states to require that cable \n     television companies shall not receive consent to operate in \n     their municipalities or franchise territories, at issuance or \n     renewal of that consent, until a cable television company \n     has:\n       a. certified that there is another cable television company \n     operating in the municipality; or\n       b. designated channels for commercial use as set forth in \n     47 U.S.C. s.532 and has leased two-thirds or more of the \n     channels required to be set aside to persons unaffiliated \n     with the cable television company; or\n       c. implemented an open video system in accordance with 47 \n     U.S.C. s.573, where ``open video system'' means a facility \n     consisting of a set of transmission paths and associated \n     signal generation, reception, and control equipment that is \n     designed to provide cable service which includes video \n     programming which is provided to multiple subscribers within \n     a community and which has been certified by the Federal \n     Communications Commission as being in compliance with Part 76 \n     ``Multichannel Video and Cable Television Service'' of Title \n     47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested to by the \n     Clerk thereof, shall be transmitted to the President of the \n     United States, the presiding officers of the United States \n     Senate and House of Representatives, and to each member of \n     Congress elected from this State.\n       This Assembly resolution urges the President and Congress \n     of the United States to allow the states to require that \n     cable television companies shall not receive consent to \n     operate in their municipalities or franchise territories at \n     issuance or renewal of that consent until a cable television \n     company has: certified that there is another cable television \n     company operating in the municipality or territory; or \n     designated channels for commercial use as set forth in 47 \n     U.S.C. s.532 and has leased two-thirds or more of the \n     channels required to be set aside to persons unaffiliated \n     with the cable television company; or implemented an open \n     video system in accordance with 47 U.S.C. s.573.\n       The leased commercial access provisions of 47 U.S.C. s.532 \n     require a television cable company to designate channel \n     capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the \n     cable television company. Smaller companies must designate 10 \n     percent of their channel capacity and larger companies must \n     designate 15 percent of their channel capacity. Channels \n     designated for public, educational, or governmental use may \n     not satisfy the requirement for leased commercial access \n     channels. If the designated channels are not leased, the \n     television cable company may continue to use them for its own \n     programming. Consumers do not receive a separate charge for \n     the programming on leased commercial access channels. An \n     example of leased commercial access channel use would be an \n     ``informercial'' channel.\n       In an open access video system, as established in 47 U.S.C. \n     s.573, the operator of an open video system is released from \n     certain federal regulatory burdens in exchange for opening up \n     one-third of its activated channel capacity to bidding by \n     those who wish to contract for carriage of specific video \n     programming on an open video system. Consumers would have the \n     choice to receive and pay for this specific video \n     programming.\n       The states' ability to regulate these aspects of the cable \n     television industry will lead to greater competition and will \n     encourage the availability of a wider array of ideas and \n     information, better rates, and improved services for New \n     Jersey consumers.\n       POM-525. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to the Marshall Islands \n     Nuclear Claims Tribunal; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n       Whereas, fifty years ago on March 1, 1954, at 6:45 a.m., \n     the United States of America tested the ``Bravo'' hydrogen \n     bomb on Bikini Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, \n     resulting in an explosion that is now acknowledged as by far \n     the most destructive nuclear detonation ever; and\n       Whereas, scientists involved in the test known as ``Bravo'' \n     have maintained that they expected a yield equivalent to five \n     megatons; and\n       Whereas, the ``Bravo'' bomb actually yielded 15 megatons, \n     or a thousand times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb; \n     and\n       Whereas, while U.S. servicemen on Rongerik Atoll were \n     evacuated within hours of the blast, Marshallese residents of \n     Utirik and Rongelap, all within the hazardous range of the \n     explosion, were left on their contaminated islands for at \n     least a day longer, resulting in their exposure to \n     significant radiation; and\n       Whereas, the men, women, and children of these atolls were \n     already suffering burns and loss of hair at the time of their \n     removal from their homes; and\n       Whereas, 23 crewmembers of the Japanese fishing boat, Lucky \n     Dragon, were also exposed to severe radiation from Bravo; and\n       Whereas, a total of 67 nuclear tests were conducted in \n     Bikini and Enewetak between 1946 and 1958, exposing the \n     people of the Marshall Islands to severe health problems and \n     genetic anomalies during the tests and for generations to \n     come; and\n       Whereas, if one were to calculate the net yield of all the \n     tests conducted in the Marshall Islands, it would be \n     equivalent to the detonation of 1.7 Hiroshima bombs every day \n     for 12 years; and\n       Whereas, Enewetak Atoll served as ground zero for 43 tests \n     including the first-ever hydrogen device, resulting in the \n     loss of eight percent of their land, and even after a massive \n     cleanup program by the United States, the Marshallese have no \n     safe access to more than 57 percent of their land; and\n       Whereas, the people of Enewetak were exiled from their home \n     for more than 33 years in spite of assurances from U.S. \n     officials that they would be repatriated in three to five \n     years after their original removal in 1946; and\n       Whereas, similar promises made to Bikini residents forced \n     the surrender of their land supposedly for the ``betterment \n     of mankind''; and\n       Whereas, on advice from the United States, the people of \n     Bikini were repatriated in 1967 only to be evacuated seven \n     years later when high levels of radionuclides were discovered \n     in their bodies; and\n       Whereas, the people of Rongelap and Utirik were returned \n     prematurely to their atolls and received additional exposure, \n     causing many to believe that they were used to study the \n     effects of radiation on human being as contemplated in the \n     Atomic Energy Commission's now infamous Project 4.1; and\n       Whereas, recently declassified information contains strong \n     indications that human experimentation using the people of \n     the exposed atolls was indeed part of the nuclear testing \n     program in the Marshall Islands; and\n       Whereas, in its Compact of Free Association (Compact), the \n     United States of America accepts the responsibility for \n     compensation owing to the citizens of the Marshall Islands . \n     . . for loss or damage to property and person . . . resulting \n     from the nuclear testing program which the Government of the \n     United States conducted in the Northern Marshall Islands \n     between June 30, 1946 and August 18, 1959'': and\n       Whereas, the pertinent provisions of the Compact were \n     negotiated based on limited and misleading information \n     provided by the United States Government to the Marshallese \n     representatives, a fact exposed only recently in material \n     declassified by the United States and acknowledged by their \n     officials; and\n       Whereas, the funds provided under the Compact agreement are \n     grossly inadequate to provide for health care and \n     environmental monitoring, personal injury claims, or land and \n     property damage; and\n       Whereas, the ``changed circumstances'' provision of section \n     177 of the Compact provides that if the agreement on nuclear \n     matters is manifestly inadequate to meet the technological \n     and financial requirements anticipated during the \n     negotiations, or if new information emerges which renders \n     those agreements insufficient for the purpose of concluding \n     full and just compensation, the Congress of the United States \n     would consider a request for proper compensation; and\n       Whereas, the Government of the Marshall Islands submitted \n     such a petition on September 11, 2000; and\n       Whereas, just compensation and continued funding for \n     promised medical and health programs for survivors of the \n     atomic tests depend upon Congress' favorable consideration of \n     this petition; and\n       Whereas, over the past 15 years Hawaii has provided \n     medical, educational, and other supportive services to lawful \n     nonimmigrants from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, \n     without reimbursement from the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the United States Congress \n     is respectfully requested to take appropriate measures to \n     provide for the compensation of awards including property \n     damage claims, to the fullest extent, as determined by the \n     Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal, and to provide for \n     the costs of cleaning up nuclear sites in the Marshall \n     Islands; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature expresses deep regret for \n     the nuclear testing legacy which the people of the Marshall \n     Islands\n\n[[Page S10701]]\n\n     have inherited, and hereby requests the Governor to declare \n     March 1 as a Day of Remembrance for the survivors of the \n     United States nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, President of the United States Senate, Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, Governor of Hawaii, \n     Speaker of the Marshall Islands Nitijela, and Mayor of Bikini \n     Atoll.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-526. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to gasoline types; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 272\n\n       Whereas, while there are many factors that are contributing \n     to the recent swift rise in pump prices for gasoline, a \n     significant element is the number of gasoline types \n     refineries must produce to meet environmental standards of \n     various metropolitan regions across the country. Over the \n     years, federal mandates to improve air quality in areas with \n     problems have resulted in a complicated patchwork of fuel \n     requirements. The Large number of fuels is also the result of \n     the strategies individual states have developed to meet \n     federal standards; and\n       Whereas, while the goals of cleaner air are important \n     challenges that must be met, it seems inefficient on many \n     levels for refineries to have to develop, produce, and \n     deliver so many different types of gasoline. In the Midwest \n     alone, at least seven types of fuel must be made. The impact \n     of these requirements is to raise costs, delay production, \n     disrupt distribution, and reduce the supply. These problems, \n     as Michigan has learned all too well, become far more severe \n     when any unforeseen events, such as a gasoline pipeline \n     accident or a refinery fire, take place; and\n       Whereas, although the ultimate goal of a single gasoline \n     type for the entire country at any given time may not be \n     attainable because of the enormous variations in geographical \n     and climatic conditions across America, requiring the country \n     to sharply reduce the number of gasoline types can bring \n     great benefits. In addition, using cleaner fuels may enhance \n     air quality not only in ozone nonattainment areas, but \n     everywhere: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     issue of the number of gasoline types refined across the \n     country and to enact legislation that will sharply reduce the \n     number of gasoline types required to meet local environmental \n     standards; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-527.

A bill to establish the Food Safety Administration to \nprotect the public health by preventing food-borne illness, ensuring \nthe safety of food intended for human consumption, improving research \non contaminants leading to food-borne illness, and improving security \nof food from intentional contamination; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when Americans sit down at the dinner \ntable, their confidence in the safety of the food they are eating is \nbased in part on the knowledge that the Federal Government is working \nhard to ensure their food is not contaminate. Right now, our food is \nthe safest in the world, but there are widening gaps in our food safety \nnet due to emerging threats and the fact that food safety oversight has \nevolved over time to spread over several government agencies. This \nmismatched, piecemeal approach to food safety could spell disaster if \nwe do not act quickly and decisively.\n  A single food safety agency with authority based on sound scientific \nprinciples would provide this country with the greatest hope of \nreducing foodborne illnesses and preparing for a bioterrorist attack on \nour food supply.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that \nas many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year. Of \nthose individuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized, and more \nthan 5,000 will die. Factors such as emerging pathogens, an aging \npopulation at high risk for foodborne illnesses, an increasing volume \nof food imports, and people eating outside their homes more often \nunderscore the need for us to take charge and shed the old bureaucratic \nshackles that have tied us to the overlapping and inefficient ad hoc \nfood safety system of the past.\n  I rise today to introduce the Safe Food Act of 2004. This legislation \nwould create a single, independent Federal\n\n[[Page S10705]]\n\nfood safety agency to administer all aspects of Federal food safety \ninspections, enforcement, standards-setting and research in order to \nprotect public health. The components of the agencies now charged with \nprotecting the food supply, primarily housed at the Food and Drug \nAdministration and the Agriculture Department, would be transferred to \nthis new agency.\n  The new Food Safety Administrator would be responsible for the safety \nof the food supply and would carry out that charge by implementing the \nregistration and recordkeeping requirements of the Bioterrorism Act of \n2002; ensuring slaughterhouses and food processing plants have \nprocedures in place to prevent and reduce food contamination; regularly \ninspecting domestic food facilities, with inspection frequency based on \nrisk; and centralizing the authority to detain, seize, condemn and \nrecall food that is adulterated or misbranded. The Administrator would \nbe charged with requiring food producers to make it possible for their \nproducts to be traced in the event of a foodborne illness outbreak in \norder to minimize the health impact of such an event.\n  The Administrator would also have the power to examine the food \nsafety practices of foreign countries and work with the states to \nenforce food safety laws, including the ability to seek various civil \nand criminal penalties for serious violations of the food safety laws. \nThe Administrator would also actively oversee public education and \nresearch programs on foodborne illness.\n  In this era of limited budgets, it is our responsibility to \nstreamline the Federal food safety system. The United States simply \ncannot afford to continue operating multiple redundant systems. This is \nnot about more regulation, a super agency, or increased bureaucracy. It \nis about common sense and the more effective marshaling of our existing \nresources.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2913. A bill to establish a demonstration project to train \nunemployed workers for employment as health care professionals, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, over the past year, I have come to this \nfloor on a number of occasions to discuss the loss of manufacturing \njobs in Wisconsin and around the country and ways in which I think that \nCongress should act to stem the flow of these jobs to foreign \ncountries.\n  According to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, \nWisconsin has lost more than 80,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000. \nNationally, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country \nhas lost more than 2.8 million manufacturing jobs during that same time \nperiod. In addition to the loss of manufacturing jobs, I am deeply \ntroubled by the Bush administration's contention that the outsourcing \nof American service sector and other jobs is good for the economy. I am \nconcerned about the message that this policy sends to Wisconsinites and \nall Americans who are currently employed in these sectors.\n  There is something of a silver lining to the looming cloud of \nmanufacturing and other jobs loss: the country's workforce development \nsystem.\n  In spite of stretched resources and long waiting lists for services, \nour workforce development boards are making a tremendous effort to \nretrain laid-off workers and other job seekers for new jobs. And this \neffort is clearly evident in Wisconsin, where my State's 11 workforce \ndevelopment boards are leading the way in finding innovative solutions \nto retraining workers for new careers on shoestring budgets.\n  I strongly support the work of these agencies, and have urged the \nadministration and Senate appropriators to provide adequate funding for \nthe job training programs authorized by the Workforce Investment Act. I \nregret that the administration's budget request for fiscal year 2005 \ndoes not provide adequate funding for WIA, and I will continue to work \nto ensure that the workforce development boards in my State and across \nour country receive the resources that they need to help job seekers \nget the training they need to be successful.\n  I am committed to finding resources to retrain those who have been \nlaid off from the manufacturing and service sectors and who wish to \nfind new jobs in high-demand fields such as health care.\n  As most of my colleagues know all too well, we are facing a \nsignificant shortage of health care workers. Congress has made some \nprogress in addressing the nursing shortage, but we need to expand our \nefforts. Shortages of health professionals pose a real threat to the \nhealth of our communities by impacting access to timely, high-quality \nhealth care. Studies have shown that shortages of nurses in our \nhospitals and health facilities increase medical errors, which directly \naffects patient health.\n  As our population ages, and the baby-boomers need more health care, \nour need for all types of health professionals is only going to \nincrease. This is particularly true for the field of long-term care. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are going to need an \nadditional 1.2 million nursing aides, home health aides, and other \nhealth professionals in long-term care before the year 2010.\n  As our demand for health care workers grows, so does the number of \njobs available within this sector. Currently, health services is the \nlargest industry in the country, providing 12.9 million jobs in 2002. \nIt is estimated that 16 percent of all new jobs created between 2002 \nand 2012 will be in health services. This accounts for 3.5 million new \njobs--more than any other industry.\n  Workforce development agencies in my home State of Wisconsin are \nalready working to support displaced workers in their communities by \ntraining them for health care jobs, since there is a real need for \nworkers in these fields. These agencies are helping communities get and \nmaintain access to high-quality health care by ensuring that there are \nenough health care workers to care for their communities.\n  As the executive director of one of the workforce development boards \nin my State put it, ``[t]here are simply not many good quality jobs to \nreplace manufacturing jobs lost to rural communities. The medical \nprofessions, by offering a `living wage' and good benefits, provide an \nexcellent alternative to manufacturing for sustaining a higher, family-\noriented standard of living.''\n  I believe we need to support our communities in these efforts by \nproviding them with the resources they need to establish, sustain, or \nexpand these important programs. For that reason, today I am \nintroducing the Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act. This bill \nwould amend the Workforce Investment Act to authorize a demonstration \nproject to provide grants to community-based coalitions, led by local \nworkforce development boards, to create programs to retrain unemployed \nworkers who wish to obtain new jobs in the health care professions. My \nbill would authorize a total of $25 million for grants between $100,000 \nand $500,000, and, in the interest of fiscal responsibility, it ensures \nthat these grants would be offset.\n  This bill will help provide communities with the resources they need \nto run retraining programs for the health professions. The funds could \nbe used for a variety of purposes--from increasing the capacity of our \nschools and training facilities, to providing financial and social \nsupport for workers who are in retraining programs. This bill is \nflexible in what the grant funds could be used for, because I believe \nthat communities know best about the resources they need to run an \nefficient program.\n  This bill represents a nexus in my efforts to support workers whose \njobs have been shipped overseas and to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to the high-quality health care that they deserve. By providing \ntargeted assistance to train laid-off workers who wish to obtain new \njobs in the health care sector, we can both help unemployed Americans \nand improve the availability and quality of health care that is \navailable in our communities.\n  I am pleased that this bill is supported by a variety of \norganizations that are committed to providing high-quality job training \nand health care services, including: the National Association of \nWorkforce Boards, the American Health Care Association, the Wisconsin \nAssociation of Job Training Executives, Northwest Wisconsin \nConcentrated Employment Program, the\n\n[[Page S10706]]\n\nNorthwest Wisconsin Workforce Investment Board, and the Southwestern \nWisconsin Workforce Development Board.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill, and the text \nof the letters of support from the above-mentioned groups, be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  In order to ensure that our workers are able to compete in the new \neconomy, we must ensure that they have the tools they need to be \ntrained or retrained for high-demand jobs such as those in the health \ncare field. My bill is a small step toward providing the resources \nnecessary to achieve this goal. I will continue to work to strengthen \nthe American manufacturing sector and to support those workers who have \nbeen displaced due to bad trade agreements and other policies that have \nled to the loss of American jobs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: This letter is in regards to your \n     bill, the Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act, which \n     seeks to establish a demonstration project to train \n     unemployed workers for employment as health care \n     professionals. The National Association of Workforce Boards \n     (NAWB) would like to support your efforts in linking \n     America's workforce investment boards with health care \n     training. Our members can be a valuable resource in the \n     transition of manufacturing workers to the numerous \n     employment opportunities in the health care field.\n       NAWB is the national association that represents the \n     interests of the 650 workforce investment boards across the \n     country. These boards consist of over 15,000 private sector\n\n[[Page S10707]]\n\n     business leaders, appointed by their Governors and local \n     elected officials, who provide leadership and governance for \n     the public workforce development system. In existence since \n     1979, NANWB has been a leader in the effort to create a \n     public workforce system. that is responsive to businesses and \n     job seekers alike.\n       As you know, meeting the ever-increasing needs of America's \n     workers and employers is critical for prosperity in the \n     United States. Developing an educated and skilled workforce \n     to attract and retain business is a challenge facing all \n     communities. The growing education and workforce skills \n     mismatch between what the current American workforce offers \n     and what employers need is particularly acute in high-skill \n     industry sectors. However, these are the very industries that \n     hold the most economic promise for our current workers and \n     the emerging workforce, our nation's young people. The \n     challenge posed for policy makers is aligning America's \n     workforce with rapidly changing economic conditions and \n     opportunities, while simultaneously maintaining \n     competitiveness to minimize off-shoring.\n       Four of five U.S. manufacturers struggled to find \n     candidates for skilled jobs, according to a 2003 survey by \n     the National Association of Manufacturers. Ironically, this \n     search for skilled workers occurred while many plants were \n     going thorough layoffs. The United States has seen 3 million \n     manufacturing jobs disappear.\n       Workers have permanently lost the jobs they once held at \n     these factories. New opportunities must be made to allow a \n     transition into new employment, especially for those who \n     cannot recover their job if demand increases. But in order to \n     do this, training dollars must be made available to those \n     employees who cannot regain employment within the \n     manufacturing industry.\n       Through your bill, employers in the health care industry \n     that desperately need skilled workers can find the human \n     capital they desire in those who have been permanently laid \n     off from their manufacturing job. There has been an enormous \n     increase in the number of nursing and direct care \n     professional opportunities within the long-term care arena, \n     particularly within home-based care. These opportunities are \n     not only based on the number of employees needed. They \n     require a high level of skill, knowledge and compassion to \n     work in long-term care. Training dollars must be available to \n     introduce educated employees to the health care industry.\n       Employers on the lay-off end of manufacturing employment \n     and employers on the hiring end of health care industries \n     need to tap all available employment and training resources. \n     NAWB can assist both sides of the equation by connecting \n     employers with their local workforce boards. Investing in \n     training our workers is critical.\n       Our CEO, Ms. Stephanie Powers, is available to provide your \n     staff with any information you may require (phone: (202) 775-\n     0960 or email: powerss@nawb.org). Thank you for your interest \n     in our organization and the members we represent. The \n     National Association of Workforce Boards remains committed to \n     working with Congress as we continue our mission to build a \n     stronger, more competitive American workforce.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. Michael Zelley,\n       President, The Disability Network, Flint, MI, and Co-Chair, \n     Policy Committee, National Association of Workforce Boards.\n     Jeffrey Howe,\n       Vice President, Manager, Indiana Commercial Banking, First \n     Indiana Bank, N.A., Indianapolis, IN, and Chair, National \n     Association of Workforce Boards.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Health Care Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2004.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: On behalf of the American Health \n     Care Association, the nation's largest association of long \n     term care providers, and the National Center for Assisted \n     Living, I am writing you to offer our support for enactment \n     of the ``Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act'' you are \n     introducing.\n       Today, there is a critical shortage of health and long term \n     care professionals and paraprofessionals and it is growing. \n     In our nation's nursing facilities, there is a need for more \n     than 90,000 nurses and certified nursing assistants right now \n     to provide the hands-on care needed by the frail and elderly. \n     The need for these direct care workers will grow dramatically \n     in the future as the baby boom population moves into \n     retirement. America's high standard for quality can only be \n     maintained if there are enough front-line workers to provide \n     the direct hands-on care that will be needed. This is not a \n     job that can be handled off-shore.\n       Your legislation will help to address this shortage by \n     providing the means for a growing number of displaced \n     manufacturing and service sector workers to begin building \n     new careers in the health and long term care sectors. It does \n     so by utilizing federal dollars to redirect these displaced \n     workers into health care careers. It provides for expanding \n     the nation's training capacity and by increasing number of \n     educators that are and will be needed to make this transition \n     successful.\n       Senator Feingold, we commend you for the leadership you are \n     providing with the introduction of this legislation and look \n     forward to working with you to see this legislation passed \n     and enacted at the earliest opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Hal Daub,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Wisconsin Association of\n\n\n                                      Job Training Executives,\n\n                                                  August 10, 2004.\n     Senator Russ Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: On behalf of the Wisconsin \n     Association of Job Training Executives (WAJTE), I am writing \n     to express our strong support for the proposed legislation \n     designed to address two significant workforce issues--the \n     loss of large numbers of manufacturing and service sector \n     jobs and the critical shortage of health care professionals. \n     As you know, both of these issues currently challenge the \n     workforce development delivery systems in Wisconsin.\n       Our association members are the chief executives of each of \n     Wisconsin's eleven Workforce Development Boards who have the \n     responsibility for overseeing the health of the local \n     economies in partnership with business, education, and local \n     governments. The proposed legislation offers these specific \n     strengths.\n       Ensures that eligible entities shall be a partnership under \n     the direction of a local board.\n       Limits grant funds to training programs for health care \n     professionals.\n       Allows for the use of grant funds for support services as \n     well as training.\n       Allows for capacity expansion in educational institutions.\n       If WAJTE members can be of assistance to you as this \n     legislation is introduced, please do not hesitate to contact \n     us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Francisco Sanchez,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                     CEP--WIB,\n\n                                  Ashland, WI, September 30, 2004.\n     Senator Russ Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: On behalf of the Northwest Wisconsin \n     Concentrated Employment Program, Inc. and the Northwest \n     Wisconsin Workforce Investment Board, Inc., I want to express \n     our enthusiastic support in the Community-Based Health Care \n     Retraining Act in Wisconsin.\n       This initiative will help to strengthen the economy of our \n     area. Some of our counties in Northwest Wisconsin are \n     experiencing high labor shortages particularly in the health \n     care industries. Further, our area wages are approximately \n     24% less than the State average, which adds to a poverty \n     situation made worse by rural isolation. This Community-Based \n     Health Care Retraining Act will address these serious \n     economic issues and help to alleviate the severe shortage of \n     health care workers.\n       This Act provides hope for the future economy and people of \n     our State. Please contact me if we can be of any further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Fred Schnook,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Southwest Wisconsin\n\n\n                                  Workforce Development Board,\n\n                                   Dodgeville, WI, August 4, 2004.\n     Hon. Russ Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I would like to take this \n     opportunity to comment on your proposed legislation regarding \n     health-care retraining. I believe it is an excellent proposal \n     that will address a serious need particularly within rural \n     communities. Please allow me to elaborate on several points \n     that support this legislation.\n       First, as executive director for a primarily rural \n     workforce development area, I can tell you how difficult it \n     is to replace manufacturing jobs. There simply are not many \n     good quality jobs to replace manufacturing jobs lost to rural \n     communities. The medical professions, by offering a ``living \n     wage'' and good benefits, provide an excellent alternative to \n     manufacturing for sustaining a higher, family-oriented \n     standard of living. Health-care is also a regional scope, \n     providing job opportunities for workers in surrounding \n     communities. Furthermore, medical professions are not \n     exportable and there is virtually no chance that health-care \n     jobs will be shipped out-of-country or overseas.\n       Second, I am chairperson of a small, rural community \n     hospital. For many years we have struggled to survive in a \n     very competitive market surrounded by large, corporate \n     medical organizations/hospitals in Janesville and Madison. I \n     believe that our hospital has a unique role within our \n     community--as a community-based facility we are closer to our \n     patients and can provide personalized ``hometown'' care. One \n     of our biggest problems is our ability to attract and retain \n     qualified, experienced health-care workers. With the \n     impending shortage caused by the retirement of ``baby \n     boomers'' we will find ourselves in an even more difficult \n     role as larger facilities offer higher salaries, better \n     benefits, incentive and sign-on bonuses, etc. to attract and \n     retain the workers they need. Rural hospitals will find \n     themselves left out and unable to compete for the caregivers \n     we need.\n       Third, there are several key organizations that lie at the \n     core of any community that\n\n[[Page S10708]]\n\n     are vital to the quality of life within that community. \n     Schools are one example of this type of organizations. \n     Hospitals, nursing homes and other types of medical \n     facilities are other examples of key organizations that \n     support a higher standard of life within a rural community.\n       And finally, I would like to thank the Senator for \n     recognizing the vital role that Workforce Development Boards \n     (WDBs) play in our areas. The WDBs are regional organizations \n     providing oversight and coordination for economic and \n     workforce development activities. Furthermore, there are few \n     organizations today that are advocates for the ``worker''. I \n     believe that WDBs are an example of such an organization. \n     And, I believe it is critical to the success of a program \n     that the WDBs serve as the coordinating agency for the \n     delivery of this type of program.\n       For the reasons stated above, I strongly support your \n     proposed Health-Care Retraining Bill. Thank you for the \n     chance to offer my comments. I look forward to the \n     opportunity to participate in, what I believe to be, a \n     meaningful and critically important program particularly for \n     the rural communities.\n       Sincerely,\n                                              Robert T. Borremans,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI:\n  S. 2914. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Common \nSense Automobile Affordability Act Of 2004''. My colleagues from \nMaryland introduced a similar bill in the House. I believe in energy \nconservation. I also believe in job conservation. We can improve the \nfuel efficiency of our cars without sticking a knife through the hearts \nof our Nation's auto workers. That is what I am going to keep standing \nup for in the U.S. Senate.\n  When I consider any energy proposal, I apply four criteria. First, \nthe proposal must achieve real savings in oil consumption. Secondly, \nthe proposal also must preserve U.S. jobs. Next, the proposal must be \nrealizable and achievable. And, lastly, it must create incentives to \nhelp companies achieve these goals.\n  I agree with the goals of energy efficient vehicle tax breaks--fuel \nefficiency and energy conservation. I believe we need to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. The U.S. imports about twenty million \nbarrels of oil a day, roughly 40 percent of that goes to fuel cars and \nlight trucks. Half of our oil is imported and a quarter of our oil is \nimported from the Persian Gulf. Reducing our dependence on foreign oil \nwould make us more flexible in the war against terror.\n  That's why I support the provisions of the energy bill that provide \nincentives for energy efficiency and fuel conservation. But, we need to \nbe more fuel efficient in a way that doesn't cost American jobs.\n  Our current tax breaks for energy efficient vehicles provides more \nhelp for foreign car manufacturers than U.S. car manufacturers. Small \ncars receive more tax breaks, and small cars are often made by foreign \nauto companies.\n  Our current tax breaks penalize U.S. automakers, because current tax \nincentives are not geared toward the SUV's or light trucks that \nAmerican consumers want and American companies make.\n  Our domestic automakers have been weakened by the current recession. \nAnd, we can't rely on foreign manufacturers to provide American jobs. \nThe United Auto Workers (UAW) has seen its membership drop \nsignificantly from 1980 through 2000 from 1.4 million members in 1980 \ndown to 670,000 today. That means that our auto workers are being left \nbehind.\n  I have seen it in Baltimore. Over 1,000 workers were recently laid \noff at the GM plant, and the plant went through another shutdown after \nslow sales. This is not just happening in Maryland. GM shut down \nfourteen of its twenty-nine North American assembly plans for at least \na week last year.\n  American workers are being laid off because, while automobile imports \nare rising, and our domestic auto share is falling, only 64 percent of \ncars bought in America are built in America. That's down from 73.9 \npercent in 1994.\n  We need common sense tax breaks that provide Americans with good \njobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and help clean up the \nenvironment.\n  That's why I'm introducing legislation that would repeal the sunsets \non existing clean vehicle tax breaks and replace the existing clean \nfuels tax breaks after 2006 with a comprehensive set of new tax credits \nof up to $4,000. These tax breaks could be used to buy energy efficient \nvehicles, including hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, diesel ``lean \nburn'' vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicles. There are also \nadditional bonuses for increased fuel conservation and fuel efficiency. \nMy bill includes incentives for all the major clean fuel technologies. \nThere are larger credits for trucks and transit buses that are often \nAmerican made.\n  I also support the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Act introduced by my colleague \nfrom North Dakota. This bill would provide research money for a \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicle tax research and development programs.\n  We can have both energy conservation and job conservation. That's \nwhat I'm fighting for. It will take innovative solutions, improved \ntechnology, and the setting of realistic, achievable goals. That's what \nmy legislation encourages. With the right incentives to increase demand \nfor cutting edge technologies, to increase U.S. manufacturing capacity \nof fuel efficient vehicles, and to provide good paying jobs for \nAmericans.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these goals and this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2914\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat distributions from an individual retirement plan, a section 401(k) \nplan, or a section 403(b) contract shall not be includible in gross \nincome to the extent used to pay long-term care insurance premiums; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to bring the Senate's attention to a \nbill I introduced today, the Long-Term Care Act of 2004.\n  Baby boomers will begin to turn 65 years old in 2010 and by 2030, all \n77 million baby boomers will have reached retirement age and the over \n65 population will have doubled. The practicality of these conditions \nwill require the Federal Government and most State governments to spend \nmore money on health care. Presently, Federal and State governments are \nspending billions of dollars to ensure the health and well being of our \nfellow citizens.\n  In one sector of the health care arena where costs are dramatically \nrising is in the area of long-term care. In 2000, spending on long-term \ncare was estimated at $123.1 billion and it is expected to triple to \n$346.1 billion by 2040. Currently, 70 percent of long-term care costs \nare spent on nursing home care. The average cost of nursing home care \nis $178 per day or $60,000 per year. That is a significant burden on \nFederal and State governments as well as the thousands of individuals \nwho pay for that care out of pocket.\n  In addition, almost 75 percent of nursing home care is publicly \nfunded. Medicaid spends about 58.7 percent on long-term care while \nMedicare spends 14.7 percent. According to the Council for Affordable \nHealth Insurance, by the year 2030, Medicaid's nursing home \nexpenditures are expected to reach $130 billion a year.\n  If more people purchased private long-term care insurance, we could \nreduce Medicaid's future institutional-care expenses by more than $40 \nbillion each year, while giving those who are insured alternatives to \nnursing homes: including home care, adult day care, foster care and \nassisted living. Congress has taken steps to give individuals more \npower to pay for their health care services such as long-term care. One \nsuch outstanding measure was the creation of Health Savings Accounts \n(HSAs).\n  Last year, I was pleased to support the passage of the Medicare \nModernization Act. This landmark legislation\n\n[[Page S10714]]\n\ncreated Health Savings Accounts, which are a new way that people can \npay for unreimbursed medical expenses such as deductibles, co-payments, \nand services not covered by insurance like long-term care. Eligible \nindividuals can establish and fund these accounts when they have a \nqualifying high deductible health plan and no other health plan, with \nsome exceptions. The beauty of these plans is that they have tax \nadvantages such as deductible contributions; tax-exempt withdrawals if \nthe individual uses the money for medical expenses; and tax-exempt \naccount earnings.\n  I am confident that with the creation of Health Savings Accounts, \nindividuals and families will be encouraged to set money aside for \ntheir health care expenses and give individuals the means to pay for \nhealth care services of their own choosing, without being constrained \nby insurers or employers. Unfortunately, Health Savings Accounts are \nrelatively new and most individuals will not have the built up funds in \ntheir HSA to pay for a number of costly health care expenses such as \nlong-term care insurance and that is why we need to provide other \noptions to help pay for this important investment.\n  Currently, thousands of Virginians and millions of Americans are \nsaving in their retirement plans to have a comfortable life once they \nbecome seniors, be it IRA, 401(k), and 403(b) accounts. These savings \nplans help prepare individuals for their future retirement or any \nunforeseen circumstance that may arise. Indeed, over 43 million \nAmericans own IRAs with total savings of $2.5 trillion, while more than \n47 million Americans have 401(k) accounts with $1.8 trillion saved. In \naddition, 6.4 million Americans have 403(b) accounts, amounting to over \n$590 billion saved.\n  These are untapped funds that individuals should be allowed to use to \nhelp pay for their future health care needs. Current tax law and some \nretirement plans allow individuals, in extreme circumstances, to \nwithdraw funds from their retirement accounts, but more often than not, \na 10 percent excise tax applies for early withdrawal. In my opinion, \nthat tax precludes the ability or desirability of individuals to \nprovide for their and their families well-being and that is why I have \nintroduced legislation to provide a new health care option to help \naddress this unfortunate circumstance.\n  My legislation, the Long-Term Care Act of 2004 will allow individuals \nto use their IRAs, 401(k), and 403(b) plans to purchase long-term care \ninsurance with pretax dollars at any age and without early withdrawal \npenalty. Under the Long-Term Care Act, the consumer has the option to \npurchase long-term care insurance at the most appropriate amounts for \ntheir own needs and their spouses.\n  Today, only six percent of Americans own a long-term care policy. One \nof the reasons behind this dismally low figure is that individuals wait \ntoo long to purchase long-term care insurance. In fact, purchasing \nlong-term care insurance at age 65 is about twice expensive as \npurchasing it age 55. That is why we must encourage individuals to plan \nfor their future health care needs and purchase long-term care \ninsurance at an early age. By purchasing long-term care insurance at a \nyounger age, individuals will be saving money in the long run and not \ndepleting their life savings.\n  Our country is heading towards a demographic melt down on long-term \ncare costs. It is simply unsustainable for individuals and the \ngovernment to maintain the current rate of spending without further \nendangering the state of health care in the United States.\n  Preparing for future costs of health care is something that every \nAmerican should be doing. Long-term care insurance is one way for \nAmericans to plan for periods of extended disability without burdening \ntheir families, going bankrupt or relying on government assistance.\n  Every American should be preparing for future health care costs and \nit is important that we encourage people to take responsibility today \nfor those costs, be it with the purchase of long-term care insurance or \ninvestment in a Health Savings Account. If Virginians and Americans \nfail to act, it will result in an increased and unsustainable financial \nburden on the Federal Government and taxpayers.\n  My legislation, the Long-Term Care Act of 2004, is a commonsense \napproach that will encourage individuals to plan for their future \nhealth care needs and help make long-term care insurance more \naffordable. While this may not be the solution for some people, it is \nanother option for the millions of Virginians and Americans to help \nprovide for their health and well-being or the health and well-being of \nloved ones. I look forward to the Senate's action on this legislation \nearly on in the 109th Congress because it not only encourages Americans \nto plan for their future health needs but will also help sustain the \nviability of our Nation's health care system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2919. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfunding for Indian tribal prison facilities, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a crisis \noccurring today in Indian country--and offer a solution. This crisis is \nnot something new. It has been decades in the making. For too long we \nhave neglected to adequately address this issue. This crisis is the \ncondition of Indian jails.\n  We held a hearing on the Finance Committee this fall to bring \nattention to the problem. We heard testimony from the Inspector General \nof the Interior Department, Mr. Earl Devaney. He issued a report that \nwas absolutely shocking. Mr. Devaney said the conditions of Indian \njails are comparable to conditions found in third-world countries. He \nsaid the jails are a natural disgrace.\n  There are over seventy Indian jails in America. Almost all of them \nsuffer from the same problems. They are highly understaffed and \noverpopulated. There are extremely high rates of suicides and escapes. \nOfficers are undertrained or not trained at all. Many of these jails \ndon't even have locking doors. We are talking about jails used to \ndetain criminals and they don't have locking doors. These conditions \nare unacceptable. They must be fixed. It is our duty to address this \nproblem.\n  In my home State of Montana, we have eleven Indian jails. They are \nstaffed with hardworking, good people. But they are not miracle \nworkers. They cannot be faulted for the deplorable condition of their \njails. Let me give you are example.\n  On one day in June of 2002, nine of the eleven Montana Indian jails \nwere overpopulated. The Crow Indian jail was 429 percent overcapacity. \nAt the Blackfeet Indian jail, every single detention officer was \nassaulted last year.\n  One major reason these jails are in such poor condition is they are \nterribly underfunded. Tribal officers don't have the money to address \nthe problems. Their hands are tied. We can do something about this. We \nmust provide adequate funding for Indian jails.\n  Today I offer a proposal to the Senate to give tribes the authority \nto issue tax credit bonds for the construction, maintenance, and \noperation of their detention facilities. These bonds give off tax \ncredits rather than interest to their investors, allowing tribes with \nlittle resources to earn interest off the proceeds. The bonds will \nprovide a steady stream of income to the Tribal governments.\n  The legislation will provide money that is so desperately needed to \naddress the problems facing Indian jails. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2919\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Max \nBaucus in introducing legislation that addresses the longstanding \nproblem of dilapidated tribal detention facilities on Indian \nreservations. There is a tremendous need for replacement construction \nof Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) operated and funded facilities, and I \nam pleased that this legislation offers a creative and innovative \nbonding approach to address the construction backlog.\n  USA Today reported that Federal investigators have uncovered evidence \nof abuse, neglect and inhumane conditions in Native American prisons \nand jails. This troubling report suggests that the conditions in Indian \ndetention facilities are not improving and, in fact, appear to be \ngetting worse. It is my hope that this hearing will help shed \nadditional light on these allegations, and lead to solutions to improve \nconditions in facilities across Indian country.\n  According to recent statistics from the Department of Justice report \non Indian jails and prisons, there are 70 detention facilities in \nIndian country, supervising approximately 2,100 inmates. Many of these \nfacilities are in\n\n[[Page S10716]]\n\nan appalling state of disrepair, and face problems that range from \novercrowding and understaffing to sheer neglect and abuse.\n  According to the most recent statistics from the Department of \nJustice, over half of all detention facilities in Indian country were \noperating at 100-percent capacity in 2002, and nineteen were operating \nat 150-percent or higher capacity. Of those nineteen, three are located \nin my state of South Dakota: Pine Ridge's Medicine Root Detention \nCenter, operating at 250-percent capacity; Crow Creek's Fort Thompson \nJail, operating at 242-percent capacity; and the Pine Ridge \nCorrectional Facility, which is operating at a staggering 400 percent \nof its capacity.\n  Inmates in South Dakota's BIA facilities are housed in dilapidated \nbuildings and are forced to endure extraordinarily harsh conditions. \nEven though the Lower Brule tribal detention facility was condemned by \nthe BIA in 1987, it was still being used to house inmates as recently \nas two years ago. Because the new facility is still under construction, \nLower Brule prisoners are sent 13 miles away, across the Missouri \nRiver, to the Crow Creek facility in Fort Thompson. Because there \naren't enough BIA officers to transport them back to Lower Brule, \ndetainees released from Crow Creek are often forced to make the return \ntrip to Lower Brule on foot. It is shocking that this is allowed to \nhappen at all, but especially in South Dakota where harsh winters and \nsub-zero temperatures are routine. Moreover, the Fort Thompson facility \nis equally understaffed. One person serves as both police dispatcher \nand detention officer in a facility that houses up to 30 prisoners.\n  These conditions have a devastating impact on prisoners. Nationally, \nbetween July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002, 282 inmates in tribal jails \nattempted suicide, up from 169 the previous year. In the last \nfive years, the number of admissions rose 32 percent, and the annual \nnumber of attempted suicides more than doubled, from 133 to 282. On \nCrow Creek, which is located in one of the most impoverished counties \nin the U.S. and experiences inordinate suicide rates among its general \npopulation, several suicides have occurred in the local jail.\n\n  Even more troubling, inadequate detention facilities pose a serious \nthreat to the surrounding communities. With a limited number of \nofficers responsible for large inmate populations, the risk of prisoner \nviolence--against both prison staff and, in the event of an escape, \nlocal citizens--is much greater. Moreover, the culture of neglect and \nabuse found in many of our Indian jails is indicative of broader trends \nwithin the communities. The Lower Brule jail doubles as a suicide-watch \ncenter for troubled teens, since there is nowhere else in the community \nto take them. Several Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) have either \nresigned, or are on the brink of resigning, due to the stress of the \nsituation. Law enforcement officials are at a loss about how to address \nthis disturbing pattern, and are overwhelmed by the feelings of \nhopelessness that accompany it.\n  Clearly, the impact that overcrowding, dilapidated conditions, and \nneglect are having on inmates in these facilities, as well as local \ncommunities, is reaching a critical mass--both in South Dakota and \nacross the Nation--and we must act now to reverse the trend. While \naddressing the problems that exist in jails and prisons clearly isn't \nthe whole answer, such an approach will meet a critical need in Indian \ncountry, and will represent an important step toward increasing public \nsafety and reducing incidences of abuse and neglect.\n  We can start by increasing funding for BIA facilities. Unfortunately, \nthis Administration has demonstrated a complete unwillingness to give \nIndian detention facilities the resources they need, and has actually \nreduced funding for jails and prisons in Indian country. It wasn't \nalways so bad. Under the Clinton Administration, then-Attorney General \nJanet Reno created the Department of Justice--Department of Interior \nIndian Law Enforcement initiative with the objective of creating an \neffective way to address law enforcement, facilities, juvenile justice, \nand rehabilitation efforts in Indian country. Although funding for \nthese programs, which increased under the Clinton administration and \nwas consistent until the FY2002 appropriations cycle, was not enough to \nmeet all of Indian country's needs, the initiative represented an \nunprecedented step toward addressing some of these problems.\n  Unfortunately, the current Administration, while budgeting hundreds \nof millions of dollars for Federal prison construction, has proposed \neliminating the tribal facility program for the second year in a row. \nWhile Congress appropriated $35 million per year for construction of \nBIA detention facilities between 2000 and 2002, we appropriated only $2 \nmillion in FY2004. Now, with an even tighter budget to work with, the \noutlook for this year is especially bleak, and conditions at BIA \nfacilities are likely to get even worse.\n  For too long, we have neglected our obligations to Native Americans. \nWe are seeing the effects of that neglect in South Dakota. These are \nonce again examples of the abrogration of the trust responsibility by \nthe Federal Government to the tribes and its people.\n  We need to do a better job of funding Indian detention centers, and \nwe need to do more to address public safety, tribal courts, and \nrehabilitation efforts. We cannot ask tribes to choose between funding \ncrisis intervention and law enforcement. We cannot force tribes to make \nthe choice between funding education and after school programs for \ntheir children, and repairing cracked walls and inoperable surveillance \ncameras in their jails.\n  While national rates are the lowest in years, crime on Indian lands \ncontinues to rise. Particularly disturbing is the violent nature of \nthis crime; violence against women, juvenile and gang crime, and child \nabuse remain serious problems. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports \nthat American Indians experience the highest crime victimization rates \nin the nation--almost twice the national average.\n  The law enforcement, public safety, and tribal detention facility \nissues are of critical importance to Indian country and surrounding \ncommunities. If this were happening in any other part of the country, \nit would be met with public outrage and swift government action. \nHowever, in Indian country, it is met with silence and reduced funding. \nFor the safety of our Indian people and the well-being of their \ncommunities, we must take action.\n  I am pleased that on September 21, 2004, the Senate Finance Committee \nheld an oversight hearing on these issues, and that this legislation \nhas emerged as a step in the right direction to address the \nconstruction backlog of much-needed facilities in rural, tribal \ncommunities.\n  I support this legislation which authorizes eligible Indian tribes to \nissue tax-exempt bonds to finance tribal prison facilities, ``tribal \nprison facility bonds''. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto address these important issues and to advance this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 2922. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe expansion, intensification, and coordination of the activities of \nthe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute with respect to research \non pulmonary hypertension; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to enhance Federal research on an emerging chronic disease in \nthe U.S. known as pulmonary hypertension. PH is a serious and often \nfatal condition where the blood pressure in the lungs rises to \ndangerously high levels. In PH patients, the walls of the arteries that \ntake blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs thicken and \nconstrict. As a result, the right side of the heart has to pump harder \nto move blood into the lungs, causing it to enlarge and ultimately \nfail.\n  PH can occur without a known cause or be secondary to other \nconditions such as; collagen vascular diseases, i.e., scleroderma and \nlupus, blood clots, HIV, sickle cell, and liver disease. PH does not \ndiscriminate based on race, gender or age. Patients develop symptoms of \nshortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, dizziness, and fainting. \nUnfortunately, these symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed, leaving \npatients\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\nwith the false impression that they have a minor pulmonary or \ncardiovascular condition. By the time many patients receive an accurate \ndiagnosis, the disease has progressed to a late stage, making it \nimpossible to receive a necessary heart or lung transplant.\n  With this legislation, I am proud to join the Pulmonary Hypertension \nAssociation in the fight against this deadly illness. PHA is the \nNation's oldest and largest organization dedicated to finding a cure \nfor PH and improving the quality of life for PH patients and their \nfamilies. I would particularly like to recognize the contributions of \nfour PHA members from my home State of Texas who have contributed so \nmuch to this worthy cause--Leo and Bobbie Fields, and Jack Stibbs and \nhis daughter Emily. Their commitment to improving the quality of life \nfor PH patients and pursuing a cure for this disease is truly \ninspiring. I would also like to recognize our colleague Congressman \nKevin Brady for his leadership in introducing the ``PH Research Act'' \nin the other body.\n  A few years ago the scientifc community discovered the first gene \nassociated with pulmonary hypertension. This was a landmark discovery \nin the battle to unravel the mystery surrounding this disease. The ``PH \nResearch Act'' seeks to capitalize on this exciting advancement by \nestablishing ``Centers of Excellence'' on pulmonary hypertension \nthrough the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the National \nInstitutes of Health. These Centers would focus on: 1. basic and \nclinical research into the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of PH: 2. \nthe training of new investigators in PH research; 3. continuing \neducation for health care professionals regarding PH with a focus on \nearly diagnosis and 4. the dissemination of information regarding the \ndisease to the general public.\n  This is an important bill that has the potential to help tens of \nthousands of Americans and their families, who are struggling with this \ndevastating disease. I look forward to working with the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee to advance the ``PH Research \nAct.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 2923. A bill to reauthorize the grant program of the Department of \nJustice for reentry of offenders into the community, to establish a \ntask force on Federal programs and activities relating to the reentry \nof offenders into the community, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Senator Specter and I introduce today the \nEnhanced Second Chance Act of 2004, which takes direct aim at reducing \nrecidivism rates for our Nation's ex-offenders and improving the \ntransition for these offenders from prison back into the community.\n  All too often we think about today, but not tomorrow. We look to \nshort-term solutions for long- term problems. We need to have a change \nin thinking and approach. It's time we face the dire situation of \nprisoners reentering our communities with insufficient monitoring, \nlittle or no job skills, inadequate drug treatment, insufficient \nhousing, lack of positive influences, a paucity of basic physical and \nmental health services, and deficient basic life skills.\n  The bill we introduce today is about providing a second chance for \nthese ex-offenders, and the children and families that depend on them. \nIt's about strengthening communities and ensuring safe neighborhoods.\n  Since my 1994 Crime Bill passed, we've had great success in cutting \ndown on crime rates in this country. Under the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services (COPS) program, we've funded over 114,000 officers \nall across the country. And our crime rate has plummeted. Murder is \ndown 37.8 percent, rape 19.1 percent, and aggravated assaults 28 \npercent. The overall crime rate sharply declined by 28 percent.\n  But now, we are seeing some troubling indicators that crime is back \non the rise. Murder was up 2.5 percent in 2001, 1 percent in 2002, and \n1.3 percent in 2003. Forcible rape is up as is robbery. Car theft is up \n10 percent over the last four years.\n  If we are going to ensure that these latest numbers are only a blip \non the continued downward trend of crime rates, as opposed to the \nbeginning of a comeback in crime, we simply have to make strong, \nconcerted, and common-sense efforts now to help ex-prisoners \nsuccessfully reenter and reintegrate into their communities.\n  There's a record number of people currently serving time in our \ncountry--over two million. This translates into 1 out of every 143 U.S. \nresidents. In its latest statistics on the matter, the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics found that the Nation's overall prison population \nincreased by over 40,000 from midyear 2002 to midyear 2003, the largest \nincrease in 4 years.\n  Also vital to realize is that 95 percent of all these millions we \nlock up will eventually get out. That equals nearly 650,000 being \nreleased from Federal or State prisons to communities each year. In a \nState like Delaware, that's over 4,000 inmates per year. And here's the \nkicker--a staggering \\2/3\\ of these released state prisoners are \nexpected to be rearrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within 3 \nyears of release. Two out of every three! You're talking about hundreds \nof thousands of reoffending ex-offenders each year and hundreds of \nthousands of serious crimes being committed by people who have already \nserved time in jail.\n  And, unfortunately, it's not too difficult to see why such a huge \nportion of our released prisoners recommit serious crimes. Up to 60 \npercent of former inmates are not employed; 15 to 27 percent of \nprisoners expect to go to homeless shelters upon release; and 57 \npercent of Federal and 70 percent of State inmates used drugs regularly \nbefore prison, with some estimates of involvement with drugs or alcohol \naround the time of the offense as high as 84 percent.\n  These huge numbers of released prisoners each year and the out-of-\ncontrol recidivism rates are a recipe for disaster--leading to untold \ndamage, hardship, and death for victims; ruined futures and lost \npotential for re-offenders; and a huge drain on society at large. One \nparticularly vulnerable group is the children of these offenders. We \nsimply cannot be resigned to allowing generation after generation \nentering and reentering our prisons. This pernicious cycle must come to \nan end.\n  My 1994 Crime Bill recognized these extraordinarily high rates of \nrecidivism as a real problem. My bill, for example, created innovative \ndrug treatment programs for State and Federal inmates to help them kick \ntheir habit.\n  But this is only one piece of the puzzle. I introduced a bill in 2000 \nthat would have built on my 1994 Crime Bill--the ``Offender Reentry and \nCommunity Safety Act of 2000'', S. 2908. This bill would have created \ndemonstration reentry programs for Federal, State, and local prisoners. \nThese programs were designed to assist high-risk, high-need offenders \nwho served their prison sentences, but who pose the greatest risk of \nreoffending upon release because they lack the education, job skills, \nstable family or living arrangements, and the health services they need \nto successfully reintegrate into society.\n  Senator Specter has also been a dedicated and tireless leader on \ncrime and public safety issues throughout his career and has, for many \nyears, seen the serious public safety ramifications of high recidivism \nrates. For example, my colleague from Pennsylvania has been the leader \non the effort to ensure that offenders who are being released back into \nour communities have adequate education and work training to become \nproductive members of our society. I couldn't be more pleased than to \njoin efforts with Senator Specter on the Enhanced Second Chance Act of \n2004.\n  While we have made some progress on offender reentry efforts since \n1994, much more needs to be done. In the current session of Congress, I \nam pleased that colleagues of mine--from both sides of Capitol Hill and \nfrom both sides of the aisle--are also focusing their attention on this \nvital issue.\n  I am proud to have worked with Representatives Rob Portman, Danny \nDavis, and John Conyers, just to name a few, in the House or \nRepresentatives. In the Senate, a number of my colleagues, in addition \nto Senator Specter, have shown strong interest in offender reentry \nissues, including Senators Brownback, DeWine, Leahy, Kennedy, Landrieu, \nBingaman, Hatch, Grassley, and Santorum.\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\n  The Second Chance Act of 2004 was introduced in the House and Senate \nrecently, and I was proud to have worked extensively on that \nbipartisan, bicameral process. The bill Senator Specter and I introduce \ntoday builds on those efforts. Like the Second Chance Act, the central \ncomponent of our bill provides a competitive grant program to promote \ninnovative programs to test out a variety of methods aimed at reducing \nrecidivism rates. Efforts would be focused on post-release housing, \neducation and job training, substance abuse and mental health services, \nand mentoring programs, just to name a few.\n\n  Because the scope of the problem is so large--with 650,000 prisoners \nbeing released from state and federal prisons each year--our bill \nprovides more than three times as much funding than the House bill. \nWhile the House bill contains $40 million per year for the main grant \nprogram, our bill provides $130 million. This isn't being wasteful with \nour scarce federal resources, it's just an acknowledgment of the scope \nof the problem we're faced with.\n  A relatively modest investment in offender reentry efforts compares \nvery well with the alternative, building more and more prisons for \nthese ex-offenders to return to if they are unable to successfully \nreenter their communities and instead are rearrested and reconvicted of \nmore crimes. We must remember that the average cost of incarcerating \neach prisoner exceeds $20,000 per year. In Delaware, this translates \ninto over $200 per resident just to pay for jail and prison operating \nexpenses.\n  In constant 2001 dollars, state prison costs in our country have \nincreased from $11.7 billion per year in 1986 to $29.5 billion in 2001. \nAnd even with these kinds of resources being spent, by the end of 2002, \n25 States and the Federal prison system reported operating at 100 \npercent or more of their highest capacity. My own home State of \nDelaware continues to see a prison system bulging at the seams. We have \ntried, but simply cannot build our way out of this problem. We need \ntough--but smart--strategies to stop the revolving door of prisoners \nbeing released from prison, only to re-offend and land right back \nbehind bars. We simply can't be penny-wise but pound-foolish.\n  The Enhanced Second Chance Act of 2004 also requires that Federal \ndepartments with a role in offender reentry efforts coordinate and work \ntogether; to make sure there aren't duplicative efforts or funding \ngaps; and to coordinate reentry research. Our bill would raise the \nprofile of this issue within the executive branch and secure the \nsustained and coordinated federal attention offender reentry efforts \ndeserve.\n  We also need to examine existing Federal and state reentry barriers--\nlaws, regulations, rules, and practices that make it more difficult for \nformer inmates to successfully reintegrate back into their communities; \nlaws that confine ex-offenders to society's margins, making it even \nmore likely that they will recommit serious crimes and return to \nprison.\n  Turning over a new leaf and going from a life of crime to becoming a \nproductive member of society is tough enough. We shouldn't have Federal \nand State laws on the books that make this even more challenging. \nThat's not to say that we don't want to restrict former drug addicts \nfrom working in pharmacies, for example, or to bar sex offenders from \nworking in day care centers. But many communities across the country \ncurrently exclude ex-prisoners from virtually every occupation \nrequiring a state license, like chiropractic care, engineering, and \nreal estate. Lifting these senselessly punitive bans would make it \neasier for ex-offenders to stay out of prison.\n  Our bill provides for a robust analysis of these Federal and State \nbarriers with recommendations on what next steps we need to take. And \nthese reviews are mandated to take place out in the open under public \nscrutiny.\n  The Enhanced Second Chance Act also spurs state-of-the-art research \nand study on offender reentry issues. We need to know who is most \nlikely to recommit crimes when they are released, to better target our \nlimited resources where they can do the most good. We need to study why \nsome ex-offenders who seem to have the entire deck stacked against them \nare able to become successful and productive members of our society. We \nneed to know what works and how we can replicate what works for others.\n  Our bill also provides a whole slew of common-sense proposals in the \nareas of job training, employment, education, post-release housing, \ncivic rights, substance abuse, and prisoner mentoring--efforts and \nchanges in law that we can do now. Some of these important provisions \nare included in the House bill, others are in addition to those \nefforts, but all are common-sense efforts in the art of the possible. \nOur goal is to do as much as possible right now.\n  Our Enhanced Second Chance Act is a next, natural step in our \ncampaign against crime. Making a dent in recidivism rates is an \nenormous undertaking; one that requires action now and continued focus \nin the future. I commit to vigorously pushing this legislation as well \nas keeping an eye on what steps we need to take in the future. We need \nto realize that the problems facing ex-offenders are enormous and \nrequire sustained focus. The safety of our neighbors, our children, and \nour communities depends on it.\n  I'm proud today to introduce the Enhanced Second Chance Act with \nSenator Specter and ask our colleagues to join with us in this vital \neffort.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the text of our bill printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2923\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Enhanced Second Chance Act \n     of 2004: Community Safety Through Recidivism Prevention'' or \n     the ``Enhanced Second Chance Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 2002, 2,000,000 people were incarcerated in Federal \n     or State prisons or in local jails. Nearly 650,000 people are \n     released from incarceration to communities nationwide each \n     year.\n       (2) There are over 3,200 jails throughout the United \n     States, the vast majority of which are operated by county \n     governments. Each year, these jails will release in excess of \n     10,000,000 people back into the community.\n       (3) Nearly \\2/3\\ of released State prisoners are expected \n     to be rearrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within 3 \n     years after release.\n       (4) In recent years, a number of States and local \n     governments have begun to establish improved systems for \n     reintegrating former prisoners. Under such systems, \n     corrections officials begin to plan for a prisoner's release \n     while the prisoner is incarcerated and provide a transition \n     to needed services in the community.\n       (5) Faith leaders and parishioners have a long history \n     helping ex-offenders transform their lives. Through prison \n     ministries and outreach in communities, churches and faith-\n     based organizations have pioneered reentry services to \n     prisoners and their families.\n       (6) Successful reentry protects those who might otherwise \n     be crime victims. It also improves the likelihood that \n     individuals released from prison or juvenile detention \n     facilities can pay fines, fees, restitution, and family \n     support.\n       (7) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \n     expenditures on corrections alone increased from \n     $9,000,000,000 in 1982 to $44,000,000,000 in 1997. These \n     figures do not include the cost of arrest and prosecution, \n     nor do they take into account the cost to victims.\n       (8) Increased recidivism results in profound collateral \n     consequences, including public health risks, homelessness, \n     unemployment, and disenfranchisement.\n       (9) The high prevalence of infectious disease, substance \n     abuse, and mental health disorders that has been found in \n     incarcerated populations demands that a recovery model of \n     treatment should be used for handling the more than \\2/3\\ of \n     all offenders with such needs.\n       (10) One of the most significant costs of prisoner reentry \n     is the impact on children, the weakened ties among family \n     members, and destabilized communities. The long-term \n     generational effects of a social structure in which \n     imprisonment is the norm and law-abiding role models are \n     absent are difficult to measure but undoubtedly exist.\n       (11) According to the 2001 national data from the Bureau of \n     Justice Statistics, 3,500,000 parents were supervised by the \n     correctional system. Prior to incarceration, 64 percent of \n     female prisoners and 44 percent of male prisoners in State \n     facilities lived with their children.\n       (12) Between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a \n     parent in a Federal or State correctional facility increased \n     by more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to \n     approximately 2,000,000. According to the Bureau of Prisons, \n     there is evidence to suggest that inmates who are connected \n     to their children and families are more likely to avoid \n     negative incidents and have reduced sentences.\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\n       (13) Approximately 100,000 juveniles (ages 17 and under) \n     leave juvenile correctional facilities, State prison, or \n     Federal prison each year. Juveniles released from confinement \n     still have their likely prime crime years ahead of them. \n     Juveniles released from secure confinement have a recidivism \n     rate ranging from 55 to 75 percent. The chances that young \n     people will successfully transition into society improve with \n     effective reentry and aftercare programs.\n       (14) Studies have shown that from 15 percent to 27 percent \n     of prisoners expect to go to homeless shelters upon release \n     from prison.\n       (15) The National Institute of Justice has found that after \n     1 year of release, up to 60 percent of former inmates are not \n     employed.\n       (16) Fifty-seven percent of Federal and 70 percent of State \n     inmates used drugs regularly before prison, with some \n     estimates of involvement with drugs or alcohol around the \n     time of the offense as high as 84 percent (BJS Trends in \n     State Parole, 1990-2000).\n       (17) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 60 to \n     83 percent of the Nation's correctional population have used \n     drugs at some point in their lives. This is twice the \n     estimated drug use of the total United States population of \n     40 percent.\n       (18) Family based treatment programs have proven results \n     for serving the special population of female offenders and \n     substance abusers with children. An evaluation by the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of \n     family based treatment for substance abusing mothers and \n     children found that at 6 months post treatment, 60 percent of \n     the mothers remain alcohol and drug free, and drug related \n     offenses declined from 28 to 7 percent. Additionally, a 2003 \n     evaluation of residential family based treatment programs \n     revealed that 60 percent of mothers remained clean and sober \n     6 months after treatment, criminal arrests declined by 43 \n     percent, and 88 percent of the children treated in the \n     program with their mothers remain stabilized.\n       (19) A Bureau of Justice Statistics analysis indicated that \n     only 33 percent of Federal and 36 percent of State inmates \n     had participated in residential inpatient treatment programs \n     for alcohol and drug abuse 12 months before their release. \n     Further, over \\1/3\\ of all jail inmates have some physical or \n     mental disability and 25 percent of jail inmates have been \n     treated at some time for a mental or emotional problem.\n       (20) According to the National Institute of Literacy, 70 \n     percent of all prisoners function at the 2 lowest literacy \n     levels.\n       (21) The Bureau of Justice Statistics has found that 27 \n     percent of Federal inmates, 40 percent of State inmates, and \n     47 percent of local jail inmates have never completed high \n     school or its equivalent. Furthermore, the Bureau of Justice \n     Statistics has found that less educated inmates are more \n     likely to be recidivists. Only 1 in 4 local jails offer basic \n     adult education programs.\n       (22) In his 2004 State of the Union Address, President Bush \n     correctly stated: ``We know from long experience that if \n     former prisoners can't find work, or a home, or help, they \n     are much more likely to commit more crimes and return to \n     prison America is the land of the second chance, and when the \n     gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a \n     better life.''.\n       (23) Participation in State correctional education programs \n     lowers the likelihood of reincarceration by 29 percent, \n     according to a recent United States Department of Education \n     study. A Federal Bureau of Prisons study found a 33 percent \n     drop in recidivism among Federal prisoners who participated \n     in vocational and apprenticeship training.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nsupport of legislation which I am sponsoring with the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Biden--the Enhanced Second Chance Act of 2004. This year, \nmore than 650,000 inmates will be released from the United States' \nprisons. Nearly two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested for \neither a felony or a serious misdemeanor within 3 years of release. \nThis ``revolving door'' of criminals endangers our communities. Yet, it \nshould really come as no surprise that an individual who is released \nand who is illiterate or lacks the necessary skills to get a job \nreturns to a life of crime. The need to address the issue of recidivism \nto protect the public is apparent and the Enhanced Second Chance Act is \ndesigned to address that need and stop the ``revolving door'' at our \nNation's correctional facilities. This bill gives criminal offenders a \nsecond chance at rehabilitation and gainful employment by creating \nsuccessful reentry programs focused on education and job training.\n  There are two categories of individuals that we must focus our \nconcern on in our fight to reduce recidivism--the career criminal and \nthe person who will one day return back to his or her community. As for \nthe career criminal, I wrote the Armed Career Criminal Bill that was \nadopted in 1984, which provides for life sentences for career \ncriminals. These individuals, who have committed three or more major \noffenses and caught in possession of a firearm, receive mandatory \nsentences up to life.\n  The second category of individuals--individuals who will one day be \nreleased--are a special circumstance because this is not about locking \nthem up forever but about making sure they have an opportunity to turn \ntheir life around. It is about focusing on literacy and job training in \norder to reduce recidivism and prevent those individuals from becoming \ncareer criminals.\n  The Enhanced Second Chance Act is aimed at better equipping the \ncommunity, increasing public safety, and helping States and communities \naddress the growing population of ex-offenders returning to \ncommunities. The act authorizes a $130 million a year grant program for \nState and local governments aimed at creating programs to help reduce \nrecidivism rates and to create procedures to ensure that dangerous \nfelons are not released from prison prematurely. It also calls for \neither establishing or expanding the use of State reentry courts to \nmonitor ex-offenders returning to the community and to provide them \nwith drug and alcohol treatment as well as necessary mental and medical \nservices.\n  One of the most significant concerns that our communities face with \nregards to prisoners is the impact on their children and communities. \nBetween 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a parent in a \nFederal or State correction facility increased by more than 100 percent \nfrom approximately 900,000 to approximately 2 million. This legislation \ndeals with the issues and obstacles that these children face. The \nEnhanced Second Chance Act of 2004 creates a new program designed to \nsupport the relationship between parent and child while the parent is \nincarcerated and to help with family unification when the parent is \nreleased. It also instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto re-examine the current programs that are in place to help support \nthe parent-child relationship while the parent is incarcerated and to \nestablish the necessary services to help preserve the family \nrelationship.\n  Another major concern is incarcerated juveniles. Juveniles have a \nrecidivism rate ranging from 55 to 75 percent. These figures are \nstaggering and that is why I have pushed for so many years for \nlegislation aimed at educating these young offenders prior to their \nrelease. I have consistently sponsored legislation that would provide \nfor workplace and community transition training for incarcerated youth \noffenders while in prison and would provide employment counseling and \nother services that would continue while the individual was on parole. \nThe Enhanced Second Chance Act of 2004 builds upon my earlier efforts \nand provides effective reentry and aftercare programs so that these \nyoung individuals will have a chance at a successful transition back \ninto the community. This bill encourages State and local governments to \nassess the literacy and educational needs of incarcerated individuals \nand to identify appropriate services to meet those needs while they are \nincarcerated. Moreover, this bill provides for collaboration with \ncommunity colleges and employment services to connect inmates with \nemployment opportunities before they are released back into the \ncommunity.\n  The New York Times recently reported that 5 million people, or \nroughly 2.3 percent of the electorate, will be barred from voting in \nNovember by State laws that strip felons of voting rights. However many \nex-felons are in fact eligible to vote but do not do so simply because \nthey are not aware that they have this right. The Enhanced Second \nChance Act helps remove the confusion and mandates that prison \nofficials provide each ex-offender released from Federal prison \ninformation on how the reentering offender can restore his or her \nvoting rights. Information must be provided to each ex-offender in \nwriting and in a language that he or she can understand. This will \nallow ex-offenders to feel more connected to their communities and is \nanother important tool in the fight to reduce recidivism.\n  I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from Delaware in \nintroducing this important and much-needed legislation. The Enhanced \nSecond Chance Act of 2004 is a very positive step forward in providing \nrealistic rehabilitation to individuals needing a second chance. I \nwholeheartedly agree with President Bush's statement that ``America is \nthe land of second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the \npath ahead should lead to a better life.'' The President urged us to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion and I believe that this bill is the first \nstep in the right direction.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Biden, \nSpecter, and Landrieu, to introduce the Enhanced Second Chance Act of \n2004.\n  I believe this is an important bill that will significantly improve \npublic safety by providing $130 million a year for a competitive grant \nprogram to State, local, and tribal governments to reduce recidivism \nrates and improve the transition of offenders back into society. In \naddition to the adult and juvenile demonstration projects, the bill \nwould create a Federal reentry task force, reauthorize funding for drug \ntreatment programs in State and Federal correctional facilities, \nestablish a program within the Bureau of Prisons to promote family \nreunification, bring additional literacy funds to correctional \ninstitutions, and establish a mentoring grant program for community-\nbased organizations to assist inmates with their reentry back into the \ncommunity.\n  We as a society have an interest in ensuring that when prisoners are \nreleased that they be reintegrated back into the community in a manner \nthat reduces the likelihood of them committing additional crimes. \nProviding assistance to these individuals is not a charity, it is a \nmatter of good public policy. Without employment, without housing, \nwithout basic life skills, without help in treating drug addiction or \nmental illness, offenders are likely to relapse into criminal behavior. \nIt is insufficient to just punish offenders; we also need to look for \nways that we can rehabilitate offenders and create an environment that \nfosters their ability to make a positive contribution to society.\n  There are programs in State and Federal detention facilities that are \nbeginning to address some of these issues, but frankly, I believe we \nneed to be doing more--especially with regard to jails across the \ncountry. By neglecting to focus on inmates in local jails we are also \nlosing out on targeting the largest population of offenders that is \nreturning to the community--it is estimated that jails return 10 to 20 \ntimes the number of people into the community as do Federal and State \nprisons,\n\n[[Page S10725]]\n\napproximately 10 million releases a year. I am very pleased that my \nsuggestions regarding recognizing the role of local jails in the \nreentry process were incorporated into this bill.\n  I also believe we need to pay more attention to the issue of \nilliteracy among inmates. According to the National Institute of \nLiteracy, 70 percent of all prisoners function at the two lowest \nliteracy levels. Considering that studies have consistently \ndemonstrated that correctional educational programs reduce recidivism \nrates by up to 30 percent, I strongly believe this is an area which \ndeserves attention, and I am happy that this bill will bring additional \nresources for literacy programs.\n  If we are going to reduce the recidivism rate, we can't overlook the \nimportance of getting these offenders the tools necessary to succeed in \nthe community without recourse to crime. With over 2 million people \nincarcerated in the United States, if punishment is all we do, without \nany effort to rehabilitate and reintegrate offenders into the \ncommunity, society will bear a heavy burden. Over 650,000 offenders are \nreleased from State and Federal facilities each year, in addition to \n100,000 juveniles and the numerous individuals coming in and out of \nlocal jails that I previously mentioned. It makes sense to do all we \ncan to ensure that these people are rehabilitated and have the skills \nnecessary to successfully change course.\n  In recent years, many States and localities have begun to improve \nways to transition offenders back into communities, and I believe that \nthis bill provides the resources necessary to continue this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 2926. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntaxpayers a credit against income tax for expenditures to remediate \ncontaminated sites; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, revitalizing our urban areas has been \nan issue I have been passionate about for many years. As former Mayor \nof Cleveland, I experienced firsthand the difficulties that cities face \nin redeveloping these sites for reuse.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Coleman, the \nBrownfields Revitalization Act of 2004, will provide incentives to \nclean up abandoned industrial sites--or brownfields--across the country \nand put them back into productive use and preserve our green spaces. I \nam pleased to be working on this important legislation with my \ncolleague from Ohio, Congressman Mike Turner.\n  I have been working on brownfields issues at the national level since \nI became Governor of Ohio in 1990 and through my involvement with the \nNational Governors' Association and the Republican Governors' \nAssociation. For almost 15 years, I have worked closely with \ncongressional leaders to develop legislation that would encourage \ncleanup and redevelopment of these sites nationwide.\n  In 2001, I was closely involved in the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee's work on the Brownfields Revitalization and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act which, in part, provided grants to local \ngovernments to remediate and redevelop brownfields sites. Grants such \nas these are important because they provide incentives to clean up \nexisting sites, which will provide better protection for the health and \nsafety of our citizens and the environment. I believe the tax \nincentives in the bill I'm introducing today will work hand in hand \nwith the grants that are already authorized to encourage private \nremediation and redevelopment efforts.\n  To enhance and encourage cleanup efforts, my State of Ohio has \nimplemented a private sector-based program to clean up brownfields \nsites. When I was Governor, Ohio EPA, Republicans and Democrats in the \nOhio General Assembly and I worked hard to implement a program that we \nbelieve works for Ohio. Our program is already successful in improving \nOhio's environment and economy. In fact, 141 sites have been cleaned up \nunder Ohio's voluntary cleanup program in 8 years. And many more \ncleanups are underway.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will build upon the success of \nState programs such as Ohio's by providing even more incentives to \nclean up brownfield sites in order to provide better protection for the \nhealth and safety of our citizens and the environment.\n  This legislation will provide additional tools to recycle our urban \nwastelands, prevent urban sprawl and preserve our farmland and \ngreenspaces. We will be able to clean up industrial eyesores in our \ncities and make them more desirable places to live. Because they are \nputting abandoned sites back into productive use, they are a key \nelement to providing economic rebirth to many urban areas, and good-\npaying jobs to local residents.\n  This bill makes sense for our environment and it makes sense for our \neconomy. It is supported by the mayors of Ohio's major cities, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the International Council of Shopping Centers, \nEmpower America, American Council of Engineering Companies, and the \nNational Association of Home Builders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enable drivers to choose a more affordable form of \nauto insurance that also provides for more adequate and timely \ncompensation for accident victims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of my co-sponsors, Senators \nMcConnell and McCain, I rise today to introduce legislation that I \nbelieve has the potential to improve profoundly the lives of millions \nof Americans across the country.\n  The Auto Choice Reform Act of 2004 offers a real solution to a very \nreal problem faced by those of us who drive every day--the high cost \nand inadequate compensation of the current tort and liability \nautomotive insurance system.\n  The tort system ought to ideally compensate people injured by \nnegligence and deter others from acting irresponsibly. With respect to \nauto accidents, the system fails miserably on both counts.\n  Numerous studies over the past 75 years document just how poorly the \ntort system compensates injured people. Almost one-third of injured \npeople recover nothing at all, and many injured persons who do recover \ncompensation must wait years to receive payment from the other person's \ninsurer.\n  Worst of all, people with minor injuries recover compensation far in \nexcess of their actual losses while many people with serious injuries \nare grossly underpaid. The RAND Institute for Civil Justice has found \nthat people with economic losses between $500 and $1,000 recover on \naverage 2\\1/2\\ times their economic loss. This is largely due to the \nfact that it is cheaper for an insurer to pay a questionable claim than \nto pay the costs of going to court, where they risk paying a multiplier \nof economic damages for pain and suffering.\n  The perverse incentives generated by pain-and-suffering damage awards \nalso cause rampant fraud and abuse in auto insurance claims. A study by \nthe RAND Institute for Civil Justice confirms that between 35 and 42 \npercent of medical costs claimed in auto accidents occur in response to \nthe incentives of the tort liability system. In other words, more than \none-third of all medical losses claimed in auto accidents are \nfraudulent or exaggerated--attempts to nab the pain-and-suffering \njackpot.\n  On the other hand, people with the highest economic losses, in excess \nof $100,000, recover only 9 percent of their economic loss on average. \nTo add injury to insult, that amount doesn't even include their \nlawyers' standard one-third fee. Because most drivers don't carry \nenough insurance to even pay this level of economic loss, particularly \nafter attorneys' fees are deducted, people with the most serious \ninjuries rarely recover anything for pain-and-suffering.\n  In short, we would be hard pressed to design a worse compensation \nsystem if we tried.\n  Indeed, the system is so bankrupt that lawyers in the auto insurance \nlitigation currently consume more than 25 cents out of every premium \ndollar spent, an amount that is significantly more than the amount \nreceived by those actually injured for medical bills and lost wages. In \ntotal, more than $16 billion went to lawyers in 2001 for automobile \nrelated personal injury cases.\n\n  What about deterrence? Perhaps it is worth paying for a poor \ncompensation system if people are deterred from driving badly, thereby \navoiding injuries in the first place. Some studies have made this \nargument but the most comprehensive analysis of accident data, again by \nthe RAND Institute for Civil Justice, has found that the tort system \nhas little or no deterrent impact. This conclusion is a logical one. If \na driver is not deterred by the threat of personal danger from reckless \ndriving, then surely that driver is not deterred by the penalty for \nreckless driving--simply a modest increase in one's insurance premium.\n  The current system is also unnecessarily expensive, as is clearly \ndemonstrated by the fact that the Joint Economic Committee estimates \nthat switching to the new Personal Injury Protection system, discussed \nbelow, which relies primarily on the payment of economic losses for all \ninjured persons without regard to fault and largely without the need \nfor lawsuits, could save drivers a total of $48 billion a year in \nunnecessary premiums.\n  Excessive premiums disproportionately impact low income Americans and \nwelfare recipients. Families in the bottom 20 percent of incomes who \nbuy auto insurance spend 16 percent of their household income on that \ninsurance. That percentage is seven times the proportion that families \nin the top 20 percent spend. Lower premiums would enable many low \nincome workers to afford the cars they need to travel to better-paying \njobs. The Auto Choice reform legislation we are proposing today would \nreduce premiums for low income people by more than it would reduce them \nfor the average driver--both in terms of percentages and often in terms \nof absolute dollars. And all drivers would see significantly lower \npremiums.\n  Auto Choice is designed to allow consumers to choose the type of \ninsurance that meets their needs and to opt out of the pain-and-\nsuffering litigation lottery associated with the current system.\n  Essentially, drivers are permitted under Auto Choice to choose a new \nPersonal Injury Protection, ``PIP'', Insurance under which they would \nbe compensated without regard to fault for all economic losses up to \ntheir policy limits by their own insurance company, with nothing \navailable for pain and suffering. Alternatively, for those who remain \nin the current tort system, they will select a small amount of \nadditional coverage similar to an uninsured motorist for situations \ninvolving another motorist that opted for the PIP system--a premium \noffset by the savings realized by everyone as a result of the overall \nshift away from the lawsuit system.\n  The system does not abolish lawsuits. By design, there will be \nreduced incentives to head straight to court, but the right to sue \nremains firmly intact--as injured parties not fully compensated can sue \nto recover excess economic losses over and above that covered by the \nPIP coverage and other sources of first party insurance. They can also \nsue for all damages, including pain and suffering, when the accident is \ncaused by a driver who is drunk or on drugs.\n  In summary, if a driver wants to maintain the possibility of \nrecovering for pain and suffering, he will stay in essentially the \ncurrent system. On the other hand, if he wants to opt-out of the \ncurrent system in exchange for lower premiums with prompt compensation \nfor economic losses--then he instead will choose the personal injury \nprotection system.\n  The idea is not a new one. Indeed, this idea has been discussed--and \neven introduced in one form or another--for over thirty years now. \nSeveral versions of Auto Choice reform have enjoyed broad support on \nboth sides of the aisle. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Steve Forbes, \nMichael Dukakis, Mayor Rudy Guliani, Congressman Dick Armey--just to \nname a few--have all opined in support of giving drivers a way out of \nthe current ineffective system.\n  The time has come for Congress to act. The results of our action are \nclear and tangible: were Congress to enact Auto Choice Reform \nlegislation now, motorists would stand to save as much as $48 billion \nnext year.\n  Think about that for just one moment. Over 5 years, Americans would \nbe able to save almost $250 billion--savings tantamount to a massive \ntax cut with absolutely no negative impact to the Federal deficit.\n  And what does this mean for the average American? The average \nAmerican family with two cars will be able to save nearly $380 a year, \naccording to Joint Economic Committee estimates.\n  Particularly encouraging is the effect these savings will have for \nlow income families. Lower auto insurance premiums will make owning a \ncar more affordable for poor Americans, allowing them to find and keep \nbetter-paying jobs and have longer commutes. Auto Choice would allow \nlow-income drivers to save almost 37 percent on their overall \nautomobile premium. For a low-income household, these savings\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\nare the equivalent of 5 weeks of groceries or nearly 4 months of \nelectric bills.\n  Auto Choice Reform can provide immediate and real relief for average, \nmainstream American families across the country. Those are real \nsavings, resulting from a sound system that offers legitimate choice--a \nchoice between guaranteed upfront savings on insurance premiums on one \nhand; and on the other, the right to sue for non-economic damages such \nas pain and suffering in the event an accident one day occurs.\n  For most Americans, I believe the choice is an easy one. \nUnfortunately, for most Americans today, that choice is unavailable.\n  The Auto Choice Reform Act of 2004 gives the American people that \nchoice. Let's get government back to doing what it ought to--protecting \nthe rights of all Americans to have the freedom to make choices about \nhow they live their lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 2933. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to expand the \nclinical trials drug data bank; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Access to \nClinical Trials (FACT) Act. I want to begin by thanking Senator \nKennedy, Senator Johnson, and Senator Wyden for joining me in \nintroducing this legislation. Our bill will create a clinical trials \nregistry--an electronic database--for drugs, biological products, and \nmedical devices. Such a registry will ensure that physicians, the \ngeneral public, and patients seeking to enroll in clinical trials have \naccess to basic information about those trials. It will require \nmanufacturers and other researchers to reveal the results of clinical \ntrials so that clinically important information will be available to \nall Americans, and physicians will have all the necessary information \nto make appropriate treatment decisions for their patients.\n  Events of the past several months have made it clear that such a \nregistry is needed. Serious questions have been raised about the \neffectiveness and safety of antidepressants when used in children and \nyouth. It has now become clear that the existing data indicates that \nthese drugs may very well put children at risk. However, because the \ndata from antidepressant clinical trials was not publicly available, it \ntook years for this risk to be realized. In the meantime, millions of \nchildren have been prescribed antidepressants by well-meaning \nphysicians. While these drugs undoubtedly helped many of these \nchildren, they also led to greater suffering for others.\n  Unfortunately, antidepressants are just one example of a story that \nhas become all too common. In the case of antidepressants, negative \ndata might actually have been suppressed, and if this is discovered to \nbe the case, those responsible should be dealt with harshly. However, \nbecause of what is known as ``publication bias,'' the information \navailable to the public and physicians can be misleading even without \nnefarious motives. The simple fact is that a study with a positive \nresult is far more likely to be published, and thus publicly available, \nthan a study with a negative result. Physicians and patients hear the \ngood news, but rarely the bad news. In the end, the imbalance of \navailable information hurts patients.\n  Our bill would correct the imbalance of information, and prevent \nmanufacturers from suppressing negative data. It would do so by \nexpanding clinicaltrials.gov, an existing registry that is operated by \nthe National Library of Medicine (NLM). Currently, clinicaltrials.gov \nincludes information for patients seeking to enroll in clinical trials \nfor drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The FACT Act \nwould expand the registry to include all trials (except for preliminary \nsafety trials), and would also require the submission of results data. \nAt the same time, the bill would ensure that clinicaltrials.gov \ncontinues to operate as a resource for patients seeking to enroll in \ntrials.\n  Our legislation would enforce the requirement to register trials in \ntwo ways. First, by requiring registration as a condition of \nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) approval, no trial could begin without \nsubmitting preliminary information to the registry. This information \nwould include the purpose of the trial, the estimated date of trial \ncompletion, as well as all of the information necessary to help \npatients to enroll in the trial.\n\n  Once the trial is completed, the researcher or manufacturer is \nrequired to submit the results to the registry. If they refuse to do \nso, they are subject to monetary penalties or, in the case of federally \nfunded research, a restriction on future funding. It is my belief that \nthese enforcement mechanisms will ensure broad compliance. However, in \nthe rare case where a manufacturer does not comply, this legislation \nalso gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to \npublicize the required information.\n  Let me also say that any time you are collecting large amounts of \ndata and making it public, protecting patient privacy and \nconfidentiality must be paramount. Our legislation would in no way \nthreaten that privacy. The simple fact is that under this bill, no \nindividually identifiable information would be available to the public.\n  I believe that the establishment of a clinical trials registry is \nabsolutely necessary for the health and well-being of the American \npublic. But I would also like to highlight two other benefits that such \na registry will have. First, it has the potential to reduce health care \ncosts. Studies have shown that publication bias also leads to a bias \ntowards new and more expensive treatment options. A registry could help \nmake it clear that, in some cases, less expensive treatments are just \nas effective for patients.\n  In addition, a registry will ensure that the sacrifice made by \npatients who enroll in clinical trials is not squandered. Many patients \nwould be less willing to participate in trials if they understood that \nthe data are unlikely to be made public if the results of the trial are \nnegative. We owe it to patients to make sure that their participation \nin a trial will benefit other individuals suffering from the same \nillness or condition.\n  The problems associated with publication bias have recently drawn \nmore attention from the medical community, and there is broad consensus \nthat a clinical trials registry is one of the best ways to address the \nissue. Accordingly, the American Medical Association (AMA) has \nrecommended the creation of such a registry, and the major medical \njournals have established a policy that they will only publish the \nresults of trials that were registered in a public database before the \ntrial began. Our legislation meets all of the minimum criteria for a \ntrial registry set out by the International Committee of Medical \nJournal Editors.\n  To its credit, the pharmaceutical industry has also acknowledged the \nproblem, and has created a registry to which manufacturers can \nvoluntarily submit clinical trials data. I applaud this step. However, \nif our objective is to provide the public with a complete and \nconsistent supply of information, a voluntary registry is unlikely to \nachieve that goal. Some companies will provide information, but others \nmay decide not to participate. We need a clinical trials framework that \nis not just fair to all companies, but provides patients with peace of \nmind that they will receive complete information about the medicines \nthey rely on.\n  The American drug industry is an extraordinary success story. As a \nresult of the innovations that this industry has spawned, millions of \nlives have been improved and saved in our country and around the globe. \nBecause of the importance of these medicines to our health and well-\nbeing, I have consistently supported sound public policies to help the \nindustry to succeed. This legislation aims to build upon the successes \nof this industry, and help ensure that the positive changes to our \nhealth care system that prescription drugs have brought are not \nundermined by controversies such as the one now surrounding \nantidepressants, which is at least in part based on a lack of public \ninformation. This bill will help ensure that new and innovative \nmedicines will be used by well-informed patients.\n  I look forward to working with industry, physicians, the medical \njournals, patient groups, and my colleagues to\n\n[[Page S10729]]\n\nmove this legislation forward. This bill has already been endorsed by \nthe National Organization for Rare Disorders, Consumers Union, the \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the American Academy of \nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry. I thank these organizations for \nlending their expertise as we crafted this legislation, and I ask that \na copy of their letters of endorsement be included in the Record after \nthis statement.\n  Clinical trials are critical to protecting the safety and health of \nthe American public, and for this reason, trial results must not be \ntreated as information that can be hidden from scrutiny. Recent events \nhave made it clear that a clinical trials registry is needed. Patients \nand physicians agree that such a registry is in the interest of the \npublic health. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I \nam hopeful that it will become law as soon as possible.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n                                         National Organization for\n\n\n                                         Rare Disorders, Inc.,\n\n                                     Danbury, CT, October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The National Organization for Rare \n     Disorders (NORD) is honored to support your efforts to \n     establish a centralized and comprehensive registry of both \n     public and privately funded clinical research. The ``Fair \n     Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2004'' will provide the \n     mechanism whereby patients, including those living with rare \n     diseases, will have access to ALL clinical research data--\n     both positive and negative--something NORD has supported for \n     many years.\n       There are over 25 million Americans currently living with \n     one of the 6,000 known rare diseases. Unfortunately, for most \n     of these diseases, little, if any, research is conducted. \n     Thus, finding a trial is like trying to locate a needle in a \n     massive haystack. Without your help, patients will continue \n     to struggle to somehow find a clinical trial in the hopes \n     that a therapy to alleviate symptoms or cure their disease \n     may someday be found.\n       NORD also applauds the ``FACT Act'' because it will \n     penalize industry when they purposefully and willfully hide \n     negative data only to their bottom line. It is unconscionable \n     to think that harmful information has been shielded from \n     patients and healthcare providers, causing irreparable harm, \n     and sometimes death.\n       Senator Dodd, NORD thanks you for your continuing concern \n     about the health and welfare of all Americans. We will work \n     with you to ensure that the ``Fair Access to Clinical Trials \n     Act of 2004'' becomes a reality.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                  Diane E. Dorman,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                                  October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd, Kennedy, Johnson, and Wyden: Consumers \n     Union, the non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, \n     commends you for introducing the ``Fair Access to Clinical \n     Trials Act of 2004'' (FACT Act). The legislation would create \n     a mandatory publicly available national registry of all \n     clinical trials involving drugs, biological products, and \n     devices. This bill would enable consumers, doctors, and other \n     health care providers to make appropriate decisions about \n     care based upon more complete and accurate safety, efficacy, \n     and comparative-effectiveness data.\n       The recent episode involving Paxil, one of the most popular \n     antidepressants on the market, underscores a potentially \n     dangerous information gap in drug regulation: the ability of \n     drug manufacturers to effectively conceal study results that \n     reveal their products to be ineffective or potentially \n     hazardous. The number of U.S. children taking antidepressants \n     has more than doubled since the early 1990s. In the past \n     year, new evidence has emerged suggesting a possible \n     connection between children starting antidepressant treatment \n     and an increase in suicide risk. The public was disturbed to \n     learn that Paxil's manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, submitted \n     three studies to the FDA when it sought approval for \n     pediatric use. The only one of the three studies that showed \n     that Paxil worked for depression was published in the Journal \n     of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. \n     This article disguised evidence of potential suicidal \n     thoughts by calling them ``emotional lability.'' However the \n     two additional negative Paxil studies were never published in \n     any journal. Meanwhile, doctors continued to prescribe Paxil \n     for children--an estimated 2.1 million prescriptions in 2002 \n     alone.\n       Your legislation would begin to close the gap in the \n     disclosure of information discovered during clinical trials. \n     It would require trial sponsors to register publicly and \n     privately funded clinical trials of drugs, biological \n     products, and medical devices. The registry will further the \n     goal of transparency by making information publicly available \n     about trials, including: the purpose of the trial; whether \n     the trial focuses on an unapproved use; a description of \n     primary and secondary outcomes to be studied; the estimated \n     completion date; the actual completion date (and the reasons \n     for any difference from the estimated completion date); a \n     summary of the trial results; adverse events observed during \n     the investigation; and a description of the protocol followed \n     in the trial.\n       Under the bill, before receiving Federal funding, a \n     principal investigator would be required to certify that it \n     will comply with the bill's registration requirements. \n     Failure to submit trial result information could result in \n     its inability to receive future federally funded contracts. \n     Sponsors of privately funded trials also would be required to \n     disclose the same information, or face potential civil \n     penalties. If any trial sponsor fails to comply with the \n     registration requirements, the Secretary of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services is directed to disclose in the \n     registry that the sponsor has failed to turn over trial \n     results.\n       Strong incentives and penalties must be in place in order \n     to ensure that pharmaceutical companies do not suppress \n     negative safety or efficacy information in order to boost \n     their profits. These practices are unacceptable, and we look \n     forward to working with you to ensure transparency for \n     clinical trial results, and to create even stronger \n     incentives and penalties in the legislation to remove any \n     financial motive clinical trial sponsors may have to hide \n     important health information from consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Janell Mayo Duncan,\n                               Legislative and Regulatory Counsel,\n\n     Washington Office.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                        Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric\n\n\n                                              AIDS Foundation,\n\n                                                  October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd, Kennedy, Johnson and Wyden: On behalf \n     of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, I would \n     like to commend your leadership in introducing the ``Fair \n     Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2004'' (The FACT Act) and \n     offer our strong endorsement of your efforts to establish a \n     publicly accessible registry of clinical trials, including \n     important pediatric studies.\n       The Foundation was created more than 15 years ago to help \n     children with HIV/AIDS and is now the worldwide leader in the \n     fight against pediatric AIDS and other serious and life-\n     threatening diseases affecting children. In 2000, the Glaser \n     Pediatric Research Network was founded as an affiliate of the \n     Foundation, with the goal of advancing vital clinical \n     discoveries on behalf of all children. Through a partnership \n     among five pre-eminent academic medical centers, the Network \n     is currently supporting clinical drug trials and other \n     pediatric studies on a range of conditions affecting children \n     such as obesity, cancer, osteoporosis, and rare bleeding \n     disorders.\n       As longstanding advocates of testing drugs for use in \n     children, we welcome the dramatic increase in pediatric \n     studies that has resulted from the enactment of both \n     incentives and a pediatric testing requirement. However, \n     simply conducting pediatric research is insufficient if the \n     results of that research are not made fully available to \n     pediatricians, parents, and researchers. By making clinical \n     trial information publicly accessible in a timely way, the \n     FACT Act will serve as a critical next step in improving the \n     safety and efficacy of medicines used by children.\n       We are particularly pleased that the FACT Act acknowledges \n     the unique circumstances and contributions of non-profit \n     sponsors of research. Your attention to the need to ensure \n     the continued viability of critical research partnerships \n     between non-profit and for-profit funders is very much \n     appreciated. In addition, as we continue our efforts to \n     improve the availability of medical devices designed for \n     children's unique needs, we applaud your inclusion of device \n     clinical trials in the scope of the registry.\n       Thank you again for your commitment to ensuring that \n     important safety data from pediatric and adult clinical \n     trials is available to improve public health. We look forward \n     to working with you in the 109th Congress to secure \n     bipartisan support for and passage of this important \n     legislation.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                       Mark Isaac,\n     Vice President, Policy and Communication.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       American Academy of Child &\n\n\n                                        Adolescent Psychiatry,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the American Academy of \n     Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), thank you for your \n     efforts to improve the health of children, adolescents and \n     adults through better access to\n\n[[Page S10730]]\n\n     clinical trial data. Legislation that you are sponsoring, the \n     Fair Access to Clinical Trials (FACT) Act, will ensure that \n     physicians, including child and adolescent psychiatrists, \n     patients and parents have all available knowledge about a \n     medication's safety and effectiveness, so that they can make \n     informed decisions about treatment options.\n       The AACAP is pleased to have been at the forefront of \n     calling for a national clinical trails registry. Research is \n     key to understanding the cause of depression, especially in \n     children and adolescents, and access to all research findings \n     will help clinicians develop the most effective treatment \n     plans. It is this principle that led the AACAP and the \n     American Psychiatric Association (APA) to urge the American \n     Medical Association to join their call for a national \n     registry, which it did earlier this year.\n       Again, we thank you for sponsoring the Fair Access to \n     Clinical Trials Act. We are encouraged by the support for \n     this bill and are eager to work with you to ensure its \n     passage. Please contact Nuala S. Moore, Asst. Director of \n     Government Affairs, at 202.966.7300, x. 126, if you have any \n     questions concerning clinical research or other children's \n     mental illness issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Richard Sarles, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues in \nintroducing a very important piece of legislation that will improve \naccess to information about prescription drugs for patients and their \ndoctors. Today Senators Dodd, Kennedy and Wyden and I are introducing \nthe Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act, or FACT Act. I want to commend \nmy colleagues for their hard work on this legislation. I also want to \nthank them for their commitment to ensuring that finally, objective, \nunbiased information can be put in the hands of consumers and doctors, \nreducing negative outcomes, improving patient care and ultimately \nreducing costs of medications.\n  It is unacceptable that today, much of the information consumers and \ndoctors rely on to make decisions about the medications they use are \nbased on incomplete information. Patients are often swayed by direct-\nto-consumer drug advertisements. Doctors must rely on the information \nthey learn at drug company sponsored conferences, and in peer reviewed \njournals that publish largely the success stories. But what about the \nuntold stories? What about the clinical trials that were discontinued \nby drug companies because the data appeared to not be going in the \nright direction? What about the studies that are part of an application \nfor a new drug that may show a negative result? And what about trials \nthat have been conducted to study the appropriateness of an off-label \nuse? Today, physicians and their patients do not have access to any of \nthis important information, and that must change now.\n  The lack of access to this information can have real, devastating \neffects on patients. We have all heard the stories in the papers in \nrecent months. We have heard about New York Attorney General Eliot \nSpitzer's lawsuit, which charged GlaxoSmithKline with suppressing the \npublication of studies suggesting that its antidepressant drug Paxil \ncould increase the risk of suicide among adolescents. Further \ninvestigation of this issue has found that some manufacturers of \nantidepressants highlighted positive findings in tests on youngsters \nwhile playing down negative or inconclusive ones.\n  We have just recently learned that the arthritis medication Vioxx was \npulled off the market, due to negative study findings, and just \nyesterday learned that over 27,000 sudden cardiac deaths and heart \nattacks may have been caused. While Merck did the right thing by \npulling the drug after learning of clinical trial, they were under no \nobligation to share this information with consumers or the medical \nprofession. Drug companies have lobbied to ensure that only the Food \nand Drug Administration gets this information and, even then, some drug \ncompanies simply discontinue studies that they do not think will \nreflect favorably on their product.\n  What doctors advocating the development of a comprehensive clinical \ntrial registry have indicated is that without ready access to all \nexperimental data, good, bad and indifferent, they cannot hope to know \nwhat is the best treatment for their patients. Our legislation will get \nat that very issue, by requiring that clinical trials are registered in \na database that is accessible to the public.\n  This bill will create a comprehensive clinical trial database, which \nwill require that all trials for drugs, biologics, and medical devices \nbe registered in the database in order to obtain approval from a U.S. \nInstitutional Review Board to move forward with any study. Researchers \nwill be required to disclose basic information about a study initially, \nso that consumers can be aware of studies while they are underway.\n  Once trials are completed, the bill requires that the results of \nthose studies be made available to doctors and patients. There is \nsignificant time allowed in the bill for researchers to publish their \nresults, prior to them being made public in the database. Submission to \nthis database will be mandatory for all federally funded and non-\nfederally funded trials, and strong enforcement mechanisms are \nincorporated into the bill.\n  Making the results of clinical drug trials public is not only a good \nconsumer right-to-know or rather need-to-know issue, but it is also the \nethically responsible thing to do. Patients enter trials for the good \nof science. It is our obligation to ensure that their sacrifices \nprovide for the greater good of the public health. Publicizing the \nresults of those studies is a step in that direction. Patients \nenrolling in clinical trials often know up front that the likely chance \nof directly benefiting from a treatment is unknown. But patients are \nalso told that even if they do not experience a positive outcome, \ndoctors can learn from the results, which will advance science in the \nlong term.\n  This legislation is strongly supported by the National Organization \nfor Rare Disorders, Consumers Union and the Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation which is long overdue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am pleased today to introduce the Fair Access to \nClinical Trials or FACT Act. This needed legislation will improve the \ninformation available to patients and their families about the medical \ntreatments they receive. For too long, drug companies have been able to \nhide damaging data that show their new wonder drug is not really the \nwonder they claim it to be. That practice ends on the day the FACT Act \nis enacted. From that day forward, consumers, doctors and researchers \nwill have access to the results of clinical trials, so they can make \ninformed decisions about treatment options.\n  No patient should ever die because they didn't get the information \nthey needed on the medications they rely on to protect their health.\n  The legislation we introduce today is offered by a strong group of \nSenators and Representatives from across the nation. I commend my \ncolleague, Senator Dodd, for his leadership in the Senate on this \nimportant measure. Senator Dodd has a strong and lasting commitment to \nimproving the health and health care of all our citizens, and \nparticularly for the youngest and most vulnerable. I am also pleased to \njoin Senator Ron Wyden and Senator Tim Johnson in introducing this \nproposal, and I commend them for their commitment and skillful \nleadership in this area.\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives are today introducing \nalmost identical legislation, and I commend our colleagues, \nRepresentative Ed Markey and Representative Henry Waxman, for their \ntireless efforts on this important issue.\n  As part of the FDA Modernization Act, Congress directed the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to establish a registry of \nclinical trials. This provision was well timed, because it coincided \nwith the rapid expansion of internet use. As a result, the National \nLibrary of Medicine has established a web site, clinicaltrials.gov, \nthat is intended to contain information on all clinical trials for \nserious and life threatening diseases.\n  Sadly, recent studies show that drug manufacturers are not complying \nwith the requirement to list even basic information on the trials they \nconduct. A recent study showed that only 48 percent of the required \ncancer trials were properly submitted to the registry, and rates for \nother serious diseases were in the single digits. As a result of this \nshameful failure, patients are being denied important information on \nclinical trials in which they may be eligible to participate.\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\n  Action is long overdue to give the NIH and the FDA better ways to see \nthat companies and researchers properly register the trials they \nconduct. The FACT Act will assure that any researcher or sponsor \nseeking to conduct a clinical trial will be required, as a condition \nfor approval to conduct the trial, to submit information on that trial \nto the clinical trial registry. This common-sense provision will see \nthat patients seeking to enroll in clinical trials will have access to \na complete set of information on the trials for which they may be \neligible. No patient should be denied access to a lifesaving clinical \ntrial because the sponsor of the trial shirked their responsibility to \nsubmit information to the national registry.\n  Ensuring that all trials are registered is important, but \nregistration alone is not enough to see that patients get the \ninformation they need on the treatments they receive. We must also see \nthat the results of clinical trials are included in the registry.\n  The FACT Act requires researchers and clinical trial sponsors to \nsubmit the results of their trials to the registry. With a complete and \ncomprehensive set of information, patients will be better able to \nevaluate the treatments they receive, and physicians will have access \nto complete information on the treatments they prescribe. The FACT Act \nrequires companies to list the results of trials--even when they show \nthat a product is less effective than its manufacturers want to claim.\n  All of us are familiar with the way that drug companies hid \ninformation on potentially harmful side effects in children of \nantidepressants. Many of our Republican colleagues in the House \nforcefully criticized the FDA for failing to release information they \npossessed showing that these pills sometimes cause suicidal tendencies \nin the children who received them.\n  The FACT Act addresses both of these serious concerns. It requires \ncompanies to list the results of their trials, and gives FDA the \nauthority to impose civil monetary penalties on those who fail to do \nso. It also gives FDA the clear legal authority to release information \non the results of a clinical trial if a company fails to do so. No \nlonger will FDA face the terrible dilemma of knowing that it possesses \ninformation crucial to assuring public health and safety, but is unable \nto release that information to the public because of legal constraints. \nThe FACT Act assures that FDA has the clear authority to take the steps \nit needs to take to protect public health.\n  I urge Congress to take swift action on the proposals introduced \ntoday in the House and Senate. We have little time left in this \nsession, but the measures introduced today have broad support from \nmedical professional, consumer organizations and the publishers of \nprofessional journals.\n  Some companies have already taken voluntary steps to release \ninformation on clinical trials. These voluntary efforts are \ncommendable, but they are inadequate to give the public the \ncomprehensive information they need and deserve. Voluntary reporting \nefforts on the companies' own web sites will not result in a single, \ncentral database that every patient can consult. Sporadic efforts by \nindividual companies will not elicit the comprehensive information \nneeded on all clinical trials--not just those of the few companies that \nparticipate in the voluntary initiative. And voluntary efforts \nundertaken now may not be sustained in the future, when the hot glare \nof public attention fades from this issue.\n  To give patients and health professionals the information they need \nto improve the quality of medical care, we need a strong legal \nrequirement to list comprehensive information on clinical trials in a \nsingle publicly accessible database. Patients and their families \ndeserve the FACT Act, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I join Senators Dodd, Kennedy, and \nJohnson in introducing the Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2004. \nThis legislation is an important milestone for patients and doctors \naround this country because it would create a centralized clinical \ntrials registry by expanding the current clinical trials.gov website to \nprovide not only information about clinical trials they might want to \nbe part of, but also the results of those trials. If information is not \nprovided so it can be posted on the website, serious penalties could be \nimposed, including a researcher losing their ability to get future \nFederal grants.\n  It is vitally important that patients and their doctors have the \ninformation they need to decide upon the best treatment for them. As we \nall know, drugs are often the key treatment for many health problems. \nGood results about the safety and effectiveness of treatments are often \ntrumpeted by drug companies and the media, but Americans are less \nlikely to hear about clinical trial results that are not so good or \ntruly negative. This legislation will ensure that everyone can get a \nfair picture of all results of clinical trials.\n  I believe that this legislation strikes the delicate balance needed \nso that companies which create breakthrough drugs can keep their trade \nsecrets, the important process of assuring peer review in medical \nliterature can continue, and consumers, doctors and researchers can \nhave access to the information they need to make sound decisions about \ntheir health care.\n  Research is key in assuring health care improvements. Knowing the \nresults of research is key in assuring better health care quality and \nimproving decision-making by doctors and their patients. I believe that \nthe expanded website created by this legislation will be an important \ntool in improving doctors' and patients' knowledge and decision-making \nthat might well mean life or death for some patients.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL:\n  S. 2934. A bill to combat methamphetamine abuse in the United States; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nConfronting Methamphetamines Act of 2004.\n  Methamphetamine, meth, use is growing exponentially in parts of our \ncountry and is spreading across the country at an alarming rate. We \nmust act aggressively to attack the meth problem with a long-term \ncommitment of resources or we will soon have a national drug crisis on \nthe scale of an epidemic.\n  Meth is an extremely dangerous and highly addictive drug. Individuals \nwho use meth risk becoming addicted to this life-destroying drug with \njust one use. Meth use has ruined the lives of many people who prior to \ntheir addiction to meth were successful contributors to our society and \nour economy.\n  Meth use triggers an avalanche of other problems for addicts' \nfamilies and our communities. The use of meth is often linked to child \nabuse and the destruction of families. It contributes substantially to \nthe perpetration of violent crimes, particularly burglary and crimes of \nsubstantial cost and personal pain to the victims, including identity \ntheft. The stories I have heard about meth users are horrible--parents \nso focused on feeding their habit that they forget their children are \nright there with them, hungry, and without any love or care. Users \nbecome aggressive, violent and unstable. Often, the kids end up users \nas well.\n  Sadly, our children are discovering meth, and the results will be \ndevastating. According to a 2001 study by the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, nearly one in ten high school students have \nused meth. The statistics are clear: the problem is bad, and it's \ngetting worse. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at \nColumbia University reports that while the proportion of teens who know \nusers of LSD, cocaine, and heroin has dropped sharply from last year, \nthe percentage of teens who know a user of methamphetamines has risen \nfrom 12 percent in 2003 to 15 percent this year.\n  The devastation to our kids' lives is hitting our rural communities \nfirst. The Columbia University researchers also found that eighth \ngraders living in rural America are 104 percent more likely to use \namphetamines than eighth graders in urban areas.\n  And meth is not just a health and social problem; it is also an \nenormous environmental problem. There are two types of local meth labs: \nso-called ``super-labs,'' which are capable of manufacturing large \nvolumes of methamphetamines and clandestine labs set up by users to \nmanufacture small amounts of the drug for personal use. These \nclandestine labs can be set up in the woods, in hotel rooms or even in \nthe back seat of a car. They can be\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\nset up anywhere, but are usually located where there is little traffic \nor population.\n  These hazardous ``labs'' can go unnoticed for years, but they produce \nmajor chemical hazards and pose severe fire risk. Meth production \ngenerates extremely hazardous byproducts, such as anhydrous ammonia, \nether, sulfuric acid, as well as other toxins that are volatile, \ncorrosive, and poisonous. When these substances are illegally disposed \nof in rivers, streams and other dump areas, explosions and serious \nenvironmental damage can and does result. Our State and local \nenvironmental agencies are responsible to cleanup these hazardous sites \nand it is taking a toll on their resources.\n  The use of meth is spreading rapidly from the western region of the \nUnited States across the rural Midwest and to the east. The spreading \navailability of methamphetamine is illustrated by increasing numbers of \nmeth seizures, arrests, indictments, and sentences. And those numbers \nare rising across the country. According to the National Drug \nIntelligence Center, methamphetamine is widely available throughout the \nPacific, Southwest, and West Central regions and is increasingly \navailable in the Great Lakes and the Southeast.\n  Similarly, the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Community \nEpidemiology Working Group reports that, in 2002, methamphetamine \nindicators remained highest in West Coast areas and parts of the \nSouthwest, as well as Hawaii. Meth abuse and the crimes associated with \nit are spreading in areas such as Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, \nand Texas, as well as the East Coast and mid-Atlantic regions. This \nproblem, once perceived as a ``western state'' problem, has become a \nnationwide problem, growing at an extraordinary rate.\n  My State has shown that a cooperative effort--law enforcement working \nside-by-side with those handling cleanup, intervention, treatment, \nchild and family support, drug courts and family drug courts, and \neducation--is effective at addressing this problem. Thanks to the \nWashington Methamphetamine Initiative and the ``Methamphetamine Action \nTeams,'' multi-disciplinary teams situated in each county across the \nState, meth production was cut back by 25 percent last year. Washington \nState has dropped from second in the Nation to sixth in the production \nof meth. The comprehensive, holistic approach my State has taken to \ncombat meth is working well, and I believe that our program can be a \nmodel for the national fight.\n  By making intervention, treatment and family support as important as \narrests and prosecution, we are effectively overcoming the secondary \nproblems that meth creates by addressing the root causes, not just the \nsocial symptoms. By taking this approach we are not simply growing \nprison populations and pushing the problem to regions not previously \nimpacted by meth, but attacking the growth of the use of this terrible \ndrug.\n  We in Washington State have also learned that laws restricting the \nsale of large quantities of precursor drugs such as ephedrine make it \nmore difficult for users to produce meth, and this tactic has reduced \nthe number of clandestine labs in the State.\n  This approach to fighting meth use has been very successful, but it \ntakes money. And although there has been an explosion in the use of \nmeth, Federal funding has been cut. Each year, States with a growing \nmeth problem are required to go through a politicized process seeking \nFederal funding through the earmark process. And each year, the funds \nare being cut.\n  These challenges to our States mean only one thing: we need to make \nfunding to combat meth permanent. Permanent Federal funding support for \nmeth enforcement and clean-up is critical to the efforts of State and \nlocal law enforcement to reduce the use, manufacture and sale of meth.\n  That is why I am introducing the Confronting Methamphetamines Act of \n2004. This bill will create a supplemental grant to augment the \nDepartment of Justice's Byrne Formula Grant Program to provide block \ngrants to help States confront their meth problems.\n  Under my bill, States will be able to apply for a formula grant if \nthey meet two prerequisites: the State must have a comprehensive, long \nterm plan to address methamphetamine use, manufacture and sale; and the \nState legislature must commit to enacting laws to limit the sales of \nprecursor products (the commercially available products used to make \nmeth, such as ephedrine). Where a State has met these two requirements, \nthat State will be eligible to receive a Federal formula grant.\n  States have discretion as to how to use the funds. The activities \nfunded may include arrest, lab seizures and clean up, child and family \nsupport services, community based education, awareness and prevention, \nintervention, treatment, Drug Court and Family Drug Court, community \npolicing, the hiring of specially trained law enforcement, State and \nlocal health and environmental department support, and prosecution.\n  The Confronting Methamphetamines Act also provides for planning \ngrants, $100,000 per State, so States can develop long-term strategies \nto address meth. We have seen in Washington and in other States that \ncomprehensive plans to address all aspects of meth--from use to \nmanufacture to sale--have the best and most efficient results. Through \nthis provision, I want to encourage States to consider the long-term \nsituation when they take the initial steps in combating meth.\n  To assure that the best practices to confront meth deployed in our \nlocal communities are shared across the country, my bill requires the \nU.S. Attorney General to collect data, to establish a national \nclearinghouse for best practices in addressing the meth problem, and to \nprovide technical assistance to States or local agencies.\n  Like the Byrne Formula Grants, distribution to eligible States will \nbe based on State population. The supplemental allocation to an \neligible State will be no less than the base amount of $250,000 or 0.25 \npercent of the amount available for the program, whichever is greater, \nwith the remaining funds allocated to the other eligible States on the \nbasis of the state's relative share of total U.S. population.\n  The bill authorizes $100 million per fiscal year 2005 and 2006, \nelevating the funding to $200 million for the subsequent three years, \nassuring that the funds are available as the meth problem grows and \nmore States become plagued by the problem of meth.\n  I have received letters supporting this legislation from the \nFraternal Order of Police, National Association of Drug Court \nProfessionals, the Police Executive Research Forum, the Washington \nState's Governor's office, representing State law enforcement, \nenvironmental protection, health and human services and the Washington \nState Methamphetamine Initiative, and the Pierce County Alliance, \nessentially the epicenter of Washington State's response to \nmethamphetamines. These letters reflect the level and breadth of \nconcern for our law enforcement, drug addiction care providers, the \ncourts and environmental protection agencies.\n  We have to give a strong signal to the State and local governments \nthat we recognize the meth problems that they are facing, we are \ncommitted to support long-term comprehensive strategies to confront the \nproblem, and will assure availability of substantial federal funds to \nhelp confront this startlingly rapidly growing problem.\n  This legislation assures the funding and continuity of Federal \nsupport desperately needed by our State and local governments. It \nassures that States have the opportunity to develop a long-term \ncomprehensive strategy to combat meth, and gives those on the front \nlines in this battle the flexibility to use the federal dollars as they \nsee fit, consistent with their long-term plan. I urge the Senate to \nsupport this bill and plan to work aggressively with the other body to \nbring it into law as promptly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the four letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                      National Association of Drug\n\n\n                                          Court Professionals,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, October 6, 2004.\n     Re Confronting Meth Act of 2004.\n\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: I am writing this letter in support \n     of the Confronting\n\n[[Page S10733]]\n\n     Meth Act of 2004 on behalf of the entire drug court field and \n     the professionals and clients we serve. As active workers in \n     the areas of treatment, law enforcement and the judiciary, we \n     see the devastation of methamphetamine use. We understand the \n     debilitating effect meth has on its users and the \n     overwhelming impact it has on families and communities. Our \n     members contact us weekly and describe in detail the special \n     challenges that accompany addiction to meth and the \n     additional resources needed to meet these challenges. It is \n     important that communities all over the country have an \n     avenue to address this issue. The Act has the unique ability \n     to equip states with that ability.\n       The funding formula that is proposed will encourage local \n     solutions to a problem that differs from jurisdiction to \n     jurisdiction. The Act also lends itself to a multi-faceted \n     approach to a pervasive challenge. We wholly support this \n     legislation and pledge the expertise of our organization to \n     its passage and implementation. Thank you for your vision in \n     introducing this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                Judge Karen Freeman-Wilson (ret.),\n\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                                       Grand Lodge\n\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2004.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: I am writing on behalf of the \n     membership of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of \n     our support for legislation you intend to introduce entitled \n     the ``Confronting Methamphetamine Act.''\n       The bill creates a supplemental grant program at the U.S. \n     Department of Justice for States that develop a \n     comprehensive, long-term plan to address the use, \n     manufacture, and sale of methamphetamines, and has enacted or \n     will enact a law to limit the sale of precursor products that \n     are used to make this dangerous drug. States that meet this \n     criteria will be able to apply for funds to fight the growing \n     problem of methamphetamines and will have discretion as to \n     how to use the funds, be it for community policing, lab \n     seizures and clean up, awareness and prevention, \n     intervention, treatment, and prosecution. The bill authorizes \n     $100 million for the program in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, \n     and then elevates the funding to $200 million for the \n     subsequent three years.\n       Law enforcement needs additional resources to fight the \n     spread of methamphetamine abuse, and the bill you intend to \n     introduce will do just that. The F.O.P. welcomes the \n     opportunity to work with you and your staff on this \n     legislation. If we can be of any further assistance, please \n     do not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco \n     through my Washington office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Police Executive\n\n\n                                               Research Forum,\n\n                                                  October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: On behalf of the Police Executive \n     Research Forum (PERF), a national organization of police \n     executive professionals who collectively serve more than 50 \n     percent of the nation's population, I would like to thank you \n     for your continued leadership on law enforcement and public \n     issues. The men and women of law enforcement face tremendous \n     challenges in combating the manufacturing, trafficking, sale, \n     and use of illicit drugs, as well as drug-related violence \n     and crime in our streets, PERF commends your efforts to \n     introduce effective legislation to help provide law \n     enforcement with the resources to reduce the presence of \n     methamphetamine drugs and laboratories across the nation, and \n     to investigate and prosecute the criminals who corrupt our \n     children and endanger our communities.\n       The Confronting Methamphetamine Act of 2004 presents a \n     comprehensive, cooperative, multi-agency approach to \n     addressing the methamphetamine problem in the United States, \n     and PERF believes this to be the best course of action for \n     achieving long-term solutions. It is crucial to involve \n     federal, state, local, and private entities in this fight, \n     and to supplement that fight with grants that will enable law \n     enforcement, prosecutors, treatment facilities, and \n     community-based organizations to carry out their respective \n     missions effectively.\n       PERF members see first-hand the ravaging effect that \n     methamphetamine and other illicit drugs have on communities \n     nationwide. They recognize and applaud your efforts to \n     provide them with the resources to attack this problem head-\n     on. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to \n     contact PERF Legislative Director Martha Plotkin at \n     mplotkin@policeforum.org or PERF Legislative Assistant Steve \n     Loyka at sloyka@policeforum.org. I look forward to working \n     with you and your staff on this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Chuck Wexler,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              State of Washington,\n\n\n                           Governor's Executive Policy Office,\n\n                                     Olympia, WA, October 5, 2004.\n     Senator Maria Cantwell,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: On behalf of members of the \n     Governor's Methamphetamine Coordinating Committee, I am \n     writing to thank you for your continued support of \n     Washington's comprehensive strategy to reduce methamphetamine \n     trafficking and use. You have been a champion for funding \n     over five years, and I appreciate your willingness to \n     introduce legislation establishing an ongoing federal grant \n     program for this purpose.\n       Your proposed ``Confronting Methamphetamines Act'' would \n     help states like Washington implement effective strategies \n     including prevention, law enforcement, treatment, services to \n     affected children and families, and cleanup. It would \n     recognize the need for multi-disciplinary coalitions, local \n     and tribal involvement, and state laws restricting the sale \n     of precursor chemicals. It would provide planning grants to \n     help states develop strategies, as well as larger grants for \n     implementation.\n       I appreciate the chance to work with your staff in \n     developing this legislation. It deserves broad support among \n     members of Congress from the many states where the \n     methamphetamine epidemic has spread. Our Methamphetamine \n     Coordinating Committee members look forward to working with \n     your office as the bill is considered. Thank you again for \n     your leadership and support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Richard D.

Your work has been \n     crucial to the continuance of the battle to abate the \n     methamphetamine crisis in our state.\n       Of course, I also fully endorse and support your \n     sponsorship of the ``Confronting Methamphetamines Act of \n     2004'' that would further assist states like ours to deal \n     with the multi-faceted problems of methamphetamine \n     production, distribution, and use. I am pleased to note that \n     it builds on the model that we have evolved here in \n     Washington State, encompassing a multi-disciplinary approach \n     with broad collaborations at all governmental levels and \n     across all social sectors. Please do not hesitate to contact \n     me if I can be of any assistance in this endeavor.\n       Again, my thanks to you for your continued leadership and \n     support on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Terree Schmidt-Whelan,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2935. A bill to amend section 35 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to improve the health coverage tax credit, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. On Monday, the Government Accountability Office \n(GAO) released a report on the Trade Adjustment Assistance health \ncoverage tax credit, HCTC. The report confirms what many in Congress \nhave been saying since the HCTC program began--the credit is not \nenough, the program has several barriers to enrollment, the premiums \nare prohibitively high for some workers because of medical \nunderwriting, and the program is very expensive to administer.\n  It is long past time for Congress to focus on the problems with the \nTAA health coverage tax credit. That is why I am introducing \nlegislation today that will make much-needed improvements to the HCTC \nprogram. The TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act of 2004 offers \nsolutions to many of the problems with the HCTC identified by GAO. This \nlegislation will go a long way to make the TAA health care tax credit a \nrealistic option for displaced workers and their families.\n  When Congress passed the Trade Act of 2002, we made a promise to \nAmerican workers that the potential loss of jobs will not equal the \nloss of health care coverage. Unfortunately, Congress has failed to \nmake good on that promise. For the last two years, I have heard from \nsteel retirees and widows in my State about how unaffordable the TAA \nhealth care tax credit is. And I have been very frustrated, just as I \nwas when this bill passed, that we were not able to make the credit \nmore affordable and accessible for people who need it the most--laid-\noff workers and retirees who have very limited income.\n\n[[Page S10734]]\n\n  For a good number of supporters of the Trade Act of 2002, the health \ninsurance tax credit was the single most important factor in overcoming \ntheir concerns about giving the President fast- track authority to move \ntrade agreements through Congress. In my own judgment, the fast-track \nwould not have passed Congress without the health care tax credit. The \nTAA health credit was the trade-off to balance the President's \nauthority.\n  Yet, the success many of us envisioned for the health care tax credit \nhas not been realized through implementation. The number of people who \nhave been able to access the health care tax credit over the last two \nyears is extremely disappointing. As of July 2004, only 13,194 out of \n229,044 who are eligible for the credit are enrolled in the program. \nThat is less than six percent, which means that over 94 percent of \nthose eligible are not participating.\n  I must say to my colleagues that Congress has had a hand in these \ndisappointing enrollment figures. We have ignored every opportunity to \nimprove the health coverage tax credit and enhance the lives of workers \ndisplaced by trade. Most recently, the members of this body voted \nagainst the Wyden-Coleman-Rockefeller-Baucus TAA amendment to the FSC/\nETI bill. Not only would this amendment have extended Trade Adjustment \nAssistance to service workers, it also would have addressed some of the \nproblems GAO has identified with the health coverage credit.\n  The TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act makes long overdue \nimprovements to the TAA health care tax credit. First, this legislation \naddresses the issue of affordability. In addition to GAO, several \nconsumer advocacy groups and research organizations--including the \nCommonwealth Fund, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and \nFamilies USA--have cited affordability of the credit as the primary \nreason for low participation in the HCTC program. The bottom line is \nthat a 65 percent subsidy is not enough. With a 65 percent credit, an \neligible individual still has to pay an average of $1,714 out-of-pocket \nper year for single coverage. This figure is particularly astounding \ngiven the fact that the average worker, while actively employed and \nearning a paycheck, paid just $508 in 2003 for single employer-\nsponsored health insurance coverage. The TAA Health Coverage \nImprovement Act makes the credit more affordable by increasing the \nsubsidy amount to 95 percent.\n  This legislation also addresses the issue of affordability by placing \nlimits on the use of the individual market, as Congress intended under \nthe original law. The Trade Act of 2002 specified that the health \ninsurance credit could not be used for the purchase of health insurance \ncoverage in the individual market except for HCTC-eligible workers who \npreviously had a private, non- group coverage policy 30 days prior to \nseparation from employment. However, States have been allowed by this \nAdministration to create state-based coverage options in the individual \nmarket for any HCTC beneficiaries, including those who did not have \nindividual market coverage one month prior to separation from \nemployment.\n  Because of the Administration's interpretation of the law, there are \npeople who had employer-based coverage prior to separation from \nemployment who are now being covered in the individual market. This was \nnot the intent of the law. To make matters worse, this interpretation \nundermines the consumer protections set forth in the law because \nindividual market plans are allowed to vary premiums based on age and \nmedical status. In one State GAO reviewed for its report, because of \nmedical underwriting, HCTC recipients in less-than-perfect health were \ncharged almost six times the premiums charged to recipients rated in \nthe healthiest category. The legislation I am introducing today \naddresses this problem by clarifying that states can only designate \nindividual market coverage within guidelines of 30-day restriction and \nby requiring individual market plans to be community-rated.\n  Second, this legislation guarantees that eligible workers will have \naccess to comprehensive group health coverage. Group coverage is what \npeople know. The vast majority of laid-off workers and PBGC retirees \nhad employer-sponsored group coverage prior to losing their jobs or \npension benefits. The TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act designates \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) as a qualified group \noption in every State, so that displaced workers nationwide will have \naccess to the same type of affordable, comprehensive coverage they were \nused to when they were employed.\n  Third, the TAA Health Coverage Act clarifies the three month \ncontinuous coverage requirement. Under the original TAA statute, \ndisplaced workers are required to maintain three months of continuous \nhealth insurance coverage in order to qualify for certain consumer \nprotections. Those protections are guaranteed issue, no preexisting \ncondition exclusion, comparable premiums, and comparable benefits. \nCongress intended this 3 month period to be counted as the 3 months \nprior to separation from employment. However, the Administration has \ninterpreted the 3 month requirement as 3 months of health insurance \ncoverage prior to enrollment in the new health plan, which usually is \nafter separation from employment and after certification of TAA \neligibility. Many laid-off workers and PBGC recipients cannot afford to \nmaintain health coverage in the months between losing their jobs and \nTAA certification and, therefore, lose eligibility for the statutorily \nprovided consumer protections. This legislation corrects this problem \nby clarifying that 3 months of continuous coverage means 3 months prior \nto separation from employment.\n\n  Fourth, this bill allows spouses and dependents to receive the health \ncoverage tax credit. Over the last 2 years, younger spouses and \ndependents of Medicare-eligible individuals have not been able to \nreceive the subsidy because eligibility runs through the worker or \nretiree. This technicality is unfair to individuals who rely on health \ncoverage through their spouses or parents. The TAA Health Coverage \nImprovement Act allows younger spouses and dependent children to retain \neligibility for the health coverage tax credit in the event the \nqualified beneficiary becomes eligible for Medicare.\n  Finally, this legislation streamlines the HCTC enrollment process and \nmakes it easier for trade-displaced workers to access health insurance \ncoverage. According to GAO, two of the factors contributing to low \nparticipation include a complicated and fragmented enrollment process \nand the inability of workers to pay 100 percent of the premium during \nthe 3 to 6 months they are waiting to enroll in advance payment. This \nlegislation includes a presumptive eligibility provision that allows \ndisplaced workers to enroll in a qualified health plan and receive the \nHCTC immediately upon application to the Department of Labor for \ncertification. There is also a provision which directs the Treasury \nSecretary to pay 100 percent of the cost of premiums directly to the \nhealth plans during the months TAA-eligible workers are waiting for \nadvance payment to begin.\n  As a former Governor, I know how important Trade Adjustment \nAssistance is to individuals who have lost their jobs due to trade. In \nWest Virginia, thousands of workers have lost their jobs as a result of \ntrade policy. While adjusting to the loss of employment, these \nindividuals still have to pay mortgages, put food on the table, and \ncare for their families. Finding affordable health care adds a \nsignificant burden to their worries. The TAA health coverage tax credit \nis designed to help American workers retain health insurance coverage \nduring this very difficult transition.\n  Unfortunately, the HCTC program is not living up to its potential. \nThe Government Accountability Office has given us a very specific \ndiagnosis of the problems. Now, it is up to us to fix them. The TAA \nHealth Coverage Improvement Act builds upon the Trade Act of 2002 and \nthe lessons we have learned since in order to make the health coverage \ncredit workable for eligible individuals and their families. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10735]]\n\n                                S. 2935\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore land to the Enterprise Rancheria to \nrectify an inequitable taking of the land; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nEnterprise Rancheria Land Restoration Act of 2004, a bill that would \nrestore lands to the Enterprise Rancheria, a Federally recognized \nIndian tribe. The tribe seeks this restoration to rectify an \ninequitable taking of their lands for the Oroville Dam in 1964.\n  I am introducing this bill, at the request of the tribe, primarily to \ninitiate a discussion regarding the tribe's efforts to obtain an \nequitable resolution among all the interested parties, including the \ntribe, local communities, and the tribe's congressional delegation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2936\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Enterprise Rancheria Land \n     Restoration Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Enterprise Rancheria is 1 of several Federally \n     recognized tribes of Maidu Indians in the State of California \n     that function under a government-to-government relationship \n     with the Federal Government;\n       (2) the Maidu people lived for thousands of years along the \n     watershed of the Feather River drainage area in north central \n     California, near what is now known as the Sacramento Valley \n     floor, and near the confluence of the south, middle, north, \n     and west branches of the Feather River;\n       (3) in 1916, pursuant to section 3 of the Act of August 1, \n     1914 (38 Stat. 589, chapter 222), and other Federal laws \n     relating to homeless Indians, a parcel of land comprising \n     approximately 40.64 acres was purchased for Enterprise \n     Rancheria;\n       (4) in 1915, the Secretary of the Interior developed a \n     census of approximately 51 Maidu Indians, which is now used \n     for the purpose of establishing the base membership roll for \n     the Enterprise Rancheria;\n       (5) Enterprise Rancheria has been continuously federally \n     recognized since 1915 and was again recognized by virtue of \n     voting in an election on June 12, 1935, pursuant to section \n     19 of the Act of June 18, 1934 (commonly known as the \n     ``Indian Reorganization Act'') (48 Stat. 984, chapter 576);\n       (6) Enterprise Rancheria has a constitution recognized by \n     the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a functioning governing body, \n     and approximately 664 enrolled members;\n       (7) on August 20, 1964, Public Law 88-453 was enacted, \n     which authorized the Secretary of the Interior to sell \n     Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel to the State of California \n     for the approximate sum of $12,196, for the sole purpose of \n     construction of Oroville Dam;\n       (8) the State of California requested the law described in \n     paragraph (7) because Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel would \n     be within the reservoir area of the Oroville Dam, an \n     important element of the California water plan;\n       (9) as a result of Public Law 88-453, Enterprise Rancheria \n     No. 2 parcel is nearly all under water within the reservoir \n     of the Oroville Dam;\n       (10) pursuant to Public Law 88-453, $11,175 was paid as \n     consideration for the 40.46 acres of Enterprise Rancheria No. \n     2 parcel, along with $1,020 for appraised personal property, \n     for a total purchase price of $12,196.00;\n       (11) the payment was distributed to 4 individuals, Henry B. \n     Martin, Vera Martin Kiras, Stanley Martin, and Ralph G. \n     Martin, who received a pro rata share of the proceeds;\n       (12) the remaining heirs and members of the Tribe received \n     no compensation for the sale of the land;\n       (13) subsequent to the sale of the Enterprise Rancheria No. \n     2 parcel, the Enterprise Rancheria members, having lost their \n     homes, community, and traditional homeland, were forced to \n     scatter throughout the surrounding foothill communities and \n     the Sacramento Valley area, which has caused a continuing \n     decay of their culture, language, and traditions;\n       (14) recognizing that the final resolution of any equitable \n     compensation claims based on the inequitable taking of \n     Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel will take many years and \n     entail great expense to all parties, rectifying the loss of \n     the Enterprise Rancheria is imperative at this time;\n       (15) the uncertainty as to the availability of Enterprise \n     Rancheria land taken in 1964 should be settled as soon as \n     practicable to avoid further damage to the long-term \n     economic, social, cultural planning, and development of the \n     Enterprise Rancheria;\n       (16) to advance and fulfill the goals of Federal Indian \n     policy and the responsibility of the United States to protect \n     the land base and members of Enterprise Rancheria, it is \n     appropriate that the United States participate in the \n     implementation of restoring the land in accordance with this \n     Act; and\n       (17) this Act settles all claims Enterprise Rancheria may \n     have regarding any equitable compensation based on the taking \n     of the original Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel in 1964.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to rectify an inequitable taking of land owned by \n     Enterprise Rancheria, specifically that parcel known as \n     Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel, which comprised \n     approximately 40.64 acres, in a manner that is consistent \n     with the trust responsibility of the United States toward \n     Federally recognized Indian tribes;\n       (2) to restore land to the Enterprise Rancheria and improve \n     the socioeconomic, cultural, and traditional aspects of the \n     Maidu people of the Enterprise Rancheria, through land that \n     can be used for economic development to improve the social, \n     cultural, governmental, educational, health, and general \n     welfare of Enterprise Rancheria and members of the Enterprise \n     Rancheria; and\n       (3) to require that land not to exceed 41 acres acquired by \n     Enterprise Rancheria within the 40-mile radius of Enterprise \n     Rancheria No. 2 parcel and within the Estom Yumeka Maidu \n     aboriginal boundaries, if approved for trust status pursuant \n     to part 151 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations (or a \n     successor regulation), be treated for all legal purposes as \n     the restoration of land for an Indian tribe that is restored \n     to Federal recognition.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \ngrant program to provide supportive services in permanent supportive \nhousing for chronically homeless individuals, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague, Senator \nJack Reed, to introduce the Services for Ending Long-Term Homelessness \nAct. I would like to thank Senator Reed for his support in introducing \nthis bill. I appreciate his dedication and commitment to this issue.\n  The chronically homeless are about 10 percent of the entire homeless \npopulation, but consume a majority of the services. There are \napproximately 200,000 to 250,000 people who experience chronic \nhomelessness. Those numbers include the heads of families, as well.\n  Tragically, for these individuals, the periods of homelessness are \nmeasured in years--not weeks and months. They tend to have disabling \nhealth and behavioral health problems: 40 percent have substance abuse \ndisorders, 25 percent have a physical disability, and 20 percent have \nserious mental illness. These factors often contribute to a person \nbecoming homeless, in the first place, and are certainly an impediment \nto overcoming it.\n  The President has set a goal of ending chronic homelessness in 10 \nyears. The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, chaired \nby the Ohio Department of Mental Health Director, Mike Hogan, \nrecommended that a comprehensive program be created to facilitate \naccess to permanent supportive housing for individuals and families who \nare chronically homeless. This recommendation is so important because \naffordable housing, alone, is not enough for this hard to reach group. \nAnd, temporary shelter-housing does not provide the stability and \nservices needed to provide long-term positive outcomes. Only supportive \nhousing, where the chronically homeless can receive shelter and \nservices, such as mental health and substance abuse treatment, has been \neffective in decreasing their chances of returning to the streets and \nincreasing their chances for leading productive lives.\n  Not only is it right to help this group of hard to reach individuals, \nbut it is also fiscally responsible. This group is one of the most \nexpensive groups to serve. As I mentioned previously, they represent 10 \npercent of the overall homeless population, however they consume a \nmajority of the services for the homeless. They consume the most \nemergency housing and health care services, which are also the most \ncostly to provide. By encouraging supportive housing, we are providing \nthe services necessary for these individuals and families to really get \nback on their feet. We can either continue to provide expensive \nemergency services to these needy people or we can give them the right \nkind of help--the type of help they need for their long-term well-being \nand long-term well-being of our communities.\n  Unfortunately, current programs for funding services in permanent \nsupportive housing, other than those administered by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD), were not designed to be \ncoordinated with housing programs. These programs were also not \ndesigned to meet the challenging needs of this specific subgroup of the \nhomeless. That is why the bill we are introducing today would provide \nthe authorization to fund services to the chronically homeless in \nsupportive housing by providing grants which can be used with existing \nprograms through HUD and State and local communities.\n  This bill also would encourage those who provide services to the \nchronically homeless, such as SAMHSA within the Department of Health \nand Human Services, to work with and coordinate their efforts with \nthose who provide the physical housing, such as HUD. Under the current \nadministration, these two departments have started to truly coordinate \ntheir efforts and this bill would encourage and support that continued \ncollaboration.\n  This is a good bill, and it could make a real difference in the lives \nof so many individuals in need. I ask my colleagues to join us in \nsupport.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2937\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Services for Ending Long-\n     Term Homelessness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nationally, there are approximately 200,000 to 250,000 \n     people who experience chronic homelessness, including some \n     families with children. Chronically homeless people often \n     live in shelters or on the streets for years at a time, \n     experience repeated episodes of homelessness without \n     achieving housing stability, or cycle between homelessness, \n     jails, mental health facilities, and hospitals.\n       (2) The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health \n     recommended the development and implementation of a \n     comprehensive plan designed to facilitate access to 150,000 \n     units of permanent supportive housing for consumers and \n     families who are chronically homeless. The Commission found \n     that affordable housing alone is insufficient for many people \n     with severe mental illness, and that flexible, mobile, \n     individualized support services are also necessary to support \n     and sustain consumers in their housing.\n       (3) Congress and the President have set a goal of ending \n     chronic homelessness in 10 years.\n       (4) Permanent supportive housing is a proven and cost \n     effective solution to chronic homelessness. A recent study by \n     the University of Pennsylvania found that each unit of \n     supportive housing for homeless people with mental illness in \n     New York City resulted in public savings of $16,281 per year \n     in systems of care such as mental health, human services, \n     health care, veterans' affairs, and corrections.\n       (5) Current programs for funding services in permanent \n     supportive housing, other than those administered by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, were not \n     designed to be closely coordinated with housing resources, \n     nor were they designed to meet the multiple needs of people \n     who are chronically homeless.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATOR OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL \n                   HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 501(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     290aa(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (17), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (18), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(19) collaborate with Federal departments and programs \n     that are part of the President's Interagency Council on \n     Homelessness, particularly the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development, the Department of Labor, and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, and with other agencies \n     within the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     particularly the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration, the Administration on Children and Families, \n     and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to design \n     national strategies for providing services in supportive \n     housing that will assist in ending chronic homelessness and \n     to implement programs that address chronic homelessness.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. GRANTS FOR SERVICES FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS \n                   INDIVIDUALS IN SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.\n\n       Title V of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290aa \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S10740]]\n\n       ``PART J--GRANTS FOR SERVICES TO END CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS\n\n     ``SEC. 596.

Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague from Ohio, \nthe Chairman of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Subcommittee of \nthe Senate HELP Committee, to introduce a bill that we believe will \nbring us closer to helping people who experience chronic homelessness \nget off the streets, out of shelters and into permanent housing. The \nServices for Ending Long-Term Homelessness Act (SELHA) will help local \ncommunities provide health care, mental health and substance abuse \nservices in conjunction with safe, decent and affordable housing. This \nbill is another essential component in the continuum of housing and \nsupportive service programs geared towards people who have become \nhomeless in our society.\n  Nationwide, as many as 3.5 million people experience homelessness \nevery year. Between 200,000 and 250,000 of them--including at least \n12,000 children--experience chronic homelessness. They live on the \nstreets and in emergency shelters for years on end or cycle between \nhomelessness, jails, emergency rooms, and other institutions. Many also \nconfront mental illness, substance addiction or other serious chronic \nhealth conditions. Moreover, because they don't get appropriate and \nregular care, these people exact a substantial toll on our public \nhealth systems.\n  The legislation the Senior Senator from Ohio and I are proposing \ntoday would authorize funding for grants to state and local entities to \noffer services to individuals and families in supportive housing to \nhelp bring them out of the downward spiral of homelessness and onto the \nroad to recovery and self-sufficiency. Permanent supportive housing \ncombines safe, decent and affordable housing with needed services such \nas mental health, substance abuse, employment, health care, and other \nservices.\n  Research indicates that supportive housing represents a cost-\neffective investment toward the goal of ending long-term homelessness. \nIn one California supportive housing program, residents experienced a \n57 percent decline in emergency room visits, a 58 percent decline in \nthe number of inpatient hospital days, and a near elimination of their \nneed for residential mental-health facilities. A study in New York City \nfound that each unit of supportive housing saved $16,282 per person per \nyear in public expenditures for emergency care, court and jail costs, \nand other public services. After deducting the public benefits, the \naverage supportive housing unit in New York City cost only $995 per \nyear. In other words, it costs little more to house and offer \nsupportive services to people than it does to leave them homeless.\n  These remarkable findings have led the bipartisan Millennial Housing \nCommission, the President's New Freedom Mental Health Commission, the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities to endorse \nthe goal of creating 150,000 units of permanent supportive housing.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Housing of the \nSenate Banking Committee, I am deeply interested in tackling the \nchallenge of homelessness on several fronts. I have been working on a \nbill to reauthorize the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. My \nlegislation would realign the incentives behind HUD's homelessness \nassistance programs, while more funding would flow to communities that \nactually demonstrate a commitment to accomplishing the goals of \npreventing and ending homelessness. It would also simplify and \nconsolidate the three competitive HUD homeless assistance programs into \none program and provide new flexibility in using McKinney-Vento funds.\n\n[[Page S10742]]\n\n  The Services for Ending Long-Term Homelessness Act perfectly \ncompliments these efforts by making sure that communities offering \npermanent housing are also able to provide health, education and other \nsupportive services that are so critical to the ultimate success of \nthese efforts.\n  I believe we have the ingenuity and dedication to ensure that \neveryone has a safe decent and affordable place to call home. We need \nto support innovative solutions, and this bill does just that. It gives \ncommunities some of the resources they need to develop more supportive \nhousing and move towards ending chronic homelessness, and I am proud to \njoin my colleague from Ohio in spearheading this initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2938. A bill to grant a Federal charter to the National American \nIndian Veterans, Incorporated; read the first time.\n\n\n   federal charter for national american indian veterans association\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, every American knows this photograph. It \nis one of the great iconic images of American courage and \ndetermination: the Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima. What many \nAmericans probably do not know is that one of the six Marines in this \nphoto was a Native American. His name was Ira Hayes. He was a full-\nblooded Pima Indian, raised on a small farm on the Gila River Indian \nCommunity in Arizona.\n  Raising the flag with Ira Hayes that day on Iwo Jima were: a coal \nminer's son from Pennsylvania who came to America as an infant from \nCzechoslovakia; a farm boy from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; a mill \nworker's son from New Hampshire; a former altar boy from Wisconsin, and \na poor kid from eastern Kentucky.\n  One writer has called this photo `` a triumphant metaphor for the \nvery soul of the (Marine) Corps.'' It is also something else. It is a \nreflection of every war our Nation has ever fought. In every major \nmilitary conflict in our Nation's history, Indians have fought side-by-\nside with non-Indians. Native Americans served with honor and \ndistinction in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. They served \non both sides in the Civil War. Stand Watie, a Cherokee, was the last \nConfederate brigadier general to surrender to the Union troops. And Eli \nParker, a Seneca from New York, was at Appomattox, serving as an aide \nto General Ulysses S. Grant when Robert E. Lee surrendered.\n  Native American soldiers rode with Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in \nthe charge on San Juan Hill in the Spanish-American War. Twelve-\nthousand Indians served in World War I. Even though Native Americans \nwere denied U.S. citizenship at the time, many were so eager to serve \nthat they went to Canada to enlist before the U.S. even entered the \nwar. Their tremendous demonstration of patriotism finally moved \nCongress to pass the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924.\n  In World War II, more than one-third of all able-bodied Indian men \nbetween the ages of 18 and 50 served. The most famous were the ``Code \nTalkers'' from the Navajo Nation and other tribes--including the \nLakota, Dakota and Nakota tribes of the Great Sioux Nation. During the \nKorean War, two Native American soldiers were awarded posthumous \nCongressional Medals of Honor. Another Korean War veteran, a Northern \nCheyenne from Colorado, served with distinction in the Air Force and \nlater in the United States Senate. He is our friend and colleague, the \nchairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell.\n  In Vietnam, nearly 42,000 Native Americans served--90 percent of them \nvolunteers. Native Americans served with honor in Grenada, Panama, the \nPersian Gulf war, Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo. And they are serving our \nNation today in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Given the tragic history between Indian tribes and the U.S. military, \nsome might regard it as remarkable that Native Americans choose to \nserve in the military at all. Yet, not only do Native Americans serve, \nthey have the highest rate of military service of any ethnic group in \nAmerica. Today, one in four Native American men is a military veteran, \nas are nearly half of all tribal leaders.\n  Incredibly, despite this extraordinary history of service and \nsacrifice for our Nation, there has never been a national American \nIndians veterans organization. Until now.\n  Last week, a new organization, the National American Indian Veterans \nAssociation, held its first annual meeting in Arizona. At that meeting, \nmembers voted unanimously to approve the organization's charter. Today, \nI am introducing a bipartisan proposal to grant the National American \nIndian Veterans Association a Federal charter. I am proud to sponsor \nthis proposal, along with four great champions of Indian people and \ntribes: my fellow South Dakotan, Senator Johnson; Senator Bingaman; \nSenator Campbell, the distinguished chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee; and the committee's ranking member, Senator Inouye, a noble \nwarrior himself and a Medal of Honor recipient.\n  The National American Indian Veterans Association is long overdue, \nand it is desperately needed. Native Americans are the most likely of \nall Americans to volunteer for military service. But they are the least \nlikely of all veterans to apply for the benefits they have earned. When \nthey do try to claim those benefits, too often, the First Americans \nfind themselves last in line.\n  Too many Native American veterans go without urgently needed medical \ncare because they can't get appointments or they can't overcome \nbureaucratic hurdles at the VA or the nearest clinic is too far away. \nToo many Native American veterans are living in crowded apartments and \ncrumbling houses and trailers, partly because homeownership assistance \nprograms that work for most veterans don't take into account the \nspecific needs of many Indian veterans. Many Native American veterans \ndon't claim the education benefits they have earned. Too many Native \nAmerican veterans don't get the retirement benefits they deserve. And \nwhen they die, too many of their families don't get the survivors' \nbenefits they should.\n  A Federal charter does not grant the National American Indian \nVeterans Association any special legal status or favors. It will simply \nenable Native American veterans from all tribes to speak with one voice \nto Congress and to the Nation.\n  The National Commander of the National American Indian Veterans \nAssociation is a man I am proud to know. Don Loudner is from Mitchell, \nSD. He is a member of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe and a Korean War \nveteran with 35 years in the Army Reserves. He is also a member of the \nVA's Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans, a former Commissioner of \nIndian Affairs for the State of South Dakota, a former superintendent \nof the Crow Creek Sioux Reservation, and one of the most tireless, \narticulate advocates for Native American veterans I have ever known.\n  Congress has chartered many veterans organizations representing \nspecific groups: the American War Mothers, the Blinded Veterans \nAssociation, Catholic War Veterans, Italian American War Veterans of \nthe USA, Jewish War Veterans of the USA, the National Association for \nBlack Veterans, Polish Legion of American Veterans.\n  I believe the guidance and collected wisdom of the National American \nIndian Veterans Association will enable America to better honor its \ncommitments to Native American veterans and their families. In doing \nso, it will strengthen Native Americans' long and exceptional tradition \nof military service to our Nation. And that will make America even \nsafer and stronger.\n  Five Native American warriors have already given their lives in Iraq. \nThey include three members of the Navajo Nation: Army Private First \nClass Lori Piestewa, a young Hopi mother and the first Native American \nwoman soldier ever killed in combat; and a young Army Private First \nClass from the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. \nSheldon Hawk Eagle was a member of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, \nthe famed ``Screaming Eagles,'' the same unit that parachuted into \nNormandy on D-Day. He was also a descendant of the legendary Lakota \nwarrior leader, Crazy Horse.\n  There are many reasons that these young warriors and so many other \nNative Americans have risked--and\n\n[[Page S10743]]\n\ngiven--their lives for this Nation. Clarence Wolf Guts may have said it \nbest. Mr. Wolf Guts is from the Oglala Sioux Tribe and one of the last \ntwo surviving Lakota Code Talkers from World War II. Two weeks ago, he \ntestified before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs about a bill I \nam sponsoring to honor all Native American Code Talkers, from all \ntribes. In Clarence Wolf Guts' words, ``Indian people love America, and \nwe will do whatever it takes to protect our freedom from all \naggressors.''\n  By formally recognizing the National American Indian Veterans \nAssociation--America's first and only Native American veterans \norganization--America will be better able to honor the extraordinary \npatriotism of these heroes and provide them with the respect and \nbenefits they have earned. I urge my colleagues to join us. Let's pass \nthis bill this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2938\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

National American Indian Veterans, Incorporated.......150401''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Feingold, \n        and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 2939. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprovide assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in \ndeveloping countries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Assistance for \nOrphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of \n2004.\n  The unprecedented AIDS orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has \nprofound implications for political stability, development, and human \nwelfare that extend far beyond the region. Sub-Saharan African nations \nstand to lose generations of educated and trained professionals who can \ncontribute meaningfully to their countries' development. Orphaned \nchildren, many of whom are homeless, are more likely to resort to \nprostitution and other criminal behavior to survive. Most \nfrighteningly, these uneducated, poorly socialized, and stigmatized \nyoung adults are extremely vulnerable to being recruited into criminal \ngangs, rebel groups, or extremist organizations that offer shelter and \nfood and act as ``surrogate'' families. It is imperative that the \ninternational community respond to this crisis that threatens stability \nwithin individual countries, the region, and around the world.\n  An estimated 110 million orphans live in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, \nLatin America, and the Caribbean. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is rapidly \nexpanding the orphan population. Currently an estimated 14 million \nchildren have been orphaned by AIDS, most of whom live in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. This number is projected to soar to more than 25 million by \n2010. The pandemic is orphaning generations of African children and is \ncompromising the overall development prospects of their countries.\n  Most orphans in the developing world live in extremely disadvantaged \ncircumstances. Poor communities in the developing world struggle to \nmeet the basic food, clothing, health care, and educational needs of \norphans. Experts recommend supporting community-based organizations to \nassist these children. Such an approach enables the children to remain \nconnected to their communities, traditionals, rituals, and extended \nfamilies.\n  My bill seeks to improve assistance to orphans and other vulnerable \nchildren in developing countries. It would require the United States \nGovernment to develop a comprehensive strategy for providing such \nassistance and would authorize the President to support community-based \norganizations that provide basic care for orphans and vulnerable \nchildren.\n  Orphans are less likely to be in school, and more likely to be \nworking full time. Yet only education can help children acquire the \nknowledge and develop the skills they need to build a better future. \nStudies have shown that school food programs provide an incentive for \nchildren to stay in school. School meals provide basic nutrition to \nchildren who otherwise do not have access to reliable food.\n  For many children, the primary barrier to an education is the expense \nof school fees, uniforms, supplies, and other costs. My bill aims to \nimprove enrollment and access to primary school education by supporting \nprograms that reduce the negative impact of school fees and other \nexpenses. It also would affirm our commitment to international school \nlunch programs.\n  Many children who lose one or both parents often face difficulty in \nasserting their inheritance rights. Even when the inheritance rights of \nwomen and children are spelled out in law, such rights are difficult to \nclaim and are seldom enforced. In many countries it is difficult or \nimpossible for a widow--even if she has small children--to claim \nproperty after the death of her husband. This often leaves the most \nvulnerable children impoverished and homeless. My bill seeks to support \nprograms that protect the inheritance rights of orphans and widows with \nchildren.\n  The AIDS orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for \npolitical stability, development, and human welfare that extend far \nbeyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide. Every 14 \nseconds another child is orphaned by AIDS. Turning the tide on this \ncrisis will require a coordinated, comprehensive, and swift response. I \nam hopeful that Senators will join me in backing this legislation, and \nI ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2939\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assistance for Orphans and \n     Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of \n     2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 110,000,000 orphans live in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. These \n     children often are disadvantaged in numerous and devastating \n     ways and most households with orphans cannot meet the basic \n     needs of health care, food, clothing, and educational \n     expenses.\n       (2) It is estimated that 121,000,000 children worldwide do \n     not attend school and that the majority of such children are \n     young girls. According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n     (UNICEF), orphans are less likely to be in school and more \n     likely to be working full time.\n       (3) School food programs, including take-home rations, in \n     developing countries provide strong incentives for children \n     to remain in school and continue their education. School food \n     programs can reduce short-term hunger, improve cognitive \n     functions, and enhance learning, behavior, and achievement.\n       (4) Financial barriers, such as school fees and other costs \n     of education, prevent many orphans and other vulnerable \n     children in developing countries from attending school. \n     Providing children with free primary school education, while \n     simultaneously ensuring that adequate resources exist for \n     teacher training and infrastructure, would help more orphans \n     and other vulnerable children obtain a quality education.\n       (5) The trauma that results from the loss of a parent can \n     trigger behavior problems of aggression or emotional \n     withdrawal and negatively affect a child's performance in \n     school and the child's social relations. Children living in \n     families affected by HIV/AIDS or who have been orphaned by \n     AIDS often face stigmatization and discrimination. Providing \n     culturally appropriate psychosocial support to such children \n     can assist them in successfully accepting and adjusting to \n     their circumstances.\n       (6) Orphans and other vulnerable children in developing \n     countries routinely are denied their inheritance or encounter \n     difficulties in claiming the land and other property which \n     they have inherited. Even when the inheritance rights of \n     women and children are spelled out in law, such rights are \n     difficult to claim and are seldom enforced. In many countries \n     it is difficult or impossible for a widow, even if she has \n     young children, to claim property after the death of her \n     husband.\n       (7) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a devastating affect on \n     children and is deepening poverty in entire communities and \n     jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children \n     in affected areas.\n       (8) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased the number of \n     orphans worldwide and has exacerbated the poor living \n     conditions of the world's poorest and most vulnerable \n     children. AIDS has created an unprecedented orphan crisis, \n     especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been \n     hardest hit. An estimated 14,000,000 orphans have lost 1 or \n     both parents to AIDS. By 2010, it is estimated that over \n     25,000,000 children will have been orphaned by AIDS.\n       (9) Approximately 2,500,000 children under the age of 15 \n     worldwide have HIV/AIDS. Every day another 2,000 children \n     under the age of 15 are infected with HIV. Without treatment, \n     most children born with HIV can expect to die by age two, but \n     with sustained drug treatment through childhood, the chances \n     of long-term survival and a productive adulthood improve \n     dramatically.\n       (10) Few international development programs specifically \n     target the treatment of children with HIV/AIDS in developing \n     countries. Reasons for this include the perceived low \n     priority of pediatric treatment, a lack of pediatric health \n     care professionals, lack of expertise and experience in \n     pediatric drug dosing and monitoring, the perceived \n     complexity of pediatric treatment, and mistaken beliefs \n     regarding the risks and benefits of pediatric treatment.\n       (11) Although a number of organizations seek to meet the \n     needs of orphans or other vulnerable children, extended \n     families and local communities continue to be the primary \n     providers of support for such children.\n       (12) The HIV/AIDS pandemic is placing huge burdens on \n     communities and is leaving many orphans with little support. \n     Alternatives to traditional orphanages, such as community-\n     based resource centers, continue to evolve in response to the \n     massive number of orphans that has resulted from the \n     pandemic.\n\n[[Page S10745]]\n\n       (13) The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has \n     implications for political stability, human welfare, and \n     development that extend far beyond the region, affecting \n     governments and people worldwide, and this crisis requires an \n     accelerated response from the international community.\n       (14) Although section 403(b) of the United States \n     Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of \n     2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673(b)) establishes the requirement that not \n     less than 10 percent of amounts appropriated for HIV/AIDS \n     assistance for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2008 shall \n     be expended for assistance for orphans and other vulnerable \n     children affected by HIV/AIDS, there is an urgent need to \n     provide assistance to such children prior to 2006.\n       (15) Numerous United States and indigenous private \n     voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, \n     provide assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children \n     in developing countries. Many of these organizations have \n     submitted applications for grants to the Administrator of the \n     United States Agency for International Development to provide \n     increased levels of assistance for orphans and other \n     vulnerable children in developing countries.\n       (16) Increasing the amount of assistance that is provided \n     by the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development through United States and \n     indigenous private voluntary organizations, including faith-\n     based organizations, will provide greater protection for \n     orphans and other vulnerable children in developing \n     countries.\n       (17) It is essential that the United States Government \n     adopt a comprehensive approach for the provision of \n     assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in \n     developing countries. A comprehensive approach would ensure \n     that important services, such as basic care, psychosocial \n     support, school food programs, increased educational \n     opportunities and employment training and related services, \n     the protection and promotion of inheritance rights for such \n     children, and the treatment of orphans and other vulnerable \n     children with HIV/AIDS, are made more accessible.\n       (18) Assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children \n     can best be provided by a comprehensive approach of the \n     United States Government that--\n       (A) ensures that Federal agencies and the private sector \n     coordinate efforts to prevent and eliminate duplication of \n     efforts and waste in the provision of such assistance; and\n       (B) to the maximum extent possible, focuses on community-\n     based programs that allow orphans and other vulnerable \n     children to remain connected to the traditions and rituals of \n     their families and communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR ORPHANS AND OTHER VULNERABLE CHILDREN \n                   IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.\n\n       Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following section:\n\n     ``SEC. 135.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\ncombat pay be treated as earned income for purposes of the earned \nincome credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I know the hour is late, and I will try to \nkeep my comments fairly brief. I promise I will not take more than an \nhour or two.\n  What I am showing tonight is a picture of some American heroes. \nOftentimes we look at a person in uniform and say: That's a hero. \nCertainly, the folks injured and killed in combat we see them as \nheroes. But you are really just a hero if you serve, if you put on your \nuniform and do your duty to your country.\n  The other heroes in this picture are this soldier's family. We can \nsee they are hugging him and supporting him, and that is really part of \nthe definition of a hero as well. Certainly, the folks who are not \npictured here--this man's employer because he is probably in the Guard \nor Reserve, and folks in the community, people in his church or his \nneighborhood--whatever the circumstances may be--they are heroes in \nthis picture.\n  We thank all of our soldiers who are serving bravely for our country, \nwherever they may be tonight. I want to thank the conferees, who worked \nso hard on the Working Families Tax Relief Act last week, for including \nthe provisions of S. 2417, the Tax Relief for Americans in Combat Act \nor, as some people call it, TRAC.\n  One thing that TRAC was designed to do was eliminate the combat pay \npenalty. I introduced TRAC back in May of this year. The rationale for \nintroducing TRAC was to help our men and women in combat. In fact, in \nmy work on the Armed Services Committee, and with the help of Chairman \nGrassley and Ranking Member Baucus, the committee requested a GAO \nreport. We became concerned in the Armed Services Committee about the \ntax package that is available to our soldiers, Marines, airmen and \nseamen. So Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus were gracious \nenough to request a GAO report.\n  In essence, what the GAO report found was a glitch in the Tax Code, \nan unintended consequence. Basically, what they found is that if one is \na soldier and receives combat pay, which means they are in theater and \nthey are in harm's way every day, they receive their combat pay and \nthey want to claim their earned income tax credit, which many of these \nindividuals are entitled to under our Tax Code, they actually can lose \nmoney on their taxes by receiving their combat pay. That is why I call \nit the ``combat pay penalty,'' because it really does disadvantage some \npeople on their taxes.\n  I have a chart that illustrates what I am talking about. If someone \nis working in a hardware store 12 months out of the year, let's say \nthey were making $16,000 a year annually, under the earned income tax \nsystem that we have on our books right now, $4,100 may possibly come \nback to him under the EITC. If that same person works in a hardware \nstore, say, for 4 months, and he is in the guard or reserve and he gets \n8 months for his military service and he makes the same $16,000, by the \ntime he does the math and he fills out his tax form he is only entitled \nto $2,100 under the earned income tax credit.\n\n  What we are doing is, inadvertently we are putting our soldiers at a \ndisadvantage. In other words, this soldier in this example has lost on \nhis taxes about $2,000. Clearly, this is not the intent of Congress.\n  The way I feel about it--and I know a lot of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle feel about this--is while our brave soldiers are \noverseas fighting for us, we need to be in Washington fighting for them \nand their families. I think it is just incumbent upon us to recognize \nthe principle that we need to take care of those who take care of us. \nThere is no one in the world who is doing a better job taking care of \nus than our men and women in combat.\n  Under the provisions of a bill that I will file this evening, the \nprovisions are very simple. What it will do is allow men and women in \nuniform serving in combat to include combat pay for the purpose of \ncalculating their earned income and their child tax credit benefits. If \nthat calculation works in their best interest, it gives them control \nover their taxes and allows them to make the determination for what is \nin their best interest on their taxes.\n  Again, I want to thank the conference, and the Senate, House, and the \nPresident for signing it, because we did win a short-term victory on \nthis. We got this provision on the earned income tax credit for 2 \nyears. Everything else in the bill was 5 years, but we did get 2 years. \nIt is a short-term victory, something I hope we will be able to go back \nand change and make it a long-term solution for these brave Americans.\n  I do not want to speak to all the intricacies of the earned income \ntax credit because I have heard Senators in this Chamber say that it is \nbasically a Tax Code for a welfare program. I disagree with that. We \nmay have an honest disagreement about that. Clearly, our men and women \nin uniform receiving combat pay are working hard. We know this is not a \nwelfare program for them. We know they are not going to abuse this or \nthey are not going to miscalculate it. We have a high degree of \nconfidence that this is going to be good for them and good for all of \nus.\n  Anyway, I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to the next \nchart, which is the earned income tax credit. This chart shows how it \nis structured. Depending on a person's situation, if they have no \nchild, one child, two or more children, it shows a sort of range of \npossibilities, depending on what one's income is. Obviously, it is like \na formula where the numbers have to be plugged in. It is different for \ndifferent people.\n  As we can see, a soldier who is making, say, about $6,300 ought to \nget about $390 from the earned income tax credit. Whereas a soldier who \nis down on the income scale, making $1,400, should get about $2,600 in \nearned income tax credit. So, again, this will change depending on \nthe situation.\n\n  What we are proposing would allow our soldiers, our men and women in \nuniform, to take advantage of an existing provision of the Tax Code and \nmaximize it to their full advantage.\n  I am not saying that we can get this done this week. We certainly \nunderstand that we are out of legislative days, but I hope sincerely \nthat we can come back in the lame duck session or whenever we reconvene \nand really get serious about helping our men and women in uniform.\n  We fixed the earned income tax credit for 2004 and 2005.\n  Here is another chart showing some of the numbers and how it would \nwork, again, depending on how many months one is in combat. Just \ndepending on the various losses that one might have, we can see based \non this chart and the numbers here, the soldiers who are impacted the \nmost are the enlisted men. Officers can be penalized under this, but \nthe enlisted men and women are the ones who are probably at the \ngreatest danger of losing their tax benefit.\n  One reason that Senators have decided to help me on this--we have, I \nbelieve 36 cosponsors now who have signed up to help out on this--is \nbecause it is a cheap fix. When we look at the numbers for 2 years, \n2006 and 2007, we are only talking about $15 million. When we talk \nabout taxes in this country, we talk about billions or trillions, but \nover 2 years this is only $15 million. Over 10 years it is only $68 \nmillion. That is not a lot of money. That is really peanuts in the \ngrand scheme of things when we are talking about our Tax Code and other \nnumbers that we talk about, when we talk about fixing our taxes in this \ncountry. This is real money for these soldiers in uniform.\n  I close with another picture of some heroes to remind us what this is \nall about, who we are trying to help. These soldiers, most of them, are \nrelatively low-income because one has to be relatively low-income to \neven qualify for the earned income tax credit. They are leaving their \nfamilies behind. Many of them are leaving jobs, homes, all kinds of \neconomic security. Like I said, these are the folks who are taking care \nof us, and I think in the Senate and in the Congress we ought to do our \npart to take care of them.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN: Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Senators \nPryor and Baucus in introducing legislation to ensure members of the \nmilitary who serve in combat are not treated unfairly under the tax \ncode. I believe strongly that we have an obligation in Congress to take \ncare of the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives to take \ncare of us.\n\n[[Page S10747]]\n\n  As my friend and colleague Senator Pryor mentioned, the provision in \nthe Tax Code we are seeking to amend affects the ability of military \npersonnel who serve in combat zones to benefit from the Earned Income \nTax Credit. Due to an unintended consequence in the tax code, those \naffected may loose up to $4,000 in tax relief simply because they have \nvolunteered to defend our freedom.\n  This is wrong.\n  We corrected the problem for 2 years--until 2006--in the Working \nFamilies Tax Relief Act which Congress recently approved but we didn't \nresolve the matter appropriately in my judgement. I offered an \namendment during the conference report to bring tax relief for military \nfamilies in line with the other provisions in the bill but that \namendment was rejected.\n  I hope my colleagues will reconsider.\n  The men and women in uniform who serve in harm's way and their \nfamilies here at home are the last people we should burden with \nuncertainty in the Tax Code. I think we should fix this problem without \ndelay and that is why l am proud to join in this effort.\n  I applaud Senator Pryor for his leadership and hard work on this \nissue, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10747-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10747-S10750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 451--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT A \n        POSTAGE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED HONORING OSKAR SCHINDLER\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 451\n\n       Whereas during the Nazi occupation of Poland, Oskar \n     Schindler personally risked his life and that of his wife to \n     provide food and medical care and saved the lives of over \n     1,000 Jews, many of whom later made their homes in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Oskar Schindler also rescued about 100 Jewish men \n     and women from the Golezow concentration camp, who lay \n     trapped and partly frozen in 2 sealed train cars stranded \n     near Brunnlitz;\n       Whereas millions of Americans have been made aware of the \n     story of Schindler's bravery;\n       Whereas on April 28, 1962, Oskar Schindler was named a \n     ``Righteous Gentile'' by Yad Vashem; and\n       Whereas Oskar Schindler is a true hero and humanitarian \n     deserving of honor by the United States Government: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Postal Service should issue a stamp honoring the life of \n     Oskar Schindler.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to \nhonor an individual who stands in high esteem in America and throughout \nthe world. I am pleased to submit a resolution calling on the Postal \nService to issue a stamp commemorating the life of Oskar Schindler. \nPostage stamps are often reserved for individuals who have offered \nespecially significant contributions--Oskar Schindler demonstrates how \none person truly can make a difference in the world.\n  The stories of Oskar Schindler and his heroism are well-documented \nand must never be forgotten. To speak against Hitler's genocide during \nthe Holocaust was rare; to help Jews escape from persecution was \nperilous. Yet Oskar Schindler selflessly risked his own life to save \nthe lives of over 1200 Jewish men, women, and children. He also rescued \nfrom the Golezow concentration camp approximately 100 Jewish men and \nwomen who were trapped in a sealed and freezing railroad car.\n  I have had the benefit of learning about these heroics first-hand \nfrom a New Jersey resident and friend of mine, Abraham Zuckerman. In \n1942, Abraham was sent to the Plaszow concentration camp, where he \nfaced certain death--until the day he was told that he was on \nSchindler's List. He attests: ``I am one of the Survivors and I owe my \nlife to the courage and strength of this great man. His life was always \nin danger but still he persisted to do what he knew to be the right \nthing, he saved the Jews anyway he could.'' Since the day Abraham \nimmigrated to the United States, he has made it a mission to keep Oskar \nSchindler's contributions alive in the minds of Americans, and I thank \nhim for his efforts.\n  A ``general policy'' of the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, which \ndecides the subject matter of postage stamps, is that U.S. postage \nstamps and stationery ``primarily will feature Americans or American-\nrelated subjects.'' Oskar Schindler rescued many Jewish people who fled \nareas ruled by Hitler and made America their home. His valor and \nselflessness exhibit attributes that parallel the founding principles \nof America and all democracies. He devoted much of his life in the \npursuit of freedom and humanitarianism. That is the ultimate American-\nrelated subject.\n  Oskar Schindler's bravery and contributions make him worthy of honor \nand recognition. Issuing a stamp in his memory would assure that his \nstory is told to a new generation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 452--DESIGNATING DECEMBER 13, 2004, AS ``NATIONAL DAY \n OF THE HORSE'' AND ENCOURAGING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES TO BE \n  MINDFUL OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF HORSES TO THE ECONOMY, HISTORY, AND \n                     CHARACTER OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 452\n\n       Whereas the horse is a living link to the history of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas without horses, the economy, history, and character \n     of the United States would be profoundly different;\n       Whereas horses continue to permeate the society of the \n     United States, as witnessed on movie screens, on open land, \n     and in our own backyards;\n       Whereas horses are a vital part of the collective \n     experience of the United States and deserve protection and \n     compassion;\n       Whereas because of increasing pressure from modern society, \n     wild and domestic horses rely on humans for adequate food, \n     water, and shelter; and\n       Whereas the Congressional Horse Caucus estimates that the \n     horse industry contributes much more than $100,000,000,000 \n     each year to the economy of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 13, 2004, as ``National Day of the \n     Horse'', in recognition of the importance of horses to the \n     security, economy, recreation, and heritage of the United \n     States;\n       (2) encourages all people of the United States to be \n     mindful of the contribution of horses to the economy, \n     history, and character of the United States; and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States and interested \n     organizations to observe the day with appropriate programs \n     and activities.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am today submitting a resolution to \ndesignate December 13, 2004 as ``The National Day of the Horse.''\n  The image of the horse is a fixture of American society, an icon \nwhose role has changed greatly through the history of our Nation, but \nwhose status has never wavered. Even for the very forefathers of our \ncountry, the horse has meant not only transportation and utility, but \ncompanionship and a way of life.\n  Who can forget the indelible images to which horses have given rise? \nMere mention of the American West conjures pictures of Plains Indians \nhunting buffalo, dusty ranchers and cowboys on the trail for the great \ncattle drives, and vast herds of wild mustangs roaming free across the \nundiscovered frontier. Horses have been used in military campaigns, \npolice operations, to say nothing of their roles in agricultural labor \nas beasts of burden.\n  Modern interest in horses ranges from the serious thoroughbred horse \nbreeders, trainers, and jockeys whose work we enjoy at events such as \nthe Breeder's Cup, which will be run later this month, to the thousands \nof Americans who enjoy riding horses with no concern for ribbons or \nmoney, but as a welcome respite from their otherwise hectic lives and a \nlink to the past.\n  The horse industry is highly diverse, and supports a wide variety of \nactivities in all regions of the country; from the pastoral activities \nof breeding, training, and riding horses to more urban pursuits such as \nhorse shows and competitive racing.\n  In terms of economic impact, the horse industry directly employs more \npeople than railroads, radio and television broadcasting, petroleum and \ncoal, and tobacco. In fact, the industry's contribution to the U.S. \nGross Domestic Product is estimated at over $100 billion, only slightly \nless than the\n\n[[Page S10748]]\n\napparel and textile manufacturing industries.\n  While the role of the horse in the daily life and economy of the \nUnited States has changed much over the past two hundred years, it \nstill remains a strong and influential force in both our collective \nimagination and daily lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 453--EXPESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nUNITED STATES SHOULD PREPARE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR ADVANCING AND \n ENTERING INTO INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS ON A BINDING AGREEMENT THAT \n    WOULD SWIFTLY REDUCE GLOBAL MERCURY USE AND POLLUTION TO LEVELS \n        SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Lautenberg) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 453\n\n       Whereas mercury is a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic \n     heavy metal;\n       Whereas mercury is found naturally in the environment but \n     is also emitted into the air, land, and water in various \n     forms in the United States and around the world during fossil \n     fuel combustion, waste incineration, chlor-alkali production, \n     mining, and other industrial processes, as well as during the \n     production, use, and disposal of various products;\n       Whereas mercury air pollution has the ability to both \n     deposit locally and travel thousands of miles in a global \n     atmospheric pool of emissions before eventual deposition, \n     crossing national boundaries and becoming a shared global \n     burden;\n       Whereas the United Nations Environment Programme reported \n     that, on average, anthropogenic emissions of mercury since \n     pre-industrial times have resulted in 50- to 300-percent \n     increases in deposition rates around the world;\n       Whereas the United Nations Environment Programme reported \n     that global consumption of mercury equaled 3,337 tons in \n     1996, and that all mercury releases to the global environment \n     total approximately 5,000 tons each year;\n       Whereas mercury air pollution can deposit into lakes, \n     streams, and the oceans where it is transformed into toxic \n     methylmercury and bioaccumulates in fish and fish-eating \n     wildlife;\n       Whereas the National Academy of Sciences confirmed that \n     consumption of mercury-contaminated fish and seafood by \n     pregnant women can cause serious neurodevelopmental harm in \n     the fetus, including such detrimental effects as intelligence \n     quotient deficits, abnormal muscle tone, decreases in motor \n     function, attention, or visuospatial performance, mental \n     retardation, seizure disorders, cerebral palsy, blindness, \n     and deafness;\n       Whereas the 1997 Mercury Study Report submitted by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     Congress found that every region of the United States is \n     adversely affected by mercury deposition;\n       Whereas the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, and 48 States currently have advisories \n     warning the public to limit consumption of certain fish that \n     are high in mercury content;\n       Whereas, of the 4,000,000 children born every year in the \n     United States, scientists at the Environmental Protection \n     Agency estimate that approximately 630,000 are exposed to \n     mercury levels in the womb above the safe health threshold, \n     caused primarily by maternal consumption of mercury-tainted \n     fish;\n       Whereas these health and environmental effects of mercury \n     contamination can impose significant social and economic \n     costs in the form of increased medical care, special \n     educational and occupational needs, reduced economic \n     performance, and disruptions in recreational and commercial \n     fishing and hunting, and can create disproportionate health, \n     social, and economic impacts among subpopulations dependent \n     on subsistence fishing;\n       Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated \n     that the United States is a net emitter of mercury in that \n     the United States contributes 3 times as much mercury to the \n     global atmospheric pool of air emissions as it receives \n     through deposition;\n       Whereas the United States Geological Survey has not \n     reported mercury consumption figures for key sectors in the \n     United States economy since 1996, thereby creating important \n     information gaps relating to domestic mercury use and trade;\n       Whereas the quantity of domestic fugitive chlor-alkali \n     sector emissions has been labeled an enigma by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       Whereas, in accordance with Public Law 101-549 (commonly \n     known as the ``Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'') (42 U.S.C. \n     7401 et seq.), the Environmental Protection Agency determined \n     in December 2000 that a maximum achievable control technology \n     standard for mercury and other air toxic emissions for \n     electric utility steam generating units in the United States \n     is appropriate and necessary, and listed coal- and oil-fired \n     electric utility steam generating units for regulation, \n     thereby triggering a statutory requirement that maximum \n     achievable controls be implemented at every existing coal- \n     and oil-fired electric utility steam generating unit by not \n     later than December 2005;\n       Whereas other major stationary sources have already \n     implemented maximum achievable control technology standards \n     for mercury and other air toxics, as required by the Clean \n     Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);\n       Whereas effective mercury and other heavy metal removal \n     techniques have been demonstrated and are available on an \n     industrial scale in the major stationary source categories;\n       Whereas the lack of effective emission control standards in \n     other countries can give foreign industries a competitive \n     advantage over United States businesses;\n       Whereas alternatives and substitutes have been demonstrated \n     and are available to reduce or eliminate mercury use in most \n     products and processes;\n       Whereas the European Commission reports that mercury \n     mining, the closing of mercury cell chlor-alkali facilities, \n     and the phasing out of other outmoded industrial processes in \n     the United States and Europe are contributing significantly \n     to imports of mercury in the developing world;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense announced in April 2004 \n     that it will consolidate and store its stockpile of \n     approximately 5,000 tons of mercury rather than allow the \n     surplus to enter the global marketplace;\n       Whereas from 1996 through 2004, the Environmental Council \n     of the States adopted or renewed 9 resolutions highlighting \n     the importance of substantially reducing mercury use and \n     releases in the United States and around the world, and of \n     managing excess supplies of mercury so that they do not enter \n     the global marketplace;\n       Whereas many States, including California, Connecticut, \n     Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \n     Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, \n     Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, \n     Washington, and Wisconsin, are already implementing their own \n     laws, regulations, and other strategies for tracking or \n     reducing various forms of mercury use and pollution, and the \n     Governors of States in New England have set a goal of \n     virtually eliminating mercury emissions in that region;\n       Whereas the European Commission is developing a mercury \n     strategy that is aimed at comprehensively addressing all \n     aspects of the mercury cycle, including the use, trade, and \n     release of mercury;\n       Whereas the United States is a party to the Protocol on \n     Heavy Metals of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary \n     Air Pollution, done at Aarhus, Denmark on June 24, 1998, \n     which entered into force in December 2003 and commits the \n     United States to a basic obligation to limit air emissions of \n     mercury and other heavy metals from new and existing sources, \n     within 2 and 8 years respectively, using the best available \n     techniques;\n       Whereas the current parties to the Convention and the \n     Protocol represent only a portion of anthropogenic emissions \n     of heavy metals annually that are subject to transboundary \n     atmospheric transport and are likely to have significant \n     adverse effects on human health or the environment;\n       Whereas the 22nd session of the United Nations Environment \n     Programme Governing Council concluded that there is \n     sufficient evidence in the Programme's Global Mercury \n     Assessment of significant global adverse impacts to warrant \n     international action to reduce the risks to human health and \n     the environment from releases of mercury;\n       Whereas the United Nations Environment Programme invited \n     submission of governmental views on medium- and long-term \n     actions on mercury and other heavy metals, which will be \n     synthesized into a report for presentation at the 23rd \n     session of the Governing Council occurring February 21 to 25, \n     2005, with a view to developing a legally binding instrument, \n     a non-legally binding instrument, or other measures or \n     actions; and\n       Whereas the United States has taken no position on any such \n     instrument: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should engage constructively and \n     proactively in international dialogue regarding mercury \n     pollution, use, mining, and trade; and\n       (2) the President should prepare a comprehensive strategy--\n       (A) to advance and enter into international negotiations on \n     a binding agreement that would--\n       (i) reduce global use, trade, and releases of mercury to \n     levels sufficient to protect public health and the \n     environment, including steps to--\n\n       (I) establish specific and stringent targets and schedules \n     for reductions in mercury use in the United States, and \n     emissions below levels for calendar year 2000, beyond current \n     domestic and global efforts;\n       (II) end primary mercury mining in the near future and \n     establish a system to ensure excess mercury supplies do not \n     enter the global marketplace; and\n       (III) require countries to develop regional and national \n     action plans to address mercury sources and uses;\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\n       (ii) include all countries that use, trade, or release \n     significant quantities of mercury into the environment from \n     anthropogenic sources;\n       (iii) require the application of the best available control \n     technologies and strategies to control releases from \n     industrial sectors in the very near future, including \n     minimizing releases from coal-fired power plants and \n     replacing obsolete mercury products and processes, including \n     the mercury cell chlor-alkali process;\n       (iv) contain mechanisms for promoting and funding the \n     transfer and adoption of less emitting technologies and \n     mercury-free processes, and for facilitating the safe cleanup \n     of mercury contamination;\n       (v) establish a standardized system to document and track \n     the use, production, and trade of mercury and mercury-\n     containing products, including a licensing requirement for \n     mercury traders; and\n       (vi) incorporate explicit mechanisms for adding toxic air \n     pollutants with similar characteristics in the future;\n       (B) to delineate the preferred structure, format, \n     participants, mechanisms, and resources necessary for \n     achieving and implementing the agreement described in \n     subparagraph (A);\n       (C) to enter into bilateral and multilateral agreements to \n     align global mercury production with reduced global demand \n     and minimize global mercury releases, while negotiating the \n     agreement described in subparagraph (A);\n       (D) to initiate and support a parallel international \n     research effort that does not delay current or planned \n     mercury pollution or use reduction

Mr. President, tomorrow morning, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the FSC/ETI JOBS conference report. We will be unable \nto reach a limited time for debate; therefore, cloture will be filed on \nthe conference report. At approximately 9:15 a.m., the Senate will \nbegin the first cloture vote on the pending substitute amendment to the \nintelligence resolution. It is my expectation that cloture will be \ninvoked, and we should be able to adopt the substitute shortly \nthereafter and then proceed to the cloture vote on the underlying \nresolution.\n  I also encourage Senators who wish to offer the amendments that are \nlisted on the amendment list approved earlier tonight to come forward \nand offer those amendments. We hope to dispose of those tomorrow. \nFollowing the disposition of the resolution, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the FSC/ETI JOBS conference report.\n  Again, we have been unable to lock in a time certain for a vote on \nthe conference report, and it appears cloture will be necessary. We \nwill continue to work with all Members to move forward on our remaining \nwork. As I mentioned earlier, we will finish both the Senate \nintelligence reform resolution and the FSC conference report prior to \nadjourning, as well as the Homeland Security appropriations conference \nreport and/or Defense conference report as they are available.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield to me for a brief minute?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the \nlive quorum vote prior to cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this second part of the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations is winding down. I know there has been a lot of hurt \nfeelings today: You took too much from my committee; you are not giving \nenough to my committee.\n  People are very protective of what they have around here and what \nthey fear they might lose. I have been chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee on two separate occasions, and transferred from \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee today was a very important \naspect of the Public Works Committee, FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Administration.\n  I only indicate that because when the dust settles, we will find that \nwe have created a much more powerful Intelligence Committee, a much \nmore powerful intelligence apparatus, and we will find that the \nhomeland security committee, which we have created, merged with the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, is going to be one of the most powerful \ncommittees in the Congress of the United States.\n  As I said, there are a lot of hurt feelings. This has been very \ndifficult for Senator McConnell and I. We did not run for this \nassignment to manage this bill, but this is part of the \nresponsibilities we have, and we have done the very best we can.\n  I hope tomorrow people will sit back and rather than lamenting what \nthey did not get or what they felt they should get, they will \nunderstand what we are doing. This is part of the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission. Always remember this is legislation, it is not \nperfection. Legislation is the art of compromise, and I believe that \nincludes consensus building, which we have done.\n  I want to again, through the Chair, extend my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky. This has been extremely difficult \nfor him and for me, but this is part of our responsibilities. I want to \nexpress my admiration and appreciation for his cooperation in allowing \nus to move forward on this legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada for his \nkind comments. I will have a good deal more to say about him tomorrow \nas well because this has been a challenging undertaking. I do think we \nhave made substantial progress, if not having achieved everything we \nhoped, but I think we have come a long way in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/07/senate-section/article/S10759-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
