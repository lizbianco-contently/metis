Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes at this \ntime to express my sympathy to the family of Senator Strom Thurmond, \none of America's most dynamic leaders in this past century, a man who \nlived through extraordinary change in his life, a man whose commitment \nto his country was unwavering.\n  I had the opportunity in 1997 to travel with him to China. He was 94, \nI believe, at that time. His vigor and his strength were \nextraordinarily impressive to me and all of us who traveled with him. \nHe wanted to see The Wall. He wanted to meet the people of China. He \nwould tell them: America and China are friends. We want to be better \nfriends. He made very perceptive and appropriate remarks.\n  Then we met Jiang Zemin at his resort in the month of their vacation \ntime and Strom made an extraordinary speech that reflected so well \nAmerica and had so comprehensive an understanding of the relationships \nof our countries. That just struck me particularly.\n  We went out to a Chinese army base. He trooped the line of a group of \nChinese troops. I remember saying to him afterwards that I never \nthought I would be in Communist China, seeing Strom Thurmond, the great \ncold warrior, troop the line of a group of Chinese troops. But he was \nextraordinary in that way.\n  I had comeup to this Senate in the mid-1980s as a nominee and it \nwasn't a very pleasant experience. I will never forget and will always \nappreciate his\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\ncourtesy and support for me at that time and enjoyed responding a \nlittle bit to that when I was able to come back to this Senate and he \nwas leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. It was just a pleasure to work with him.\n  He lived through a complete change in the South. He reflected the \nchange that went on in our region of the country. I think he did it in \na positive and especially important way. His leadership in moving from \nthe days of segregation to a new era of relations between the races was \nvery important and positive throughout the South.\n  He served his country in an almost unprecedented way. He was 40 years \nold when World War II began. He was an elected judge in his home State \nand he was an army reservist. He insisted that he be allowed to be on \nactive duty and they allowed him to do so. I understand at first it \nwasn't going to happen.\n  He ended up in England when they were planning for the Normandy \ninvasion. A number of people were called upon to fly gliders in during \nthat invasion at the time. He volunteered to fly on a glider, one of \nthe most dangerous missions there could be. The planes would pull up \nthese gliders and get them going and just let them go and they would \nhave to find a place to land down behind enemy lines--extraordinarily \nhigh risk. Many were killed on landing. Many were killed in combat, \nmany were separated, many were injured. That is the kind of man Strom \nThurmond was.\n  I asked him one time: Strom, did you stay in until Germany \nsurrendered?\n  He said: Oh, yes, we stayed until Germany surrendered and we were on \na train coming back when they declared the war on Japan was over. We \nwere being sent to the East.\n  He was prepared to go there. As long as this country was in combat he \nwanted to be there, committing his life, his every effort to the \ndefense of this Republic. He did so in the Senate and he did so in \nuniform and as a leader in South Carolina.\n\n  He was beloved in his State, respected to an awesome degree. He won \nhis Senate race on a write-in vote with a substantial majority, the \nonly Member, I believe, in the history of this Senate ever to be \nelected on a write-in vote. That shows the power and the energy and the \nvigor and the leadership of this man. I have appreciated his \nfriendship.\n  I know his family is hurting at this time and my sympathies are \nextended to them. I know the great members of his staff, Duke Short and \nthe whole team that worked with him for so many years, are hurting \ntoday and our sympathies go out to them as well as to the family.\n  Mr. President, I know you served with Senator Thurmond so many years. \nThe two of you together have conducted a remarkable effort to maintain \nour military strength and leadership in the world. He was certainly \ncommitted to that.\n  There are many other things I could say. I will not at this time. I \njust express my sympathy to his family, his friends, the people of \nSouth Carolina, and those around this great country who will mourn his \npassing.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. May the Chair request the Senator to \noccupy the Chair so this Senator may speak about Senator Thurmond?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be honored to.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, next Tuesday it will be my honor to be \npart of the funeral delegation to South Carolina to attend the funeral \nof our departed President pro tempore. When I first came to the Senate, \nI was in the Gallery up there watching the debate on the Alaska \nstatehood bill. A filibuster was being led against that bill by the \nSenator from South Carolina. As a matter of fact, he held up the bill \nfor a considerable period of time.\n  Because of his opposition, we developed a strategy of trying to get \nthe bill passed by the Senate without amendment--passed by the Senate \nas it had come to us from the House, without amendment. It was, I \nthink, the only statehood bill in history that ever passed both Houses \nin identical form without amendment by the Senate. We did that because \nwe knew if the bill went to conference and came back, Strom Thurmond \nwould have another shot at the bill and another filibuster.\n  I remember that today because I remember how, when I did finally \narrive here in 1968 as a Member of the Senate, Strom came up to me and \nsaid: I remember you, boy.\n  And he remembered I had been part of the group from the Eisenhower \ndelegation that worked on our bill. We formed a friendship that day \nthat I never expected to have.\n  Strom was, as I have said, a distinguished member of the U.S. armed \nservices. He was the oldest officer to land in Normandy. As we all \nknow, he landed in a glider. The pilot was killed. I talked about that \nwith Strom because I had been trained to fly gliders. Even though I was \na pilot, some of us were trained to fly gliders in case they needed \nglider pilots and I had anticipated I might have gone to Normandy. \nInstead, I was sent to China. When I returned and was a Member of the \nSenate here, we often discussed our wartime service. Of course, he was \nconsiderably older than I was and his experience was entirely \ndifferent. But over the years I grew, really, to have great fondness \nfor Senator Thurmond, despite our original, really, antagonism. Believe \nme, as an advocate for statehood for my State, anyone who was going to \nfilibuster that bill was not exactly a friend at that time. But as we \ngrew together and grew older together here in the Senate, Strom became \na person who did give me a lot of guidance. At one time he was chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee and I was chairman of the Defense \nSubcommittee for Appropriations, and we did a lot of work together.\n  But my memory of Strom really goes back to the time after 1981 when \nwe had a dinner for the new President pro tempore as we had taken the \nmajority in the Senate. Strom became President pro tempore. I was the \nassistant leader. Senator Baker was the leader. We had a dinner at one \nof the local hotels. Senator Baker and his wife Joy and I and my wife \nCatherine were at the head table. When it became Strom's time to thank \nthe people there for honoring him, he started talking with the people \nat the head table, and he came to me. I had just been remarried. \nCatherine and I were married in December of 1980. Just before that \ndinner, she had informed me we were going to have a child.\n  Strom stood up and was introducing people. He came to me and made \nsome kind remarks about me. And he turned and said: Here is his lovely \nlady who has now joined our family. She is a beautiful woman, and isn't \nit nice that she is with child?\n  I thought Catherine was going to break my arm and bust my head. I \ngrabbed Strom and asked him to come over and tell Catherine I had not \ntold him that. She did listen to him for a moment or two. And he \nsmiled, and said: Child, he never told me. He never told me anything \nabout that. He said: I just looked at you. I can tell when a woman is \nin flower.\n  Mr. President, being from Alabama, you can understand the way he \npronounced that.\n  It is something I will never forget.\n  When our child came, he became Uncle Strom to Lily Stevens. Every day \nhe sat here in that chair, he would ask me about Lily. Lily, as a \nmatter of fact, last evening had a tear in her voice as she called to \ntell me she had heard about Strom.\n  Strom was really a member of this Senate family. He got to know every \none of us in a way that I think no one else did because no one else was \nnear 100 years old. He was like a 1,000-pound gorilla around here; he \ndid what he wanted to do, but he did it in a way which really reflected \nhis southern heritage. He was a southern gentleman to the core.\n  I have to tell the Senate that there are many things Senator Strom \nThurmond did in his life with which I didn't agree. There were many \nvotes he cast here on the floor that I opposed. But I can't think of a \nperson who more epitomized being a Senator and what it meant to be a \nSenator. He lived up to his principles, and he lived up to the idea of \nwhat this democracy is about. He was, I believe, one of the finest \nSenators who will ever serve in this body.\n  I am honored, following him as President pro tempore, to go back and \nparticipate in the services and to once\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\nagain remind his people who sent him to the Senate that he was a person \nwho became a very distinguished Senator whom history will always \nadmire.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am deeply moved this morning, as are \nSenators all over America today--not only those who are present in the \nSenate, but so many who have gone on from the Senate to other careers--\nabout the loss of our distinguished colleague Senator Thurmond. I think \nit is coincidental, and indeed most fitting, that the Presiding Officer \nin the Chamber this morning is the son of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, Senator John Chafee.\n  I first met Senator Thurmond when I joined then the Secretary of the \nNavy, John Chafee, as his principal deputy and in later years to \nsucceed him. Really, our first call was to come to the Senate to meet \nwith Richard Russell, John Stennis, Strom Thurmond, John Tower, and \nBarry Goldwater. I remember our calls as the brand-new team of the \nSecretary of the Navy during the height of the war in Vietnam--at least \none of the periods of great intensity--was in 1969. Senator Thurmond \ngreeted us in his office in the same way that he greeted me throughout \nmy 25 years in the Senate. Each of those years--except since his \nretirement in January that I shared with him, as did John Chafee and \nothers--it was a learning experience every day you were with him.\n  I stop to think of the men and women of the Armed Forces today all \nacross the world, engaged in fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, and \nguarding the outposts of freedom. They have not lost Strom Thurmond \nbecause they have the wealth of the memories of him. I don't know of \nany class of individual--perhaps other than his immediate family--for \nwhom Senator Thurmond had a deeper or more abiding love and devotion \nthan those in uniform.\n  This record last night covered briefly his distinguished military \ncareer, and I don't doubt others will address that. But we always \nremember that he was a judge in the State of South Carolina. By virtue \nof his age at that time--I think right on the brink of 40, give or take \na year--he would not have been subjected to the draft. He would not, by \nvirtue of his judicial position, have had to leave that position and go \ninto the Armed Forces--other than by his own free will. He resigned his \njudicial post to go into the ranks of the U.S. Army, where he served \nwith great distinction, going in on D-Day with the airborne assault \ndivisions, landing, helping those who were wounded--that was his first \ncall--and then marshaling the forces to mount the offensive against the \nGerman army, and going through those matters until victory in May of \n1945.\n  When we walked into his office, two things always struck me. One was \nthe portrait that was obviously painted in the period when he was \nGovernor--straight, tall, and erect, eyes that were penetrating, eyes \nthat reflected a tremendous inner confidence and conviction, but eyes \nthat had a soft side, because he did have a soft side. He loved humor. \nHe was very often the object of a lot of humor, including respectfully \nfrom this humble Senator. But what a tower of strength. I served with \nhim these many years on the committee as really an aide-de-camp--yes, a \nfellow Senator, but I was happy to be ``general'' Strom Thurmond's \naide-de-camp on many missions--missions that took me abroad on \noccasions when he was chairman, and missions from which I learned so \nmuch at the hand of the great master on the subject of national events. \nHe was unwavering in his steadfast support of Presidents, be they \nDemocrat or Republican, and unwavering in his resolve for the care of \nthe men and women in uniform on active duty, their families, the \nretirees. And, oh, Mr. President, did he love the National Guard. There \nwasn't a bill that went through the Armed Services Committee and \nconference when he wouldn't tug on my shoulder and say let's beef up a \nlittle bit for the Guard and Reserve here. Remember, in times of \ncrisis, they are among the first to respond.\n\n  That bit of wisdom has proven ever so true. Going back to the Balkans \ncampaign, the Guard was actively engaged at all levels of that \ncampaign. The Air Guard, for example, flew so many of the missions \ncarrying food, medicine, and other supplies to the ravaged civilians \nand others in Sarajevo. I remember I joined one time in one of those \nmissions. I remember it so well because the plane behind ours was shot \ndown and lost--just to point up the risks that those Air Guard took on \nthose missions.\n  Now, today, in Operation Iraqi freedom, worldwide against terrorism, \nonce again the Guard and Reserve are in the forefront--a Guard and \nReserve that have benefited through the many years of Strom Thurmond \nbeing a Senator and receiving a fair allocation of equipment and money, \noften in competition with the regular forces.\n  But Strom Thurmond was there with his watchful eye on the Armed \nServices Committee to ensure that degree of fairness for the Guard and \nReserve. He rose to the rank of major general. I mentioned his portrait \nas you walked in. Then, in a very discreet way, there was a large frame \nthat contained all of his many decorations. He rarely talked about \nthem. As a matter of fact, only after one tried to elicit facts from \nhim would he share facts about the combat of war and what he received \nin World War II, and the other recognitions by our Government and other \ngovernments for his contribution to freedom worldwide.\n  So I say to my dear friend--really a big brother--I thank him for all \nhe has done for the world, for the Nation, for this humble Senator and, \nI daresay, many others of my comtemporaries, as we came along in this \ninstitution on the learning curve that was often at the hands of Strom \nThurmond.\n  My final thoughts are with his family, his wife and children, all of \nwhom I have known throughout these years, and with whom I have had the \nprivilege so often to be photographed, from little sizes all the way \nup, as we do through the years with our colleagues. But I know the \nPresiding Officer's father, were he here today, would join in the most \nfervent and heartfelt expressions with regard to our comrad, our \ncolleague, our dear friend, Strom Thurmond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8821-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8821-S8822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ONGOING MILITARY OPERATIONS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this morning we had another meeting \norganized by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic \nleader, with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and the Vice Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs Staff, General Pace, together with representatives from \nthe intelligence agencies.\n  This is the third time Secretary Rumsfeld has been to the Senate this \nweek. He has been in close consultation with the Senate during these \nperilous days for our Armed Forces around the world, and most \nparticularly in Iraq. Our discussions, by necessity, were largely \nrelated to classified matters and were behind closed doors.\n  I do share with my colleagues two thoughts. I sensed by those \ncolleagues--quite of number--who joined us this morning a heartfelt \nconcern for the men and women of the Armed Forces who, around the \nclock, 7 days, 7 nights, are in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nmost particularly, and we share in the bereavement of their families \nfor those who are lost from time to time.\n  Steadfast this Nation must remain in its resolve to bring to a \nconclusion the hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan, such that the \npeoples of those two countries can themselves create a government free \nof oppression and persecution to enable them to have a very large \nmeasure of freedoms, freedoms we enjoy in the form of democracy, \nbeginning with speech, privacy, and a sense of security in their homes, \nin their workplaces, and in the nation.\n  This is a long and courageous struggle worldwide, headed by, if I may \nsay most respectfully, a very strong and courageous President of the \nUnited States, George Bush, and those principal deputies and many \nothers right\n\n[[Page S8822]]\n\ndown to the privates, sailors, airmen, and marines who are making \npossible this freedom throughout the world.\n  We will stay the course. We will meet every challenge. We shall not \nwaiver in the mission of this country. I just pray and hope the \nAmerican people have a complete and full understanding of the risks \nthey are taking and the absolutely essential requirement that this \nNation continue its leadership and succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8822-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8822-S8824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, just a day or so ago the Armed Services \nCommittee, as is its responsibility, held a nearly 4-hour hearing on \nthe nomination of General Abizaid, U.S. Army, for appointment to the \ngrade of full general. Within days, a change of command will take place \nsuch that he will succeed General Franks as the Commander of the U.S. \nCentral Command. I think General Franks has performed his duties with \nextraordinary professionalism, courage, and conviction, and his \nstrength of mind and knowledge were an inspiration to all members of \nthe Armed Forces who served in his command throughout the ongoing \noperations in Afghanistan and the ongoing operations in Iraq.\n  I have come to know General Franks quite well. He is a lovely \nindividual--he has his soft side--a marvelous husband, and he has a \nwife who has given him enormous support throughout his long and \ndistinguished career in the Army.\n  We are fortunate now to have an individual whom General Franks \nencouraged the President and the Secretary of Defense to have succeed \nhim, and that is General Abizaid.\n  General Abizaid will have as his responsibility the Central Command \nwhich extends from Africa right up to the European sector where it \nabuts with General Jones's role as the Chief of U.S. Forces in that \narea. He served as General Franks's principal deputy in the planning \nand execution of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  The committee, in the course of the hearings, was very complimentary \nof both General Franks and General Abizaid and their staff and \nparticularly the men and women in the Armed Forces who executed their \nplans, especially in the historic, stunning, 17-day advance to Baghdad \nthat led to the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime.\n  We all recognized throughout that hearing, as we did this morning in \nour briefings with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and GEN Peter Pace, \nthat this operation is continuing in terms of the risks to the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces every hour of the day. They are courageously \nfacing those risks, and we must stay the course in this situation.\n  General Abizaid, throughout his hearing, repeatedly said he is \nprepared to pick up the responsibilities of General Franks and stay \nthat course and bring, from the military perspective, the fastest \npossible conclusion to the hostilities, such that Ambassador Bremer, \nworking in parallel with CENTCOM, can reestablish a form of government \nunder the control of the Iraqi people, and to bring to the Iraqi people \nthe basic necessities of life, be it electricity, sewage, or otherwise.\n\n  Now, the most challenging phase of the military operation, as we said \nin the course of the hearings, really once the major combat was \nsecured, was finally bringing the situation under control to provide a \nsense of security throughout Iraq, and that is being done. We are \nmaking progress.\n\n[[Page S8825]]\n\n  He assured us that progress is being made and that he has the \nexperience to carry it forward with his long distinguished career in \nthe Army. He has been a part of the Central Command officer corps on \nfour occasions in his career. So he does have extraordinary background, \na unique background, to take on this responsible post.\n  He was joined by his lovely wife Kathleen in the course of the \nconfirmation proceedings. He was so respectful to his wife, which the \nrecord reflects. They have three children, all of whom are of adult age \nnow, who are actively working one way or another in the cause of \nfreedom in various parts of the world.\n  He also brings experience with regard to joint duty, joint \nresponsibilities. That means the combined efforts of the Army, the \nNavy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and such other areas of military \nparticipation.\n  I want to pay tribute to the civilians in the Department of Defense. \nThey, too, are present throughout Iraq and accepting a very high level \nof risk in supporting the troops in their missions.\n  His prior assignments were as Director of the Joint Staff, Director \nfor Strategic Plans and Policy, J-5, on the Joint Staff, and a \nparticipant in joint operations in Kosovo and Bosnia, and in northern \nIraq following Operation Desert Storm. He was integral in that \nsituation. All of this eminently qualifies him for the challenges of \ncommanding general of the U.S. Central Command.\n  He brings a unique perspective to this post. He is truly an expert \nand a student in this region. He is currently serving his fifth tour of \nduty in the Middle East. He is fluent in Arabic and has a proud--and I \nunderline this, a proud--family heritage closely tied to the cultures \nof this region of the world.\n  He is the son of a man who served this Nation as an enlisted man in \nthe U.S. Navy in World War II. So he comes from a family with \nlongstanding service to this Nation.\n  I had the joy of talking with his wife, and we reminisced about how \nher father was a medical doctor, serving in the combat zones of France \nin World War I, as did my father serve as a doctor in the Fifth \nDivision in the trenches in France in World War I.\n  That concludes my remarks with regard to General Abizaid. I am \npleased this morning that the Senate has confirmed him and we will \nshortly notify the President.\n\n\n                   Nomination of Mark E. Ferguson III\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I acknowledge that, as a body, we have \njust promoted Captain of the U.S. Navy Mark Ferguson to the rank of \nadmiral. He will receive that promotion in due course. I hope to be \npresent.\n  Many Senators know Mark Ferguson. Perhaps their first recollection of \nhim as a young officer is he was an aide-de-camp to the NATO Supreme \nAllied Commander. In that capacity, he made many visits to the offices \nof Senators, and on the occasions when General Clark was hosting \ncongressional delegations in the NATO command area, this wonderful \nnaval officer was integral in making the arrangements. He is a \nmarvelous family man, what we call a black-shoe naval officer, which \nmeans he is proud of the shoes he has worn on the decks of all types of \nsurface vessels throughout his career. He is a sailor's sailor and \nbrings to this new post a marvelous background of achievement. We wish \nhim and his family well in his new post as a young frocked admiral, \nwhich will take place during the course of this summer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8825-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENTS--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, let me add my voice to those of my \ncolleagues who last evening and this morning have expressed sympathy to \nthe families of Senator Strom Thurmond. I was privileged to serve in \nthis Chamber for many years while Senator Strom Thurmond was a Senator. \nHe was quite a remarkable American. He was a hero in many ways. His \nlife was controversial in some ways.\n  I talked to Strom Thurmond one day about the Second World War. \nAmericans should know, when he was in his 40s, this man volunteered for \nservice in the Second World War, volunteered to get in a glider to fly \nat night and crash-land behind enemy lines, behind German lines. All of \nthe rest in that glider were young kids, 18, 19, 20-year-old GIs. This \n40-plus-year-old lawyer and judge who volunteered for service in the \nSecond World War was in that glider that crash-landed behind enemy \nlines.\n  He was quite a remarkable American and had a remarkable political \ncareer. In his later years as he suffered health challenges and \ndifficulties, but he never complained, ever. He showed up for all of \nthe votes in the Senate even at times when it appeared to us it was \ndifficult for him to do so.\n  The American people, I know, will thank Senator Strom Thurmond for \nthe service he gave to his country. I wanted to add my voice to the \nmany others in this Chamber who wish to remember the memory of this \nremarkable American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8826-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8826-S8827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONGRESSIONAL CEMETERY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I call to the attention of the Senate and \nthe country something that is important. Some while ago I went to what \nis called the Congressional Cemetery here in Washington, DC. I want to \nstate why I did that.\n  I went to visit a gravesite of a man named Scarlet Crow, an American \nIndian. He came to Washington, DC, in 1867 with some other American \nIndians from my part of the country, a member of the Wahpeton-Sisseton \nSioux Tribe. He came here to negotiate a treaty. He was found under the \nOccoquan bridge one morning, dead. The death certificate said Scarlet \nCrow committed suicide. I actually got a record of the investigation of \nScarlet Crow's death--remember, now, this is 1867--and discovered the \npolice reports in Alexandria, VA, and the investigator who investigated \nScarlet Crow's death seem to suggest that Scarlet Crow was murdered. He \ndid not commit suicide, in fact, he was murdered. He was found lying \nunder a bridge with a blanket neatly folded over him. They say he \nhanged himself. The police investigators said the branch from which \nthey allege Scarlet Crow hanged himself could not have held a 6-year-\nold child.\n  That was a different time. American Indians came to this town to \nnegotiate treaties. This man, Scarlet Crow, never returned to the \nDakotas because he died under the Occoquan bridge under mysterious and \nstrange circumstances. It appears his death was not fully investigated \nor resolved. The death certificate simply says he committed suicide.\n  Because I was interested in this and because he came from a part of \nthe country where I reside, I went to the cemetery one day to find \nScarlet Crow's gravesite. Here is Scarlet Crow's tombstone. It is at a \nplace called the Congressional Cemetery. The Congressional Cemetery is \na place I had not previously visited. It is here in Washington, DC. It \nholds the bodies of many Congressmen and Senators and others. It was \nfounded in 1807 by a group of citizens residing in the eastern section \nof the new Federal city of Washington. Immediately, it became the sole \nburial place in Washington for Members of Congress. For over 60 years, \nMembers of Congress and other Government officials were interred at \nwhat was known as Congressional Cemetery. The Government appropriated \nmoney to help construct some buildings, roads, and walls and to make \nother site improvements.\n  Other than relatively small and very infrequent Federal dollars, \nGovernment support ended many decades ago and the cemetery has fallen \ninto disrepair. It is a rather forlorn place, as a matter of fact. I \nwill show some pictures. This is the entrance to Congressional \nCemetery. You can see the beat-up roads. Let me show an example of the \nroads inside the Congressional Cemetery. This, one would think, would \nbe a place of honor, a place that is repaired and made to look \npresentable. Instead, here is what the Congressional Cemetery appears \nlike to those who visit it. Roads in desperate disrepair. This does not \nlook like a cemetery that has been maintained at all. It has not been.\n  Here is another picture of what the cemetery looks like inside. Roads \nin disrepair, grass growing out of the middle of those roads.\n  One wonders why, with a Congressional Cemetery, which was the burial \nplace for so many Members of Congress, and many others over so many \nyears, why the Federal Government and Congress would not restore it to \nits place of honor.\n  I am pleased that some of my colleagues, at my request, included some \nsmall amount of money in the Legislative Branch appropriations bill in \nFY2002, and a bit earlier, as well.\n  As we begin the appropriations process this year, I think in the \nhonor of those who are laid to rest in that Congressional Cemetery, we \nreally do need to do what is necessary to make that cemetery a place of \nhonor.\n  Let me discuss a couple of the people who are buried at this \ncemetery. Vice President Elbridge Gerry is buried at the cemetery. I \nhave a picture showing his tombstone. This is a tombstone of former \nVice President of the United States Elbridge Gerry. He is buried in the \ncemetery.\n  There is a term, ``gerrymandering,'' in politics that many will \nrecognize. Gerrymandering comes from Elbridge Gerry.\n  His marker describes he was born in 1744, died in 1814. It quotes on \nhis words on his grave marker:\n\n       It is the duty of every man, though he may have but one day \n     to live, to devote that day to the good of his country.\n\n  These words describe how Gerry lived. In fact, the day that Gerry \ndied he had to get to the temporary Senate Chambers in the Patent \nOffice building so he could preside over the Senate. British troops \nburned the Capitol in the War of 1812 and the Senate was functioning \nfrom a temporary location in 1814. In those days, the Vice President \npresided over the Senate almost daily because the President pro tempore \ndid not have a continuous office. On November 23, 1814, determined to \npreside over the Senate, Gerry suffered a fatal stroke.\n  At that time, Members of the Senate gathered in their chairs at the \ncustomary hour. Upon hearing the reports that Vice President Gerry had \ndied, the body voted to send two Senators to the Vice President's home \nto ``ascertain the fact.'' When they returned with confirmation, the \nSenate appointed a joint committee to ``consider and report measures \nmost proper to manifest the public respect for the memory of the \ndeceased,'' and then the Senate adjourned. On the following day, the \nSenate ordered that the President's chair ``be shrouded with black \nduring the present session; and as a further testimony of respect for \nthe deceased, the members of the Senate will go into mourning, and wear \nblack crape around the left arm for thirty days.''\n  Gerry is the only signer of the Declaration of Independence buried in \nWashington, DC. On the Fourth of July, there is annually an event at \nhis tomb in the Congressional Cemetery with the Sons and Daughters of \nthe American Revolution.\n  There is another person buried at the cemetery who is an interesting \nperson. His name is Issac Bassett. He was the second page who served in \nthe U.S. Senate. He came to work in the Senate at age 9 in 1831. He \nnever left. He worked there until 1895. He came to work at age 9 as a \npage in the U.S. Senate, and he worked here for 64 years. One wonders \nwhether any of the current pages will work continuously for the next 64 \nyears. I don't expect so. He was here even longer than the longest \nserving U.S. Senator, the late Strom Thurmond. He is buried at the \ncemetery. Right next to him is a larger marker for Alexander Bache, the \nfounder of the U.S. Coastal Survey and a charter member of the National \nAcademies of Science and its first president.\n\n[[Page S8827]]\n\n  In addition to the nearly 80 Members of the House and Senate buried \nin the Congressional Cemetery, there are also 128 cenotaphs erected to \nhonor former Members.\n  Here is what they look like.\n  The latest cenotaphs were for Speaker Tip O'Neill, Hale Boggs, and \nNicholas Begich. It is something that has been done for quite some \nwhile. There is currently some interest in placing a cenotaph for our \nrecently departed colleague, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  These cenotaphs were designed by the distinguished Capitol Architect, \nBenjamin Henry Latrobe.\n  As transportation improved, it became custom to remove remains to a \ncongressman's home state for burial, but a cenotaph was placed in the \nCongressional Cemetery in their memory. The practice ceased in 1877.\n  It is my hope that this Congress will take a look at this cemetery \nand understand that the Congressional Cemetery is the final resting \nplace of nearly 80 Members of the House and the Senate, a signer of the \nDeclaration of Independence and two Vice Presidents. It is where you \nwill find the grave of John Phillip Sousa. You will see the gravestone \nof J. Edgar Hoover. It is quite a remarkable cemetery.\n  Let me again show a photograph that shows the entrance and the roads \nin this cemetery. It is in desperate, desperate disrepair. The \nCongressional Cemetery ought to be a place of honor. It is the final \nresting place for many who served this country with great distinction \nfor so many years.\n  As this Congress considers what our responsibilities are and what we \ncan and should do, it is my hope that we will invest the small amount \nof resources necessary to once again provide the honor and majesty that \nshould accompany this monument of ourselves called the Congressional \nCemetery.\n\n  Cemeteries have a way of casting personalities. Everywhere you go at \nthe Congressional Cemetery, you can't help but notice strong \npersonalities who served this country over its more than two centuries.\n  I indicated when I started that this cemetery doesn't belong to the \nU.S. Government. It is run by a nonprofit organization. But when the \ncemetery was started in 1807, it received financial support from the \nfederal government. It was created by a group of citizens who wanted it \nto become the sole burial place in Washington, DC, for Members of \nCongress. And over nearly two centuries--Senators, Congressmen, and \npublic officials who served this country in a remarkable way have found \ntheir way to this final resting place in the Congressional Cemetery. It \nis a shame, in my judgment, for it to have fallen into such desperate \ndisrepair.\n  My hope is that in the coming couple of weeks in the appropriations \nprocess, we may once again continue to make some progress to address \nit. I have spoken with Mr. Byrd, the Senator from West Virginia, at \nsome length about this and with other colleagues. I think all recognize \nthat this is something to which we should pay some attention. I know \nthere are many other very big issues we deal with here in the Senate. \nBut this is something that I think is important to the memory of who we \nare, who served our country, how we treat them in death, and how we \nrespect their memories. We can and should do better to bring a sense of \nrepair and majesty to the Congressional Cemetery.\n  It is not too far from this building. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to go to the Congressional Cemetery and drive down those \nroads full of potholes in great disrepair and ask yourself if we don't \nhave an obligation to do something about it. I hope so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8827-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8827-S8830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to proceed in morning business \nto briefly discuss two totally different subjects, if I may.\n  I rise initially to acknowledge the passing of a good friend of mine. \nPeople may find it strange to hear the Senator from Delaware say that, \nbecause they are used to so much hyperbole from all of us in the \nSenate, in Congress, and many in public office. They find it difficult \nto believe that people with disparately different views, as Strom \nThurmond and I had, were good friends.\n  I received a call not too many weeks ago from Nancy, Strom Thurmond's \nwife, telling me she had just spoken to the Senator. To use Nancy's \nphrase, she said that Strom ``was now on God's time, Joe.'' I wondered \nfor a moment about exactly what she meant. She went on to say that he \ndoesn't have much time left, his body is shutting down.\n  She said he made a request which both flattered me greatly and \nsaddened me significantly. She said he asked her to ask me whether or \nnot I would deliver a eulogy for him at his burial, which is going to \ntake place on Tuesday next--this coming Tuesday.\n  It might come as a surprise to a lot of people that on Tuesday, \nsomewhere approaching 4 or 5 o'clock, people--including representatives \nfrom Strom's family--will stand up to speak of him and that I will be \namong them. I am a guy who as a kid was energized, angered, emboldened, \nand outraged all at the same time by the treatment of African Americans \nin my State--a border State--and throughout the South. When I was not \nmuch older than the young pages who are now sitting down there I \nliterally ran for public office and got involved in public office and \npolitics because I thought I would have the ability to play a little \ntiny part in ending the awful treatment of African Americans. I will \nstand up to speak about Strom Thurmond.\n  In the 1950s I was a child in grade school, and in the late 1950s and \ninto the 1960s I was in high school. As hard as it is to believe now, \nthat was an era where, when you turned on your television, you were as \nlikely to see ``Bull'' Conner and his German Shepherd dogs attacking \nblack women marching after church on Sunday to protest their \ncircumstance, or George Wallace standing in a doorway of a university, \nor Orville Faubus.\n  This all started to seep into my consciousness when I was in grade \nschool, as it did, I suspect, for everyone in my generation. It \nanimated my interest, as I said, and my anger. I was not merely \nintellectually repelled by what was going on in the South particularly \nat the time, I was, as is probably a legitimate criticism of me, angry \nabout it and outraged about it.\n  The idea that I would come to the Senate at age 29--to be precise, I \ngot elected at age 29; by the time I got sworn in, I turned 30--and 2 \nyears later to be serving on a committee with J. Strom Thurmond, him \nthe most senior Republican and me the most junior not only Democrat but \njunior member of the committee. Over the next 28 years he and I would \nbecome friends. He and I would, in some instances, have an intimate \nrelationship.\n  The idea that my daughter, who is now a 22-year-old grown woman, \nwould, to this day, in her bedroom, have one picture sitting on her \ndresser of all the pictures she has since she was a child. From the \nmoment she was born--her father was a Senator and her entire life I \nhave been a Senator--she has had the privilege of being able to meet \nSenators and Presidents and kings and queens. She has one picture \nsitting on her bureau. It startled me when I realized it the other \nnight. She does not live at home. She, like all young people, is on her \nown. It is a picture of her and Strom Thurmond, taken when she was 9 \nyears old, sitting on her desk.\n  If you had told me--first off, if you had told me when I was 20 years \nold I was going to have a child, that would have been hard to believe. \nBut if you told me when I was 29 years old--when I did have two \nchildren--that one of my children, as I approached the Senate roughly \n30 years later, would have a childhood picture of her or him in Strom \nThurmond's office, standing next to his desk with his arm around her, \nand it was kept on her bureau, I would have said: You have insulted me. \nDon't do that.\n  The only point I want to make today, as I do not intend at this \nmoment to attempt to eulogize Strom, is that I think one of the \nincredible aspects of our democracy--even more precisely, our \nGovernment, our governmental system--that is lost today on so many is \nit has built into it the mechanisms that allow you not only to see the \nworst in what you abhor and fight it but see the best in people with \nwhom you have very profound philosophic disagreement.\n\n[[Page S8828]]\n\n  There is an old expression: Politics makes strange bedfellows. That \nis read today by most young people, or anyone who hears it, as meaning \nwhat it maybe initially meant: that they are strange bedfellows because \npeople need things from each other, and they compromise. So you end up \nbeing aligned with someone with whom you disagree, out of self-\ninterest.\n  But the majesty of this place in which I stand--this Senate, the \nfloor of this place, the floor of the Senate at this moment--is it has \nanother impact on people I do not think many historians have written \nvery well about, and I think it is almost hard to understand, even \nharder to articulate; and that is, it produces relationships that are a \nconsequence of you looking at the best in your opponent, the best in \nthe people with whom you serve, the best about their nature.\n\n  I remember, as a young Senator--I guess I was 31--wandering on the \nfloor one day. New Senators will not like what I am about to say, but \nwhen you are a newer Senator, you have less hectic Senate \nresponsibilities than you do when you are a more senior Senator. You \nare no less important. But being chairman of a committee gives you the \nhonor of turning your lights on and turning them off, meaning you are \nthe first and last there. When you are not a senior Member, you are not \nrequired to do that as much.\n  So I was wandering literally onto the floor, like my friend from \nMontana just has, and there was a debate going on.\n  (Mr. BURNS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. One of my colleagues, who also became a friend, was \nrailing against something I felt very strongly about. And at the time, \nbecause of the circumstance in which I got here, I was meeting \nregularly, once a week, with one of the finest men I ever knew, the \nthen-majority leader Senator Mike Mansfield.\n  When I got here, between the date I got elected and the date I \narrived, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident and \nI was not crazy about being here. Senator Mansfield, being the great \nman he was, took on the role of sort of a Dutch uncle. He would tell me \nwhat my responsibility was and why I should stay in the Senate.\n  And then, without my knowing it, really, at the time--looking back, \nit is crystal clear--he would ask me to come and meet with him in his \noffice once a week and talk about what I was doing. But he acted sort \nof like he was the principal and I was the young teacher, and I was \ncoming to tell him how my classes were going. But, really, it was just \nto take my pulse and see how I was doing.\n  Anyway, I walked on the floor one day, and a particular friend of \nmine, Jesse Helms--he has become a close friend, God love him. He is in \nNorth Carolina now in retirement--he was going on about something I had \na very serious disagreement with.\n  I walked into Senator Mansfield's office--which was out that door--\nand I sat down with him. He said: How is it going? And I began to rail \nabout how could this Senator say such and such a thing? It had to do \nwith the Americans with Disabilities Act or what was being discussed \nthen. And Senator Mansfield, in his way, just let me go on, and then he \nsaid: Joe--I will not bore you with the whole story. This relates to \nStrom--he said: Joe, you should understand one thing. And he told me \nthe story about Harry Truman.\n  When Harry Truman first got to the Senate--I will paraphrase this--he \nwrote back to his wife Bess and said: I can't believe I am here. I \ncan't believe how I got here with all these great men.\n  Apparently, not long thereafter, he wrote back to Bess and said he \ncouldn't understand how all these other guys got here.\n  Well, he told me that story. And he said: Let me tell you, every \nsingle solitary man and woman with whom you will serve in the Senate \nhas something very special that their constituency sees in them. And \nyour job is to look for that.\n  I can't imagine anybody saying that today, can you? I can't imagine, \nin this raw political environment we are in, somebody having the \ninsight Mike Mansfield had and telling a novitiate, if you will, a new, \nyoung Senator, that part of my job was to look for that thing in my \ncolleague, a colleague with whom I have a bitter disagreement, to look \nfor that thing in him that his constituency recognized which was \nspecial and sent him here.\n  Maybe subconsciously, because of that, I became one of Strom \nThurmond's close friends and, as his AA will tell you, one of his \nprotectors, especially as he got older. Mike Mansfield was right. I \nnever called Mike Mansfield ``Mike.'' I am standing here as a senior \nSenator saying Mike Mansfield. I never called him Mike until the day he \ndied. I called him Mr. Leader. And Strom Thurmond had a very special \npiece of him that his constituents saw that had nothing to do with the \nmost celebrated aspects of his career.\n  The most celebrated aspects of his career were the ones I abhor the \nmost: The filibuster to fight civil rights and to keep black Americans \nin the shadow of white Americans or signing the Southern Manifesto.\n  It is funny--I say to my friend from Montana--I actually got tied up \nwith a lot of Southerners.\n  Senator John Stennis became my friend. I had his office. I have the \ntable he presented to me in the conference room that had been Richard \nRussell's, upon which--I am told--the Southern Manifesto was signed. I \nmight note parenthetically, if you all know John Stennis, he talked at \nyou like this all the time. He would hold his hand like this. When I \nwas looking through his office, when he was leaving, to see whether I \ncould take his office because of my seniority, he reminded me of the \nfirst time I came by his office as a young Senator to pay my respects, \nwhich was a tradition then. And I sat down at that conference table \nwhich he used as his office desk.\n  He patted the leather chair next to me. He said: Sit down. He said: \nWhat made you run for the Senate? After congratulating me.\n  And like a darn fool I told him the exact truth. I said: Civil \nrights, sir.\n  As soon as I said it, I could feel the beads of sweat pop out on my \nhead, my underarms get damp. Why am I telling this old segregationist \nthat the reason was civil rights? That is not a very auspicious way to \nstart off a relationship.\n  He looked at me and said: Good. Good. Good.\n  That was the end of the conversation.\n  Over the intervening years, we served 18 years. We shared a hospital \nroom in Walter Reed for 3 months. He was in there, and I was. He became \nsupportive of me in my effort to run for President back in the 1980s. \nWe became good friends. But 18 years later, when I came back to look at \nhis office to see whether or not I would take his office because it was \na more commodious space, I walked into the office. It was during that \ninterregnum period after the Presidential election. President Bush was \nabout to take office. There had been this transition.\n\n  Anyway, I said to his secretary of many years--I am embarrassed, I \ncan't remember her first name. I think it may have been Mildred. He was \nin the Senate 42 years, maybe 43--is the chairman in?\n  She said: Senator, you can go right into his office.\n  I walked in. He was sitting in the same spot he was 18 years earlier. \nOnly this time in a wheelchair with an amputated leg was John Stennis. \nI said: Mr. Chairman, I apologize.\n  He said: Come in, sit down. Sit down. He patted the chair. I sat \ndown. He startled me. He said: You all remember the first time you came \nto see me, Joe?\n  I had not. And he reminded me. I looked at him and he recited the \nstory. And I said: I was a pretty smart fellow, wasn't I, Mr. Chairman?\n  And he said: I wanted to tell you something then and I am going to \ntell you now. He said: You are going to take my office, aren't you?\n  I said: Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.\n  He caressed that table--it was a big mahogany table about half the \nsize of the table in the cabinet room--as if it was an animate object. \nHe said: Do you see this table, Joe?\n  I said: Yes, Mr. Chairman.\n  He said: This table was the flagship of the Confederacy from 1954 to \n1968. He said: Senator Russell would have us every Monday, Tuesday, \nWednesday--I forget what day--and we would have lunch here. He said: \nEverybody had a drawer. And he opened one of the drawers. He said: We \nplanned the demise of the civil rights movement at this table.\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\nHe said: It is time now that this table go from the table of a man \nagainst civil rights to the table owned by a man for civil rights. I \ngive you my word on that.\n  I was moved by that. I looked at him, and he said: One more thing, \nJoe, before you leave. He said: The civil rights movement did more to \nfree the white man than it did the black man.\n  And I said: How is that, Mr. Chairman?\n  None of you here are old enough to remember him, but again the way he \ntalked, he went like this, he said: It freed my soul. It freed my soul.\n  The point I want to make that I am grappling with here is the men and \nwomen who serve here, and Strom Thurmond in particular, actually \nchange. They actually grow. They actually, because of the diverse views \nthat are here and the different geography represented, if you are here \nlong enough, it rubs against you. It sort of polishes you. Not in the \nway of polish meaning smooth, but polishes you in the sense of taking \noff the edges and understanding the other man's perspective.\n  I believe Strom Thurmond was a captive of his era, his age, and his \ngeography.\n  I do not believe Strom Thurmond at his core was racist. But even if \nhe had been, I believe that he changed, and the news media says he \nchanged, they think, out of pure opportunism. I believe he changed \nbecause the times changed, life changed. He worked with, he saw, he had \nrelationships with people who educated him, as well as I have been \neducated.\n  Hubert Humphrey wrote a book--and I had the great honor of serving \nwith him--called ``The Education of a Public Man.'' I watched Strom \nThurmond as the percentage of his staff increased in terms of black \nrepresentation. He and I were chairmen, or cochairmen, of the Judiciary \nCommittee for almost two decades--16 years I believe. I watched him. He \nwould lean over to me in the middle of a hearing because we had a \ngenuine trust and say: Joe, what did they mean by that?\n  I will never forget we were holding a hearing on a Supreme Court \nJustice, and at the end the last group of witnesses we had--we had six \nwitnesses--included a young man representing the gay and lesbian task \nforce. He was chairing and I was the only one with him because the \nhearing was already finished and these were people coming to register \nopposition or support. They ranged from all kinds of groups that were \nbefore us--extremely conservative ones and liberal ones--to give \neverybody their say. Everybody on the committee knew it was basically \nover. Because of being the ranking Democrat or ranking Republican or \nthe chairman, you have to be there.\n  I will never forget sitting next to him and he leaned over and said: \nWhat is he saying? This young man was explaining the point of view of \nwhy, in fact, to be gay was not to be in any way maladjusted. But Strom \ncame from an era and a time that was different, so he looked at the \nyoung man and he said: Have you received psychiatric help, son?\n  Now, everybody in that room who was under the age of 40 laughed and \nthought he was being a wise guy. He was serious.\n  He leaned over to me and he said: Joe, why do they call it ``gay''?\n  He wasn't being snide. He literally, at 91 years old, didn't \nunderstand that. I guess it must not have been Rehnquist. It must have \nbeen someone later. He did not understand. Remember, this man was over \n100 years old. He came from the Deep South. People from the far North \ndon't understand either. But he came from an environment that was so \ndifferent. But in this place, over time, he had the ability, without \neven knowing it, to apply Mike Mansfield's standard, which was to look \nat the other guy or woman and try to figure out what is the good thing \nabout them that caused their people to send them here, with all their \nwarts, foibles and faults.\n  I deem it a privilege to have become his friend. We were equals in \nthe sense that our vote counted the same. Our influence on some issues \nwas the same. But I am 60 and he was 100. There was always a 40-year \nchasm between us. I could say things to Strom and be irreverent with \nhim. I could grab him by the arm and say: Strom, don't--which I would \nnot have been able to do if there had been a 10-year difference. I was \nlike the kid. It is strange--I find it strange even talking about it--\nhow this relationship that started in stark adversarial confrontation \nended up being as close as it was, causing Strom Thurmond to ask his \nwife whether I would deliver a eulogy for him. I don't fully understand \nit, but I do know it is something about this place, these walls, this \nChamber, and something good about America, something good about our \nsystem, and it is something that is sorely needed--to look in the eyes \nof your adversary within our system and look for the good in him, and \nnot just the part that you find disagreeable or, in some cases, \nabhorrent.\n\n  I will end on a more humorous note. I had the privilege of being \nasked to be one of the four people to speak at his 90th birthday party. \nThe other people were George Mitchell, then majority leader, a fine \nman; Bob Dole; and Richard Milhouse Nixon. It was before a crowd of a \nthousand or more people, black tie, here in Washington. It was quite an \nevent. It kind of shocked everybody that I was asked to be one of the \nspeakers. It shocked me to be seen with Richard Milhouse Nixon, even \nthough he was President when I arrived here.\n  I did some research about Strom to find out about his background \nbefore I did this tribute on his 90th birthday--a combination tribute \nand roast. You know what I found? I found a lead editorial--I don't \nhave it now--from the year 1947 or 1948 from the New York Times, and \nthe title, if memory serves me correct, is something like ``The Hope of \nthe South.'' It was about Strom Thurmond. The New York Times, the \nliberal New York Times, in the late forties--it must have been 1947--\nwrote about this guy, Strom Thurmond, a public official in South \nCarolina, who got himself in trouble and lost a primary because he was \ntoo empathetic to African-Americans because when he was a presiding \njudge, he started an effort statewide in South Carolina that tried to \nget better textbooks and materials into black schools, and he tutored \nyoung blacks and set up an organization to tutor and teach young blacks \nhow to read. Strom Thurmond. Strom Thurmond. I think it was in 1946 or \n1947. The essence of the editorial was that this is ``the hope of the \nSouth.'' In the meantime, he got beat by a sitting Senator for being \n``weak on race.''\n  I think Strom Thurmond learned the wrong political lesson from that \nand decided no one would ever get to the right of him on this issue \nagain. But I also was sitting next to him when he voted for the \nextension of the Voting Rights Act.\n  The only point I want to make is, people change, people grow, and \npeople react to crises in different ways. I choose to remember Strom \nThurmond in his last 15 years as Senator rather than choose to remember \nhim when he started his career.\n  I do not choose that just as a matter of convenience. I choose that \nbecause I believe men and women can grow. I believe John Stennis meant \nit when he said the civil rights movement saved his soul. I believe \nStrom Thurmond meant it when he hired so many African Americans, signed \non to the extension of the Voting Rights Act, and voted for the Martin \nLuther King holiday.\n  I choose to believe that he meant it because I find it hard to \nbelieve that in the so many decent, generous, and personal acts that he \ndid for me that it did not come from a man who is basically a decent, \ngood man, and the latter part of his career reflects that.\n  I choose it not just because I am an optimist. I choose it not just \nbecause I want to believe it. I choose it not just because I believe \nthere is a chemistry that happens in this body. I choose it because I \nbelieve basically in the goodness of human nature and it will win out, \nand I think it did in Strom.\n  I will have more to say--or less to say but hopefully more succinctly \nand in a more articulate way--at his funeral.\n  I close by saying to Nancy, Strom, Jr., and all of his children, how \nmuch I cared about their father, how much, in a strange way, he taught \nme, and how much I hope he learned from those of us who disagreed so \nmuch with his policy on race. The human side of this can never be lost. \nThey lost the blood of\n\n[[Page S8830]]\n\ntheir blood, bone of their bone. It was a tough time. But I am \nflattered that he asked me, and I just hope that I and others are \nworthy of his memory when we speak of him on Tuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8830-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8830-S8832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WAR IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I planned yesterday to be here today to \nspeak about a totally different subject, and then we learned last \nevening what happened to Strom Thurmond. With the permission of my \ncolleagues, I wish to move for a few minutes to a totally different \nsubject, and that is the war in Iraq. I say ``the war in Iraq'' because \nthere is still a war in Iraq.\n  I returned from Baghdad on Tuesday with two of my distinguished \nRepublican colleagues--Senators Lugar and Hagel. I came away with \nseveral impressions that I want to pass on to my colleagues in the hope \nthat it will give some additional information or insight. My \nimpressions, although not stated in the same way by my two colleagues, \nSenators Hagel and Lugar, I am confident are the same ones they had \nbecause we did a number of press conferences and we talked at length. \nIt was a 14-hour flight back. We are good friends, and we all agree on \nthe essence of what I am about to say, although we have different \nemphasis on different points. Let me say what those primary impressions \nare and why I think there is such an urgency.\n  First, there is still a war going on. It is more like a guerrilla war \nbut there is a war. Meeting with our military troops, meeting with our \ngenerals, one told us: Every time I send a young man out on patrol on \nthe streets of Baghdad in a humvee, I tell them: Treat it as if you are \nin battle.\n  He told us how they know now that our young men and women are being \ntargeted not by some random group of Islamists who are angry but by \nprofessionals, the leftover fedayeen, the Republican Guard. Where did \nall these folks go? They went back into their communities.\n  One colonel told us they know that people who are engaged in going \nafter Americans are instructed in the following way: All our young men \nand women wear helmets and flack jackets. They are instructed when \nthere is a disturbance to come out of the crowd. If they are going to \ntry to kill one of our young men and women, there is a 4-inch opening \nto do it; that is, space between the back of the helmet and the top of \nthe bulletproof vest is where they aim to kill our soldiers. That is \nnot the work of just random and irrational people who are angry we are \nin their country. How well coordinated and how well organized it is \nthey do not know, and I do not know, but there is still a war going on.\n  The second impression I came back with is, what a remarkable group of \npeople we have working in the toughest of conditions against the \nlongest of odds to put Iraq back on its feet and back into the hands of \nthe Iraqi people. I am not merely talking about our military, which has \nbeen celebrated with good reason and everybody knows; I am talking \nabout our civilians. I am talking about Ambassador Bremer. I am talking \nabout Ambassador Crocker. I am talking about Secretary Slocum. I am \ntalking about the most talented group of people we have assembled, the \npeople who have had incredible experience in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and in \nAfghanistan in trying to stand up a police department.\n  We spent an hour or more at the police training academy with men I \nknow are the best in the world. I know because I spent so much time in \nthe Balkans and so much time dealing with the subject. I know they are \nthe single best in the world. In fact, coincidentally, one of them \nhappens to be a former chief of police of the Newark Police Department \nin the town in which I attended college, the University of Delaware. \nThese are incredibly talented people working under incredibly difficult \nconditions, made more difficult, I am sad to say, by the incredible \nmiscalculations this administration is making about how to proceed in \nIraq.\n  Many of us on this floor--I am not unique--have pointed out that \nwinning the war is only half the problem, the smaller half. Winning the \npeace is an astronomically difficult subject. As I say to my colleagues \nand anyone who asks, if the Lord Almighty came down and sat in this \nchair and agreed to give the President and those on the ground in Iraq \nthe right answers to the next 20 decisions they had to make, the next \n50 decisions they had to make, consequential decisions, we still only \nhave, in my view, a 65-percent chance of getting it right.\n  That is how complicated Iraq is. That is how difficult this problem \nis. But it has been made much more difficult, frankly, by the wrong \nassumptions that were made by the administration. This is not second-\nguessing. These are things that, for a year before, many of us argued \nwith them about.\n  I supported us taking out that tyrant, but there seems to be a tone \ndeafness right now, and that is that the administration thought \nbuilding the peace would be built upon three assumptions they had, for \nwhich, in the hearings we held I never found any basis. One is, they \nexpected to find a fully functioning bureaucracy when they got to Iraq, \na literate country that would have in place for each of their \ndepartments--think of it in terms of the United States--their \ndepartment of education, their department of public works, their \ndepartment of highways, their department of security. We were told, \nwith absolute certainty by the administration, that all we had to do \nwas go in and decapitate the Baathists, that is the neo-Nazis who ran \nthat country, and we would have this infrastructure ready to take over \nthe running of their country. But it melted away. It is not there.\n  The second assumption was we were told they expected to find an army \nintact. Again, we decapitate the bad guys but there would be a standing \narmy we could work with. That melted away. It does not exist, and to \nthe extent it exists, it is engaged in guerrilla activity.\n  The third assumption was we were going to find a police force in the \ncountry that once we took the bad apples out of--like we did, by the \nway, in Colombia, helping them vet their national police--that we would \nhave tens of thousands of police officers we could work with who were \ntrained. There are none, and there never were any.\n  The result has been massive problems in terms of getting basic \nservices back and restoring security. We have seen looting and \npolitical sabotage against power, oil, and water plants, some organized \nresistance, which seems to be getting more organized. All of this is \ncompounded by years of neglect by Saddam Hussein's regime. Neither this \nadministration nor any of us could have reasonably anticipated how \nbadly he treated the infrastructure of his own country. It is not \nmerely that he did not repair the infrastructure during the period when \nthe embargo was on them, when they were operating under sanctions, but \nfor 30 years.\n  In fairness to the administration, no one knew how badly he had raped \nand pillaged his own country and infrastructure. We knew what he did to \nhis people but we did not know this.\n  Ultimately, Iraqis need to do all these jobs: Administrate, be the \narmy, be the police force, restore security, maintain security, but it \nis going to take a long time to do that. Meanwhile, we the \ninternational community should be filling the gaps, not we the United \nStates alone.\n  What is worse is we should have known better. We had extensive \nexperience in the Balkans. We had considerable experience in \nAfghanistan, which is a failure, in my view. We had considerable \nbipartisan testimony from experts on the left, right, and center, going \nback to July, that these problems would be protracted and they would be \ndeep. I will never forget two leading generals, the former head of \nCENTCOM and former NATO director, testifying before our committee, and \nI remember the parallel they used.\n  They said we have this incredible military juggernaut which we have \nplanned incredibly well and executed it incredibly well, but we should \nin tandem be planning for the occupation of Iraq. There was virtually \nno planning, but that is water over the dam.\n  That is not just me. Ask my Republican colleagues who deal with this. \nThere was no planning. The question now, and my purpose today, is not \nto say, aha, look at the mistake you made, you did not listen. It is to \nsay, let's get over this. Now that we realize and the whole world \nunderstands these infrastructures do not exist, it is time to \ninternationalize the effort.\n  First, we need a significant infusion of military and civilian police \nto fill\n\n[[Page S8831]]\n\nthe gap of the Iraqi police. On another date, I will spend more time on \nthis, but there are 79,000 Iraqi police spots we have to fill. Our \nexperts on the ground in Iraq say there is a need immediately for 5,800 \nEuropean crack police, the gens de guerre, to be brought in to maintain \nthe peace and security of the citizens, stop the looting, make the \ntraffic lights work, investigate the murders and the rapes, while we \nare training 80,000 new police officers.\n  There is a gigantic vacuum, and our own people on the ground say we \nneed help now. So I implore the President to get over his feelings \nabout the Europeans, the French and the Germans in particular, and seek \ntheir assistance because I believe they are ready to assist. They need \nto be asked.\n  As I said, we are starting from scratch to build an Iraqi police \nforce of 73,000 people with 18,000 cars. Now we have about 30,000 Iraqi \npolice, all ill trained, with about 200 cars. How long will it take to \nget to 73,000, which is a very thin blue line? The estimate of many is \nabout 5 years. So what do we do in the meantime if we do not seek to \ninternationalize this?\n  Second, we need to sustain and probably increase our military forces \nin Iraq, and it need not be more Americans. We should be reaching out \nto NATO. When I have spoken to Lord Robertson, when I have spoken to \nthe head of NATO, and spoken to the country specific, I am told they \nare prepared to send hard, tough, fighting troops into Iraq, but they \nwant to be asked. To the best of my knowledge, the President and \nSecretary of Defense and the Vice President have decided not to ask. If \nthat is true, that is foolhardy.\n  We need between 30,000 and 60,000 forces there, and they should be \nNATO forces. Meanwhile, the notion that has been floated out of the \nPentagon by Mr. Rumsfeld, as he suggested 6 weeks ago that we could get \ndown to 30,000 troops by the end of the year, is pure fantasy. Who are \nwe kidding? Get down to 30,000 troops within 6 months? Unless he has a \nplan no one has ever heard of internationalizing this to the extent \nthat they are backfilled with European and other forces.\n  We need to get more troops in. They need to be effective, and the \nbest place to look is NATO. As I said, I met with Secretary General \nRobertson last weekend. NATO is willing to help, but the administration \nhas to ask. So please ask, Mr. President.\n  Third, we are going to need significant resources to get all of this \ndone. Just a couple of weeks ago my committee, headed by Senator Lugar, \nhad testimony from leading members of the administration saying do not \nworry; basically, the oil revenues are going to take care of all of \nthis. What a joke. We have a leading oil man appointed by the \nadministration in Baghdad with whom we sat and met, my two colleagues \nand I. He said we will get to 1 million barrels a day maybe by the end \nof the summer; maybe by the end of 2004, an average of 2.4 million a \nday.\n\n  Let me explain that. It means there may be the ability to generate $5 \nbillion worth of revenue this year and $14 billion next year; and it \ncosts us $3 billion a month just to maintain our troops there.\n  It is time we start leveling with the American people. Maybe the most \nimportant impression was our folks on the ground are doing an \nincredible job. I am not being solicitous. I am not just saying we are \ndoing a great job. They are doing an incredible job. The most positive \nthing I came away with: I went over despondent about a lack of a \npolitical game plan of transferring government to the Iraqis. I am \ntruly impressed with Ambassador Bremer and his team. They have that \nprocess underway, after we finally discarded what I assume was the \nCheney-Rumsfeld idea of putting Mr. Garner in there and finding Mr. \nChalabi--I may be wrong about that; if I am, I apologize for sounding \nharsh.\n  But the President was wise enough to recognize the model they \noriginally came up with on the political transition--General Garner is \na fine man, and the expatriates being the basis upon which the \ngovernment would be stood up quickly--was not realistic, and he made a \nswift change. I implore the President to make a similar change in \nthinking about police and the military.\n  Nobody back home understands. The American people have not been given \nthe facts, in my view, to be able to fully understand how monumental \nthe task is we are undertaking, how long it will take and how much it \nwill cost, how many troops. The President needs to go to the American \npeople and tell them.\n  I will end where I began 10 months ago in this Chamber after my \nhearings in July--almost a year ago, when I chaired the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I said then and I repeat it: The one thing all who \ncome out of the Vietnam era generation can agree on is, regardless of \nwhat our view was on the war at the time, no foreign policy, no matter \nhow well fashioned, can be sustained without the informed consent of \nthe American people.\n  As I have said repeatedly, folks in my State and around the country \nthought when we went in that Johnny and Jane would come marching home \nas they did after gulf I, immediately after the war. There is a bit of \nshock and dismay on the part of the families of the National Guard and \nthe reservists when they find out their dads and moms are not coming \nhome; they are being extended.\n  We knew ahead of time they would have to be extended. You knew it, I \nknew it. We did not tell. We told them, the President didn't. Mr. \nPresident, please go on television, tell the American people what is \nexpected of them now. They will respond. We are a mature people. They \ndon't like the fact that 161,000 Americans have to stay there for an \nextended period of time. But we have to tell them, and tell them why it \nis so important it be done. It is in the naked self-interests of the \nUnited States that we get this right--that we stand up with a \ngovernment at the end of the day that is at least more democratic, is \nnot a breeding ground for terror, and is a stabilizing influence in the \nregion because it will save the lives of our children and our \ngrandchildren if we do it right. We have an opportunity to do it right. \nThis is doable. But not on the cheap, and not without leveling with the \nAmerican people.\n\n  Nearly 2 months ago, on May 1, President Bush landed on the USS \nAbraham Lincoln to address our troops and the Nation. Behind them was a \nlarge banner that read ``Mission accomplished.'' Our troops did \naccomplish their first mission, a remarkable mission in Iraq, of \nridding its people of the tyrannical regime of Saddam Hussein. But the \nlarger and more difficult mission is building the peace in Iraq and is \nfar from accomplished. In fact, it has only just begun.\n  I respectfully suggest it is time for the President to explain that \nto the American people, to talk to us straight about the hundreds of \nthousands of troops who will be needed immediately and the tens of \nthousands of troops who will be needed for a long time, and the tens of \nbillions of dollars that will be needed, and how we will have to \nenergize the international community as donor nations to come up with \nthat money so we do not hold the bag for it all. It will take many \nyears.\n  When Senator Lugar and I held our hearings, everybody kept saying, \nthe day after the war, and we said, no, it is not the day after, it is \nthe decade after Saddam Hussein is down--the decade after. I have not \nfound one reasonable person who suggests that the United States will \nnot be heavily involved, even after there is a transition to an Iraqi \nGovernment, for at least the next 3 to 5 years. If anybody thinks it is \nless than that, they are kidding themselves. If it is less than that, \nit will mean we will lose the peace.\n  I know it is dangerous, and I can see my colleague looking at me; it \nis dangerous to prognosticate in this business because everybody \nremembers exactly what you said. But I am saying the same thing I said \nlast July. It was a worthy goal to take down Saddam Hussein. He was a \ndanger to his people. The one thing the whole world has seen is what a \nmadman he was. He has killed 300,000 of his own people at least. Mass \ngraves abound. We did a worthy and noble thing. But we must \ninternationalize this effort now. Now. Now. We must level with the \nAmerican people.\n  I conclude by saying what the troops told us. You have been on these \nmissions. These young men and women we have dinner with, these young \ntroops we go out and ride around with, the people we spend our time \nwith in the\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\ncountry, they want to know in Baghdad, are we going to support them? \nThey know how tough this is. They know how many more of them are going \nto die. They know their life is at risk. They know this is an \nincredibly difficult undertaking, and they are wondering why, when they \npick up the papers back home, it is not being stated that way. It is \nbeing treated as if this is over. The American people deserve to be \nleveled with.\n  Everyone here knows, whether we say another year or 10, whether it is \n75,000 troops or 160,000, whether it is $1 billion or $20 billion or \n$40 billion, we all know it is a lot more than any of us are telling \nthe American people.\n  It is time, as one of my Republican colleagues said, to tell the \ntruth. I am not suggesting the President is lying. He is not. I am \nsuggesting the American people do not have any idea what we have signed \nthem on to. We had better tell them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night's vote on the Medicare \nprescription drug bill is one of the toughest votes I have cast since \nbecoming Senator in 2001.\n  As the people of Michigan know, I made the issue of adding a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare one of the centerpieces of my \n2000 campaign. I told Michiganians that if they sent me to the Senate, \nI would fight to add a meaningful prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare. I also said I would do everything within my power to lower \nprescription drug prices for everyone.\n  For years, I have crisis-crossed Michigan and listened to seniors who \ndesperately need help with paying for their medicines. I have heard \nfrom middle class, retired people who have had to cut pills in half \nbecause they could not afford to pay for their full prescriptions. I \nhave gone with seniors to Canada where they could actually afford to \nbuy American-made prescription drugs because they cost so much less \nnorth of the border.\n  Since 2001, I have sponsored and co-sponsored bills that would \nprovide a comprehensive prescription drug benefit in Medicare and lower \nprices for all Americans. These are the goals that I have fought for \nand have spoken out for on this Senate floor time and time again.\n  Specifically, I have cosponsored S. 7, a bill that would provide a \nmeaningful Medicare prescription benefit. And I have co-sponsored bills \nto open the border to Canada to allow families to purchase low-cost, \nF.D.A.-approved drugs made in the U.S. that have been sold in Canada \nfor half the price or less.\n  I have co-sponsored legislation creating more competition to lower \nprices by allowing more generics, or unadvertised brands on the market \nand helping States set up bulk purchasing programs to lower prices for \nthose without health insurance to help pay for their prescription \ndrugs.\n  I have particularly focused on lowering prices for all Americans \nbecause the soaring cost of prescription drugs is hurting all of us.\n  When a brand-name prescription drug goes up in price three times the \nrate of inflation, everyone is affected by that. It hurts our seniors, \nmany of whom must pay for prescriptions directly out of their pockets. \nIt harms our businesses by dramatically increasing their health care \ncosts. The average small business has seen their health care premiums \ndouble in the last 5 years. This affects our ability to grow and to \nprovide new jobs.\n  The bill that the Senate passed last night only accomplishes some of \nmy goals. It has its strengths and weaknesses. It is a step in the \nright direction, but only a beginning step.\n  On a positive note, this bill establishes an outpatient prescription \ndrug benefit for all seniors for the first time since the entire \nprogram was created in 1965.\n  Currently, Medicare only covers prescription drugs for those who are \nin the hospital. As we all know, this has been a seniors challenge for \nour seniors.\n  Unfortunately, the benefit is confusing and will vary depending upon \ndecisions made by insurance companies, but at least this bill \nestablishes for the first time that there should be a benefit.\n  The bill provides a benefit for low income seniors who make less than \n160 percent of poverty. Married couples earning less than $19,392 per \nyear will receive a comprehensive prescription drug plan. This will \nhelp approximately 350,000 seniors in Michigan. Again, this is a step \nin the right direction.\n  This bill also provides a catastrophic benefit for seniors who have \nextraordinary prescription drug bills each year. For some seniors, it \nis not uncommon for them to have monthly prescription drug bills of \nover $1,000 per month or $12,000 per year. This bill has a catastrophic \ncap at $5,800 per year. After $5,800, seniors would only have to pay 10 \npercent of additional out-of-pocket costs in one year. This is a \npositive step.\n  This bill also includes several improvements in payments for Medicare \nproviders. Since 1997, many Medicare providers have been underpaid and \nhave been forced to make difficult decisions regarding serving new \nMedicare patients. Specifically, this bill provides increased payments \nfor rural providers such as hospitals, ambulance services, and home \nhealth agencies. This is important to the people of Michigan.\n  The bill also makes great strides in helping to lower prescription \ndrug prices for all Americans. For the first time, we have closed \nloopholes in our drug laws that have allowed brand name drug makers to \nkeep lower cost generic drugs off the market. This bill will mean that \nthere will be more competition between similar drugs and thus lower \nprices for families, for businesses, and for everyone using \nprescriptions drugs. This is a positive aspect that I have been \nfighting for, for the last 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  It also includes a provision that I have long championed that will \nallow pharmacies and families to purchase lower priced prescription \ndrugs from Canada. In some cases, the same drugs that are sold in \nCanada can cost up to 50, 60, or 70 percent less than they cost here in \nthe U.S. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  Regrettably, opponents of this type of free market competition \nattached a provision that allows the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to stop its implementation. I hope that HHS Secretary Tommy \nThompson will not block it and allow U.S. citizens to get lower priced, \nFDA approved, American made prescription drugs from Canada.\n  Unfortunately, this bill has serious drawbacks as well which is why \nit has been such a difficult situation for me. The Republican Congress, \nalong with the President, has not been willing to allocate enough \nfunding to provide a comprehensive benefit to most of our middle class \nseniors.\n  They arbitrarily picked a figure of $400 billion in total spending \nfor 10 years even though we know that it would take twice that amount \nto provide American seniors with the same kind of prescription drug \ncoverage that we in the Congress enjoy. Why was that decision made? I \nhave always said this is a question of values and priorities.\n  Which is more important, or more effective, putting money in people's \npockets and improving the quality of life for Americans, another \ntrillion dollar tax cut for the privileged few, or meaningful \nprescription drug benefit that will help our seniors and their families \nafford live saving medicine and put money back in people's pockets \nthrough lower prescription drug prices.\n  The answer to that question, I believe, is very clear. Unfortunately, \nmisplaced priorities have resulted in a prescription drug plan that is \nmuch less than American families need and deserve.\n  There are many short-comings in this plan that I will continue to do \neverything in my power to correct.\n\n[[Page S8833]]\n\n  For example, the drudge benefit stops when a senior's drug \nexpenditures are between $4,500 and $5,800. During that period, after \nseniors have spent $4,500 on their prescription drug costs, and before \nthey reach $5,800, seniors would pay 100 percent of that $1,300 in \nprescription drug bills. This is a major gap in coverage.\n\n  Secondly, the copayments, the deductibles, the premiums are too high \nand too unpredictable. The $35 premium often quoted is not even \nguaranteed in the bill. Seniors will be left to the mercy of insurance \ncompanies that will decide the premiums and the benefits that will be \nprovided. This is not in the bill. It is up to the insurance companies.\n  Another very important issue relates to those who already have \nprescription drug coverage. There is currently not enough incentive in \nthis plan to make sure employers do not drop existing prescription drug \ncoverage for their retirees. This is a very important issue for the \nretirees in Michigan.\n  I will continue to fight for changes in this legislation to protect \nthose who currently have coverage, who have worked hard their whole \nlives, who have retired and have been fortunate enough to have good \nbenefits and are very concerned that they not lose them, as we work to \nhelp others who do not have coverage. It makes no sense to set up a \nsystem that might actually take away benefits currently being provided \nto retirees through private insurance.\n  Furthermore, one of the most negative parts of this bill is the fact \nthat it does not allow seniors to get their prescription drugs through \nthe traditional Medicare system as their first choice. Under the bill \npassed by the Senate, seniors must pick a private prescription drug \nplan or enroll in a private PPO or HMO if one is available to them.\n  Traditional Medicare, that seniors know and depend on, is only \navailable if private plans are not available. Does this make sense? \nOnly if you are a pharmaceutical company or an insurance company. I \nbelieve seniors should have many choices, including the choice to stay \nin the Medicare Program they know and trust.\n  As I have said so many times before on this Senate floor, when given \na choice between traditional Medicare and a Medicare HMO, 89 percent of \nour American seniors and persons with disabilities have chosen \ntraditional Medicare--89 percent.\n  This choice is not available to them under this bill. I believe this \nis a major flaw that I will continue to do everything I can to correct.\n  During debate on this bill, I sponsored and cosponsored and supported \namendments that would have corrected all of these problems. These \namendments would have stopped the benefit shutdown, reduced out-of-\npocket costs, protected current retiree coverage, and provided a real \ncomprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit. Regrettably, none of \nthese important amendments received the necessary support from my \nRepublican colleagues to pass.\n  When deciding how I would cast my vote on this bill, I looked at all \nof these things: the positive and the negative. I evaluated whether or \nnot this was a step forward for Michigan families, for Michigan \nworkers, for Michigan businesses and, most importantly, for our seniors \nwho have waited too long for help to pay for their medicine.\n  After many hours of thoughtful review and discussions with those \naffected by this legislation, I voted in favor of this bill last night, \nnot because it was the best we can do but because it is a first step in \nthe right direction. This direction--the direction in which we need to \nmove--is for a real, meaningful prescription drug benefit for our \nseniors who have waited too long for their Government to act.\n\n  We were successful in improving this bill in some ways during this \ndebate, but much more needs to be done. There will be other \nopportunities to do so, and I will take them.\n  This bill does not take effect until 2006. So between now and then I \nwill be fighting hard to provide seniors with the real prescription \ndrug benefit they need and deserve, and I will continue to help lead \nthe fight to lower prescription drug prices for everyone.\n  As we know, this legislation is not finished. It must now go to a \nconference committee, a joint committee between the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives, where differences between the Senate and \nHouse bills will be addressed. There are critical differences between \nthe two bills.\n  The House of Representatives passed, by only one vote, a bill that \ntruly begins to unravel Medicare. The House started down the road of \nprivatizing the health care system of senior citizens and the disabled \nin our country. They voted to begin the process of turning back the \nclock to the days when too many seniors and families could not find or \nafford private insurance.\n  If I had been in the House of Representatives last evening, where I \nserved for 4 years, I would have voted no. If the House bill comes \nbefore the Senate as it is currently written, I will vote no. Unlike \nthe Senate, where we worked in a bipartisan way to develop a plan that \nthe majority of Senators could support, the House process was very \npartisan and polarizing, and it resulted in an extreme plan that could \nnot be supported by my Democratic colleagues who care deeply about \nstrengthening and preserving Medicare for the future.\n  Our seniors expect and deserve the best plan we can offer. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues to achieve that goal. And I hope \nand pray that we will be successful.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8833-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8833-S8837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE HONORABLE J.

Res. 191, which is at the \ndesk, and I ask that the resolution be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 191) relative to the death of the \n     Honorable J. Strom Thurmond, former United States Senator and \n     President Pro Tempore Emeritus from the State of South \n     Carolina.\n\n                              S. Res. 191\n\n       Whereas the Honorable J. Strom Thurmond conducted his life \n     in an exemplary manner, an example to all of his fellow \n     citizens;\n       Whereas the Honorable J. Strom Thurmond was a devoted \n     husband, father, and most recently, grandfather;\n       Whereas the Honorable J. Strom Thurmond gave a great \n     measure of his life to public service;\n       Whereas, having abandoned the safety of high position, the \n     Honorable J. Strom Thurmond served his country during World \n     War II, fighting the greatest threat the world had thus far \n     seen;\n       Whereas the Honorable J. Strom Thurmond served South \n     Carolina in the United States Senate with devotion and \n     distinction;\n       Whereas his service on behalf of South Carolina and all \n     Americans earned him the esteem and high regard of his \n     colleagues; and\n       Whereas his death has deprived his State and Nation of a \n     most outstanding Senator: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow \n     and deep regret the announcement of the death of the \n     Honorable J. Strom Thurmond, former Senator and President Pro \n     Tempore Emeritus from the State of South Carolina.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate \n     these resolutions to the House of Representatives and \n     transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the \n     deceased.\n       Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it stand \n     adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of the \n     Honorable J. Strom Thurmond.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, this resolution has been submitted by \nmyself and on behalf of Senator Daschle, Senator Graham, and Senator \nHollings in honor of the honorable and great J. Strom Thurmond.\n  Last night shortly after 9:45, we were notified of the death of Strom \nThurmond. At that time, I pointed out that it was a century ago--a long \ntime ago--when Mark Twain was alive and Teddy Roosevelt was still \nPresident, J. Strom\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\nThurmond was born in Edgefield, SC, and, thus, began a life of public \nservice unmatched--unmatched--in the modern history of America.\n  Strom Thurmond served as United States Senator from December 1954, 2 \nyears after I was born, until January of this year, nearly a half \ncentury of service in this body--this body we have the honor of \nparticipating in on a daily basis.\n  Though his period of service is a remarkable accomplishment in and of \nitself, Strom led a remarkable life even before coming to the Senate. \nLate last night and over the course of the morning, if one turned on a \ntelevision set, they would hear anecdotes, stories about this great \nman, and those pre-Senate years when he was a teacher, an athletic \ncoach, and a superintendent of education.\n  He studied law under his father, Judge J. William Thurmond, and \nbecame a city attorney, a county attorney, a State senator, and \neventually a circuit court judge. He resigned his position as a circuit \njudge to volunteer to fight in World War II. This he did at the age of \n39, 18 years after serving as an Army reservist and having earned a \ncommission as a second lieutenant.\n  Indeed, as we all know, age never was an obstacle for Strom Thurmond. \nAs a member of the 82nd Airborne, Strom landed a glider at Normandy on \nD-Day and helped secure the foothold for the Allies to liberate the \nEuropean continent.\n  For his distinguished service, Strom was awarded five battle stars \nand 18 other decorations, including the Legion of Merit with oak leaf \ncluster, the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star for Valor, the Belgian Order \nof the Crown, and the French Cross of War. No wonder when a speech \nwriter once used the word ``afraid,'' Strom Thurmond handed the text \nback with the retort:\n\n       I've never been afraid of anything.\n\n  After the war, Strom returned home to South Carolina. He was elected \nGovernor in 1946, and then ran for President of the United States as \nthe States Rights Democratic candidate. Strom won four States and 39 \nelectoral votes, and that tally stands as the third largest independent \nelectoral vote in U.S. history.\n  Though he did not win the Presidency, Strom was determined to serve \nin Washington. He ran for the Senate in 1954, became the only candidate \nelected to Congress by a write-in vote in American history, and he was \nreelected eight more times.\n  In the most recent years, it became increasingly difficult for Strom \nto go back and forth to South Carolina, but that did not stop the \npeople of South Carolina from coming to him, and it should not have. \nFor decades, Strom attended every county fair, handled every \nconstituent request, and sent a congratulatory note to every high \nschool graduate, many of whom came to intern in his office. It has been \nsaid that almost 70 percent of South Carolinians have met Strom \nThurmond face to face. Over the course of his long and distinguished \ncareer, Strom Thurmond was a witness to history.\n  As a young man, he knew people who stood in the presence of Andrew \nJackson. He campaigned for the votes of men who fought in the Civil \nWar. He and Herbert Hoover won their first elective office in the same \nyear, 1928.\n  Strom more than saw history, he wrote it. He was the first major \nsouthern Democrat to switch to the Republican Party. He served for more \nthan 17 years as President pro tempore of the Senate. As chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, he ensured that our men and women of the \nArmed Forces had the best training, the best equipment, and the best \nleadership in the world.\n  As we all know, Strom did set the record for the oldest and longest \nserving Senator. He served with about one-fifth of the nearly 2,000 men \nand women who have been Members of the Senate since 1789. He was nearly \none-half the age of the U.S. Constitution. Strom certainly faced his \ntrials. As the Dixiecrat candidate for President in 1948, he campaigned \non a platform of States rights, but in doing so he also opposed civil \nrights, as he did for many years as a Senator.\n  History will reflect that part of Strom's life. We will let history \nalso reflect that when Strom saw that America had changed, and changed \nfor the better, he changed, too.\n  A longtime friend of Senator Thurmond's, Hortense Woodson, once said \nof him:\n\n       Everything he's done has been done to the full. There's no \n     halfway doings about Strom.\n\n  Indeed, Strom Thurmond will forever be a symbol of what one person \ncan accomplish when they live life to the fullest. God bless our friend \nand our colleague from South Carolina, Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Madam President, I compliment our \nmajority leader for his statement. It was very eloquent and it means a \nlot to Senator Thurmond's family.\n  I know personally that Senator Thurmond had a great fondness for \nSenator Frist. He told me he is a very smart man and he is a good \ndoctor, too. If you ever need him, look him up.\n  I rise today in support of this resolution on behalf of myself and \nSenator Hollings. I appreciate the majority leader and Senator Daschle \nallowing this to occur. It is offered in the spirit of Strom Thurmond's \nlife. Something can be said about Strom Thurmond in the Senate very \neasily. He loved the Senate and the Senate loved him. His colleagues \nwho have served with him so long all have personal stories of fun, good \ntimes, tough fights. He was a valuable ally and a worthy opponent, and \nthe Senate has lost its longest serving Member. Many of us have lost a \nvery dear friend. That goes for the Senate family, the people who help \nus with the doors, the clerks, and the reporters of debates. Everyone \nenjoyed and appreciated Senator Thurmond.\n  It is important to comment on Senator Thurmond, the man. His children \nhave lost their father. Whether one is 100 or 200, it is always \ndifficult, no matter how long one lives, to give up their father and \nmother.\n  I have talked to two of his three children today, and I have \nexpressed my condolences. They are doing very well but they are sad \nbecause they have lost their daddy. I have talked with his wife. We \nreminisced about their life together, the raising of their children, \nand the experiences they have had. So my prayers, along with the \nprayers of everyone in the Senate, go to the family. He was a good \nfamily man. If a script was written in Hollywood about his life, it \nwould not have ended any better in this regard.\n  He became a first-time grandfather at the age of 100 last week. He \nhas three children under 30. He had his first child when he was 68. He \nwas just a phenomenal person. He has done things that most of us could \nnot dream of doing in many ways.\n  I am convinced that two things drove him in his final years: That he \nwanted to finish out his term because he is not a quitter, and when he \nwas elected to serve his last 6-year term he meant to serve it out. He \nhelped me to become his successor, and I will be forever grateful. He \nalso wanted to see his grandchild born, and God allowed him to do that. \nHe was presented his grandson last week. They tell me it was a very \nmagic and touching moment. A week later, he passed on.\n  He has suffered personal tragedy, lost a daughter in an accident. He \nhas experienced much good and bad in his life. He has touched so many \npeople. It is a loss to the Senate. It is a loss to his family. It is a \nloss to his staff.\n  Duke Short, who served with Senator Thurmond in Washington for so \nmany years, was a very loyal and capable staff director. I know that \nDuke and his family feel the loss.\n  Dr. Abernathy in South Carolina has been with Strom Thurmond since \nthe 1940s when he worked with him as Governor. Dr. Abernathy is a \nlegend in his own right.\n  There are so many people who have worked for Senator Thurmond \nthroughout the years, and I know they feel this loss. Senator Thurmond \nhas had enough interns to probably fill up a football stadium. His \nfirst group of interns are now on Social Security.\n\n  He was elected in 1954. I was born in 1955. All I have known in my \nlife is Senator Thurmond, and for 36 years Senator Thurmond and Senator \nHollings served together. Both of them are distinctive gentlemen, \nbigger than life. A lot of us who have associated with Senator Thurmond \nfeel his loss.\n  South Carolina has lost her favorite son. Much has been said and will \nbe said of Senator Thurmond's legacy.\n\n[[Page S8835]]\n\nThe majority leader, Senator Frist, went over his life very well, and \nit is just an amazing story to tell: Being a superintendent of \neducation in the 1920s; getting elected for the first time in 1928; \nbeing a judge in South Carolina at the start of World War II, deciding \nto give up that job which would have exempted him from service, being \nin his early forties; joined the 82nd Airborne, landing in a glider. \nThe pilot of the glider was killed when it landed. His men were \nwounded. He led them out and secured the objective.\n  When the war in Europe was over, he volunteered to go to Japan and he \nfought until they quit. He was just an unbelievable person who embraced \nlife.\n  People ask me: How did he make it so long? He just had a passion. He \nhad a passion for everything he did--his family, his constituents. His \nlegacy in South Carolina is quite simple for every South Carolinian--\nblack, white, rich, poor, no matter whether you are from upstate, \nmiddle, low State--I am sure every State has different regions and \ndifferent dialects but the one thing we had in common: If we had a \nproblem, we knew who to call. We knew to pick up the phone and call \nSenator Thurmond because if he could help you, he would.\n  The average, everyday South Carolinian, from the company owner to the \njanitor, believed that Senator Thurmond was on their side. And when \nthey called, they received a call back. When they wrote a letter, they \nreceived a letter back. The reason I know that is people tell me \neverywhere I go.\n  One guy told me Senator Thurmond used to cut his grass. These stories \nabound. Some of them have been embellished, I am sure, but the only way \nthat he could have lasted this long in politics, doing as many things \nas he has done, taking on the issues that he has taken on, is that at \nthe end of the day people saw that he had a servant's heart.\n  Part of his legacy is the 1948 campaign, and it needs to be \nmentioned. Senator Frist mentioned it. That was a tough time in our \ncountry. He ran as a States rights candidate with a lot of passion for \nthe limited role of the Federal Government. He won on the platform that \ndivided the races. That was a dark time in South Carolina. That was a \ndark time in our Nation.\n  Senator Thurmond made a choice later in life. He could have done \nalmost anything he wanted. But as the 1950s came to a close and the \n1960s came about and people started insisting their Government treat \nthem better, Senator Thurmond made a choice. Instead of hanging on to \nthe rhetoric of the past and the politics of the past, he embraced the \nfuture.\n  Here is what he does not get much credit for. Instead of going with \nthe flow, which some people want to ascribe to him, he in a subtle way \nled a change. He could have been a barrier to change, but he made it \neasy for people in South Carolina, politicians on the Democratic and \nRepublican sides, to embrace change because when Strom came out for \nsomething, it made it easier for you to come out for something because \nit gave you cover. When Strom Thurmond appointed the first African-\nAmerican judge in the history of South Carolina to the Federal bench, \nit made it easier for the people in the statehouse to give appointments \nto African Americans. That is what we do not need to lose.\n  When he embraced traditional Black colleges and started giving them \nthe same recognition and funding as every other university in South \nCarolina, it made it easier for the legislature to improve the quality \nof life for everybody. At the end of his life, in 2001, he was awarded \nlifetime recognition from the Urban League in South Carolina, that is \ndesigned to build racial harmony, for his lifetime of service to \ntraditionally African-American colleges.\n  That needs to be mentioned as much as the 1948 campaign. He will be \nheld accountable in history for that part of his life. History should \nknow that in many subtle ways, in many bold ways, he allowed my State \nto move forward, and everybody in my State is better off for it.\n  From a personal point, when I was in the House, I was the first \nRepublican to be elected from my Third Congressional District in 120 \nyears. One reason I was able to win when everybody behind me was beaten \nfor 120 years was, Senator Thurmond, for the first time in his \npolitical career, embraced a campaign very directly--because he had \nbeen smart enough not to get involved in political races and try to \nrepresent everybody. He took to me, and I am the beneficiary of that. \nHe said: I will come and campaign for you, Lindsey. I said: Great. And \nI turned to my staff and said: What do you do with a 92-year-old man? I \nwas worried we would wear him out and we could not utilize his \nservices. I was worried about him at age 92. Three days he campaigned \nfor me. When he left, I said: Thank God he is gone. He wore me out.\n  He had a passion I had never seen. I picked him up at the airport on \nday 1, in an airplane flown by his personal pilot who was 75 years old, \na single-engine plane. We went to a parade in September. It is hot in \nSouth Carolina in September. We went from one end of town to the other \nshaking hands. We went to the funeral home because he remembered the \nguy who owned the funeral home always gave him apples. He walked in \nunannounced because the Senator wanted apples, and he got the apples. \nHe campaigned all day. We had a fundraiser that night. We went to a \nfootball game that night. He made a speech at half time. We went to a \nrodeo that started at 9 o'clock at night, and he got up in the middle \nof the ring on a barrel and gave a speech. He wanted to see the third \nshift change at the textile plant. I said: I am too tired, and I went \nhome. That went on for 3 days.\n\n  When he left, I asked him to sign a fundraising letter for me. We \nwere all worn out. He looked at the letter and he said you misspelled \nyour own name and you are in the Third District, not the Second \nDistrict.\n  At 92 years of age, he had a passion and he helped me. I stand \nappreciative. When I ran for the Senate, he endorsed me in a primary. I \ncan tell you, I would not be his successor if he had not come out and \nsaid: Lindsey Graham is the right guy to follow me. That will stick \nwith me forever.\n  What have I learned from Senator Thurmond? If you are willing to \nchange, you can serve your State and Nation well. If you care about \npeople, they will take care of you. Let it be said that God gave to \nthis Nation, my State, South Carolina, a public servant, a man of great \ncharacter and heart, and that we miss him, but we thank God that he \ngave us J. Strom Thurmond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I enjoyed hearing my colleague from \nSouth Carolina tell his stories about Strom Thurmond. I rise to join \nthe tribute to the memory of Strom Thurmond that is, very \nappropriately, the day after his death.\n  Most of the time when someone dies, we gather in great sorrow and we \nmourn his passing and we think about what might have been. In Strom's \ncase, there is no reason to think about what might have been. He did it \nall. There was nothing left undone. There was nothing left to \naccomplish.\n  This should not be a time of mourning or sorrow but a time of \ncelebration. So I rise to celebrate the life of Strom Thurmond. The \nbest way to do that, I think, is to tell Strom Thurmond stories. All of \nus are full of Strom Thurmond stories.\n  I remember D-Day, when the big celebration occurred on the \nanniversary of D-Day and Strom Thurmond was not there. Arlen Specter, \nwho was there, greeted him in the Senate and said: Strom, it was a \nmarvelous, marvelous celebration, and you should have been there. And \nhis response was: I was there when it counted. It put us in our place.\n  My father had the experience of working with Strom Thurmond. My \nfather was elected in 1950, and, as has been noted, Strom Thurmond was \nelected in 1954. They became instant friends, not just political \nfriends. There were occasions when they disagreed politically, but they \nbecame personal friends.\n  When Strom married, my mother--old enough to be Strom's wife's \nmother--kind of took Nancy under her wing and they became friends. The \nThurmonds and the Bennetts remained close for a long, long time, to the \npoint when my children started getting married, my parents said: You \nhave to send Strom Thurmond an announcement. And we did and thought we \nhad taken care of our social obligation. Then we\n\n[[Page S8836]]\n\nget a phone call from Strom Thurmond's office: We got this \nannouncement, and we don't mean to be prying, but who are you? Well, we \nare the children of Wallace Bennett. There was a pause. Then the person \non the end of the line said: And who's Wallace Bennett?\n  But Strom knew who Wallace Bennett was, and when I came to the \nSenate, Strom greeted me very warmly and called me Wallace. It took a \nlittle while for him to figure out that I was not my father. And that \nwas a compliment to me because I was very proud of my father and the \nservice he performed in the Senate, and I took the opportunity to touch \nbase with Strom.\n  From that, I thought: This man in his nineties is not all that sharp. \nHe confuses me. He does not have all of this as straight as he might. \nThen I had a couple of experiences that set me straight. We had an \nissue with the State of Utah that was all wrapped up in the Armed \nServices Committee. It was quite a complicated issue. Someone said to \nme: Explain that to John Warner because John Warner is second ranking \nto Strom and is handling all of the detailed kind of things. You go \ntalk to John Warner. He said: You will be talking to somebody who I \nknow can handle the problem.\n\n  So I went to Senator Warner and I started outlining the details of \nthis situation to him. He cut me off. He said: You are going to have to \ntalk to the chairman.\n  I, having had this image of this old man, thought, I don't really \nwant to have to talk to the chairman. And, as delicately as I could, I \nsaid to John: Can't we work this through and kind of handle it? He said \nno. He said: That is a serious enough issue, I don't dare handle that. \nYou are going to have to talk to the chairman.\n  Just then, Senator Thurmond walked through the doors. So, gathering \nup my courage as a freshman Senator, I walked over to him and said: \nSenator Thurmond, I would like to visit with you about--and I no sooner \ngot the title of the issue out of my mouth, than he said: It's all \ntaken care of. And he kept walking. I followed him along, sure that he \nhad not understood what I was talking about. This was a complicated \nkind of issue, and he had oversimplified it and assumed that it had \nbeen taken care of.\n  So I started to intrude again with some of the details. He was very \nrespectful and wasn't patronizing. But he said: I know; I understand; \nall taken care of.\n  Well, thus dismissed, I went back to my staff and said: I think we \nhave a problem here. Senator Warner won't handle it, and he insists \nthat Senator Thurmond has to handle it, and Senator Thurmond just said \nit has all been taken care of.\n  We contacted the Armed Services Committee staff, and they said: Oh, \nyes, that has all been dealt with. Senator Thurmond stepped in, he \nunderstood the issue, he made his decisions, he took care of it, and it \nis all taken care of.\n  So I decided, well, I had better not underestimate this man, in spite \nof his age.\n  Then I had the experience while I was on the campaign plane with \nSenator Dole in the 1996 election when we were flying around the \neastern States on the day of the South Carolina primaries. The word \ncame in that Senator Dole was winning the South Carolina primary. We \nhad some exit polls that looked pretty good. We decided to change our \nitinerary and fly to South Carolina so that Senator Dole could be there \nto receive the plaudits and applause and the excitement of winning the \nSouth Carolina primary. So we did. Of course, this had been a long day. \nWe didn't leave South Carolina to come back to Washington on the \ncampaign plane until after the returns were in and all of the \ncelebrations had been held.\n  Senator Dole, very appropriately, went up into the front part of the \nplane to take a nap as we were flying back. Senator Thurmond had \nhitched a ride back to Washington on the campaign plane. That left \nSenator Thurmond and me and one or two others sitting around the table \njust behind the front part of the plane chatting.\n  It was now midnight, way past my bedtime, and here we were having \npolitical discussions on a campaign plane in the middle of the \nPresidential campaign--the kind of thing that political junkies like me \nlove to do. It was a great discussion. But the interesting thing about \nit was that Strom Thurmond not only understood the discussion and \nparticipated in the discussion, but he led the discussion. He was \ninstructing us about political lore. He was telling tales out of his \npast, which is what old people often do. But he was also analyzing \nthings for the future and had a firm hand on everything. I thought I \nwas talking to a man at least 20 and maybe 30 years younger than his \nchronological age. I understood: OK, this man still has all of his \nfaculties, mental as well as physical.\n\n  We landed at Dulles Airport well after 1 o'clock in the morning. \nEverybody was dragging except Strom, who strode off to his car in fine \nstyle. I remember what he said on that occasion about how you live a \nlong time. He said you eat right, you exercise regularly, and you keep \na positive outlook. He did all of those things, although I am not quite \nsure about the eating right part because there were times when I caught \nStrom eating some things that I am not sure a dietician would \nrecommend.\n  The time came for him to run for reelection. I couldn't believe at 94 \nhe was going to run for reelection. Ninety-four is the time you retire. \nBeing a skeptic, I had a hard time believing the people of South \nCarolina would vote for a 94-year-old man. So I sidled up to one of his \ntop staffers as we were getting ready for that campaign. I said: Can \nStrom Thurmond really win one more time in South Carolina? Is this \ngoing to be close? He said: No, it is not going to be close at all. \nStrom is going to win going away.\n  By the way, I remembered when the Republicans had taken control of \nthe Senate in 1994 and we were having our discussions about platforms. \nOne of the issues that was raised by one of the freshman Senators newly \nelected was term limits and how we needed to be for term limits. We \nwere debating back and forth. Strom was sitting there not talking. \nSuddenly, he spoke up, and he said: I am for term limits. We all kind \nof giggled a little. He said: But if they are not enacted, I am going \nto run again.\n  Here he was running again--94 years old. And I was being told by his \nstaff that Strom would win overwhelmingly. I said: Look, we all love \nhim. We all love the history. But 94 years old? He said: Let me tell \nyou a story.\n  This is my favorite Strom Thurmond story.\n  He said: I was Strom's AA, and I got a phone call from a woman in \nSouth Carolina who said to me: I need the Senator's help. Here is the \nsituation. My fiance and I got married just before he shipped out in \nthe Navy for a 6-month cruise in the Mediterranean. We knew we would \nnot like the separation, but we decided, for a variety of reasons, that \nwe should get married now rather than wait until after he got back. He \nhas just called me and said he has been given leave. He has 2 weeks of \nleave right now in the middle of this 6-month tour, except that he \ncannot leave the theater in case something should arise that would \nrequire him to be back on the ship within 24 hours. He has to stay in \nor around the Mediterranean area where his ship is. So he said catch an \nairplane, come over here, we can have a 2-week honeymoon in the \nMediterranean and I can still be available for the military situation, \nif it should arise.\n  She said: I went down to get my passport and I was told it takes 2 \nweeks to get a passport. By the time I get a passport to fly over to be \nwith my husband, his leave will be up and he will have to get back on \nthe ship. Can the Senator help me get a passport any faster than 2 \nweeks?\n  Well, said the staffer, I will find out. He called the woman in South \nCarolina who was handling passports and introduced himself and said: I \nam calling on behalf of Senator Thurmond to see what we can do about \ngetting this woman's passport a little faster. The passport lady said: \nIt takes 2 weeks. Well, Senator Thurmond would really be grateful. She \nsaid: I don't care what Senator Thurmond wants. It takes 2 weeks. I \ndon't care who you are, and I don't care who he is. Passports take 2 \nweeks.\n  Well, he said, I have to tell you that under these circumstances, I \nam now going to have to call Senator Thurmond. When there is a \nsituation I can't\n\n[[Page S8837]]\n\nhandle myself, I have to involve him. Those are my instructions. She \nsaid: Call him. Tell him anything you want. He can call me. I don't \ncare. Passports take 2 weeks.\n  So he said: Well, I am not threatening you. I am just telling you. I \nhave to call Senator Thurmond.\n  So he hung up talking to the passport lady, and he picked up the \nphone and called Senator Thurmond. Now, it seems Senator Thurmond was \nin Germany, and it was in the middle of the night in Germany, but his \ninstructions were that he was to call Senator Thurmond in any such \nsituation. So he woke Senator Thurmond up, in the middle of the night \nin Germany, and started to explain this situation.\n  He did not get half way through the explanation I have given here \nwhen Senator Thurmond said: What is her name?\n  He said: Well, her name is--and he started to describe the wife of \nthe marine who was sent out with the Navy.\n  Senator Thurmond said: No, no, not her name, the passport lady's \nname.\n  So he gave Senator Thurmond the passport lady's name.\n  Senator Thurmond said: Thank you very much--and hung up.\n  Ten minutes later the staffer said: I got a phone call from the \npassport lady. She exploded over the phone and said: He called George \nShultz. The Secretary of State now knows my name.\n  Senator Thurmond called George Shultz and he said: George, you've \nbeen a marine. This is their honeymoon. Can't you get this lady to give \nthe woman a passport?\n  She got her passport. She got to the Mediterranean. She had her \nhoneymoon.\n  The staffer said to me: Senator, South Carolina is full of stories \nlike that. South Carolina is full of people like that. Strom Thurmond \nwill win, big time. No matter how old he is, no matter what his \nsituation, that is the kind of service Strom Thurmond has rendered as a \nSenator.\n  One of our colleagues was in the Senate doctor's office, as we go in \nthere from time to time, and he noticed Strom coming out of the \ndoctor's office with a very worried look on his face. We were all very \nconcerned about Strom and his health in his later years. So the \ncolleague said to the doctor: What's the matter with Strom?\n  The doctor said, appropriately: I cannot discuss the medical \ncondition of one patient with another patient, so I can't say anything \nto you. He said: However, I don't think it would be violating medical \nethics to tell you that Strom is a little worried about the fact that \nhe can no longer do one-arm pushups.\n  This was a man of legend. Eat right, exercise, keep a positive \nattitude, always be available for your constituents, even when it is \nthe middle of the night in Germany, and never worry about who you may \ncall or upset as long as you are working on behalf of a constituent. \nThis was Strom Thurmond.\n  We have all kinds of stories. These are my favorite ones. I offer \nthem as part of the celebration of an extraordinary life, a life fully \nlived, of someone about whom we need not say: Well, we worry about what \nmight have been. In his case, there was nothing left over that might \nhave been because he did it all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bennett \nfrom Utah for that remembrance. It was just exactly what needed to be \nsaid. I say to the Senator, I know he loved you and your father dearly. \nOn behalf of the people of South Carolina, I thank you very much for \nwhat you just said.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 191) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8837-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8837-S8839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, most of our colleagues are departing, and \nwe will shortly, in just a bit, for a recess which, as all of us know, \nis a time for visiting with our constituents, visiting around the \ncountry with people who give us the opportunity to serve in the Senate \nand interact with them in a way that we can ask questions. How are we \ndoing? You elected us to fulfill a vision that you have had and which \nwe are doing our best to lead with. So it gives us an opportunity to \nreally sit back and assess how we are doing as public servants, as \nSenators representing our own States.\n  As I look back over the last week, it has truly been an exciting week \nfor America. After years of discussion, after years of debate, we \npassed a bill this morning, in the middle of the night, late last night \nafter midnight, that we know, once we work through conference, and once \nit is signed by the President of the United States, will strengthen \nMedicare, will improve Medicare, will modernize Medicare in a way that \nwe simply never have since the origin of Medicare in the mid-1960s.\n  We know from this legislation that we developed in a bipartisan way, \nthat for the first time in this program and, indeed, in the history of \nthe country, seniors, through the Medicare Program, will have access to \nprescription drugs. They will have for the first time the option to \nchoose health care coverage that best suits their individual needs. It \nis all voluntary. They don't have to take advantage of any of these new \noptions that they will have. Their health care coverage will be \nresponsive not only to them, the way this program is designed, but to \nthe constant advances in health care delivery and new medicines and new \ntechnology that we know characterize health care today but will even \nmore so characterize health care in the years to come. It will be able \nto capture those lifesaving innovations of modern medicine.\n  Best of all--I keep mentioning it--I am very pleased with the way \nthis bill came to the Senate floor, was debated, and in committee prior \nto that because it really was a bipartisan effort. Many times, \nespecially when the American people look at the way we operate here, \nthey say: That extreme partisanship and that rhetoric going back and \nforth; how in the world does any business get done?\n  This particular legislation, probably as complicated as any \nlegislation that would be on this floor--and clearly it is big; this is \nthe largest single expansion of an entitlement program in the last 30 \nyears--was carried out in a way that debate took place in a civil \nfashion and people came together, not always agreeing, as we saw last \nnight and early this morning, on every single issue, but we tackled the \nissues head on, something our seniors deserve, something the American \npeople expect. And we delivered a bill that reflects the needs and \npriorities of both sides of the aisle.\n  Not everybody is perfectly happy with it. We know it is not perfect. \nBut it is as good as can be generated from this body at this point in \ntime.\n  That is sort of the last week, the last couple weeks. Over the last 6 \nmonths, as leadership in the Senate, we have tried to lead this body in \na way that is very much mission focused, that is very much building on \nrelationships, centered on different relationships on both sides of the \naisle in a way that values are important--the values of civility and \ntrust, and with a real action orientation, looking for solutions to \nproblems, not just talking about them, not just legislating for \nlegislation's sake but actually delivering where problems are \nidentified.\n\n  So if you look at being mission focused and relationship centered and \nvalues based and action oriented, that is what you set out to do. Then \nit provides a good opportunity, now as we go into this recess about 6 \nmonths into the year, to see what sort of job we are delivering for the \nAmerican people.\n  Again, I mentioned the bill last night because I think it fits all \nfour of those\n\n[[Page S8838]]\n\ncriteria and shows us with that common mission of moving America \nforward and doing it in a very respectful and civil way.\n  Over the past 60 days, the Senate has acted, responded, and provided \nsolutions to many of the jobs problems and the challenges brought to \nus. Every Senator can leave for this Fourth of July recess today proud \nof what they have accomplished on behalf of our fellow citizens. We \npassed the third largest tax cut in history. The Jobs and Growth Act is \nproviding immediate relief to millions of Americans, American citizens, \ntheir families, to States, to businesses. Of the $350 billion stimulus \nand growth package that we passed, nearly $200 billion, a full 60 \npercent, is provided this year and next, not way off in the future. \nIndeed, many of those checks will start flowing in the next 4 weeks.\n  This injection of money, this injection of resources will grow the \neconomy, and by growing the economy will create jobs, will increase \ninvestment, will provide States with resources to maintain essential \ngovernment services, and will reduce unemployment.\n  On this chart, I do list, in this whole jobs and growth dimension, \nthe fact that we did do a budget, the second earliest in the history of \nthis body in terms of generating a budget on April 11. And we did pass \nthe jobs and growth package on May 23. If you look, just since this \njobs and growth package was signed into law, stocks have surged about \n$619 billion in value. We should not read too much into short-term \nfluctuations in stock prices, but indeed, recent trends in the stock \nmarket suggest that overall conditions are set for a resumption of \nstrong overall economic growth.\n  As I mentioned, because of passage of this jobs and growth package, \nAmerican workers will have more money in their paychecks. A family of \nfour making $40,000 will see their taxes reduced by $1,133 in 2003. \nThose checks for $400 will be sent to nearly 25 million taxpayers \nstarting in about 4 weeks.\n  We also voted in these last several weeks to expand the child tax \ncredit to include low-income families. Because of the jobs and growth \nact, working Americans will have more money in their pockets to spend, \nto save, to invest how they wish next month.\n  Last month, we also passed--I have this listed under health--the \nglobal HIV/AIDS bill on May 15. As a physician, as one who has been \ntrying to fight this virus for the last 20 years--really since about \n1983 when this virus first appeared--23 million people have been \nkilled. It has infected another 40 million people alive today and will, \nin the best of all worlds, kill another 60 million people. This bill, \nin a bipartisan way, working with the President of the United States, \nwho led, and with the House and with the Senate, will have the impact \nof helping prevent another 7 million infected people.\n  It will help care for 10 million HIV-infected individuals and AIDS \norphans and probably, most importantly, does bring back hope to \nmillions of people in this country but indeed all over the world who \nrecognize that ultimately that virus can and will be destroyed.\n  It links prevention, care, and treatment in a comprehensive way, led \nby the United States of America, where we can leverage our leadership \nso that countries all over the world will step up and join us arm in \narm in fighting this deadly virus.\n  Our work in passing this global HIV/AIDS legislation demonstrates \nthat we as a society place a high value on life. History will judge us \non how we respond to such challenges and, indeed, we can now say very \nproudly that we are responding, that we in this body made the right \nchoice. We are taking the necessary steps to put an end to one of the \nmost deadly scourges of human life in recorded history. It is a moral \nchallenge, a medical challenge, a humanitarian challenge. But we are \nresponding, and we are leading.\n  Alongside these legislative accomplishments, we also passed a number \nof other measures. In the last 2 months we passed the Department of \nDefense authorization, the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, \nauthorization, and the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  We also allotted significant resources to upgrade technology at \nAmerica's historically black colleges and universities.\n  I am particularly very excited about this legislation because, again, \nfirsthand, I have had the opportunity to visit and speak at \nhistorically black medical schools. In fact, I was at Morehouse School \nof Medicine a few weeks ago. On my visit there, I had the opportunity \nof looking at their technology and innovation center, where they are \nactually using technology to best teach young physicians-in-training so \nthey will be able to extend the great power they have as physicians in \nmaking others' lives better.\n  We took a historic step in bringing a National Museum of African \nAmerican History and Culture to our Nation's Capital. There have been \n80 years of petitions on bringing an African American museum to the \nfamily of museums we have here in Washington, but only in this Senate \nare we finally, by passing that legislation, close to having a museum \nof African American history in Washington on the Mall. I want to take \nthe opportunity to thank all of my colleagues, but in particular \nSenator Brownback, and in the House, Congressman John Lewis, for their \nleadership on this initiative.\n  We passed expedited hiring authority for the Security and Exchange \nCommission under the leadership of Senator Shelby. This legislation \nwill allow the SEC to hire the accountants and the economists they need \nto enforce corporate accountability and maintain that investor \nconfidence we know and trust, and that we know must be the undergirding \nfoundation of our investor economy today.\n  Our colleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins, led the campaign to \nincrease public access to cardiac or heart defibrillation. We passed a \ntrauma care systems planning piece of legislation that is potentially \nimportant to everybody listening to me. If you happen to be in a motor \nvehicle accident driving home from work today, where are you going to \ngo? How quickly are people going to respond? Are you going to have a \ntertiary trauma center nearby? We, in effect, will double our national \nefforts through this legislation as we focus on trauma care systems \nplanning. I had the opportunity to introduce that, and passage was on \nJune 23.\n  My colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander--through his \nleadership, we passed the American History and Civics Education Act. \nBecause of this act, and through this act, America's students will be \nable to learn our Nation's great history and civic traditions.\n  That reminds me of Senator Gregg, the Senator from New Hampshire, and \nhis tremendous work on the initiative called Keeping Children and \nFamilies Safe Act, which was signed by President Bush just this week, \nfocusing on our children and their safety and their security.\n  Earlier this year, in March, we passed the ban on partial-birth \nabortion, a procedure that is unnecessary and offends the sensibilities \nof the American people.\n  The following month we passed the President's faith-based \ninitiative--not the whole initiative, but an important aspect of it, \nthrough a bill called the CARE Act.\n  The same month we passed AMBER Alert. Some are listed here on the \nchart, including partial-birth abortion ban, faith-based initiative, \nAMBER Alert, which we have all seen on television and heard on radio \nwhere the names actually come forth, where we have a national alert in \nthe event some tragedy has occurred.\n  Last week the child care conference report was passed. Millions of \nlives of Americans and future citizens will be protected by each of \nthese initiatives passed. They all passed on the floor of the Senate, \ndemonstrating our deep commitment and compassion for our most \nvulnerable citizens.\n\n  Internationally--and I have some of these under security--again, I \nwill not go through each one. While all of this has been going on, we \nhave funded Operation Iraqi Freedom. Who will ever forget that morning \nwatching the Iraqi people pull down that statue of Saddam Hussein? The \nUnited States, this body, will continue to aggressively support the war \non terror. We will continue that financial commitment, whatever it \ntakes, and that moral commitment to the war until America's enemies are \ndefeated.\n  Internationally, also globally, we passed the Moscow Treaty, the NATO \nexpansion. When you look at Bulgaria and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nSlovakia, and Slovenia, we see democracy\n\n[[Page S8839]]\n\nin action, where 15 or 20 years ago people would have said \n``impossible.'' So the very freedoms we are fighting for, whether it is \nin Iraq or this ongoing war of terror, they are embodied in what we \nhave voted on in this Senate--expansion of NATO to include these new \ndemocracies.\n  We also passed the Microenterprise Assistance Program, which will \nhelp impoverished citizens build and grow small businesses, so people \nwho may not have access to capital are given some assistance, which, \ncombined with their own entrepreneurial spirit, can grow and they can \nhave that opportunity to take part in a growing economy. This economic \ntool is especially powerful for impoverished women in developing \ncountries all over the world. I spend some time every year going to \nAfrica and in a few months I will be going with a Senate delegation to \nSouth Africa, Botswana and Namibia. Last January, I was in Uganda, \nTanzania, Kenya, and the Sudan. You see the importance of these what \nare called microenterprise grants, giving people that opportunity to \ngrow economically, help their family return to dignity and opportunity \nthat they simply don't otherwise have.\n  I listed here a series called values. I mentioned most of these. But \nthe Burmese Freedom Act is an issue that is ongoing in a part of the \nworld where we see the civil liberties we take for granted being \nstripped away. When you say freedom in this country, you think of \nfreedom of speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of the press. But \nthe Burmese Freedom Act is necessary because in that part of the \nworld--particularly right now--those freedoms don't exist. Again, this \nwas an important response on behalf of the Senator from Kentucky and \nothers to bring attention to the human rights abuses that are being put \nforth and committed by the Burmese government against its citizens.\n  So the Senate, by working together, has accomplished a lot, with a \nlot of hard work and cooperation. I once again thank my colleagues for \ntheir efforts. We are doing all this, and I put ``action'' up here on \nthe chart, and the goals that we have met because day to day we are \nfocusing on each of these and we rarely have the opportunity to go \nback. The importance is on ``action.'' This is occurring now in this \nfirst 6 months, but it occurred compared to the last Congress, when we \nnever passed a budget.\n  In the last Congress, we didn't pass 11 out of 13 appropriations \nbills. In the last Congress, we did not pass Medicare. So it is the \naction, and the solution is fulfilling the agenda that we put forth. \nThat is what the American people expect. We have made the legislative \nprocess work.\n  The one area that I believe continues to undermine the effectiveness \nof the Senate is the obstructionism towards the President's circuit \ncourt nominees, the judicial nominees. This is unprecedented in our \n200-year history, the tactics to endlessly delay the process and \nprevent the Senate from performing its constitutional responsibility to \nvote on the President's judicial nominees. That is inconsistent with \nthe Constitution.\n  Our responsibility is to advise and consent. Yet we are being denied \na simple up-or-down vote, allowing people to vote how they wish, but \nallowing them to express advice and consent by voting which is, in the \nend, the only way we can express that advice and consent. The Senate \nhas few constitutional responsibilities as important as exercising that \nadvice and consent on the President's judicial nominees. I am \ndetermined to press forward in the next weeks to carry out a fair and \norderly Senate process and return to the norms of the last 200 years, \nwhere Senators are given that opportunity for an up-or-down vote.\n  Looking ahead, July will be a busy month. I do want my colleagues to \nknow--and we had some discussion with the Senator from West Virginia \nlast night in terms of making sure we have good productive Fridays--I \ncan assure my colleagues that in July, in large part because we will be \naddressing the appropriations bills very aggressively during that \nmonth, we will be working 5 days a week, and it is likely that votes \nwill continue late in the day on Fridays, at least later than usual on \nFridays.\n  During July, in addition to the appropriations bills, we will \ncomplete action on the Energy bill, which we all know is critical to \ngenerating an affordable, reliable energy supply.\n  I know we will be aggressive in passing these appropriations bills \nfor the Cabinet agencies. Early on, I expect to see the Department of \nDefense, the Department of Homeland Security, Labor and Health and \nHuman Services, and, at the same time, I want to address one other \nissue in July--and this is an ambitious schedule--but I do believe \nstrongly, and I say this in part as a physician, yes--that we have an \nobligation to diminish--I would like to say eliminate--the frivolous \nmedical liability lawsuits that are being applied today.\n  That needs to be the goal: to get rid of the frivolous lawsuits \nbecause they unnecessarily drive up the cost of health care, and if you \nunnecessarily drive up the cost of health care, you end up driving \npeople to the ranks of the uninsured.\n  We will address that issue during the month of July, as well as \nissues surrounding genetic discrimination, an issue that has already \nbeen addressed in committee and is ready to come to the floor.\n  This is an impressive list, I think. It is one I am confident we will \nbe able to handle in a systematic and productive way, always keeping in \nmind that goal of moving America forward and that we are working for \nthe American people. They send us here to get results, not unnecessary \nlegislation, but get results to the problems and challenges they face.\n  If we look at the list, I think we are on the right track. We have \naccomplished a lot. We have had a number of successes. We have seen \nresults. We are delivering to the American people in strong, effective \nlegislation, and I have every expectation that we will continue \nbuilding on this record of success in the weeks and months to come.\n  To my colleagues, I do wish them all a happy Fourth of July. I hope \nthey will travel safely. I extend my best wishes to them and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, in a few minutes I will be back with another \nstatement, and then we will have some closing business over the course \nof the day.\n  For now, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: What is pending before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from New Mexico desires to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8839-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8839-S8842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE HOPE-FILLED SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was in my office and I regret that I \nwas unable to be in the Chamber when the distinguished majority leader, \nDr. Bill Frist, gave a rather elaborate, detailed, and enlightened \ndiscussion regarding illnesses, ailments, cures, and the evolution of \ndiseases in this country and in the world.\n  I commend him for that. Had I been in the Chamber at that time, I \nwould have taken the opportunity to present him with the first document \nthat the Senator from New Mexico is having printed. It will be \nsomething that I choose to call ``The Hope-filled Senator.'' The hope-\nfilled Senator is the story of America's future in terms of diseases, \nprescriptions, and cures. It is my own story of what I believe is going \nto happen to prescription drugs, to the medical profession, and to the \ndelivery of health care over the next 30 to 40 years.\n  I am hoping that this very brief summary of the hope-filled Senator's \nthoughts will be of some help to Senators and people who are so worried \nabout the costs of prescription drugs. Will it really work; will we \nreally have enough money to do it or not?\n  Today, I will not repeat the contents of this hope-filled statement \nthat I delivered as the Senator from New Mexico, calling myself a hope-\nfilled Senator.\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\n  Suffice it to say that when one discusses a program of the magnitude \nof this prescription drug program, that it is absolutely imperative \nthat it is looked at from more than one vantage point. One vantage \npoint is to look at it as Senators did on the Senate floor, in the back \nrooms and in caucuses. We talked about the specifics of who is going to \nget the drugs, how much is it going to cost, will we have enough money, \nand are we going to be able to pay for it? We asked will America go \nbankrupt? Will Medicare really survive and will it be competitive? Are \nwe really building into the system? We examined the ingredients that \nare so well known for bringing prices down. We examined competition for \ndelivery and competition for business. All of that is one way to look \nat it.\n\n  One must look at it that way, but another way to look at it is to try \nto think of what is going to happen to health delivery and medical care \nduring the ensuing 10, 20, 30, or 40 years. The hope-filled Senator is \ntalking about those things as he looks at the next four decades.\n  By way of recapitulation of what was in my statement of a hope-filled \nSenator, there are three or four big things. We finished mapping the \nchromosomes of the human anatomy. We call that the genome system. That \nmeans that after years of mankind researching to try to find where in \nthe chromosome of the human body was the aberration that caused \nmultiple sclerosis, and years of research at various institutions to \nlocate the gene, or the number of genes that caused, perhaps, \nschizophrenia--what we finally did in a record period was to take them \nall, map them and index them. We can say we know where they all are. We \ndo not have to go looking for them anymore.\n  I do not mean to make this a big thing, because people sometimes \nthink they do not have to worry about it. But this is a big thing. For \nyears, even in our lifetime, we can remember reading a story that would \nleave the medical journals and be big enough to hit the newspapers. The \nstory would say, ``Michigan State group of researchers discover the \nlocation on the genome system of a multiple sclerosis gene.'' Remember \nthat? Boy, that was big time.\n  Soon, I am going to hand to the majority leader the first copy of a \ndocument called ``The Hope-filled Senator.'' I am going to have it \nencapsulated with gold print. It is the hope-filled Senator's other \nside of the story. It is the story of the delivery system of health \ncare during the next 40 or 50 years as it most assuredly will impact on \nthis prescription drug system.\n  I did not go bother a bunch of scientists in putting this document \ntogether. So, they may find this document lacking. But what I did, and \nI repeat it now because our leader is in the Chamber, I used four or \nfive big things that are going to change. I started with the genome \nmapping, indicating that we have now located the aberrations on the \nchromosome system of the anatomy of every known disease from which \nmankind suffers.\n  Why is that important in the hope-filled Senator's dissertation \nregarding prescription drugs? Because there is no question during the \ndelivery system that we tried so valiantly to find out how much it is \ngoing to cost. During that time many diseases for which we are spending \nhuge amounts of money in prescriptions are going to be cured. \nResearches will know where where the illnesses are and they will be \nable to research how to fix them. And, they are going to fix many of \nthem.\n  What does that mean? That means many of the expected costs that the \nCongressional Budget Office plugged into their estimates are going to \nbe different. Indeed, there are going to be prescription drug \nbreakthroughs that come from this genome mapping that are going to \nclearly indicate that there are different ways to do what we are doing \ntoday. We can achieve better results. So, as I said this will \ndramatically change the delivery system of health care.\n  I was foolish enough, as a hope-filled Senator, to predict that \nbefore the turn of 40 years the hospitals in America will not be the \nhospitals of today. I predicted that we would have hospitals that are \ngoing to be more concerned with genetics than with the individual \ncuring of an ailment.\n  I did not dream that up. When I first started working on genomes, I \nhad a magnificent, wonderful doctor who egged me on, and he was the \ninventor of Tylenol. He used to sit in my office and talk with me. He \nused to draw what he thought a hospital might look like in 30 or 40 \nyears. I used to laugh and throw the drawings away. He drew a center \nwhere you would check your gene system and they would tell you, as you \nleft, what was wrong with you and how they would fix you. Or if you got \nsick, that is what they would plug in. That would be the hospital.\n\n  He is still alive; he is currently practicing as a very old doctor. \nHe joined up with doctors who are down in the South delivering health \ncare to poor people free. He does this just because he wants to keep on \nbeing a doctor. He was so thrilled that he hooked me on this concept \nthat we never lost contact.\n  In this hope-filled sermon, we start with that.\n  Then I said, the American economy is going to change so rapidly in \nterms of its productivity and, at the same time, produce new things \nbecause of nanoscience. I defined nanoscience as the newest science \nthat is so unique, and so way out, that today's scientists are saying \nwe will not recognize the products that humanity will be using because \nof nanoscience. They are practicing a science of changing the molecules \nthat make up a substance. Imagine, compare that with making zinc by \nadding a couple of compounds. That science is today's industry. They \nwill be changing the molecular makeup so things change and become \nsomething different.\n  It is predicted with the five centers that exist in America today on \nnanoscience, and many more to come, that the breakthroughs, once they \nstart, will occur with such rapidity that the productivity in America \nand in the world will change. That means those who make medicine and \ncures will be part of picking up that change and those breakthroughs \nalso.\n  The third that I am aware of, and there are probably some I am \nmissing, is a most incredible science. For lack of better terminology \nit is called microengineering or the production of microengines.\n  I visited the Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico. They wanted \nto show me microengines. I thought, you have to be kidding; what kind \nof engines could there be that are so small they have now reached this \nlevel? They showed me. Microengines are so small. Now we have in the \ncomputer business a chip, and on the surface of the chip we can put \nthese different things, and that is how we get these millions of \nmegabytes. Now it is trillions and numbers we did not even used to use. \nThey actually create engines that are so small they put them on a chip, \nbut they can be synchronized and organized as engines on that little \nchip.\n  The engines look to me something like an oil patch when you see the \ndrilling wells with the pumps. They are so small you could never see \nthem unless you used an extremely powerful microscope.\n  What will happen with these engines? We do not know. But, they have a \nhypothesis. It is entirely possible that one of the first things we \nwill do with these engines is organize them so well that we will be \nable to inject them in the human body. They will be directed to do some \nwork, and they will do it like they are told. And, believe it or not, \nthey possibly will go in and eat what you want them to eat. They will \nbe able to go into the heart system to open up areas we worry are \nclogged. These little microengines will dissolve those clogs for you.\n  Those are engineers that can do that work. We will not even have to \nsend patients over to Vanderbilt University to a bunch of scientists or \nheart specialists.\n\n  There will be huge numbers of breakthroughs if we add those three \nthings to a vibrant American economy. We must not mess up by causing \nthe American economic system to go to sleep. We must keep the economy \nvibrant, by doing the right things in terms of taxing the right things \nand not the wrong things. If we continue to fund the right research \ninstead of the wrong things, and we keep on funding NIH but maybe we \nreach the point where 10 percent a year might be enough and maybe we \nmove over and fund some physical science like the Energy Department\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\nand a few other institutions of our Government that are doing basic \nscience so physical science can catch up with the biological sciences. \nThere will be huge numbers of breakthroughs.\n  My hope-filled delivery dissertation says: Don't be so worried about \nwhether we will be able to deliver on what we promise. We may be able \nto deliver even more than we think we are going to deliver. And let's \njust watch out that in putting the system together--and I know the \nmajority leader has been worried about this--that we don't just put \nbureaucracy in place where it inhibits the injection of these new \nthings into the delivery system.\n  That is why HCFA, which this Senator personally as a young Senator \nfound was such a terrible inhibitor to delivering appropriate care had \nto be changed. The management tool had grown so big that all we heard \nas Senators when we went home to our hospitals, to our doctors, to our \nclinics, to those centers that were taking care of people in shelters, \nall we heard was HCFA is messed up so badly that we are doing worse \nwith their rules than if we did not have any rules. It was so bad once \nthat I thought I would come back here and introduce a bill that \nrecommended we experiment with 100 places where we will treat seniors \nwith no regulations. We would look at them once every 6 months. And \ntake a chance and see if they are not better run and the people taken \ncare of better and cheaper than those who have to have someone checking \noff every time an apple was delivered to a senior that happened to have \nbeen decayed, if it was brown and faulty. At one time, you had to note \nthat you delivered a bad apple, literally, to a senior.\n  Now, frankly, I know a lot about fiscal policy.\n  I know a lot of experts on this bill who are worried about whether we \nare going to have enough money to deliver under this system. But I \nchose to go over it and spend a little bit of time on it. Once I \ndecided we were going to try this and to talk about this, I say to my \nfriend, the majority leader--yesterday afternoon while he was still \nburdened, I sat down and wrote on a piece of paper what the score would \nbe at whatever hour we voted last night. What I wrote down was the vote \nwould be 78 yes, and 22 no. The vote turned out to be 76-21. I think I \nknow what happened to one of them who would have made it 77, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. But I think it became pretty clear to people \nlike me that the Senate was ready. I had a hope they were ready, \nbecause even if they weren't, I had a hunch they had some hope we could \nget this done.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just about 30 minutes ago I sat down and \nwanted to review a little bit about the last 6 months. As I did that \nand came to the floor and cited some of the legislation we have done, I \nso much appreciate the comments of the Senator from New Mexico because \nthey fit with the hope which I translate into maybe additional dreams \nand hopes, but reality.\n  I have been blessed to be in this body for the last 8 years, but \nprior to that, 20 years in the scientific field and spending hours and \nnights in laboratories thinking and trying to hypothesize about what \nwould occur 6 months later; or why a capillary muscle relaxed in a way \nbased on the metabolic environment and doing my best to figure it out \nand doing the experiments; but then 6 months later because of the work \nof other people in maybe unrelated fields, having that hypothesis \nchanged and productivity to increase to the point that my idea was \nsolved--not the way I wanted to, but because of investment with \nscience. I would run over from the laboratory to the clinical arena and \nwork in a health care system that was beautiful, which was delivering \nthe very best quality of care but looking at it through really a \nMedicare system at the time that was so rigid and inflexible because of \nthe 130,000 pages of regulations from HCFA--the Health Care Financing \nAdministration--which had evolved over a period of 30 years with good \nintentions but which so micromanaged and so straitjacketed the \nphysicians, the scientists, the researchers, the patients, governing \nthe doctor-patient interaction--130,000 pages of governing which meant \nyou could not capture whether it is the nanotechnology or the 3 billion \nbits of information out of the human genome project today, with the \nmicromanaging that the Senator was talking about--that can't be \nassimilated into the system of health care delivery at a rate which the \nAmerican people deserve.\n\n  I mention that because as I was going through this legislation, I was \nthinking of AIDS/HIV, a huge problem with 23 million people dead and 40 \nmillion people infected, and there is no cure. Another 60 million \npeople will die. Thus, we need to encourage that innovation, invent \nthat vaccine, engage in that science. Right now we don't know what the \nhypothesis is. But it is there, and we are going to see it in our \nlifetime, because in part, just as the Senator from New Mexico led the \nsupport in the human genome at the time, at the time nobody really knew \nwhat was going to happen, he was out here 15 years ago leading on the \nhuman genome project, for a shorter period of time we had that phone \nbook of 3 billion bits of information which is there. It is the phone \nbook, as he said. Now it can be applied.\n  I mention that because 12 hours ago on this floor we passed a piece \nof legislation that delivers prescription drugs in an unprecedented way \nfor the first time in the history of the Medicare program. We are \nhelping seniors with prescription drugs. But at the same time it \nmodernizes Medicare to get rid of the unnecessary bureaucracy, the \nredtape, the straitjacket, the micromanagement, building in the \nflexibility where those new ideas, the dynamism from the marketplace, \nthe innovation in the marketplace can be assimilated and speed up the \nprocess where we can address this huge unfunded liability which we know \noccurs in Medicare today because of what our seniors deserve. But we \nhave a doubling of the number of seniors.\n  At the same time we offer the prescription drug package, we modernize \nMedicare in such a way that it is flexible. These new ideas will be \nincorporated in a rapid fashion.\n  Heart transplantation. At the time I first started heart transplants, \nit was very rare. Lung transplants had never been done successfully. I \nam not that old. But I had the opportunity to be involved in heart \ntransplants. It took about 5 years after I was doing them routinely in \nthe private sector for Medicare to allow any reimbursement for our \nseniors--5 years because of bureaucrats. It is the way Government \nworks. It takes a long time. That is just one procedure.\n  The optimism which the Senator talked about, I think so realistically \nand eloquently, is there. There is no question.\n  When we talk about 14 years out trying to predict essentially a \nstatic system moving ahead, and it is not going to happen--the advances \nin technology are just like that. The half-life of science has gone \nfrom 10 to 7 to probably 4 years now, and it is going to be down to 2 \nyears. It is the same way with the health care delivery systems, and \nthe old fee-for-service.\n  My dad practiced medicine for 55 years. As the Senator was talking \nabout the genetic testing that is going to be available, the \nappropriate response and how we are going to be able to develop cures, \nI was sitting there thinking of my dad with his black bag in the 1940s, \n1950s, and 1960s. He didn't have any medicines. He had none. He had \nantibiotics after 1945, but none before that.\n  But the revolution I have seen when I was doing heart transplants and \nlifting people's hearts out and putting them in was made possible \nbecause of one drug--cyclosporine. If the pharmaceutical companies had \nnot invested to get that drug, we would not have been able to do heart \nand lung transplants.\n\n  The advances we went through in that 20 or 25 years--and now I see \nbecause of the work like the human genome projects and nanotechnology--\nthat combination--once we allow that to marry with our health care and \ngovernment-sponsored programs, the sky is the limit. Productivity will \nincrease. The advances can be assimilated. We will be able to think \nmore in terms of, yes, longevity, but also quality of life.\n  It does come down to hope. I very much appreciate the Senator \narticulating the big vision, because every day we are here, in the back \nof my mind I am thinking the same thing. Prescription drugs are \nimportant, but at the\n\n[[Page S8842]]\n\nsame time to develop a system that can capture that technology and at \nthe same time look at HIV/AIDS and make sure there is a vaccine bill, \nand that we keep trying. We are all trying to get it through.\n  But right now, because of the medical liability issues which we are \ngoing to address in July, when you have predatory trial lawyers--not \nall are predatory--who are really going to come in and say that vaccine \nhas certain side effects, there is going to be a lawsuit, and there \nwill be a lot of frivolous lawsuits that drive up the cost of health \ncare and drive people to the ranks of the uninsured.\n  One last issue which I didn't mention earlier but which we addressed \non the floor goes into this--medical safety in the hospital.\n  The Institute of Medicine report said there are 100,000 people who \ndie every year because of medical errors in the hospital. Most of that \nis cross-reaction from drugs and the like. The best way to approach \nthat is to have information voluntarily shared by physicians and by \nnurses to learn in an ongoing, continuous quality management program \nand to have that information available, which is correct, and which is \nself-correcting. But if you have predatory trial lawyers all the way \naround, and you have incentives not to share that information, we are \nnever going to make this system better.\n\n  So it all fits together: the science, the technology, the framework \nwhich the Senator explained so well. What we are doing in Medicare, the \naccess to prescription drugs, global HIV/AIDS--you put all that \ntogether. If we keep moving things, as we have in the last, I would \nsay, 6 months, I am absolutely--absolutely--convinced we are going to \nbe able to capture those hopes.\n  In many ways, people say: You're dreaming. You describe them as \nhopes. Having seen science and technology in my own life, they may have \nstarted as dreams, and they may be hopes now, but in our lifetimes they \nare going to be reality.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you so much for your comments. I was very pleased \nto yield.\n  I just want to say, without hopes and dreams in these fields, there \nis no question we are overwhelmed. It is hopes and hope-filled ideas \nthat keep us energized. But it does not mean we do not have a big job \nbecause, as a matter of fact, the hopes can truly be deenergized by \nsystems that do not let it work. That is what we have to worry about.\n  In my opinion, the breakthroughs are going to be so rapid that the \nbureaucracy that manages the change is going to have to be looked at \nall the time by people who really know. The breakthroughs will occur, \nand it will make your 5-year example--of how long it took for the heart \nto go from being done to being accepted--it will make that example pale \nas compared to the breakthroughs that are going to be over and over and \naround here and over there. We think the new bureaucracy--which the \nSenator and others helped put together--will make that work better.\n  I do want to hold the floor. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8842-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8842-S8843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about my friend, Senator \nStrom Thurmond. I do not have any prepared remarks but I want to speak \nfor a few moments about Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  Senator Strom Thurmond spent many, many years sitting in the seat, \nfor those observing the Senate Chamber, right next to the seat where \nthe distinguished majority leader is sitting right now.\n  I have eight children. Senator Thurmond, as everyone knows, lived a \nvery long life with his first wife without children. I don't know if \nthat had anything to do with his huge interest in asking people such as \nme how my children were, and I am not one who is very loathe to tell \npeople about my children's successes.\n  So he used to say to me, and to anyone around, he would point at me, \nand say: ``There is the Senator with all the smart kids.'' Of course, I \nwas embarrassed, and I would bend down and say: ``Senator, there are \nlots of Senators with smart children.''\n  Then he would say: ``Well, you told me about one'' . . . and he would \nexplain what I told him. He would ask, ``how is that one doing?''\n  Well, obviously, those days are gone now. I was privileged, with my \nwife Nancy, to go to the wedding of his daughter here in this town not \ntoo many years ago. It was a beautiful wedding, a big wedding. It was a \nbeautiful daughter and a beaming father, Strom Thurmond.\n  He was already past 90, for certain, and how thrilled he was to walk \ndown the aisle and to be part of the normal wedding activities.\n  I note that with all the blessings he has received in his life, and \nall the legacy that he leaves, he got one blessing that he deserved; \nthat is, that wedding and that marriage yielded his first grandchild. \nAnd I just wonder because he had already left the Senate; he was no \nlonger here; he was in a hospital, but I just wonder, how happy that \nday must have been for him. He had a grandchild at that very old age.\n  There are Senators, such as from his home State, who have known him \nthrough campaigns and actions and activities that I hear of. I have \nread of these activities, but I did not participate in them, so they \nwill do better than I in talking about him. But I am 71. I am very \nlucky, I feel, in that I have spent 31 years in the Senate. The only \nthing I did prior to that is, 6\\1/2\\ years before I came here, I \naccepted a dare from a group of friends to run for an office. I ran and \ngot elected. And that office was for city council, which put me in a \nmayorship of sorts in our biggest city.\n  So you know, if you write down, at 71, what I have done: I ran for a \nnonpartisan office, got elected, served 4 years, waited 2 years, got \nelected to the Senate, and came here. But we all know, if we are going \nto put down what Strom Thurmond has done as a public servant, all of \nwhich clearly is one's legacy, it would take me quite a while to \ndiscuss it all. Just his military career would be a rather good speech \nand a rather good talk on the Senate floor.\n  The other thing that, to me, is of such rare, rare importance is that \nwhen you consider 100 years, and that 80 or 79 of those years he was an \nadult, you just think of all the things that have changed during his \nadulthood. Governance, governmental changes, cultural changes, \nphilosophical leanings and tendencies of our great country changing. \nYou have to conclude that this man, who represented a State that also \nchanged and had become a great industrial State, and a great \neducational State, with fantastic educational institutions, that this \ngreat man also learned how to change. He changed with time, not \nchanging in the sense of giving up but rather of gaining more for \nhimself and becoming more rather than becoming less.\n  Now, I have known a lot of great Senators, more than most, because \nthere are only five or six Senators who have been here longer than I, \nas of today, maybe five. So I have known a lot of them. I think it is \nonly fair to say, for his family, for Nancy, for his children, there \nreally have never been any Senators like him that I have been \nprivileged to know.\n  He was indeed unique. He was so different that you cannot forget him. \nFirst, he was so personal to everyone. He was never forgetting. He was \nalways considerate. He spent more time and effort at little things.\n  I know nothing about his constituent work. Let those who know speak. \nI speak of little things here in the Senate. The Chair and I both \nwatched during a week at the end of a day's work, we watched Strom \nThurmond while he was still around and healthy and walking. We watched \nwhat he did. He went with his staff from one event to another, perhaps \nthree, four, five events an evening, because he had been invited and \nbecause it was somebody who said: ``Would you come to my party?'' \n``Would you come to my fundraiser?'' ``Would you come to my birthday?'' \n``Would you come and join me; we have visitors from my State.'' What it \nwas that made him that kind of person, who knows? I don't know. You \ndon't know. The Senate doesn't know. I am not sure his family knows. \nBut the truth is, we know he did that.\n  All of these would appear, what I have said so far, to be things that \none might say are not very important.\n\n[[Page S8843]]\n\nWell, I stated them because I think they are very important. They are \nof utmost importance. I think they are the essence of who he is and \nwhat he is and what he was.\n  But don't let anyone think he didn't do his work. When you look at \nthe committees he chaired, the events that happened during those chair-\nfilled years, be it on the Judiciary, on Armed Services, or whatever, \nyou have to know he had a great capacity for work and he did his work \nand got it done.\n  Can you just imagine not having a chance to know him when he was a \njudge? What a great judge he would have been. Can you imagine, not \nhaving a chance to know him, what a good school superintendent he must \nhave been? Can you imagine not getting to know him, what a good \ncommissioner he must have been at the local level where he governed? \nFor I believe he is what he was. And it is probable that he took care \nto do everything right and he took care to be concerned and worried \nabout people, as he did his job, and that he never forgot the people \nwho were good to him and meant something to his success.\n  I, for one, am very sorry we will be going to a funeral. But, I guess \nit is really only fair to say that he has been very blessed. After all, \nwe won't, any of us, ever go to a funeral for a fellow Senator who has \nlived 100 years--none of us. This will be the only one. Because he has \nbeen very, very blessed. The Lord has been kind and decent to him. \nThose around him should be very proud. Obviously, his kinfolk are sad.\n  I remember at that wedding, while we were celebrating youth, his \ndaughter was a young lady. I remember meeting his sister, two sisters I \nbelieve. They were alive and there. I don't mean to cast any aspersions \nabout the fact they were alive. They were lively, I assure you. They \nknew a lot. They were talking. They were carrying on conversations. \nStrom Thurmond was talking with them about us and my wife Nancy.\n  They were quick to ask us to sit down, and you could hardly believe \nthat a man almost 100 was there with sisters at a wedding for a very \nyoung daughter of his, who has just since then had his first \ngrandchild. What a beautiful, beautiful tribute all of this is to Strom \nThurmond's family, to their heritage, and to those around them and \nthose who love them.\n  My wife Nancy and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Nancy and all \nof the other kinfolk, to his relatives, and clearly to his daughter and \nson-in-law who have that young grandchild of whom he must be so proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, last evening we received the news of the \npassing of a dear friend and leader in this Chamber, Strom Thurmond. \nStrom Thurmond retired this year at the age of 100 after more than half \na century serving the people of South Carolina and our Nation as a \nSenator, as Governor of South Carolina, and as a State legislator.\n  Remarkably, his career in the Senate spanned the administrations of \n10 Presidents, from Dwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush. His passing \nlast night certainly will be felt by so many Members of this Chamber \nwho had grown accustomed to the courtly gentleman from South Carolina. \nBut his life leaves a lesson for us all in compassion, respect, \ncivility, dedication, and hard work.\n  Before he was elected to the Senate in 1954, as the only write-in \ncandidate in history to win a seat in Congress, Strom Thurmond was \nelected county school superintendent, State Senator, and circuit judge. \nHe resigned his judgeship to enlist in the Army in World War II. He \nlanded in Normandy as part of the 82nd Airborne assault on D-Day and, \nthe story goes, flew into France on a glider, crash-landing in an apple \norchard. He went on to help liberate Paris, and he received a Purple \nHeart, five Battle Stars, and numerous other awards for his World War \nII service.\n  My husband Bob and I were honored to have known Strom Thurmond for so \nmany years and to count him among our very special friends. He and Bob \nshared a great deal of common history, dating from their World War II \ndays. And his southern gallantry always had a way of making this North \nCarolinian feel right at home.\n  I first worked with Strom Thurmond when I served as Deputy Special \nAssistant to the President at the White House. Even then he was an \nimpressive Senator. President Reagan praised his expert handling as \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee of nominees to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  In fact, it was Strom Thurmond's skill as chairman that helped to \nshepherd through the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor as the Nation's \nfirst female on the U.S. Supreme Court. I had always admired Strom \nThurmond for his constant dedication to the people of South Carolina \nand to the industries of that State.\n  Bob Dole has joked that someone once asked if Strom had been around \nsince the Ten Commandments. Bob said that couldn't have been true; If \nStrom Thurmond had been around, the 11th commandment would have been: \nThou shalt support the textile industry.\n  And that industry still needs a lot of help. In fact, when President \nReagan called Strom to wish him a happy 79th birthday back in 1981, \nStrom Thurmond, with his constant attention to South Carolina \ninterests, used the opportunity to talk to the President about the \ntextile industry.\n  Indeed, South Carolina is full of stories of how the senior Senator \nfrom South Carolina managed to cut through redtape to make sure that \nhis residents got the things they needed. And whenever South \nCarolinians called, or anyone else for that matter, Strom Thurmond \ncould always be counted on to show up--at a Fourth of July parade, a \ncounty festival, or a State fair, armed with his trademark Strom \nThurmond key chains.\n  North Carolinians developed a fondness for Strom Thurmond. He often \nflew in to Charlotte before driving to his Edgeville, SC, home. He \nbecame so familiar in the airport that many of the workers there knew \nhim, and he knew them all for stopping to share a kind word or a funny \nstory.\n  I was so honored that just before Strom went home for good to South \nCarolina, he came in his wheelchair, with Nancy's help, to my little \nbasement office to welcome me to the Senate.\n  Bob and I send our heartfelt condolences to Strom's family, our dear \nfriend, Nancy, and the children, including daughter Julie, who worked \nwith me at the American Red Cross. He was a loving husband, a proud \nfather, and new grandfather, and, of course, the people of South \nCarolina, for whom he worked tirelessly throughout his career in public \nservice and to whom he chose to return when his work was done in the \nSenate.\n  Today as I remember him, his life, and his legacy, I think of the \nBible in the 25th chapter of Matthew when the Lord said:\n\n       Well done, thou good and faithful servant. . . . enter thou \n     into the joy of thy Lord.\n\n  May God bless him and his family.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (Mrs. DOLE assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8843-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8843-S8844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FILIBUSTER REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, last Tuesday, the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration favorably reported S. Res. 138, a proposal to amend the \nSenate's cloture rule. The committee's action represents an important \nmilestone on the road to filibuster reform. It brings the Senate one \nkey step closer to ending filibusters on nominations. On May 9 of this \nyear, I introduced S. Res. 138, along with a bipartisan group of 11 \ncosponsors. Our purpose was to respond to a disturbing change in the \nway the Senate considers nominations.\n  Lengthy and apparently implacable filibusters have erupted on two \njudicial nominations. Although it has long been clear that a majority \nof Senators stand ready to confirm Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen, \nit is increasingly obvious that a minority of Senators never intends to \npermit these nominations to come to a vote.\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\n  Beyond these filibusters are the expressed threats to filibuster \nadditional nominees, threats that may well materialize after the Senate \nreconvenes in July.\n  Given the record already established this year, we have every reason \nto take these threats seriously and to imagine they will be executed. \nKilling judicial nominations by filibuster is not simply business as \nusual in the Senate. Up until now, no judicial nomination has ever been \nrejected in that fashion.\n  Even the failed Supreme Court nomination of Abe Fortas 35 years ago \nis not truly an exception to this rule. In the Fortas case, one cloture \nvote was taken with 45 Senators supporting cloture and 43 opposed. At \nleast five additional Senators who missed that vote expressed \nopposition to cloture. Yet another who supported cloture expressed \nopposition to the nomination.\n  It was far from plain, even to the nominee, that a majority was ready \nto confirm the nomination, much less a supermajority was available to \ninvoke cloture.\n  After a single cloture vote taken four session days after the \nnomination was brought to the floor, the nominee asked that his name be \nwithdrawn.\n  These facts differ dramatically from those pertinent to filibusters \nunderway in this Congress and from the rest of Senate cloture history \non judicial nominations.\n  Thus far, we have had six cloture votes on Mr. Estrada and two \ncloture votes on Justice Owen, with more than a majority of Senators \nbut less than a supermajority, favoring cloture. So the filibusters \nendure with no end in sight.\n  Prior to this year, the record number of cloture motions filed on any \nsingle judicial nomination was 2, and 17 such motions were filed \noverall. In a majority of those cases, cloture was invoked and \nconfirmation followed. Even when cloture failed, confirmation followed. \nIn all cases, the nominations were brought to a vote, the full Senate \nworked its will, and the nominees were confirmed.\n  The Estrada and Owen filibusters and their threatened progeny are \nanything but customary. They represent a disturbing change in Senate \nnorms, a change that has been defended on untenable grounds.\n  Proponents of the filibusters claim they have no choice. With the \nSenate and its committees controlled by the party of the President, \nthey have no choice but to filibuster, or so they say. Their logic is \nfacile but faulty, and it runs contrary to many years of Senate \ntradition.\n  For 70 percent of the 20th century, one party controlled the White \nHouse and the Senate. This was the case for 6 years of President \nWilson's term and the entire terms of Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and \nHoover. It was the case through 12 years of President Franklin \nRoosevelt and 6 years of President Harry Truman. It was the case for \nall of the Kennedy-Johnson years, all of President Carter's years, 6 of \nPresident Reagan's years, and 2 years under President Clinton. In some \nof those eras, the Senate minority was Republican; in others \nDemocratic. But at no time did those minorities resort to partisan \nfilibusters of judicial nominees. At no time did those minorities deny \nthe Senate the right to vote on confirmation.\n\n  What is happening now is aberrant. It breaks with Senate traditions. \nIf the trend begun with the Estrada and Owen filibusters is not \narrested, a disturbing new practice will take root.\n  Partisan filibusters to kill nominations will lead inevitably to more \nof the same in retribution. Left to fester, things can only get worse. \nThe outcome cannot be good for current or future Senates, for current \nor future Presidents, for current or future nominees.\n  Those of us concerned about these consequences have two fundamental \nchoices: We can either acquiesce to this partisan change in Senate \nnorms, or propose a reform to Senate rules. Unwilling to accept a \nchange in Senate traditions that will damage and weaken this \ninstitution, we offer a targeted and limited amendment to the rules.\n  Our remedy is narrow, aimed not against the filibuster generally, but \nagainst filibusters on nominations. If adopted, our proposal would have \ndeclining cloture requirements of 60, 57, 54, 51, and then a simple \nmajority on successive cloture votes. The first cloture motion cannot \nbe filed until a nomination has been pending for 12 hours. Successive \ncloture motions cannot be filed until the prior cloture motion has been \nresolved. As under current rules, each cloture motion will take 2 days \nto ripen. Our proposal is true to Senate traditions. It will permit \nrobust debate and time for reflection, but also allow the Senate to \nreach a definite resolution on confirmations.\n  As I have said on this floor and before the committee, the filibuster \nis not sacrosanct. When it has been abused, it has been reformed. The \nvery cloture rule itself represented just such a response to filibuster \nabuse. It has been amended five times since it was first adopted in \n1917. Moreover, the very modest debate limitations we propose are \nsignificantly less restrictive than more than 25 provisions now in \nstatute law that expedite Senate debate on measures ranging from budget \nreconciliation to the execution of war powers.\n  Madam President, some on the other side of the aisle have said our \nproposal is too extreme in that it would undermine their capacity to \nuse existing rules to reshape Senate norms. Others from the same side \nhave said our reform is too narrow because it does not attack \nfilibusters in all circumstances.\n  My response is this: We must fix what is damaged, but we do not \nrequire radical surgery. We shall reform our rules to repair what is \nbroken and restore traditions. Beyond that, we shall leave our rules \nalone.\n  Our opponents contend that our narrow reform will inevitably lead to \nthe wholesale destruction of the filibuster in the Senate and that it \nwill convert the Senate into a smaller copy of the House. I know of \nfew, if any, Senators who would support that outcome, and I regard such \npredictions as fanciful. This proposal does not attack the use of \nfilibuster on legislation. Instead, it builds on an existing tradition \nof distinctive procedures for the consideration of executive business.\n  One of those traditions is a 1980 precedent urged by Majority Leader \nByrd which obviates debate on a motion to proceed to a nomination. \nUsing the logic of our opponents, one could theorize that a next \nconsistent step would be to mimic this precedent and kill debate on a \nmotion to proceed to legislation. But 23 years have passed and that \nnext step has not been taken. In its wisdom, the Senate has known how \nfar it must go to resolve particular problems and when it must stop.\n  Our opponents argue that filibuster reform will undermine the balance \nof power between the President and the Senate. They claim if we adopt \nthis proposal, the Senate will diminish itself and become the \nPresident's handmaiden. I do not desire that result, and I strongly \ndisagree with that conclusion.\n  What their position amounts to is that Senate power to check a \nPresident can only be vindicated if a minority prevails against a \nmajority ready to confirm.\n  Once again, for 70 of the last 100 years in this century, one party \ncontrolled both the Senate and the White House. Yet filibustering \nnominations was unheard of most all of that time. Was the Senate the \nPresident's handmaiden then and only now has awakened to its \nconstitutional purpose?\n  Over two centuries, a number of judicial nominations failed on the \nSenate floor. Filibusters were unnecessary to defeat Clement \nHaynsworth, Harold Carswell, or Robert Bork, much less many earlier \nnominees, starting with President Washington's nominee, John Rutledge.\n  The full Senate, no President's handmaiden, asserted constitutional \nchecks and balances. If we can only affirm Senate power by the \nfilibuster, then we have come to a new and very unfortunate place. \nThus, we propose to reform Senate rules in order to restore Senate \ntraditions.\n  Filibuster reform is imperative. It will enable all Senators to meet \ntheir constitutional responsibility to advise and consent. With \nSenators so empowered, the voice of all Americans will again be heard \non these matters.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8845-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF VICTOR J.

Res. 62\n\n       Whereas the democracies of the Western Hemisphere have \n     approved an Inter-American Democratic Charter that sets a \n     regional standard regarding respect for human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms;\n       Whereas the government of the Republic of Cuba approved and \n     is bound to respect the Charter of the Organization of \n     American States (OAS) and the American Declaration of the \n     Rights and Duties of Man;\n       Whereas in 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, and previous years, the \n     government of the Republic of Cuba declined to reply to the \n     OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights when it sought \n     the government's views on human rights violations in the \n     Republic of Cuba;\n       Whereas all countries have an obligation to promote and \n     protect human rights and fundamental freedoms as stated in \n     the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on Human Rights \n     considered and passed a resolution in 2002 regarding the \n     situation of human rights in the Republic of Cuba and called \n     for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to \n     send a personal representative to the Republic of Cuba;\n       Whereas the United States and other countries remain \n     concerned about violations of human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms in the Republic of Cuba, including the freedoms of \n     expression, association, and assembly, and the rights \n     associated with the administration of justice;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, Cuban \n     authorities use exile as a means of repression and continue \n     to harass, threaten, arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison, \n     and defame human rights advocates and members of independent \n     professional associations, including journalists, economists, \n     doctors, and lawyers with the goal of coercing them into \n     leaving the country;\n       Whereas Cuban citizens are routinely jailed solely because \n     their views do not coincide with those of the government;\n       Whereas Amnesty International in its 2002 report noted an \n     increase in human rights violations in the Republic of Cuba, \n     including short-term arbitrary arrests, threats, summonses, \n     evictions, interrogations, losses of employment, restrictions \n     on travel, house arrests, and other forms of harassment \n     directed by the government against political dissidents, \n     independent journalists, and other activists in an effort to \n     limit their ability to exercise fundamental freedoms;\n       Whereas Amnesty International also noted with concern the \n     beginning of a trend toward the increased use of violence by \n     Cuban authorities in order to repress dissent;\n       Whereas Cuban political prisoners are deliberately exposed \n     to harm and poor conditions as a means of punishment, \n     including beatings, denial of medical treatment, forced labor \n     against medical advice, unsanitary eating conditions, and \n     coexistence with inmates carrying highly infectious diseases;\n       Whereas peaceful dissidents in the Republic of Cuba, such \n     as Oscar Elias Biscet, who upon finishing more than 3 years \n     in jail for ``instigation to commit a crime'' is again in \n     police custody and facing a possible year-long sentence, are \n     subjected to ongoing harassment and imprisonment;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as journalist Bernardo Arevalo \n     Padron, who is currently in jail serving a 6 year sentence, \n     are routinely jailed under the charge of ``disrespect'' for \n     making negative statements about the government of the \n     Republic of Cuba;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Carlos Oquendo Rodriguez, who \n     is serving 2 years in prison, are routinely jailed under the \n     charge of ``public disorder'' for criticizing the Castro \n     regime;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez, \n     the longest serving current Amnesty International prisoner of \n     conscience in the Republic of Cuba, are imprisoned on charges \n     of ``revealing state security secrets'' and ``falsifying \n     public documents'' for promoting democratic practices and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Juan Carlos Gonzalez Leiva, a \n     blind lawyer and president of the Cuban Foundation for Human \n     Rights, are imprisoned on charges of ``disobedience'' and \n     tortured while incarcerated for peacefully protesting the \n     Republic of Cuba's brutal treatment of dissidents;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Leonardo Miguel Bruzon Avila, \n     president of the 24th of February Movement (named for both a \n     turning point in the Spanish-American War and the day in 1996 \n     when 2 civilian aircraft carrying 4 members of the Cuban \n     American Brothers to the Rescue movement were shot down over \n     international waters by Cuban fighter jets), are charged with \n     ``public disorder'' and held without trial for planning \n     peaceful public ceremonies;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Nestor Rodriguez Lobaina, who \n     is president of the Cuban Youth for Democracy Movement and \n     currently serving a 6 year prison sentence, are charged with \n     ``damages'' for denouncing violations of human rights by the \n     Cuban government and communicating the brutality of the Cuban \n     regime to Cuban citizens and the world;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, who \n     is a founder of the Pedro Luis Boitel Political Prisoners \n     Movement and serving a 15 year prison sentence, are charged \n     with ``enemy propaganda'' and suffer systematic abuse and a \n     lack of medical assistance while in prison, for criticizing \n     communism;\n       Whereas Amnesty International reports that participants in \n     Oswaldo Paya's Varela Project collecting the required 10,000 \n     signatures on a petition for peaceful change to the legal \n     system of the Republic of Cuba have been harassed, detained, \n     subjected to confiscation of signed petitions, and ``kicked, \n     punched, and threatened'' by Cuban state security officials; \n     and\n       Whereas the European Parliament rightfully recognized \n     Oswaldo Paya for his work on the Varela Project with the 2002 \n     Sakharov Prize for his human rights work in the Republic of \n     Cuba: Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate calls upon--\n         (1) the Organization of American States Inter-American \n     Commission on Human Rights to continue its reporting on the \n     human rights situation in the Republic of Cuba and to request \n     a visit to the Republic of Cuba for the purposes of reviewing \n     and reporting to the international community on the human \n     rights situation there;\n         (2) the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     and his newly appointed personal representative to vigorously \n     pursue the implementation of the 2002 Resolution regarding \n     the situation of human rights in the Republic of Cuba;\n         (3) the European Union, to build upon the European \n     Parliament's recognition of Cuban dissidents and, through the \n     appropriate bodies and mechanisms, request to visit the \n     Republic of Cuba for the purpose of reviewing the human \n     rights situation there and issue a report to the \n     international community on its findings; and\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\n         (4) human rights organizations throughout

to secure \n     their internationally recognized human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url":

Res. 90) was agreed to.\n  The amendment to the preamble was agreed to.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, as amended, reads as follows:\n  (The resolution will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, on March 6, 2003, the Senate gave its \nadvice and consent to ratification of the Moscow Treaty on strategic \nnuclear arms reductions. The 97 to 0 vote belied significant weaknesses \nin the treaty: it contains no verification procedures, it does not \nrequire the destruction of any warheads or missiles, and it expires on \nthe same day that it goes into effect.\n  Those weaknesses should not be ignored. I joined with my colleagues \nin voting to approve a formal treaty on U.S. and Russian arms \nreductions in order to send a message that more work is needed to \nreduce, control, and secure the most dangerous weapons that mankind has \ncreated. The Moscow Treaty is a modest step away from the Cold War \nthreat of nuclear holocaust, but more steps need to be taken.\n  The resolution that I offer represents the Senate's next step in \npushing for more action in the control of nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons. I am grateful to the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Lugar, for his support of the resolution \nas its principal cosponsor. The Byrd-Lugar resolution urges the \nadministration and the Russian Federation to do more to implement \nnonproliferation programs.\n  The United States has a good record in working with the countries of \nthe former Soviet Union on nonproliferation programs. The Cooperative \nThreat Reduction program, conceived by former Senator Sam Nunn and of \nSenator Richard Lugar, has an astounding record of success. That \nprogram has destroyed more than 6,000 Soviet-era nuclear weapons and \nmore than 800 ballistic missiles. The program helped to remove all \nnuclear warheads from Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakstan. It has made \nsignificant progress in securing nuclear materials, chemical weapons, \nand biological weapons.\n  The Byrd-Lugar resolution states the sense of the Senate on three \nimportant issues relating to U.S. non-proliferation programs.\n  First, the resolution states clearly the strong support of the Senate \nfor non-proliferation programs that ``are intended to reduce the threat \nposed by\n\n[[Page S8849]]\n\nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that remain unsecured in the \nRussian Federation and elsewhere.''\n  Second, the resolution urges the Russian Federation to increase \naccess to key weapons facilities and to share more information about \nits weapons programs. According to General Accounting Office testimony \ndelivered to the House Armed Services Committee on March 5:\n\n       Russia will not allow DOD [Department of Defense] and DOE \n     [Department of Energy] the level of access they require to \n     design security improvements [at weapons storage sites], \n     verify their installation, and ensure their proper operation. \n     As a result, agencies have been unable to help protect \n     substantial portions of Russia's nuclear weapons. . . In \n     addition, many Russian biological sites that store dangerous \n     biological pathogens remain off-limits. (GAO testimony, 3/5/\n     03, GAO-03-526T)\n\n  Third, the resolution urges our country to redouble efforts to \nachieve full implementation of nonproliferation programs, under \neffective management, and with full use of the funds that Congress may \nappropriate for nonproliferation activities.\n  Critics have been active in pointing out that poor management of some \nnonproliferation projects has resulted in wasted money and lost time. \nMost recently, some have leveled criticism at two projects that were \nintended to eliminate Russian rocket fuel. The United States spent $200 \nmillion to build two facilities to eliminate fuel that was left over \nfrom destroyed Russian missiles, only to find that the fuel was \ndiverted into the Russian civil space program. As a result, these \nfacilities are left with no rocket fuel to destroy.\n  It is a very serious issue when such a great amount of money is \ndevoted to an unsuccessful program. There is no excuse for poor \nplanning and management. We should not lose sight of the importance of \nnonproliferation programs, and to ensure their success we must not \nignore such examples of mismanagement. That is why the Byrd-Lugar \nresolution makes a point about the need for effective management in our \nnonproliferation programs.\n  But just as management improvements are needed, the Executive Branch \nhas been slow to implement nonproliferation programs. There has been \ndelay after delay in spending funds that Congress appropriates for \nthese projects.\n  According to the administration's fiscal year 2004 budget, $543 \nmillion in DOD nonproliferation funds will remain unexpended this year. \nTo put that figure in perspective, the White House has requested $439 \nmillion for these programs in its fiscal year 2004 budget. I support \nthat request, but that money--like the half a billion dollars that \nremains in our coffers--will do nothing to improve our security unless \nit is spent by the administration. Whatever funds that Congress \nappropriates to nonproliferation programs should be used in a timely \nmanner that recognizes the serious nature of the threat posed by loose \nnuclear weapons in Russia.\n  The Byrd-Lugar resolution underscores the important nonproliferation \ntasks ahead of us by spotlighting problems that need to be addressed by \nthe United States and Russia. Just as this resolution follows up on the \nMoscow Treaty, there is much more work to do after this resolution. \nThese are matters on which the Armed Services Committee, of which I am \na member, and the Foreign Relations Committee, of which Senator Lugar \nis chairman, should continue to work together.\n  One issue that is particularly deserving of increased attention is \nexpansion of non-proliferation programs to countries outside of the \nformer Soviet Union. The supplemental appropriations bill passed by the \nSenate on April 3, 2003, included temporary authority for the President \nto spend up to $50 million in nonproliferation funds outside of the \nformer Soviet Union during this fiscal year. Unfortunately, this \nprovision was not included in the final version of that bill that was \nsigned into law by the President on April 16, 2003.\n  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency warned the Armed \nServices Committee on February 11 of a new nuclear arms race among \nsmaller countries. Let us look beyond the borders of the former Soviet \nUnion to address the heart of the growing menace of nuclear \nproliferation, and start thinking about how to leverage the success in \nRussia of the Nunn-Lugar programs into results in other countries.\n  The Nunn-Lugar programs have greatly reduced the chance that a poorly \nsecured Russian military facility may serve as a one-stop shop for \nterrorists seeking a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon. I count \nmyself as a consistent and strong supporter of these programs.\n  But there is much more work to do. The Moscow Treaty, which requires \nthat thousands of nuclear warheads be removed from deployment, but not \nnecessarily destroyed, renews the need for a cooperative program to \nkeep these weapons out of the hands of terrorists. The Byrd-Lugar \nresolution sends a message to the White House and to the Kremlin that \nwe need to fix the problems that have surfaced in the nonproliferation \nprograms between our countries and accelerate our work to secure and \ndestroy unneeded and unwanted weapons of mass destruction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8849-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MEASURE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED--S.

Madam President, Independence Day marks a time for \nAmericans to celebrate our country's creation through an epic struggle \nfor freedom and liberty. Families come together to commemorate the \nqualities displayed by the early patriots: a commitment to democratic \nexpression, a yearning to be free from tyranny, and a sober willingness \nto sacrifice life itself on behalf of these aims.\n  This Fourth of July, thousands of men and women in our military will \nbe in Iraq, dedicating themselves to the reconstruction of this country \nthat has lived so long in the shackles of Saddam Hussein's reign of \nterror. Our objective is much the same as in 1776: creating conditions \nin which the people are protected from oppression and in which free \nexpression and democratic government can flourish. We know this is not \nan easy task--indeed, our forces continue to suffer casualties but its \nsuccess or failure will be very important, not only to Iraq, but also \nto the future of this country and the entire Middle East.\n  I am so proud of the service members who have stepped forward, making \ntremendous sacrifices, to fight for the liberty of a foreign people in \na foreign land. These men and women have been\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\nunflinching in their resolve and have already accomplished much.\n  I am particularly proud of the roughly 2,000 South Dakotans who have \nbeen involved in the Iraq campaign. Many of them are South Dakota \nNational Guard members, who participated in a mobilization with few \nprecedents in our State's history. It was, by far, the largest \nmobilization since World War II. At the time the fighting began, units \nfrom more than 20 communities had been called up, from Elk Point in the \nsouth to Lemmon in the north, from Watertown in the east to Custer in \nthe west. Indeed, our State's mobilization rate ranked among the \nhighest of all the States on a per-capita basis. Also, hundreds of \npersonnel from Ellsworth Air Force Base were deployed overseas at the \nheight of the campaign.\n  But no community in South Dakota, or perhaps the even country, is \nmore remarkable in its contribution to this effort than the small town \nof Frederick.\n  Frederick lies roughly 30 miles from my hometown of Aberdeen. It is a \nsmall, close-knit community with a population of fewer than 300 people. \nBut twenty-six of Frederick's sons and daughters answered the call to \nduty--nearly ten percent of its population! Frederick's military \npersonnel are serving in nearly every branch of the armed forces, \nincluding the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Army National Guard, Air \nNational Guard, and Army Reserve. To put this tremendous display of \npatriotism in perspective, the boroughs of New York City would need to \nsend roughly 750,000 people to match Frederick's effort.\n  On July Fourth, Frederick is commemorating the patriotism of its \nservice members with a community parade and celebration that will \nfeature a flyover by a B-1 bomber out of Ellsworth Air Force Base. They \nwill honor their friends, neighbors and loved ones serving in the U.S. \nmilitary, and I want to join them by recognizing them here today. They \nare:\n  Air Force: A1C Justin Wallace, SSgt. Jason Strand, Senior MSgt LeRoy \nFiekens, SSgt. Tara Meyers,\n  A1C Paul Sumption, and TSgt. Reiff Mikkonen.\n  Air Force National Guard: SSgt. Brian Achen.\n  Army: LTC Ronald Claeys, PFC Gary Kurtzhals, and PFC Mikael Schmit.\n  Army National Guard: SPC Stephen Achen, Sgt. Ryan Henningsen, Sgt. \nRobert Heider, PFC Jeff Pierce, Cpl. Mike Bunke, Col. Gordon Niva, \nSSgt. Eric Kinslow, Sgt. Dave Gunther, SPC Ben Deuter and Sgt. Ryan \nBakeburg.\n  Army Reserve: Maj. Susan Lahr and PFC Glenn Gunther.\n  Navy: PFC Josh Larsen and Petty Officer Randy Jensen.\n  Marine Corps: Sgt. Eric Thompson and MSgt. Scott McCullough.\n  Let me also take a moment to recognize another young patriot from \nFrederick, 10-year-old Peyton Healy. Though she does not know any of \nthe 26 deployed soldiers personally, Peyton took the initiative to \ndevelop a way for the people of Frederick to support troops serving \nabroad, creating the ``Project Patriotic Penny Fund.'' Working with the \nlocal American Legion post, she placed donation cans in area businesses \nto raise money for postage on care packages to the troops. She hoped to \nraise roughly $100--enough to pay for one package to every Frederick \nservice member. The people of Frederick placed $195 in these cans--\n19,500 pennies. They also donated supplies for the packages, such as \ncrossword puzzles, pens and paper, batteries, hygiene products, and \ncandy.\n  Most importantly, Peyton helped us see the defining characteristic of \nthe people of Frederick. She helped us see that the people of this tiny \ntown have enormous hearts. I call upon my colleagues and the people of \nthis Nation to join with me in commending the people of Frederick, and \nin celebrating alongside them on Independence Day the democracy and \nliberty they so proudly defend and promote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8850-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on June 11, 1995 my colleagues joined \nSenator Feinstein and myself in passing the Burma Freedom and Democracy \nAct. This legislation prohibits the importation of all products from \nBurma, freezes the assets of Burma's ruling thugs and their political \narm, bans travel to the United States for the junta's political and \nmilitary leadership, and provides assistance for democracy activists \ninside the country. At this time, our House colleagues are working to \npass their version of this legislation and I urge them to do so \nquickly.\n  Today we have news reports from Tokyo that the Japanese Foreign \nMinistry will be suspending new development assistance pending the \nrelease of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. This is a positive first step, but \nthis is not enough.\n  I urge our Japanese allies to reflect upon the junta's continual \nefforts to smother democracy in Burma and review their overall \nengagement policy towards the junta. The junta put the final nail into \nthe coffin of constructive engagement when it signaled its hostility to \npolitical dialogue and national reconciliation on May 30 by arresting \nSuu Kyi and murdering Burmese democrats. It is painfully clear now that \nthe junta's support for engagement was nothing more than a farce used \nto bankroll its corrupt and vicious rule.\n  Constructive engagement for Japan and Association of Southeast Asian \nNations, ASEAN, has done nothing to improve the political, economic, or \nsocial situation in Burma. The ASEAN policy of noninterference will not \nstand. Burma's military government is a festering sore infecting the \nregion with narcotics, HIV/AIDS, and instability. In fact, without \nquestion, Burma is worse off now than at any point in its history. The \npath now is clear: isolate the vile thugs who rule this country. We \nmust encourage Burma's neighbors to use their considerable influence to \nmake clear to the military regime that they, too, find the political \nsituation intolerable; it must change.\n  When the Prime Minister of Thailand visits the United States and his \nmeetings with American officials are dominated by the issue of Burmese \natrocities, it displaces Thai national security and economic issues \nfrom the discussion. When the Association of South East Asian Nations \nconvened in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, this month and the discussions \ncentered not on fighting HIV/AIDS or improving regional economic \ndevelopment but on the arrest of Suu Kyi and the murder of National \nLeague for Democracy political activists, it distracts ASEAN from other \nimportant issues.\n  The regime in Burma is pulling down the region, and it is time that \nits neighbors owned up to their responsibility in fixing this problem \nonce and for all. This is not a problem that can be pushed under the \nrug; ASEAN and Burma's neighbors must confront this problem. Until the \nregion confronts the junta and demonstrates backbone in the face of \ncorrupt despotism, they will find the United States a less willing \nnegotiating partner.\n  Clearly, the transfer of power 1990 elected government will provide \npeace, stability, and the opportunity for enhanced regional economic \ngrowth. It is this goal, not merely the release and continued \nharassment of Suu Kyi, that should drive the foreign policies of \nBurma's regional neighbors.\n  I welcome the statements coming from Japan demanding Aung San Suu \nKyi's release from the notorious Insein Prison--a jail Burmese \npolitical prisoners call ``The Hell of Asia.'' However, her release \nfrom prison alone will solve none of Burma's problems. There is much \nmore that needs to be done here in Congress, and at the White House, by \nJapan, ASEAN, the European Union, and by Secretary General Kofi Annan \nand the United Nations Security Council to ensure that the thugs now \nruling Burma are one day soon consigned to the ash heap of history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8850-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8850-S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to speak on S. 1, the \nPrescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003.\n  For far too long Medicare has lacked a prescription drug benefit. The \nlack of this benefit has been the gaping hole in the Medicare safety \nnet. Prescription drugs are the largest out-of-pocket health care cost \nfor seniors. Many who cannot afford drug coverage often break the drugs \nin half, skip doses, or do not fill their prescriptions.\n  The legislation the Senate passed last night will finally establish a \nbenefit. I supported this bill because it is\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\nan important step forward in meeting the prescription drug needs of \nseniors. However, I am particularly concerned that the bill provides \ninsufficient prescription drug coverage for seniors and depends \nexcessively on private plans.\n  Medicare beneficiaries will experience a gap in their prescription \ndrug coverage after their drug expenditures reach $4,500. They will not \nreceive any benefits until their total drug expenditures reach at least \n$5,813 unless they qualify for the additional low-income support. This \ngap in coverage will occur while they are still paying premiums. It is \nunfortunate that amendments designed to fill in the gap were defeated. \nThis issue must be revisited in the future. Also, the eligibility \nrequirements for the additional low-income support are too restrictive \nand will deny many seniors in need the extra help that they need.\n  The dependence on private insurers to administer this benefit \npresents additional challenges to providing seniors with access to \nprescription drugs. Prescription drug-only insurance policies are \ncurrently not offered and they will need to be developed. The \nutilization of private plans creates a system in which insurers have \nincentives to limit access to needed drugs. In addition, the premiums \nthat seniors pay for coverage are likely to vary depending on what \nregion people live in. It is not equitable for a Federal benefit to \nhave different prices across the country. Seniors should have the \noption of choosing a Medicare-administered plan instead of one that is \nrun by a private insurer.\n  It is unfortunate that amendments to strengthen the prescription drug \ncoverage and to provide seniors with an option to enroll in a Medicare \nadministered plan were defeated. I look forward to continue working \nwith my colleagues to address these important issues to improve the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Again, I supported this bill because it is an important step towards \nproviding much needed prescription drug coverage for seniors. Also, I \nam pleased that my amendment to restore a Medicaid disproportionate \nshare hospital, DSH, allotment for Hawaii was adopted. This amendment \nis vital to Hawaii's hospitals which are struggling to meet the \nelevated demands placed upon them by the increasing number of uninsured \npatients. DSH payments will help Hawaii hospitals meet the rising \nhealth care needs of our communities. I hope that this provision is \nretained in conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8851-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8851-S8856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            S. 1, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, as the Medicare prescription drug \ndebate draws to a close, I would like to take a few moments to give my \ncolleagues my honest assessment of this legislation.\n  I join many of my colleagues in recognizing how difficult it has been \nfor the managers of this bill to hold to a proposal that fits within a \n$400 billion budget constraint. In that respect, they are to be \ncommended for their discipline. But for my part, I believe that \nconstraint, combined with the fervent intent by some to move Medicare \nto a private insurance model, has produced a bill that is fatally \nflawed. Seniors will not get the affordable, meaningful prescription \ndrug coverage they expect because the majority of Members seem to have \nconcluded that we cannot break the $400 billion barrier. I think it is \na false choice.\n  The actual prescription drug benefit in this bill is inadequate to \nmeet the needs of more than 40 million Medicare beneficiaries and \neventually America's seniors are going to figure that out. The fact of \nthe matter is that $400 billion is simply not enough to buy an adequate \nbenefit. But we already knew that--our debates last year made that \nabundantly clear.\n  I believe that insisting on the capped amount of $400 billion for a \nMedicare drug benefit as a precondition of moving a new benefit through \nthe legislative process serves as a convenient excuse. It means this \ndrug benefit is sure to fail to meet seniors' real drug coverage needs. \nIt also means that we will only cover 20-25 percent of seniors' drug \ncosts.\n  What is worse, the complicated structure of this bill will cause \nseniors to be angry and confused by the benefit--and they will be \nentitled to be. This is not the straightforward guaranteed Medicare \nprescription drug benefit seniors have been repeatedly promised. There \nis no standard premium and there is no uniform benefit. For the first \ntime under Medicare there is no universal coverage for all Medicare \nbeneficiaries. This bill falls fall short of what seniors expect and \nneed.\n  Let's take a few minutes to look at how the shortcomings of this bill \nwill become apparent to a Medicare beneficiary--a senior or disabled \nperson who enrolls in this benefit. For illustrative purposes, let's \ntake an 80-year-old West Virginia widow living at 250 percent of the \npoverty level.\n  Assume this widow spent her entire career working for the same \nemployer. Since her retirement, her employer has provided her with a \nfairly generous drug benefit--$150 deductible, $10 copays, and \ncatastrophic coverage. However, once the Senate's proposed drug benefit \nis enacted, she becomes one of the 37 percent of Medicare beneficiaries \nwho currently receive good employer-sponsored coverage who lose that \ncoverage. That is because the way this bill works her former employers' \ncontribution to her drug costs are meaningless because they do not \ncount toward her catastrophic limit.\n  I want to note here that, during the health care reform debates of \nmore than a decade ago, one of the few things that we seemed to agree \non was that we should not disrupt the health care coverage that \nAmericans already rely on. My friends on the other side of the aisle, \nin particular, were quite adamant about that point. Well, this bill \nwould not just disrupt the drug coverage for millions of seniors, it \nwould completely strip the drug coverage from 4.5 million seniors who \nhave employer-sponsored coverage today.\n  It will strip their employer-sponsored coverage and leave them with \nan inferior drug benefit which is either less generous or more \nexpensive. I offered an amendment to correct this problem, but it \nfailed just 2 days ago.\n  To return to my example, as a result of having lost her employer-\nsponsored coverage, this 80-year-old senior decides she has to enroll \nin the new drug benefit next year--in 2004--only to find out that it \nwill not be implemented until 2006. There is a discount drug card, but \nit is not substantially better than the discounts she gets today--and \nit is far worse than the drug benefit she used to receive from her \nformer employer.\n  This widow spends the next 2 years trying to figure out whether it is \nto her benefit to enroll in this new Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. But she can't really make an informed decision because she has \nno idea what the premium will be or what the benefit will actually look \nlike. She decides to enroll in the voluntary benefit having been told \nthat if she waits to enroll she will have to pay a very harsh late \nenrollment penalty.\n  This particular 80-year-old senior lives in West Virginia, so let's \nassume that no private insurers enter the area to provide a drug \nbenefit. That has been my State's experience with the Medicare+Choice \nProgram and I have no reason to believe that this proposal will produce \na different outcome.\n  My illustrative senior citizen enrolls in the fallback. Her sister, \nhowever, lives in northwestern Ohio and has enrolled in a Medicare \nAdvantage Plan. For the first time under Medicare, the West Virginia \nwidow and her sister in Ohio have a different Medicare benefit and are \npaying a different premium for that benefit. In addition, her sister is \nbeing offered additional benefits like a catastrophic limit on her \nmedical expenditures and disease management. These additional benefits \nare not even being offered to the West Virginia senior because she \nremains in traditional Medicare.\n  Now, fast forward 1 year and assume that private insurers decide to \nenter West Virginia. The fallback plan she received through traditional \nMedicare disappears and she is required to enroll in a private \ninsurance plan. She cannot see the doctor she was seeing because he is \nnot in the private insurer's network. She cannot go to the pharmacy she \nusually visits--the one that is right down the street--because it is \nalso outside the network. She can't have the drug she was taking \nbecause it is not on the insurers' formulary.\n  Again, fast forward, this time it is 2 years later. Let's assume that \nthe private insurers did not make enough\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\nprofit to continue to provide a drug benefit in West Virginia--then \nwhat happens? The now 83-year-old widow will have to start the process \nall over again.\n  What is worse is that each senior will face a different calculation \nin determining how this bill will or won't help them. Senior citizens \nwith incomes of 135 percent of the poverty level should theoretically \npay no deductible, 5 percent cost sharing up to $4,500 in total \nspending, 10 percent cost sharing between $4,500-$5,800 and 2.5 percent \ncost sharing above $5,800.\n  But this bill has an asset test that will prevent millions of seniors \nfrom getting the low-income subsidies in this bill. If a senior owns a \nburial plot worth $1,000, a $3,000 Treasury bill, and a vehicle worth \n$6,000--indeed, if a senior owns anything that adds up to over $10,000 \nin assets, not including his or her home, the cost sharing they have to \npay will double.\n  Our Nation's neediest seniors, those with incomes 74 percent of \nFederal poverty, will not be permitted to enroll in the new Medicare \nprescription drug benefit at all. Even though these low-income seniors \nare Medicare beneficiaries, they will not be eligible for this \nparticular Medicare benefit because they are now eligible for Medicaid. \nThey will be discriminated against for the very first time under this \nnew Medicare benefit.\n\n  Seniors who are forced to remain in Medicaid may well end up seeing \ntheir drug coverage dramatically cut back. With our Nation's economy \nstill fairly stagnant, State budget situations remain dire. In some \nStates, dual-eligible Medicare beneficiaries may only have coverage for \nthree prescriptions per year, regardless of their medical needs.\n  Put simply, the Medicare drug benefit the Senate is about to vote on \nhas fatal flaws. The following is a list of 10 fatal flaws that, \ncombined, persuade me this bill should not get my vote.\n  1. The drug benefit has no national premium. CBO estimates that $35 \nwill be the national average premium. That number appears nowhere in \nthe legislative language. It is a projection, a best guess--and it \ncertainly could be higher.\n  2. Under this prescription drug plan, the premium will vary in every \nregion of the country, perhaps State by State, and there is no limit on \nhow high it can be. We defeated an amendment that would have limited \nthe variation to no more than 10 percent above the national average, \nbut it failed.\n  3. Private insurers will actually decide what the premium will be. \nAnd, this premium will grow each year by the rate of increase in drug \ncosts--that is roughly 10-12 percent increases every year. That means \nseniors in 2008 could well be paying $50 a month for their drug premium \nalone--and that is on top of the cost of their deductible and \ncopayments.\n  4. There is no requirement for private plans to offer a standard \nbenefit-- private plans are only required to offer an actuarially \nequivalent benefit. That means West Virginians and other rural \nbeneficiaries may not have access to the same drug benefit that other \nseniors will have--again, for the very first time under Medicare \nseniors in some States won't get the same benefits as seniors in other \nStates. I am not very confident that West Virginia seniors will end up \nwith the better benefit--we never do.\n  5. The bill currently has a completely unstable fallback. Under this \nproposal, the only time a beneficiary will have the option of receiving \ncoverage through Medicare is if there are not at least two bids from \nprivate insurers to serve a region. There is no guaranteed Medicare \nprescription drug benefit of the kind I believe seniors fully expect. \nMoreover, if private insurers do not enter an area, the fallback moves \ninto place for 1 year. The next year, a new bidding process begins, and \nif two plans show up, the Medicare fallback disappears. Private \ninsurers can then change or terminate coverage every 2 years. This \nmeans that seniors, especially seniors in rural areas where preferred \nprovider organizations or PPOs and private plans are not likely to come \nto the table, may end up bouncing between a fallback, then a private \nplan, and then back to a fallback. Back and forth, back and forth. All \nthe while, this senior will be forced to change doctors and \npharmacists, their cost sharing will be changing, as may their \npremiums. The Senate prescription drug plan we are considering leaves \nthe big HMOs and insurance companies in charge.\n  6. There is a significant gap in coverage. That gap is $1,300--\nseniors pay their monthly premiums but get no drug benefit in that gap. \nTwo amendments to address this problem did not achieve sufficient votes \nfor passage. One was an amendment to eliminate this gap. Another one \nwould have said that seniors would not have to pay premiums when they \nwere not receiving any benefit. The failure of these two strengthening \namendments means that under this legislation, if a Medicare beneficiary \nhas $5,900 in drug spending per year, by October 7 of that year, their \nbenefit will run out. That beneficiary will continue to need the drugs \neach day for the rest of the year but her benefit will run out on \nOctober 7. Fifteen million Medicare beneficiaries will fall into the \ngap.\n  7. Low-income seniors who are eligible to receive a drug benefit \nunder Medicaid will not be eligible for the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, as I illustrated in my earlier example. This means that 43,000 \nWest Virginians will not be eligible for this Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. Millions more across America won't be eligible for this \nMedicare benefit even though they paid their whole lives into the \nMedicare program rightfully expecting that it would cover their health \ncare costs.\n  8. Again, under this legislation, CBO estimates that 37 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries who currently receive a drug benefit from their \nemployer will lose that coverage because of the way this legislation \ndefines out-of-pocket costs.\n  9. This proposal requires private insurers to provide beneficiaries \nwith a catastrophic limit on expenditures for medical benefits, disease \nmanagement, chronic care services and preventive benefit. But, such \nbenefits are not made available to beneficiaries remaining in \ntraditional Medicare. Everyone keeps arguing that these private plans \nwill provide better, more comprehensive, preventive care. But, the fact \nis that this bill precludes the traditional Medicare from providing \nbetter, more coordinated care. There is no reason that traditional \nMedicare cannot provide the same level of care as a private plan--at a \nsignificantly lower administrative cost, I might add--but not if we \npreclude it from doing so.\n  10. And if those reasons weren't enough, consider what is headed our \nway in conference: today, the House will include in its prescription \ndrug bill new tax shelters for health care, that disproportionately \nhelp the rich and undermine employer-based health insurance coverage . \n. . the very system that the vast majority of Americans depend on for \ntheir health care and a voucher system for Medicare beneficiaries \nbeginning in the year 2010.\n  Under this system, seniors would receive a defined contribution \npayment rather than a defined benefit. In other words, rather than \ndefined benefits beginning in 2010, seniors would receive a set premium \npayment--like a voucher--from the Government.\n  We need to think about what we are doing here. In my judgment, every \nMember of Congress should think about this benefit from the perspective \nof their beneficiaries. This proposal is a great opportunity for \nseniors to shop for new coverage every few years. If you have the \nutmost faith in private insurers to provide good health coverage to \nelderly Americans and the disabled, then this is the plan for you. This \nplan puts private insurers in the driver's seat by giving them \nflexibility to vary premiums and change or terminate coverage every 2 \nyears. But, as far as providing long-term security, this proposal \nfails.\n  Finally, several Members have come to the floor and claimed that this \nproposal is just a downpayment--that we will be able to revisit the \nbenefit over the years and make it more generous. That is simply \nuntrue. We have an administration that is intent on large tax cuts, \nthat is focused on the minimization of Government and that is committed \nto the privatization of the Medicare Program. Most every amendment \noffered during this debate to improve this benefit has lost. I don't \nknow why any senior would believe that we will be able to revisit this \nprogram and make it better. We should take the time to get it right.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I want to state my support for the\n\n[[Page S8853]]\n\nMedicare Prescription Drug Bill, S. 1, and my reasons for doing so.\n  I believe that by passing this legislation, we begin to answer the \nprayers of many seniors who are struggling to cover the rising costs of \nthe prescription drugs they need to live longer and healthier lives. I \ncommend the bipartisan Congressional effort to beat back the worst \npieces of the President's initial proposal--which would have forced \nseniors out of Medicare en masse and paved the road to privatizing the \nsystem--and forged this more sensible compromise.\n  But my support is not an enthusiastic endorsement. We cannot ignore \nthe substantial weaknesses in this proposal. For one, the bill does not \ntake effect until 2006--seniors have waited long enough. More \nspecifically, this bill has an enormous gap in coverage--the so-called \n``doughnut hole''--that leaves millions of seniors without the \nassistance they need. Premiums may vary from plan to plan. Some seniors \nmay be forced to go round and round in a revolving door, changing plans \nas private plans come and go. And seniors covered under employer-based \nretiree plans would not get the catastrophic benefit they need. \nUnfortunately, Republicans defeated Democratic amendments to remedy \nthese shortcomings.\n  Nevertheless, the bill represents a dramatic improvement in \nprescription drug coverage for our nation's seniors. It would provide \ncomprehensive prescription drug coverage for our lowest income elderly \nwith no or minimal premiums. It also guarantees that a drug benefit is \navailable to all Medicare beneficiaries by giving them a ``fallback'' \ntraditional government plan when there is a lack of private plans in \ntheir area. Even with the existing gap, 80 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries will get back more in benefits than they pay in premiums.\n  Both problems and advantages to the bill are summarized in more \ndetail below.\n  All in all, this is a foundation upon which to build in the months \nand years ahead. Senator Kennedy is right. Seniors deserve the basic \ncoverage this plan will provide--and an end to the political stalemate \nthat has blocked action for the last several years. Thanks to the \npersistent, principled, and passionate advocacy of him and other \nDemocrats--and the strength of Republicans who resisted President \nBush's divisive prescription--that's precisely what they're getting.\n  But I do think we can and should do more to improve this plan, and \nthere are several specific areas we should focus on as we go forward. \nFirst, we must fill the doughnut hole I described above. This gap in \ncoverage will hurt our seniors at their time of greatest need--\nfinancially and physically. The gap occurs because after a senior's \ndrug spending reaches a certain amount, the benefit ends. The benefit \ndoesn't start again until there is a significant out of pocket payment, \nat which time catastrophic coverage kicks in. Many of the beneficiaries \nwho fall into that gap are likely to be seriously ill and financially \nstrapped, and therefore faced with the same awful choice between \nmedicines and necessities that too many seniors face today.\n  That's not the only problem with this bill. Another is that the drug \nbenefits paid by employer-based retiree plans would not count toward \nthe catastrophic benefit promised to seniors. Therefore, seniors \ncovered under these plans would not gain from this new benefit. In \nfact, these seniors may get less Medicare coverage than other \nbeneficiaries. Also, CBO estimates that as many as 37 percent of \nemployers may drop their retiree drug coverage, which is the last thing \nwe want to happen as a result of this bill.\n  In addition, there is no set premium for seniors under this plan. \nMany seniors will enroll in private drug-only plans because that will \nbe their only option. The premiums for these plans may vary \nsignificantly and may be quite high in certain parts of the country. \nThis is clearly unfair and will hurt those seniors in locations where \npremiums are high.\n  Moreover, the drug coverage approach in the bill relies on uncertain \nand historically unstable private health insurance plans. In fact, \nthere will not be a guaranteed ``fallback'' option for coverage in a \ntraditional Medicare plan. This fallback will only occur when there are \nless than two private plans in any region. Seniors may be pushed from \nplan to plan as the private plans come and go.\n  But on balance, this bill has more strengths than weaknesses, \nstarting with the fact that it commits $400 billion to help reduce the \ncosts of prescription drugs for America's senior citizens. This is a \nhistoric breakthrough, and we should not minimize that.\n  One of the most encouraging parts of this bill is that it provides \ncomprehensive coverage for low income seniors up to 160 percent of \npoverty with no or minimal premiums and cost sharing--40 percent of all \nMedicare beneficiaries. There is no ``doughnut hole'' for this group. \nAlthough I wish that there were better coverage for the remaining 60 \npercent of beneficiaries, there is at least strong, reliable coverage \nfor the lowest income group.\n  Another positive aspect of the current bill is that all Medicare \nbeneficiaries are provided a ``fallback'' traditional government plan \nwhen there are not two private plans in their area. This means that all \nMedicare beneficiaries are guaranteed that a drug benefit is available. \nI co-sponsored Senator Stabenow's amendment to guarantee this fallback \nwithout regard to the presence or absence of private plans to increase \nthe stability of coverage and decrease the risk of needing to move from \nplan to plan. That amendment failed.\n  There were other important amendments that I did not have the \nopportunity to vote on. I would like to note my position on them for \nthe record.\n  Stabenow Amendment No. 931 to Bill S. 1: I was a co-sponsor of this \namendment that would have ensured the availability of the traditional \nMedicare plan in all areas. Bill S. 1 guarantees a ``fallback'' plan \nonly when there are not two private plans in any region. This amendment \nwould have guaranteed the availability of a Medicare-administered drug \nbenefit for all Medicare beneficiaries in all regions and this \n``fallback'' would not be dependent on the presence or absence of \nprivate insurers. This would have avoided the revolving door of drug \ninsurance we may face with the enactment of the underlying bill. As \ndiscussed, seniors could be forced to change insurers and drug \nformularies from year to year. This amendment would have provided \nstability, by allowing seniors access to the federal fallback plan at \nall times. It is important that seniors don't just have drug coverage, \nbut have coverage they can trust. For this reason, I was a co-sponsor \nof this amendment and would have voted for it.\n  Daschle Amendment No. 939 to Bill S. 1: This amendment would have \nensured that an affordable plan would have been available to all \nMedicare beneficiaries by limiting the variations in the amount \nbeneficiaries have to pay in premiums to only 10 percent above the \nnational average, no matter where they live. Currently, premiums for \nMedicare HMO plans with drug coverage vary from $99/month in \nConnecticut to $16/month in Florida. Similarly, the premiums in \nMedicare PPO plans vary from $166/month in New York to $39/month in \nAlabama. This amendment would have limited these types of inequities. \nFor this reason, I would have voted for this amendment.\n  Gregg Amendment No. 945 to Bill S. 1: This bipartisan amendment \nattempts to help ensure that Americans have access to generic drugs in \na timely fashion. This amendment speeds the market entry of generic \ndrugs by eliminating some patent extension practices used by brand name \nmanufacturers. I voted for similar generic drug legislation in the last \nCongress, which passed the Senate. I would have voted for this \namendment.\n  Dayton Amendment No. 957 to Bill S. 1: This amendment would require \nthat Members of Congress receive prescription reimbursements at the \nsame level as Medicare beneficiaries. I believe that that this it is \nappropriate and fair for us to be subject to the same problems to which \nour constituents will be subject. For these reasons, I would have voted \nfor this amendment.\n  Dodd Amendment No. 969 to Bill S. 1: This amendment would have \nallowed an ongoing open enrollment period for two years so that \nbeneficiaries could enroll and disenroll in Medicare Prescription Drug \nPlans and Medicare Advantage plans during 2006 and 2007. Medicare \nbeneficiaries would have been able to choose which plan they wanted\n\n[[Page S8854]]\n\nas they gathered more information about each plan during the first two \nyears of this benefit. For this reason, I was a co-sponsor of this \namendment and would have voted in favor.\n  Dodd Amendment No. 970 to Bill S. 1: This amendment would have \nprovided 50 percent cost sharing through the ``donut hole'' for seniors \nbetween 160 percent and 250 percent of poverty. Beneficiaries who have \nan income of only $15,000/year (or $20,000/year for a couple) are just \nover the 160 percent cut-off. This amendment would have helped these \nbeneficiaries who have reached the initial coverage gap and before \nthese beneficiaries have reached the annual out-of pocket limit. I am \ngreatly concerned that the bill voted out of the Finance Committee will \nhurt these beneficiaries. For these reasons, I would have voted for \nthis amendment.\n  Harkin Amendment No. 991 to Bill S. 1: I was a co-sponsor of this \namendment to have a demonstration project through the Medicaid program \nto encourage community-based services for individuals with \ndisabilities. I believe that it is important that we treat disabled and \nchallenged individuals in their communities to try and decrease the \ninstitutionalization of this population. We need demonstration projects \nto establish cost effectiveness and quality. For these reasons, I co-\nsponsored this amendment and would have voted for it.\n  Dodd Amendment No. 998 to Bill S. 1: This amendment would have \nincreased the amount of the direct subsidy to employers who provide \nretiree prescription coverage. It would have encouraged retiree benefit \nplans to continue to exist as an alternative to Medicare. I am deeply \nconcerned that the bill voted out of the Finance Committee will hurt \nseniors who currently have employer prescription drug coverage. Seniors \nwho have worked hard all of their lives and earned drug insurance from \ntheir former employers should not lose this coverage and this bill \ncould, according to CBO estimates, eliminate over a third of these \nbenefits. For these reasons, I would have voted for this amendment. \nThis provision needs to be corrected.\n  Clinton Amendment No. 1000 to Bill S. 1: I was proud to cosponsor \nSenator Clinton's amendment to ensure that seniors get the information \nthat they need to make informed choices about which medication they \nshould take for a given medical condition. Often, there is more than \none medication that is available for treatment. This measure would have \nsupported research to determine which of these drugs is most effective \nand would have ensured that this information would be made available to \npatients and their physicians. I believe that it is important to \nsupport these studies as a means of improving the quality of \nprescribing practices and make certain that patients get the best \npossible care. For these reasons, I co-sponsored this amendment and \nwould have voted for it.\n  Boxer Amendment No. 1001 to Bill S. 1: This amendment would have \nfilled the coverage gap or ``doughnut'' for beneficiaries who are ill \nand who have drug expenditures that exceed $4500. Bill S. 1 contains a \nprovision that after Medicare beneficiaries' drug expenditures reach \n$4500, there is no more coverage until the total drug expenditures \nreach at least $5813 (unless beneficiaries qualify for low-income \nprotections). No other private or public health insurance policy has \nthis kind of coverage gap. In addition, S. 1 requires that during this \ncoverage gap, Medicare beneficiaries would be required to pay their \nmonthly premium. This is unfair. This amendment would have ensured that \nMedicare beneficiaries continue to receive the same drug coverage even \nafter drug costs reach $4500 and before they reach $5800. They are \npaying their premiums and should continue to receive benefits. For \nthese reasons, I would have voted in favor of this amendment.\n  Sessions Amendment No. 1011 to Bill S. 1: I support the Senate's vote \nto defeat Senator Sessions' amendment. The Senate Finance committee \nincluded provisions in S. 1 to extend Medicaid and S-CHIP coverage to \nlegal immigrants. These benefits would aid tax-paying residents who \nhave come to this country for a better future. It is only right that \nhard working newcomers who play by the rules receive our help when \nneeded. Senator Sessions' amendment would have eliminated these \nprovisions. For these reasons, I would have voted to oppose the \nSessions amendment.\n  I attempted to cast as many votes as possible during the Senate \nMedicare debate. I did not miss any votes for which my vote would have \nchanged the outcome, including the vote for Senator Harkin's amendment. \nAlthough I missed this vote and the count was 50-48 in favor of a \nmotion to table the amendment, even if both I and another Senate \nabsentee had cast our votes, Vice President Cheney would have cast the \ndeciding vote. Most of the amendments passed or failed by wide margins, \nas did the final bill.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to reiterate that on balance I \nview this bill as real progress, despite its flaws. But I also want to \nmake clear that I will oppose any effort to tip that balance against \nsenior citizens in conference. I am troubled by provisions in the House \nbill that would undermine traditional Medicare and force seniors into \nprivate plans. And I will not support any effort to include these \nprovisions or ones like them into the conference report and make the \nbill weaker instead of stronger.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the Grassley-\nBaucus Medicare prescription drug legislation approved by the Senate \nlate last night.\n  I supported this legislation, though I did so reluctantly. On \nbalance, I believe the proposal represents a modest step forward toward \nthe goal of a guaranteed prescription drug benefit under Medicare. It \nis a first step.\n  From a New Jersey perspective, I am particularly pleased that the \nmanagers agreed to my request to include a provision that will protect \nthe ability of nearly 250,000 New Jersey seniors to continue to receive \nbenefits through our State's 27-year-old pharmaceutical benefit \nprogram, known as the PAAD program. This program, which enjoys \nbipartisan support, is uniformly believed to have served our State \nexceedingly well. Similar long standing programs exist in other States, \nas well.\n  Unfortunately, the bill adopted by the Senate also has many \nshortcomings. I am hopeful that many of those problems will be \naddressed before the final version of the legislation is sent to the \nPresident. The Senate bill is the minimum first step I can support, \nhowever. And I will oppose the final conference report if it drops my \nprovision protecting the ability of States to administer long standing \nprescription drug programs.\n  As I have traveled New Jersey I've heard from my constituents about \ntheir struggle to deal with rising drug prices. Many New Jerseyans fear \nthat the cost of prescription drugs will bankrupt them in their last \nyears. They worry about the burden those costs can impose on their \nfamilies. And around our country, too many seniors are forced to choose \nbetween paying rent and buying their prescription drugs. That's a \nchoice that no American should have to face.\n  I believe strongly that seniors who have worked hard all their lives, \npaid taxes and contributed to Medicare should have access to the \nmedicines they need to maintain independent, productive lives. Modern \nmedicine largely is based on pharmaceutical treatment. Providing a \nprescription drug benefit is the right thing to do for our seniors and \ntheir families. But it also serves broader public goals.\n  After all, we all pay the price if we fail to provide a guaranteed \nprescription drug benefit. That failure increases the number of \nhospital admissions and surgical procedures. It also increases costly \ninstitutionalization in nursing homes, and deprives seniors of the \nability to live independently in their communities.\n  My own State of New Jersey recognized the value of a prescription \ndrug benefit in 1975 when it created the PAAD program, which serves \nlow- and middle-income seniors. New Jersey's PAAD program is considered \nthe Nation's most generous State administered prescription drug program \nfor the elderly. Together, PAAD and Senior Gold, a more recent program \nwith broader eligibility added under a Republican governor, provide \ncomprehensive prescription drug coverage to nearly 250,000 low-income \nseniors and disabled people in New Jersey, without deductibles or \npremiums.\n\n  It is absolutely essential that seniors who currently receive higher \nquality\n\n[[Page S8855]]\n\nbenefits under state drug programs than they would under the Medicare \ndrug benefit continue to receive the state benefits. Their position \nshould not be diminished by Federal edict. For example, seniors in the \nNew Jersey PAAD program pay only $5 for their prescriptions. They do \nnot pay premiums or deductibles. By contrast, seniors who enroll in \nthis Medicare benefit would pay a substantial premium averaging $35 per \nmonth, along with a $275 deductible, and a 50 percent copay. It is \nunthinkable that we would force these seniors to disenroll in their \nmore generous state program to receive less coverage under Medicare--\nparticularly those seniors with low and moderate incomes.\n  I have been making this point to my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee for a long time, and I am very pleased that a provision to \nprotect my State's seniors has now been included in the bill. I want to \nthank Senators Grassley and Baucus for their tremendous assistance in \naddressing this issue. The bill before us not only allows New Jersey to \ncontinue to administer the PAAD program, but it contains language I \nsought to ensure that state payments on behalf of a beneficiary count \ntoward the beneficiary's out of pocket costs, helping that beneficiary \nreach catastrophic coverage sooner. This will save the state of New \nJersey an estimated $105 million annually.\n  I particularly want to thank Liz Fowler and Andrea Cohen of Senator \nBaucus' staff for all of their efforts on these issues. They have \ndevoted many hours to these issues and done great work, and I want them \nto know that I appreciate their assistance.\n  I would note that giving states the money we would otherwise give \nprivate plans to administer benefits would allow states to expand their \nprograms. Rough estimates indicate that the Medicare subsidy for those \nseniors currently enrolled in New Jersey's PAAD program is at least \n$300 million. With this new Federal money, the State of New Jersey \ncould expand this successful program to higher income seniors, \neliminating gaps and strengthening the program in many ways. This is a \nwin-win for everybody. And, I want to note that the provision is budget \nneutral: it won't cost the taxpayers one penny. I will work hard with \nmy colleagues in the New Jersey delegation to ensure that this \nprovision will be retained in conference.\n  In addition to preserving state pharmaceutical assistance programs, \nwe must also work to make this drug benefit better for all Americans. \nWhile I plan to support the underlying bill in order to push the \nlegislative process forward, let me be clear: this is not the Medicare \nprescription drug proposal I would have preferred and it is not the \nproposal I have advocated with my constituents for the last few years.\n  The bill before us would require seniors to pay hefty premiums--\npremiums that will vary by region, and are likely to be especially \nburdensome in my State of New Jersey. The bill also won't pay a penny \nin benefits until seniors pay $275, on top of those premiums. And, even \nafter paying that $275 deductible, the program still will pay only 50 \npercent of the cost of drugs.\n\n  I'm also concerned that the proposal contains what is called a \n``doughnut hole''--a gap in coverage that will leave seniors with high \ndrug costs paying premiums but not getting coverage for some time. \nWhile the Federal Government would pay 50 percent of a beneficiary's \ndrug costs up to $4,500, a beneficiary with drug costs that exceed that \nlevel would have to pay all of their drug costs between $4,500 and \n$5,800. Those Medicare beneficiaries who require drugs that exceed \n$4,500 are usually the sickest and most vulnerable seniors. And it is \nwrong to force them to bear these costs on their own, especially \nconsidering that they will be paying premiums at the same time. Some \nhave called this the sickness tax.\n  In addition, the bill fails to provide equal benefits for low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries who also qualify for Medicaid, the so-called \n``dual eligibles.'' These seniors will not be guaranteed the same \nbenefit, and the burden on states will be increased.\n  When you add up all the limitations and all the costs that will be \nimposed on seniors, you end up with a benefit that's a far cry from the \ncomprehensive coverage provided under the traditional Medicare program. \nIn fact, most seniors actually will pay into this program more than \nthey receive. That's not what most seniors were expecting. It's not \nwhat many of us have been promising. And, as more older Americans \nappreciate what this bill is really about, more are getting angry about \nit, and understandably so.\n  Compounding matters, even the limited benefit provided in this bill \nwill not go into effect until 2006. There is no good excuse for that. I \nwas pleased to cosponsor an amendment offered by my distinguished \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, to make the benefit \neffective in July of next year. That would have given the \nAdministration as long as it took to get the entire Medicare program \nunderway back in the 1960's. Unfortunately, the amendment was defeated.\n  Another concern of mine is that the bill before us could serve to \nweaken private insurance coverage, and actually might encourage \nemployers to eliminate prescription drug coverage to their retirees. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Grassley-Baucus \nbill could lead to a 37 percent reduction in employer-sponsored retiree \ndrug benefits. This is largely because under the Grassley-Baucus plan, \nretirees with employer sponsored prescription drug coverage would not \nqualify for catastrophic coverage if their employer plan paid for their \ndrug costs.\n  This is a major disincentive for employers to offer their retirees \nprescription drug benefits. Today, approximately 12 million seniors \nhave some form of prescription drug coverage through their former \nemployers. By and large, these employer-based drug benefits are more \ngenerous than those provided for in this bill. And it is imperative \nthat the final version of this legislation ensure that all prescription \ndrug costs paid by an employer help the beneficiary achieve \ncatastrophic coverage. Without this critical provision, seniors \nenrolled in retiree health plans may never trigger their Medicare \ncatastrophic drug coverage.\n  Today I have noted several problems with the substance of this bill, \nand many of them are quite serious. There are many others. At the same \ntime, it is important to remember that, for all its problems, the bill \nprovides $400 billion to create a critical new public program for our \nNation's seniors. It's a start. And for many seniors, especially those \nwith very low incomes, it will be of tremendous help.\n  Given that, I hope my colleagues will join me in approving the \nlegislation before us and sending it to conference. And then I hope the \nconferees will listen more closely to the concerns of America's seniors \nand improve it. If those concerns are heard, and the conferees respond, \nwe could soon witness an historic achievement that makes a huge \ndifference in the lives of millions of America's seniors.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I have long championed a prescription \ndrug benefit that would provide real prescription drug coverage for \nseniors and individuals with disabilities. Last year and again during \nthis debate, I voted for proposals that provided a comprehensive, \nreliable benefit without gaps in coverage that force seniors to pay \npremiums even while they get no benefits in return.\n  S. 1, the Grassley-Baucus bill that passed, however, contains serious \nshortcomings, including these large benefit gaps. So I must reluctantly \noppose this legislation unless it is improved.\n  I am particularly concerned that it poses a strong danger to \nsignificant numbers of New Yorkers. It leaves 37 percent of seniors who \nrely on their retiree drug coverage at risk of losing their employer \ncoverage because of incentives in the bill for employers to drop \ncoverage. It also leaves out 300,000 of New York's nursing home \nresidents who rely on Medicaid and another 230,000 low-income New \nYorkers who also rely on Medicaid because Medicare beneficiaries who \nare also eligible for Medicaid are excluded from receiving the \nprescription drug benefit that passed last night. These New Yorkers \ncould actually find themselves worse off than they are today if their \nemployers or Medicaid programs drop or reduce coverage.\n  The provisions excluding those beneficiaries who are dually eligible \nfor\n\n[[Page S8856]]\n\nMedicare and Medicaid also harms New York State's finances. New York \nState has effectively been subsidizing the Federal Government for years \nin the absence of a Federal provision for prescription drug benefits, \nby paying for the drug costs of these Medicare beneficiaries. But by \nfailing to include dually eligible Medicare beneficiaries in the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, this bill continues to leave New \nYork, which is in a precarious State budget situation, to subsidize the \nFederal Government's lack of adequate investment.\n  Finally, the bill includes a Grassley-Baucus amendment that starting \nin 2009 will allow for government subsidization of private plans at \nlevels much higher than the government funding for beneficiaries in \ntraditional Medicare, and would then allow the private plans to offer \nbenefits not available to the 90 percent of seniors in traditional \nMedicare, which I believe begins to subordinate the goal of health care \nfor seniors to the goal of privatizing Medicare.\n  While I am pleased that New York's State drug program, EPIC, will \nstill be available under a provision that Senators Corzine, Lautenberg, \nSchumer and I worked hard to include, the other measures I supported to \nmake sure seniors with other sources of coverage were not harmed by \nthis proposal were unfortunately left out of the bill.\n  For their sake, for the sake of New York's fiscal situation, as well \nas for the sake of other New York seniors who will be confronted with \nan unnecessarily complex maze of bureaucracy to navigate in order to \naccess benefits, I felt obliged to oppose the bill. There were some \nimportant provisions in the bill, including Senator Schumer's amendment \nthat provides greater market competition for generic drugs so that \nseniors will have a cheaper alternative and don't have to rely on \nhigher priced name-brand drugs.\n  These positive provisions were not enough, however, for me to vote \nfor the bill unless it is substantially improved. While I believe New \nYork deserves a better bipartisan alternative than the one that passed \nthe Senate yesterday, I hope that those in conference will fight \nagainst changes that make the bill even worse for New York, and I will \ncontinue fighting this year, as well as in years to come, to correct \nthese deficiencies and actually to deliver on the long-awaited promise \nof a simple, affordable, comprehensive prescription drug benefit for \nall seniors.\n  I request that this statement and a separate document, Governor \nPataki's letter dated June 12, 2003, be submitted for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                            State of New York,\n\n                                                    June 12, 2003.\n       Dear New York Congressional Delegation Members: \n     Prescription drug costs continue to strain the budgets of the \n     nation's senior citizens. I applaud your efforts this year to \n     address this important issue. As you begin consideration of \n     legislation to provide prescription drug coverage to all \n     senior citizens, please consider two issues vitally important \n     to New York State.\n       First, New York taxpayers continue to support a significant \n     cost for prescription drug coverage for its dual eligible \n     population. The dual eligibles are elderly and disabled \n     individuals who qualify for both the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs. Medicaid is required to provide medical services \n     not covered by Medicare--including prescription drugs.\n       More than 600,000 New Yorkers are considered dual eligibles \n     and each year New York's Medicaid program spends nearly $1.5 \n     billion on prescription drugs for the dual eligible \n     population alone. We have always believed that these costs \n     should be borne by the federal government and strongly \n     support efforts to federalize prescription drug costs for the \n     dual eligible population.\n       In addition, New York administers the nation's largest \n     prescription program for seniors, EPIC. Today, more than \n     300,000 seniors are enjoying the significant benefits EPIC \n     offers and savings thousands of dollars each on vitally \n     important medicines. Costs for this program exceed $600 \n     million annually in State only dollars. Currently eighteen \n     states have programs similar to New York's to provide \n     prescription drug benefits to senior citizens.\n       Any federal program created this year to provide \n     prescription drug coverage should recognize state efforts and \n     allow seniors to choose their benefit plan (in New York, that \n     choice would be between EPIC and the federal plan) while \n     providing a direct Medicare subsidy to the state program for \n     individuals that choose that option.\n       The Federal government has accepted responsibility of \n     providing health care to senior citizens and I strongly urge \n     an expansion to include prescription drug coverage. I applaud \n     President Bush for his leadership on this issue and our \n     Congressional delegation for its commitment to our seniors.\n       Your efforts on this important legislation could \n     dramatically improve the health of a segment of our \n     population that has given so much to New York's and America's \n     safety and prosperity. We urge you to work with us to ensure \n     that our seniors get the prescription drug coverage they \n     deserve, and that the federal government assumes its rightful \n     role in supporting services for our dual-eligible population.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 George E.

Madam President, I rise to state for the record my \nstrong support of Senator Harkin's amendment to the Medicare \nprescription drug bill (S. 1) to increase Medicare reimbursement for \nmammorgrams. I am a proud cosponsor of this amendment. I am pleased \nthat Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus agreed to include it in the \nMedicare prescription drug legislation that passed the Senate earlier \ntoday. Americans must have access to mammography because it is an \nimportant tool to screen and detect breast cancer.\n  It is vital for Medicare beneficiaries to have access to mammography. \nA woman's risk of having breast cancer increases with age. A woman's \nchance of getting breast cancer is 1 out of 2,212 by age 30. This \nincreases to 1 out of 23 by age 60 and 1 out of 10 by age 80. More than \n85 percent of breast cancers occur in women over the age of 50. There \nwill be 70 million Americans aged 65 and over in 2030. At the same time \nabout 700 mammography facilities have closed nationwide over the last 2 \nyears. Adequate reimbursement is essential to help ensure that women \nhave access to this important screening tool. This amendment will \nincrease Medicare reimbursement for mammograms. This amendment is also \nan important step to help radiologists enter and remain in the field of \nmammography by providing more adequate reimbursement. Mammography is \nnot perfect, but it is the best tool we have now.\n  I have long fought to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access \nto mammography. I cosponsored the Assure Access to Mammography Act, S. \n869, that would increase Medicare reimbursement for mammograms. It \nwould also increase the number of radiologists by increasing Medicare \ngraduate medical education, GME, to provide three additional \nradiologists in each teaching hospital. In 1990, I introduced the \nMedicare Screening Mammography Amendments of 1990 to provide Medicare \ncoverage of annual screening mammography. My legislation was included \nin the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Before that, Medicare \ndid not cover routine annual screening mammograms. Additional \nlegislation since then has expanded access to mammography for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I will continue to fight to ensure that women have \naccess to quality mammography, and I urge that the final version of the \nMedicare prescription drug bill include provisions to increase Medicare \nreimbursement for mammograms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8856-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8856-S8857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EDUCATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, there is troubling news on the \neducation front. Yesterday, the Republican majorities on the House and \nSenate Appropriations Committees approved education budgets filled with \nharsh cuts that will hurt families, students, schools, and teachers \nthroughout the country.\n  Unfortunately, the pattern is all too clear. Our Republican \ncolleagues promise strong support for education and quietly break the \npromise. The bills unveiled yesterday contain a litany of broken \npromises on education.\n  Obviously, money is not the answer to all the problems of our \nschools. But the way we allocate resources in the Federal budget is a \nclear expression of our Nation's priorities. And the priorities on \neducation reflected in this Republican Appropriations bill are \nprofoundly wrong.\n  In January 2002, President Bush promised that ``America's schools \nwill be on a new path of reform . . . our schools will have greater \nresources to meet those goals.'' But yesterday, on a\n\n[[Page S8857]]\n\nstrict party-line vote, our Republican colleagues voted to cut funding \nfor the No Child Left Behind Act by $200 million. We have raised \nstandards and raised expectations on schoolchildren. We intend to hold \nschools accountable for better performance. Yet now the Republican \nmajority wants to cut funding for school reform.\n  President Bush promised that we would ``leave no child behind,'' and \nthat became the title of the landmark school reform bill he signed into \nlaw a year and a half ago. But yesterday, behind closed doors, our \nRepublican colleagues approved a budget that leaves 6 million children \nbehind. It underfunds the title I program for needy children by over $6 \nbillion. Under the Republican education budget, needy children will not \nget smaller classes, will not get supplemental services, and will not \nget special attention in reading and mathematics.\n  In March last year, President Bush promised to support teachers, \nmaking sure they ``get the training they need to raise educational \nstandards.'' But yesterday, Republicans on the Appropriations \nCommittees proposed to cut 20,000 teachers from professional \ndevelopment programs. They proposed to eliminate training for teachers \nin technology.\n  We need to upgrade teacher quality, not downgrade teacher training. \nThe No Child Left Behind Act requires schools to give every classroom a \nhigh quality teacher. They need more resources, not fewer resources, to \nreach that goal.\n  President Bush promised that his administration ``will promote \npolicies that expand educational opportunities for Americans from all \nracial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds.'' But yesterday, our \nRepublican colleagues approved a budget that cuts 32,000 children from \neducation programs in English as a Second Language. They want to \neliminate the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship program. They want a zero \nincrease in Pell grants, a zero increase in campus-based financial aid, \nand a zero increase in College Work Study.\n  President Bush promised to increase AmeriCorps by 25,000 volunteers. \nTwo weeks ago, the Administration told us that AmeriCorps programs \nwould be cut by 25,000 volunteers.\n  Clearly, Federal resources are being limited unfairly because of the \nmassive tax breaks already enacted that benefit the wealthy. If we \nfreeze future tax breaks for the wealthy, we can obtain the resources \nwe need for education.\n  In the Senate and the House, Senator Byrd and Congressman Obey have \nshown impressive leadership on this issue. Instead of providing \nmillionaires with an average tax cut of $88,000 each as the President \nproposes, they would use the savings to fund the No Child Left Behind \nAct, invest in teachers, and help students pay for college.\n  But the Republican majority rejected those amendments. The Republican \nmajority voted to give $88,000 to each millionaire and to cut funds for \neducation. These are the wrong priorities for America, and we are going \nto oppose them on the Senate floor.\n  Next week on the Fourth of July, we will all celebrate our Nation's \nfounding values, values whose preservation depends heavily on the \nquality of education of each generation. As Senators go home to their \nStates for the recess, they should ask constituents whether they give \nhigher priority to tax breaks for millionaires or to education. They \nshould ask their constituents if they value investing in school reform \nand improvement. They should ask teachers what they think of a cut in \nthe No Child Left Behind budget.\n  If we intend to hold schools and students accountable, Congress has \nto be accountable, too.\n  On this Fourth of July, let's reflect on our history, on the need to \nkeep our promises, and on the importance of building a better future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8857-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in New York, \nNY. On September 12, 2001, a 66-year-old Sikh was savagely attacked by \nthree white teenagers. The man was shot with a pellet gun and chased \ndown by the teens who battered him with a baseball bat. The victim was \nhospitalized with head, back and wrist injuries.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8857-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HILARY B. ROSEN, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE RECORDING INDUSTRY \n                         ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I come to the floor today to offer \ncongratulations and heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional work of \nHilary Rosen, Chair and CEO of the Recording Industry Association of \nAmerica. Hilary will step down at the end of this year, after 17 years \nwith the RIAA. She leaves a legacy of remarkable efforts to ensure that \ninnovations are protected while finding legitimate new venues in the \nDigital Age. She has accomplished a great deal while at the same time \nushering the organization, and the music industry, through extremely \ntrying years.\n  After matriculating at George Washington University and earning a \nBachelor of Arts in International Business, Hilary devoted her energies \nto working for a former Governor of New Jersey in addition to two \nsenatorial transition teams, those of my distinguished colleague and \nformer colleague, Dianne Feinstein and Bill Bradley. She was an \naccomplished advocate and began her own consulting firm in 1987. \nHilary's hard work and talent were rewarded in 1998 when she assumed \nthe position of Chair and CEO at the RIAA.\n  She has represented the music industry with both tenacity and good \nhumor. While the Internet has ushered in a new era of information and \ncommunication capabilities, we are now well aware of the dangers posed \nby this innovation. These dangers take many forms: the security issues \nthat result when we have achieved so much interconnectedness, the \nproliferation of child pornography that seeks to exploit society's most \nvulnerable, and of course the threat posed to copyright holders by \nthose who distribute, for free, the work products of artists. Hilary \nhas made genuine headway, sometimes single-handedly, in harnessing the \npower of the Internet to further the goals of the music industry while \nhelping in the fight against the worst abuses of technology.\n  But her political activities extend well beyond the boundaries of the \norganization she leads. She was a founding member of Rock the Vote, a \ngroup which has successfully sought to reach out to younger Americans, \nimbuing those coming of age with the belief that they can have a \npositive impact on our political processes. And she sits on numerous \nnot-for-profit boards including the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, \nY.E.S. to Jobs, and the National Cancer Foundation. Looking at the list \nof groups she is involved with, the variety of causes she champions \nrivals the diversity of artists and labels she represents.\n  We know that her partner, Elizabeth Birch, and their twins, Jacob and \nAnna, will enjoy having more time with Hilary. If past experience is a \npredictor of future performance, she will shine in whatever endeavor \nshe next chooses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8857-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8857-S8858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, in considering potential nominees for a \npossible vacancy on the Supreme Court, I hope President Bush will \nconsider the example of earlier Presidents who followed both the letter \nand the spirit of the Constitution, and fully respected the role the \nFramers gave the Senate to share with the President.\n  The Framers originally rejected a proposal that the President alone \nappoint judges, and they seriously considered allowing the Senate to \nexercise that responsibility alone. In the end,\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\nthey decided to make that responsibility a shared function of the \nPresident and the Senate, through the ``advice and consent'' mechanism.\n  There is nothing ``novel'' or extra-constitutional about Presidents \nconsulting in advance with the Senate before nominating a person to a \nlifetime position on the Supreme Court. George Washington wanted the \nSenate to be his own ``privy council'' and refused to do so, but for \nthe past century many Presidents have taken the opposite course. They \nhave decided not only that such consultation was fully consistent with \nthe Framers' system of checks and balances, but also that their concern \nfor achieving a consensus in the selection of strong and independent \nJustices could be best achieved by consulting in advance with the \nSenate.\n  Presidents who did so often achieved broad Senate and national \nsupport for their nominees, avoided divisive and unnecessary battles, \nand prevented embarrassing rejections of their selections.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt frequently consulted with Senators \nbefore making Supreme Court nominations, including the 1902 nomination \nof Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who was confirmed the day he was \nnominated.\n  In 1932, President Herbert Hoover presented his list of possible \nnominees to Senator William Borah, a fellow Republican. Benjamin \nCardozo, a Democrat, was at the bottom of the President's list, but \nSenator Borah persuaded the President to nominate Cardozo, who was \nconfirmed nine days after his nomination was sent to the Senate.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt also shred his list of potential \nnominees with Senator Borah in advance. Senator Borah expressed his \nenthusiastic support for William O. Douglas, who was quickly confirmed \nby a vote of 62-4.\n  In 1975 President Gerald Ford shared his list of 11 prospective \nnominees with both the Senate and the American Bar Association. \nAlthough there was support for others on the list, his choice, John \nPaul Stevens, was confirmed in three weeks by a vote of 98-0.\n  President Bill Clinton consulted with Senators from both parties on \neach of his two Supreme Court nominees. Senator Dole, Senator Hatch, \nand others advised him that his favored candidate would be \ncontroversial, and supported the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \nLater, Senators from both parties, including Senator Hatch, recommended \nStephen Breyer. Both Ginsburg and Breyer were quickly and \noverwhelmingly confirmed.\n  Nominations which generated the most controversy were those which had \nlittle or no consultation with the Senate, or where the President \nignored advice of the Senate.\n  President Richard Nixon sought little or no direct advice from \nSenators who were not friends and supporters of his prospective \nnominees. He suffered two consecutive defeats, and the opponents \nincluded members and party leaders of the President's own party.\n  President Ronald Reagan's Chief of Staff, former Senator Howard \nBaker, consulted with leading Senate Democrats, and received strong \nadvice that Robert Bork would have substantial opposition. Bork was \nnominated nevertheless, and was defeated by a vote of 58-42.\n  There is no down-side to serious consultation with the Senate. If a \nwell-known prospective nominee has significant bipartisan support, the \nPresident will know in advance that he is likely to achieve prompt \nconfirmation of the nominee, without a divisive debate in the Senate \nthat would also be divisive for the country. The selection of a Supreme \nCourt Justice with broad national support would help bring the country \ntogether at a time when we are facing many difficult challenges, and I \nhope very much that the Members of the Senate can work closely with the \nPresident and with one another to achieve that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8858-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8858-S8860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, last night with the passing of our \nrevered colleague, Senator Strom Thurmond, I indicated I would have a \nlonger recount of his work. The Nation has lost one of its most \ndistinguished and longest-serving public servants, my State has lost \nits greatest living legend, and I would like to add to my comments.\n  By any measure, Senator Thurmond ranks as a giant of modern American \npolitics. Few people in recent memory have had greater influence on the \nshape and substance of American politics, and few elected officials \nhave shown themselves more devoted to serving the people of their State \nand nation. There was no more hard-working politician in America than \nSenator Thurmond. Right up to the day he retired from the Senate, he \nremained devoted to his constituents.\n  Of course, any discussion of Senator Thurmond's political and \nlegislative legacy ultimately turns to a discussion of Senator Thurmond \nthe man. He was one of the most amazing men anyone in this Chamber ever \nhas met. He was what we attorneys call ``sui generis.'' When God made \nStrom, He broke the mold for sure. Merely listing all of Senator \nThurmond's ``firsts'' conveys the prodigious energies and talents of \nthe man.\n  In 1929, he began his political career by becoming the youngest \nperson ever elected Superintendent of Education in Edgefield County, \nSouth Carolina. He entered state-wide politics in 1933, when he was \nelected to the State Senate. As a South Carolina Senator, he was known \nfor his devotion to improving public education and promoting \nopportunities for the people of my State. His concern for the common \nman motivated many of his legislative efforts, such as writing the act \nthat raised workers' compensation benefits and sponsoring South \nCarolina's first Rural Electrification Act. Although these efforts may \nseem far removed from our concerns today, they were crucial to my State \nat the time.\n  He left the Senate in 1938 to become Judge Thurmond. Continuing his \nlife-long love affair with politics and public service, he served as a \nSouth Carolina Circuit Judge until the United States entered the Second \nWorld War in 1941. Then Judge Thurmond took off his robe and \nvolunteered for active duty. He enlisted despite the fact that, as a \n39-year-old Circuit Judge, he was exempt from military service.\n  He fought in five battles in 4 years, and on D-Day, he rode a glider \ninto Normandy with the 82nd Airborne. For his wartime service, Senator \nThurmond was awarded 18 decorations, including the Purple Heart, Bronze \nStar for Valor, and Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster. He remained \nin the Army Reserves after the War and was made Major General in 1959.\n  After the war, he came home and ran for Governor. He was elected in \n1947, and his administration was known for its progressive policies on \neducation and infrastructure. During his tenure, 60,000 new jobs were \ncreated in the private sector, teacher pay was boosted to unprecedented \nlevels, and the State Farmers' Market was begun. These initiatives \nhelped start South Carolina on the road to a dynamic, modern economy.\n  In 1948, Governor Thurmond ran for President on the States' Rights \nticket. In 1954, he became the first person ever elected to the Senate \nas a write-in candidate. That election established him as a force in \nnational politics and a giant in South Carolina.\n  He was reelected to the Senate eight times, more than any Senator. \nWhen he left in January, he was the oldest and longest-serving Senator \nin U.S. history. He served as chairman of two powerful committees: \nJudiciary and Armed Services. In those capacities, he played an \nimportant role in keeping our national defense strong and ensuring the \nquality of our Federal judiciary.\n  He took controversial stands on civil rights and other divisive \nissues, but over time he changed and ended up garnering the support of \nmany of those whom he opposed. He will go down in history for his \ndevotion to his constituents.\n  Senator Thurmond also changed the course of politics in the South. \nHis conversion to the Republican party in 1964 heralded a new age in \nparty affiliation in the South and led the way for the region's \ntransformation from a one-party, Democratic stronghold.\n  Senator Thurmond is gone, but his legacy will live on for many \nlifetimes. The people of South Carolina loved him as they have loved no \nother politician.\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\nToday his loss is mourned across my state, by Democrats and Republicans \nalike. Those of us who have the privilege of serving in the Senate \nlament the loss of an admired colleague whose influence on this \ninstitution will stand for generations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I want to take a minute to say a few \nwords in honor of Strom Thurmond, our friend and former colleague, who \nhas passed away.\n  From the moment Strom Thurmond set foot in this Chamber in 1954, he \nhas been setting records. He was the only person ever elected to the \nU.S. Senate on a write-in-vote. He set the record for the longest \nspeech on the Senate floor, clocked at an astounding 24 hours and 18 \nminutes. He was the longest-serving Senator in the history of the U.S. \nSenate. He was also the oldest serving Senator. Many of my colleagues \nwill recall the momentous occasion in September of 1998 when he cast \nhis 15,000th vote in the Senate. With these and so many other \naccomplishments over the years, he has appropriately been referred to \nas ``an institution within an institution.''\n  In 1902, the year Strom Thurmond was born, life expectancy was 51 \nyears--and today it is 77 years. Strom continued to prove that, by any \nmeasure, he was anything but average.\n  He was so much in his life. To provide some context, let me point out \nthat during his lifetime, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska and \nHawaii gained Statehood, and 11 amendments were added to the \nConstitution. The technological advancements he witnessed, from the \nautomobile to the airplane to the Internet, literally spanned a century \nof progress. Conveniences we have come to take for granted today were \nnot always part of Strom Thurmond's world. Perhaps this explains why, \nduring Judiciary Committee hearings, he was often heard asking \nwitnesses who were too far away from the microphone to ``please speak \ninto the machine.''\n  The story of his remarkable political career truly could fill several \nvolumes. It began with a win in 1928 for the Edgefield County \nSuperintendent of Schools. Eighteen years later, he was Governor of \nSouth Carolina. Strom was even a Presidential candidate in 1948, \nrunning on the ``Dixiecrat'' ticket against Democrat Harry Truman.\n  I must admit that he came a long way in his political career, given \nthat he originally came to the Senate as a Democrat. I was happy to say \nthat wisdom came within a few short years when Strom saw the light and \njoined the Republican Party.\n  When I first arrived in the Senate in January of 1977, he was my \nmentor. As my senior on the Judiciary Committee, it was Strom Thurmond \nwho helped me find my way and learn how the committee functioned. He \nwas not only a respected colleague, but a personal friend.\n\n  During his tenure as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Strom \nThurmond left an indelible mark on the committee and the laws that came \nthrough it. He became known and respected for many fine qualifies and \npositions--his devotion to the Constitution, his toughness on crime, \nhis sense of fairness.\n  He was famous for his incredible grip. Many of us in this Chamber had \nthe experience of Strom Thurmond holding our arm tightly as he \nexplained a viewpoint and asked for our support. I might add that this \nproved to be a very effective approach.\n  Strom was also known to have a kind word or greeting for everyone who \ncame his way, and for being extremely good to his staff. Despite his \npower and influence, he never forgot the importance of small acts of \nkindness. For example, whenever he ate in the Senate Dining Room, he \ngrabbed two fistfuls of candy. When he returned to the floor of the \nSenate, he handed the candy out to the Senate Pages. Unfortunately, it \nwas usually melted into a kaleidoscope of sugar by then! I have a \nfeeling that the Pages preferred it when Strom took them out for ice \ncream.\n  Strom Thurmond was truly a legend--someone to whom the people of \nSouth Carolina owe an enormous debt of gratitude for all his years of \nservice. Clearly, the people of South Carolina recognize the sacrifices \nhe made and are grateful for all he did for them. In fact, you cannot \nmention the name Strom Thurmond in South Carolina without the audience \nbursting into spontaneous applause. He truly was an American political \nicon.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said that ``The better part of one's life \nconsists of friendships.'' With a friend like Strom Thurmond, this \nsentiment couldn't be more true. I am a great admirer of Strom \nThurmond, and I am proud to have called him my friend.\n  One final note about Strom Thurmond: He was a great patriot. A \ndecorated veteran of World War II who fought at Normandy on D-Day, \nStrom Thurmond loved this country. Let me close by saying that this \ncountry loved him, too.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this is a sad day for the family of our \nlate and beloved colleague, Strom Thurmond. I want to begin my remarks \nby extending my and Barbara's heartfelt condolences to all of them for \ntheir great loss. It is also, though, a day for all Americans, and most \nespecially those of us in the Senate community, to remember a man who \nspent a lifetime--in fact more than the average lifetime--in dedicated \npublic service to this nation.\n  When I joined the Armed Services Committee in 1979, Senator Thurmond \nhad already served on the committee for 20 years. I knew of him as a \npassionate and effective advocate for a strong national defense even \nbefore I joined the committee. In the 24 years that we served on the \ncommittee together, I came to appreciate even more his commitment to \nthe welfare of the men and women who serve and who have served in our \nnation's military, as well as their families.\n  One of the reasons Senator Thurmond was such an effective leader on \nnational security issues is that he spoke from his heart and from \npersonal experience. He served his country in uniform for 36 years. He \nwas commissioned in the Army Reserve even before he began his \nremarkable career in politics. He retired as a Major General in the \nArmy Reserves.\n  In June 1944, Lt. Col. Strom Thurmond landed behind German lines in a \nglider with the rest of the 82d Airborne Division as part of the D-Day \ninvasion. He truly was a member of what Tom Brokaw called ``the \ngreatest generation.''\n  During Senator Thurmond's long tenure on the Armed Services \nCommittee, our Armed Forces faced challenge after challenge in Western \nEurope, Vietnam, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, and \nAfghanistan. Through it all, Senator Thurmond was unwavering in his \nsupport for our men and women in uniform. His steadfast commitment to \nour national defense was a rock upon which they and we could all \ndepend. He never stopped working to ensure that our military is always \nready to answer the call whenever and wherever needed.\n  Senator Thurmond served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in the 104th and 105th Congresses. I had the honor and \npleasure to serve as his ranking member in 1997 and 1998. I know from \npersonal experience how seriously Senator Thurmond treated his duties \nas chairman and how hard he worked to be fair and even-handed with \nevery member of the committee. Our former colleague and chairman, \nSenator Sam Nunn, was right when he said that there was not a single \nnational security issue facing this country that has been or could be \nsolved by one political party. That legacy of bipartisanship on the \nArmed Services Committee was continued under the chairmanship of Strom \nThurmond. I am sure that I speak for all of our colleagues in saying \njust how much we appreciate not only the commitment that Senator \nThurmond brought to his duties as chairman, but also his lifelong \ndedication to the defense of our Nation and to the welfare of those who \ndefend us.\n  In my 24 years of service with Strom Thurmond, I never knew him to be \nanything other than unfailingly optimistic, always courteous, and ever-\nthoughtful of his Senate colleagues and their families. I cannot say \nhow many times he gave me and all my colleagues advice on exercise, on \ndiet, and on taking care of ourselves and our families in general. I \nwish I had followed his advice more often because it was always given \nout of his true concern as a friend. Strom himself was a marvelous \nspecimen of physical fitness. One need only receive a handshake or a \nshoulder slap from Strom Thurmond to fully appreciate his strength and \nstamina.\n\n[[Page S8860]]\n\n  Sadly Strom Thurmond has left this Earth and we will always miss him. \nI hope his family takes comfort in knowing, though, that he leaves an \nexample of dedicated public service that will stand as a inspiration \nfor generations to come.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, we are deeply saddened by the death of \nour former colleague, Strom Thurmond. He was a beloved friend, always \ngracious, and affectionate.\n  His service in the Senate was distinctive not only because he served \nso many years but because of his love for his job and his dedication to \nserving the interests of the people of South Carolina.\n  He was determined to make his influence felt in the committees and on \nthe floor. He took an active part in the debates even on the most \ncontroversial issues.\n  His 24 hour speech on the Civil Rights Act was a record-setting \nevent. He also was a fervent and effective supporter of our military \nforces and the veterans who had risked their lives in military service \nto our Nation.\n  I will always count it as one of my richest blessings that I got to \nknow Strom Thurmond and the members of his family. My hope is that \nNancy and their children will be comforted by the warmth and sincerity \nof the esteem and affection in which the Thurmond family will always be \nheld by their many close friends in the Senate family.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my colleague and \ndear friend, Senator Strom Thurmond, who passed away last night at the \nage of 100.\n  A few months ago, as he was about to retire from the United States \nSenate, I said on this floor that I could not even begin to imagine the \nSenate without Senator Thurmond. And since he left this Chamber, I \ncan't tell you how many times, during a vote, when the clerk would \nreach the lower half of the alphabet, I've looked up from wherever I \nwas on the floor--expecting to see the man who was, for so long, South \nCarolina's senior Senator.\n  He was truly an institution within this Chamber--a ranking Member, a \ncommittee chairman, a President pro tempore, and the first ever \nPresident pro tempore emeritus. He cast over 15,000 votes. His service \nspanned the terms of 10 U.S. Presidents. And he was directly involved \nin the confirmation hearings of all nine current Supreme Court \nJustices.\n  Strom Thurmond's life was one devoted to public service. He was a \nteacher, a school superintendent, a State Senator, a judge, a war hero, \nGovernor, and, of course, a Senator for nearly 50 years.\n  At each step in his life, Strom Thurmond was searching for ways to \nserve his country. As a circuit judge in South Carolina, he took a \nleave of absence to volunteer to parachute behind enemy lines during \nthe D-Day invasion at Normandy. For his valor in World War II, he \nreceived the Purple Heart, five Battle Stars for Bravery and numerous \nother decorations. And shortly after the war ended, he was elected \nGovernor of South Carolina, an office he held for 4 years.\n  But there is no doubt that when his constituents remember Strom \nThurmond, their thoughts will immediately turn to his years as their \nSenator. He served them in this body for over one-fifth of our Nation's \nhistory. For many South Carolinians, when he retired earlier this year, \nhe was the only senior Senator they had ever known.\n  Strom Thurmond did not merely serve in the Senate; he did so, even \nduring his final years, with unparalleled vigor. His commitment to the \npeople of South Carolina was legendary--whether it was helping an \nelderly constituent get a Social Security check, or ensuring that the \nwidow of a law enforcement officer could keep her husband's badge, \nStrom Thurmond never forgot the people who sent him to Washington.\n  And the dozens of schools, buildings, parks, and streets in South \nCarolina that bear his name today show that they never forgot him \neither.\n  I served with Strom Thurmond for 22 years in the Senate, and my \nfather served with him for 12--that's 34 years in which a Dodd served \nin this body with Senator Thurmond. Both of us certainly had our share \nof disagreements with him. But those disagreements always came in the \nspirit of respect, thoughtfulness, and collegiality that are hallmarks \nof the Senate. And Strom Thurmond truly embodied those qualities.\n  To the Dodd family, though, Strom Thurmond was more than just a \ncolleague--he was a true and loyal friend. We will never forget the \nloyalty and friendship he showed us even during some trying and \ndifficult times.\n  It is impossible to look back at the years of Strom Thurmond's life \nwithout being amazed. He lived through the invention of the Model T \nFord and the creation of the Internet. As a child, he read newspaper \naccounts of battles that were fought with bayonets in the trenches of \nEurope. And in his later years, he watched satellite television reports \nof conflicts won with smart bombs and laser technology. He experienced \nthe Great Depression of the 1930s and the technology bubble of the \n1990s.\n  And as America matured and changed during his lifetime, Strom \nThurmond grew, as well.\n  Senator Thurmond didn't just live through a century of history. He \nwas intimately involved in it. In each step that America took, Strom \nThurmond was there. In that respect, and in so many others, Strom \nThurmond was a truly unique and rare individual.\n  I offer my condolences to the entire family of Strom Thurmond. We \nwill miss him very much.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, a constant of the universe has changed. \nStrom Thurmond is no longer with us. We mourn because this world is \npoorer for his passing, but we also know he smiles down upon us from a \nbetter, happier place.\n  True to the creed taught him by his father, Strom always gave of \nhimself, to his family, his beloved state of South Carolina, and to his \ncountry. He understood that the essence of leading is serving.\n  Strom changed his times and changed with his times. Born during the \nadministration of Theodore Roosevelt, he retired a thoroughly modern \nSenator.\n  He wanted to be history's first 100-year-old Senator. Through faith \nand force of will, he made it. Even more happily, he wanted to see the \nbirth of his first grandchild, and he did, just recently.\n  Like many great persons, Strom combined changeless values with an \namazing ability to adapt in a changing world. In turns, he was a \nliberal and a conservative; a Democrat, Independent, and Republican; a \nfamous bachelor, widower, husband, father, and now grandfather. He came \nto the Senate from what they call the ``Old South,'' but when I came to \nCongress, I saw in Strom a Senator committed to equal opportunity and \ninclusiveness. He was young at heart, had a sense of fun and adventure, \nand was always open to new ideas. This is the way Strom should be \nremembered, as an example of how the human spirit can grow and mature \ngracefully.\n  Yet, for all the changes, Strom's constituents were reassured by a \nsense of his being changeless. What never changed was a foundation of \ntimeless values. He was devoted to faith, family, patriotism, \nintegrity, public service, hard work, and compassion for everyday \npeople.\n  Only in recent years, did Strom and I discover from a genealogy \nwebsite that we were distant cousins. After that, we enjoyed greeting \neach other with, ``Hi, Cousin!''\n  Today, I say, ``Farewell for now, Cousin. Your life has honored and \ninspired your family, friends, and Nation.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8860-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8860-S8861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SAN PEDRO HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the proud \nhistory of San Pedro High School, which is celebrating its centennial \nthis year. The school has grown considerably since 1904, when the San \nPedro community honored its first graduating class at a ceremony at the \ntown hall building. Maude Wayne was the only member of that class, and \nalso served as student body president for the school's other 22 \nstudents.\n  When San Pedro High School first opened, students were taught in a \nsingle room on the second floor of 16th\n\n[[Page S8861]]\n\nStreet Elementary School. Today's campus has existed since 1937, \neducating athletes Garry Maddox and Alan Ashby, and astronaut Anna \nFisher.\n  San Pedro High School is a fixture in the community, filled with many \nfond memories. Many alumni have lived in the San Pedro community all \ntheir lives, and take pride in the school that educated them, their \nchildren and their children's children. San Pedro Pirates young and old \nhave attended many anniversary celebrations and have enjoyed exchanging \nstories about their high school years. San Pedro High truly plays a \nsignificant role in the community.\n  I would like to extend my congratulations to principal Stephen \nWalters and all the past principals, as well as current and past \nteachers, administrators, and students. They have all been a part of \nthe school's success over the years. This is a proud moment for them \nand for the entire community, and I thank them all for making San Pedro \nHigh the best it could be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8861-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO DOCTOR A. MICHAEL ANDREWS II\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute today to an \noutstanding American for his significant, lasting contributions to the \nsoldiers of the United States Army.\n  On June 23, 2003, Dr. A. Michael Andrews II, the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of the Army for Research and Technology/Chief Scientist, \nreturned to the private sector after over six and a half years of \nselfless service to the Army and the Nation. Mike hails from the great \nstate of Oklahoma, and received his B.S. and M.S. in Electrical \nEngineering from the University of Oklahoma. In 1971, he received his \nPh.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois.\n  Following a stellar 25-year career as a senior engineer and senior \nexecutive at Rockwell International Corporation, Mike came to the \nPentagon in January 1997 as the Director for Technology in the Office \nof the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development and \nAcquisition.\n  His exemplary performance as Director of Technology led to Mike's \nappointment as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research \nand Technology/Chief Scientist, DAS, R, in November 1998. As DAS, \nR, Mike was responsible for the Army's entire Research and Technology \nprogram, spanning 21 Laboratories and Research, Development and \nEngineering Centers, with approximately 10,000 scientists and engineers \nand a budget that, under his leadership, grew over 30 percent to reach \n$1.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2004.\n  In October 1999, the Army Secretary and the Chief of Staff of the \nArmy announced their Vision for transforming the Army to an Objective \nForce--a force that is rapidly deployable and can operate in both \nlarge-scale wars and urban peacekeeping operations. It was clear that \nthe Army's Science and Technology, S, program was the cornerstone to \nachieving their vision of a full spectrum force within this decade. \nMike took bold steps to shift the focus of the Army's technology by \njudiciously refocusing and redirecting the Army's $10 billion plus S \ninvestments over 2000-2007 towards developing and demonstrating \nObjective Force technologies.\n  Understanding the importance of Congressional support for the Army \nS program, Mike consistently worked to develop better communications \nwith Members of Congress and Congressional Staff. These efforts \nresulted in Congress providing over 98 percent of the requested Army \nS program funding over the last five Fiscal Years and 100 percent, \nthus far, for Fiscal Year 2004.\n  In addition to his pursuit of achieving a lighter, more lethal Army, \nMike also initiated a unique partnership with the private sector to \nlink the Army and the entertainment industry to establish unique \ntraining environments for our soldiers. By leveraging significant \nentertainment industry investments and capabilities in modeling and \nsimulations, e.g., electronic games, theme parks and digital movies, \nand existing Army efforts, Mike established a university-based center \ncalled the Institute for Creative Technologies. The Institute provides \nan environment for shared investment and joint projects to enhance Army \ntraining. The Institute has expanded beyond Hollywood to the Army's \nField Artillery Center and School at Fort Sill, OK, where its \nsignificant simulation and modeling capabilities can be brought \ndirectly to soldiers undergoing basic and advanced Field Artillery \ntraining.\n  Finally, Mike was also the driving force in launching the \nCybermission program, a personal initiative of Chief of Staff of the \nArmy CSA, General Eric K. Shinseki. This program raised the visibility \nof the Army's commitment in the education of America's youth in \nscience, math and technology among 7th-8th grade students across \nAmerica. ECybermission introduces young Americans and potentially \nfuture soldiers to the Army and the theme of Service to Our Nation \nwhile supporting the President's commitment to education.\n  Mike was honored with the Presidential Rank Award in 2001, elected as \na Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in \n2001, and presented the National Defense Industry Association Firepower \nAward in 2000.\n  In this short space, it is difficult to fully document the many \nsignificant, positive ways that Mike has shaped the future of the Army. \nThrough his tireless attention to detail and personal involvement, Mike \nhas shepherded the FCS program through the past five years and has \nbrought attention and credit to the Army's S community for the \noutstanding achievements that they have made. Mike Andrews' effective \nwork with senior Army and DoD staff principals, scientists and \nengineers, and industry significantly enhanced the Army's efforts \ntoward the development of the Future Combat Systems, Objective Force, \nand Transformation. He demonstrated visionary leadership, planning and \norganizational skills throughout his tenure. As we honor him, we note \nthat this institution and our country is better off for the major \ncontributions he has made. We wish him all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8861-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:18 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2417.

A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. \n(posthumously) and his widow Coretta Scott King in recognition of their \ncontributions to the Nation on behalf of the civil rights movement; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, joined by a number of my colleagues in \nthe Senate, I am today introducing legislation, S. 1368, that will \nauthorize the President to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Reverend \nDoctor Martin Luther King, Jr., posthumously, and his widow, Coretta \nScott King, in recognition of their countless contributions to the \nNation as leaders of the civil rights movement. A companion bill is \nbeing introduced in the House by Congressman John Lewis of Georgia. \nThis medal is one small way for Congress to recognize and honor this \ncouple's distinguished record of public service, sacrifice, and \ncommitment to protect the dignity of a people and awaken the conscience \nof a country.\n  Dr. King embraced all Americans in his quest to make a living reality \nof equality of opportunity and economic and social justice for all \nhumankind, those fundamental principles in our Constitution. The vision \nof equality which guided his life and contributed to his death is \nindelibly woven into the fabric and history of our Nation. This medal \nwill pay tribute to Dr. King's many great accomplishments: from his \ncourageous application of the doctrine of nonviolent civil disobedience \nto combat segregation to his leadership in the Montgomery bus boycott, \nfrom his efforts on behalf of 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting \nRights Act to his soaring speeches that inspired a nation to action. \nFor these and for all his other contributions, Dr. King deserves our \nhighest honor.\n  Mrs. Coretta Scott King joined her husband in his lifework and has \ncontinued his legacy to this day. Like Dr. King, Mrs. King was a leader \nin our country's civil rights movement, striving through nonviolent \nmeans to promote social change and attain full civil rights for \nAfrican-Americans and other discriminated people. Mrs. King worked to \npreserve Dr. King's memory and ideals by, among other things, \ndeveloping and building the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for \nNonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, establishing the ``Freedom \nConcerts'' organization to increase awareness of the Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference, and leading a campaign to recognize Dr. King's \nbirthday as a national holiday. Mrs. King's continuing contributions to \nour nation also merit her receipt of this award.\n  Here in America we have come a long way towards achieving Dr. King's \ndream of liberty, justice and equality for all. But we still have work \nto do. Let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle that he \ndied for and that Mrs. King continues to work for. The Congressional \nGold Medal is a fitting tribute to these two heroes who tirelessly \nfought to create a united America.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join Senators Warner, Biden, Hollings, \nBingaman, Stabenow, Kennedy, Lautenberg, Pryor, Landrieu, Clinton, \nMilkulski, Durbin, Dodd, Lieberman, Corzine and me in commemorating the \nefforts of the late Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. and his \nwidow, Coretta Scott King, by supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S.J. Res. 14. A joint resolution expressing support for freedom in \nHong Kong; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a joint resolution \nfor myself and Senator Kyl regarding the United States' commitment to \npreserving freedom in Hong Kong. It is not simply the responsibility of \nthe United States, but also of the Administration of Tung Chee Hwa, \nHong Kong's chief executive and the People's Republic of China.\n  This resolution emphasizes an isolated event taking place on July 9 \nof this year--the passage of draconian laws on sedition, subversion, \nand theft of state secrets. This law evokes something out of one of the \nnovels of George Orwell. Just as the resolution states, the law, as now \ndrafted, is vague and overly broad in its definitions of subversion, \nsedition, and official secrets.\n  The Secretary of Security, an appointee of the Government of the \nPeople's Republic of China, would have very broad authority to ban \norganizations not approved by his Beijing masters. Nothing less than \nthe survival of\n\n[[Page S8864]]\n\nthe Catholic Church in China and the Falun Gong, a quasi-religious \npractice that emphasizes breathing and meditation, are at stake with \nthis law. Beijing has clearly targeted these and many other groups \npromoting democracy and human rights.\n  In addition, the Secretary of Security would have the authority to \nwaive the right to notice and the right to be heard--something that \nperson could execute on a whim. This horrendous bill would allow the \nHong Kong Government to prosecute members of the news media for \npublishing information that would arbitrarily be deemed a ``state \nsecret.''\n  These ``state secrets'' might include Hong Kong-Mainland cooperation \non the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS. If China handled a \nnew outbreak of some contagion the same way it handled SARS, I would \nthink the people of Hong Kong should know that their lives might be in \ndanger because of the Government's negligence.\n  This is the extreme case, however, it must be made clear to my \ncolleagues, and to the world, that the legislation to be voted on July \n9, in Hong Kong would create a severe chilling effect on the press to \nfreely report information. The Hong Kong Journalists Association, the \nOverseas Press Club, and the Committee to Protect Journalists all \noppose this bill.\n  In addition, the legislation would strip other provisions contained \nin a current Hong Kong law, the Societies Ordinance, of due process \nprotections. On top of that, the Hong Kong police would have new powers \nto search without having a warrant. Those two provisions are the \nbedrock of a free society. How does the Hong Kong government think it \ncan get away with this?\n\n  It assumes that it can ride out the cries of outrage from inside Hong \nKong and throughout the world. I hope that Chief Executive Tung's \nadministration understands that this resolution only represents the \nbeginning. Sir, if you read these comments, please understand you are \non the losing side of history.\n  Hong Kong has been remarkably free in the last six years. That is a \ntrue statement. The fact that Mr. Tung and his colleagues fail to \nunderstand is that without these freedoms, Hong Kong will surely fail.\n  Unfortunately, the People's Republic of China has increasingly \ninterfered in Hong Kong's independent judiciary, intimidated the media \nto induce self-censorship, and excluded visitors who disagree with the \nChinese Communist Party's policies.\n  The Hong Kong SAR Government, encouraged by the Government of the \nPeople's Republic of China, has eroded Hong Kong's political \nindependence, international prestige, and its appeal as a business and \nfinancial hub of Asia. Recently, the American Chamber of Commerce in \nHong Kong reversed its position regarding the bill saying that it would \nbe a disaster for business in Hong Kong.\n  The South China Morning Post reported: ``In a letter to all \nlegislators, chamber chairman James Thompson said the bill contained \nworrying provisions, such as that seeking to ban organisations. These \nwould jeopardise Hong Kong's distinctive features, in particular its \ntransparent legal system and free flow of information.''\n  Similarly, the International Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong in its \nsubmission to the Hong Kong Government opposing the bill stated ``We \nregret that the Administration has chosen to ignore our request, and \nthat of many others in Hong Kong for a second round of public \nconsultation before bringing the matter to the Legislative Council, and \nrigidly following its own timetable.\n  They continued saying, ``The Consultation Document is complicated \nenough, and has taken us much time to prepare a response. The Bill is \neven more difficult to study as it relates to a number of existing \nordinances, if nothing else. Yet we have to rush to forward our \ncomments to meet a deadline. This timetable also puts undue pressure on \nthe Legislative Council to finish scrutiny in a hurry. For a matter of \nsuch great significance, it is to be regretted that it should have to \nbe rushed through at the risk of sacrificing quality.''\n\n  The lifeblood of Hong Kong's existence, its business community, \nopposes the bill and the Hong Kong Government pressured by Beijing \nfails to understand why there is all this outrage. The business \ncommunity in this fascinating center for finance, shipping and media is \nwell known for its cozy relationship with Mr. Tung, his cabinet and \nother officials, and even for being close with Beijing to get the \nfavorable treatment it receives in China.\n  Yet, this community, arguably the most influential in Hong Kong's \naffairs, is out right opposed to the effort to suppress freedom in Hong \nKong. It is not such a large leap to understand that Hong Kong's \nvibrancy results from its freedom.\n  I underline these concerns for my colleagues today in the hope that \nit will give pause to legislators in Hong Kong, and deter this and any \nfuture assaults on freedom in this important territory.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 14\n\n       Whereas Hong Kong has long been the freest economy in the \n     world, renowned for its rule of law and its zealous \n     protection of civil rights and civil liberties;\n       Whereas the Agreement between the Government of the United \n     Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question \n     of Hong Kong, done at Beijing December 19, 1984 (the Sino-\n     British Joint Declaration of 1984) explicitly guarantees that \n     all of Hong Kong's freedoms, including freedom of the press, \n     religious freedom, and freedom of association, will continue \n     for at least 50 years after the transfer of Hong Kong's \n     sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic \n     of China on July 1, 1997;\n       Whereas in the 6 years since the transfer of the territory, \n     the citizens of Hong Kong have enjoyed a certain degree of \n     individual liberty, religious freedom, freedom of the press \n     and freedom of speech, which keep it both politically vibrant \n     and stable;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has increasingly \n     interfered in Hong Kong's independent judiciary, intimidated \n     the media to induce self-censorship, and excluded visitors \n     who disagree with the policies of the Chinese Communist \n     Party;\n       Whereas the Government of the Hong Kong Special \n     Administrative Region (SAR), encouraged by the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China, has eroded Hong Kong's \n     political independence, international prestige, and appeal as \n     a business and financial hub of Asia;\n       Whereas the freedoms cherished by the people of Hong Kong \n     serve as a constant reminder to the world and to the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China that such \n     freedoms could, but do not, prevail on mainland China;\n       Whereas the traditional liberties of Hong Kong's 7,000,000 \n     people are now immediately threatened by a new national \n     security bill proposed by the SAR Government that would \n     revise Hong Kong's laws regarding sedition, treason, \n     subversion, and theft of state secrets;\n       Whereas the national security bill, as now drafted, is \n     vague and overly broad in its definitions of subversion, \n     sedition, and official secrets, weakens existing due process \n     protections in the Societies Ordinance, and gives dangerous \n     new powers to the police to make searches without warrant;\n       Whereas the proposed legislation would give the Hong Kong \n     SAR Secretary for Security, an appointee of the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China, broad authority to ban \n     organizations not approved by Beijing, thereby threatening \n     religious organizations such as the Falun Gong and the Roman \n     Catholic Church;\n       Whereas, under the proposed legislation, such basic and \n     fundamental procedural rights as notice and opportunity to be \n     heard could be waived by the Secretary for Security if \n     honoring these rights ``would not be practicable'';\n       Whereas the proposed legislation provides for the \n     imprisonment of individuals accused of ``unauthorized \n     disclosure of protected information,'' making it possible for \n     the Hong Kong SAR Government to prosecute members of the news \n     media for publishing any information relevant to relations \n     between the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong;\n       Whereas similar subversion laws in the People's Republic of \n     China are regularly used to convict and imprison journalists, \n     labor activists, Internet entrepreneurs, and academics;\n       Whereas the members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council who \n     have been elected by universal suffrage oppose the proposed \n     legislation, but are powerless as a minority to block the \n     votes controlled directly and indirectly by the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas the clear majority of people in Hong Kong have \n     expressed strong concerns about, and opposition to, the \n     proposed legislation;\n       Whereas the scheduled consideration of these proposals to \n     restrict Hong Kong's freedoms in the Legislative Council on \n     July 9, 2003, makes the threat to the people of Hong Kong \n     clear and imminent; and\n\n[[Page S8865]]\n\n       Whereas the United States has consistently supported the \n     desire of the people of Hong Kong to be free, and, as \n     Congress declared in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act \n     of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.): ``The human rights of the \n     people of Hong Kong are of great importance to the United \n     States and are directly relevant to United States interests \n     in Hong Kong. Human rights also serve as a basis for Hong \n     Kong's continued economic prosperity'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) declares that restrictions on freedom of thought, \n     expression, and association in Hong Kong are limits on the \n     fundamental rights of the people of Hong Kong;\n       (2) declares that the national security bill would \n     undermine freedom of the press and access to information, \n     both of which are fundamentally important to the economic and \n     commercial success of Hong Kong;\n       (3) calls upon the SAR Government to--\n       (A) avoid implementing any law that restricts the basic \n     human freedoms of thought and expression, including the \n     proposed implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law of the \n     Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's \n     Republic of China (the Basic Law); and\n       (B) immediately schedule and conduct elections for the \n     Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR according to rules \n     approved by the people of Hong Kong through an election law \n     convention, by referendum, or both; and\n       (4) calls upon the President of the United States to--\n       (A) urge the Government of Hong Kong, including Hong Kong \n     Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and the Legislative Council, \n     not to implement any law, including any law established \n     pursuant to the proposed implementation of Article 23 of the \n     Basic Law, that restricts the basic human right to freedom of \n     thought and expression;\n       (B) call upon the People's Republic of China, the National \n     People's Congress, and any groups appointed by the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China to leave all revisions of \n     Hong Kong law to a democratically-elected legislature;\n       (C) call upon the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to fully respect the autonomy and independence of the \n     Independent Commission Against Corruption and the chief \n     executive, civil service, judiciary, and police of Hong Kong;\n       (D) declare that the continued lack of an elected \n     legislature in Hong Kong constitutes a violation of the Sino-\n     British Joint Declaration of 1984; and\n       (E) call upon the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to honor its treaty obligations under the Sino-British \n     Joint Declaration of 1984.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/27/senate-section/article/S8865-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 191--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE J.
