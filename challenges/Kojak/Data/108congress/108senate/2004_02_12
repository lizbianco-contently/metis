Mr. President, this morning the Senate will complete the \nfinal 30 minutes of debate prior to the vote on invoking cloture on the \nsubstitute amendment to S. 1072, the highway bill. That vote will occur \nat 9 a.m. today. If cloture is invoked, it is my hope that we will be \nable to dispose of any germane amendments in a timely manner, thereby \nclearing the way to wrap up consideration of the substitute. Once the \nsubstitute is disposed of, we still may require a cloture vote on the \nbill itself. It is my hope that we will be able to speed the process \nalong and be in a position to complete action on the bill today. As was \nannounced last night, it is my intention to remain in session until we \npass this bill.\n  Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout the day. In \naddition, I remind all Senators that all second-degree amendments must \nbe filed at the desk no later than 9 a.m.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the managers will yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until 9 \na.m. shall be equally divided between the chairman and ranking members \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee or their designees. Does \nthe Senator yield a portion of his time to the Senator from California?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I start off by thanking the chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Inhofe, for telling \nme yesterday that he would be really pleased for me to speak for 5 \nminutes. This Environment and Public Works Committee is quite a unique \ncommittee, extremely bipartisan. Working with Senator Jeffords, Senator \nInhofe, also with Senator Reid, Senator Bond, and also with the help of \nthe majority leader and the Democratic leader, this is a very important \nmoment for this Senate.\n  Why do I say that? Times are very tough in this Nation and we have a \nNation divided on so many issues. But one thing we are not divided \nabout is the fact that we have a very serious job issue in our country. \nNow, each party has reasons for why they think this is happening and I \nwill not go into that; I don't have enough time to do it now.\n  This morning, I learned on the news that, surprisingly, jobless \nclaims are up this week again, and retail sales are down. We have a \nproblem in this country--outsourcing of jobs. That is a big problem in \nthis country, although it seems that the administration doesn't think \nso. I think most Americans--a very strong number of Americans--believe \nthat taking jobs overseas is a serious problem. Without those jobs, \nfamilies struggle. With the fear of losing their jobs, our families are \nanxious.\n  This is a bill that will build the highway and transit systems we \nneed. This is a bill that will put people to work with good jobs, \nexcellent jobs, and good benefits that will bring a benefit to the \ncountry. No country that wants to be the leader of the world--which we \nalready are--can survive if it doesn't keep it up with its \ninfrastructure needs. This committee understands that. This Public \nWorks Committee has overcome the things that divide us.\n  Is the formula perfect? No, it is not.\n  For my State, we are definitely doing better, and I am very pleased \nabout that. But I can tell you this: We need the million jobs this bill \nwill bring. We need the 100,000 jobs that will come to my State. We \nneed these important road projects. We need to move goods in this \nsociety. Goods movement is one of the key issues we have addressed in \nthis bill.\n  In States such as California, where goods are moving off ports and \ninto the interior of the country, we need attention to these problems. \nThis bill pays attention to these problems.\n  At my behest, there is language in the bill about using funds to \nreduce congestion. Congestion is a real problem. This chart shows how \nmany hours are wasted every year with people sitting in their cars in \ntraffic.\n  In Los Angeles--we are talking about a year's time--136 hours. That \nis what the average person is wasting sitting in their car in Los \nAngeles; San Francisco-Oakland, 92 hours a year; San Jose, 74; the \ninland empire, an area that is receiving all the goods from a very \nrobust port of Los Angeles, 64 hours; San Diego, 51 hours.\n  Whether you are looking at jobs, whether you are looking at goods \nmovement----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask if I may have 1 minute to complete \nmy thoughts.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California, Mrs. Boxer, have an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That would be wonderful.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since I have 2 minutes, I wish to say to \nmy chairman--he may not have heard me--how proud I am of this \ncommittee. His work, along with Senator Reid, Senator Jeffords, and the \ntwo leaders, has brought us to this point. I personally say for my \nState and the people in my State who are stuck sitting in traffic 136 \nhours a year in Los Angeles, thank you.\n  The Senator's State is a small State. We are a State with 35 million \npeople, growing to 50 million people. This bill is our lifeblood. I am \nso pleased we have a chance today to vote up or down on a clean bill.\n  Are there problems with the fact the Commerce Committee did not \nproduce a piece about rail? I think it is a problem. I sit on the \nCommerce Committee, and I wish we had done it, and I hope, as this bill \nmoves forward, we can address that issue. But we have a bill that is \ngoing to meet the problems of this century, that is going to move us \nforward.\n  This is the greatest country in the world. We have to have an \ninfrastructure that keeps up. I thank very much the leaders of the \ncommittee on which I am proud to serve. I thank the Chair. I hope we \nget a resounding vote so we can move to this bill and do something to \ncreate jobs and create an infrastructure that we need at this time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on cloture on \nthe Inhofe substitute amendment to S. 1072, the SAFETEA bill. As we all \nknow, the country has important transportation needs that Congress must \naddress, and I commend the managers of the bill for working hard to \naddress highway construction, mass transit, highway safety, and other \nimportant programs.\n  This is a very important bill, and I am not taking my vote lightly. \nHowever, I am concerned that this bill does not do enough to help meet \nthe transportation needs of my constituents in Wisconsin. And for that, \nand other reasons, I will be voting against cloture today.\n  Before I discuss some of my main concerns with the bill, I want to \nnote that the substitute amendment before us was laid down on Tuesday. \nFurthermore, I understand that the text was not immediately available \nfor review. I know how hard the managers have been working, and I know \nhow important this bill is. But surely it is reasonable to give \nSenators more than 24 or even 48 hours to review a huge and complicated \npiece of legislation like this before filing cloture.\n  I appreciate the months of hard work that my colleagues have spent on \nthis bill. However, I have serious concerns about the funding formula \nthat this bill would establish. Under that formula, certain States \nwould continue to receive significantly more money than they pay into \nthe highway trust fund, while other States continue to be denied their \nfair share.\n  Wisconsin is one of the States that will get the short end of the \nstick. While increasing the total dollars coming to Wisconsin, this \nbill would ensure that citizens of Wisconsin no longer get back at \nleast one dollar for every dollar that they pay into the highway trust \nfund.\n  I worked hard with the rest of the Wisconsin delegation during the \nlast authorization to make sure that our State finally got a fair rate \nof return. Let me tell my colleagues, that change was long overdue. \nAccording to numbers from the Department of Transportation, from 1956 \nthrough 2000, Wisconsin got back just 90 cents on every dollar it paid \ninto the trust fund.\n  In TEA-21, Wisconsin at last received a fair return. Unfortunately, \nthis bill will take us back to where we were for the previous four \ndecades--in the hole. Under the new formula, Wisconsin will once again \nbe a donor State, with average rate of return of 95 percent. I have \nspoken to other members of our State's delegation, and I think I can \nsafely say we agree that Wisconsin deserves better.\n  I am also concerned about some of the environmental provisions in the \nbill, particularly those with a potential impact on the Nation's air \nquality. The substitute modifies current transportation regulations \ndealing with long-range transportation planning, which could result in \na failure to adequately consider the long-term effects of new projects \non air quality.\n  The substitute also potentially undermines the National Environmental \nPolicy Act--NEPA--and section 4(f), which guarantee meaningful public \nparticipation in review of the impacts of proposed highway projects.\n  And I am concerned that the substitute would allow the Federal \nDepartment of Transportation to ignore\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\nthe often valuable input of States, tribes, and local governments, who, \nin my State of Wisconsin, have spent valuable public resources and time \nto develop transportation and land use plans.\n  All of which leads me to believe that now is not the time to cut off \ndebate on the substitute. We need plenty of time to analyze and \nunderstand the full ramifications of this bill. And, I think we need \ntime to try to improve the bill. I will continue to work hard with the \nsenior Senator from Wisconsin and the rest of the State's delegation to \ndo everything that we can to provide Wisconsin with a transportation \nbill that is fair for our constituents.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the vote we are about to take is not \njust a cloture vote on a transportation bill. The vote to move forward \non this legislation is about safety, it is about worker productivity, \nit is about family, it is about fairness, and it is about fulfilling \nour responsibility to the American public. But most importantly, it is \nabout jobs--jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  These jobs are not in China or Singapore or Chile. These jobs are in \nPortland, Springfield, Los Angeles, Kansas City, and Burlington. This \nlegislation is balanced, it is fair, and it is paid for. We owe it to \nour constituents to finish this bill today. Tomorrow let's send it to \nthe House and then to the President.\n  I urge my colleagues to support moving forward and completing this \nvital legislation. Vote for cloture, vote for jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have had 2 weeks of a lot of \ndiscussion. We haven't had a chance to vote on amendments mostly \nbecause there are some Members who have been objecting to moving \nforward to consideration of amendments. I think that is regrettable.\n  We are now to the point where we are going to have a vote on cloture. \nIt is absolutely necessary. The alternative to this would be an \nextension. Probably 20, 30 different times Members have come in and \nsaid we should have an extension. If we have an extension, we will not \nhave streamlining provisions, and we cannot move on with IPAM. We \ncannot immediately start constructing these roads and bridges.\n  It doesn't make any sense to stall and stall and wait around and do \nnothing. We want to get this bill on the road. That is what we are \ngoing to do, and we are going to do it today.\n  I regret a lot of people who wanted to have amendments considered \nduring the last 2 weeks have not been able to do so. I regret that some \npeople just blocked them from having that opportunity.\n  There have been a lot of objections that have come up on this bill. \nMembers keep talking about the 40-percent increase--40-percent \nincrease. That is 40 percent over 6 years. If you said 6.2 percent for \nthe infrastructure of America that is lagging so far behind, no one \ncould complain about that. They are making it appear this is 40 percent \nin one year. It is not.\n  They are talking about the amount of money in this bill. We have to \nunderstand we have two things we are looking at. One is capital outlay \nand one is obligation limitation. This is a perfectly reasonable \nbill. We have done something that has not been done before. It was not \ndone in 1991, and it was not done in 1998. We have stayed with the \nformula. The alternative is to stay with the formula, like we failed in \nTEA-21 and failed in ISTEA, and we will have to put in a minimum \nguarantee where all you do is pacify some 60 voters by giving them \nwhatever they want in the percentage of the overall, and as to the \nrest, who cares; we have our 60 votes and we run.\n\n  That is not the way we did it this time. For that we have been \npunished. We have had people assail this bill when this is the first \ntime it has been done right.\n  The formulas took into consideration many factors. I know others want \nto be heard. I don't want to use a lot of time. At an appropriate time, \nI am going to go over what went into these formulas. Fast-growing \nStates, slow-growing States, donor States, donee States--all these \nfactors were considered, and then we came up with a formula.\n  Sure, I heard the two Senators from Arizona were complaining they \ndidn't think their State had enough and, at the same time, they were \ncomplaining we were spending too much on the bill. When we look at the \nformula, their State still gets $40 million more than my State of \nOklahoma over 6 years. Any State can complain about how the formula \ncomes out. The bottom line is every State gets a minimum of a 10-\npercent increase. The average is 35.6 percent.\n  It is a good bill. We are going to get cloture. We are going to move \nahead. If there are germane amendments everyone agrees should be \nconsidered, we will consider them. I look forward to doing that. \nCloture is important. We are going to get cloture and bring this step \nto a halt.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nDemocratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a couple of minutes \nto say I hope we can invoke cloture this morning. I think this debate \nhas been less than many of us had hoped. We hoped we could see more \namendments. We hoped we could have a good debate about many of the \nissues.\n  This is a good bill. It will create the jobs that many of us have \ntalked about on this floor for the last couple of weeks. It will create \nperhaps 1 million, 2 million jobs. We have an infrastructure deficit \nthat is growing, and this bill, more than any other bill we will take \nup this year, is going to address that deficit.\n  For a lot of reasons, this represents the commitment and investment \nto infrastructure and our economic growth that I think warrants support \nfor the bill.\n  I am very concerned about where we go from here. The administration \nhas expressed opposition to this legislation. The House has indicated \nthey do not support the approaches that have been reflected in this \nbill, the very delicate balance we have achieved in public transit and \na commitment to highways. I am disappointed we were not able to deal \nwith the railroad question, as Senator Hollings and others noted \nyesterday. The business of completing our work is far from finished.\n  I will put my colleagues on notice that we will not be prepared to \nmove forward to conference until we have a better understanding of the \ndegree to which there is some meeting of the minds on these issues, on \nthe commitment and investment to highways themselves, on a commitment \nto railroads, on a commitment to public transit, on a commitment to a \nbudget that will accommodate the infrastructure deficit we face. We \nwill take conferences one step at a time, and certainly in this case \nthat is all the more imperative.\n  I commend the managers of the bill for the extraordinary \nbipartisanship that was reflected in coming to this point. Senator \nInhofe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Bond, Senator Reid, and others \ndeserve great credit for working as closely together as they have. If \nwe can do that through this whole process, we will have a good result \nat the end. We will have a result that will generate strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I think we will win cloture today in large measure because we have \nbeen able to demonstrate the bipartisanship that has brought us to this \npoint, even with the misgivings I have just articulated. I look forward \nto working with our colleagues in that spirit and fashion and I hope \nthat colleagues on both sides of the aisle will recognize the value of \nthis work product and support cloture this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader for his very \nsolid views. Once again, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, Senator Jeffords and Senator Reid, for working in a bipartisan \nway to produce a bill that is extremely important for the long-term \neconomic growth and well-being of our country.\n  Everybody agrees we need to put much more money into roads, highways, \nbridges, and mass transit. This bill does that. This bill also would \ncreate significant numbers of jobs right away if we get it passed. If \nthis bill passes, 90,000 jobs will be created this year. For every \nbillion dollars spent on highways, it creates 47,500 jobs.\n  There are some on our side of the aisle and some others who have \nsaid, well, this bill is too much. The President has recommended $256 \nbillion in obligation limits. Obligation limits are what is spent under \nthe bill. The contract authority is authorizing language that allows \nspending up to the higher amount. That is subject to the normal process \nin appropriations and subject to limits imposed by the budget on \ntransportation.\n  This bill is at $290 billion. The President was at $256 billion. I \nbelieve clearly they have indicated there has to be negotiations. There \nhave to be negotiations with the House. Whatever bill we pass is going \nto be changed because we have to negotiate with the House. Obviously we \nwant to hear the concerns of the White House so we can develop a bill \nthat will be signed by them. We did not go through this drill for over \na year not to get something through. Make no mistake about it, this is \nthe last and only chance to get started on the kind of major \nconstruction we need on highways, roads, and bridges this year, and to \ndo what is needed for mass transit this year. If we do not invoke \ncloture and pass this bill this week, there will be no highway bill. We \nwill be stuck at the old level at best, even if we get an extension, \nand that extension does not do us any good. That extension does not \nincrease the building of roads and does not increase the assistance for \nmass transit that is so important.\n  There will be amendments. We look forward to having healthy debates. \nI am sure after people have rested up for almost 2 weeks they will have \nlots of good ideas. We look forward to having a busy day, but we cannot \nwork on this bill unless we invoke cloture. Whatever the Senate \ndecides, we will take that to conference. We need to pass this bill. I \nbelieve this is going to be the most important economic development \nbill and job-creating bill in this session of Congress.\n  Furthermore, it is, as its title says, a major contribution to safety \non our highways. The administration has named it SAFETEA and we have \nincluded almost all of their safety proposals in this bill. Having \ntraveled the roads of Missouri and traveled the two-lane highways that \nare marked with white crosses where somebody's family member, \nsomebody's friend, somebody's spouse has died, because there is too \nmuch traffic on a two-lane road and somebody has taken a chance, \nfatalities result. They passed where they should not have. They had \ngotten out of their lane. That is why we have four-lane highways. We do \nnot have them in Missouri.\n  There are many provisions that are going to be important for this \nNation. I know the distinguished President pro tempore has a proposal \nto help connect communities in Alaska that have not been connected by \nroads. I believe that is a high-priority item. There are many other \npriority items that must be dealt with in this bill.\n\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's invoke \ncloture; let's get about the business of voting on amendments. We are \nready and open for business, but we will have to negotiate with the \nHouse and the White House before we bring back a final version, which I \nhope can be passed very shortly, perhaps by the end of the month, to \nget highway construction going, improve safety, and improve the job \nsituation in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is one minute and 55 seconds on the \nmajority side and one minute and 42 seconds on the minority side.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know we have a couple of minutes \nremaining. This morning we have covered some of the arguments that have \nbeen made over the last 2 weeks. There are some aspects that have not \nbeen talked about. I do think we should compliment the Finance \nCommittee. They have taken a lot of heat. They have taken a lot of \ncriticism--unjustly, I might add. We made a request of them when we \ncame up with this bill, at the figures we had in both capital outlay \nand obligation limitation. We asked Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley \nif they could come up with the amount of money to do this so it will \ncomply with what the President outlined when he said he did not want a \ntax increase, he did not want to go into deficit or have it come out of \nthe general fund, and they have done that. They have been criticized on \nthis floor.\n  I do know this, that the highway trust fund has been raided for \nyears, and we are now in a position where we can correct and rectify \nthat problem. I think this is one of the good things that has come out \nof this bill, and I applaud the Finance Committee for the work they \nhave done.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. The \nminority has one minute remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield back our time, through the \nChair.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back. Under the \nprevious order, the hour of 9 a.m. having arrived, the Senate will \nproceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on amendment No. \n2285.\n  Under the previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     substitute to Calendar No. 426, S. 1072, a bill to authorize \n     funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and \n     transit programs, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, James M.

Mr. President, I rise to offer amendment No. 2388 and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Kyl, Mr. Levin, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. McCain, Ms. \n     Stabenow, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2388 to amendment No. 2285.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 139 of title 23, United States Code, as added by \n     section 1201 of the amendment--\n       (1) strike ``Set-aside.--'' in subsection (b)(2) and insert \n     ``Funding.--'';\n       (2) strike ``of the amounts made available'' in subsection \n     (b)(2) and insert ``the amounts made available'';\n       (3) strike ``$439,000,000'' in subsection (b)(2);\n       (4) strike ``allocated'' in subsection (c)(1)(A) and insert \n     ``apportioned'';\n       (5) strike ``subsection (d).'' in subsection (c)(1)(B) and \n     insert ``subsection (e).'';\n       (6) redesignate subsections (d) and (e) as subsections (e) \n     and (f), respectively, and insert the following after \n     subsection (c):\n       ``(d) Distribution of Funds.--\n       ``(1) Infrastructure performance and maintenance program \n     distribution.--Notwithstanding section 1101(13) of the Safe, \n     Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity \n     Act of 2004, and in lieu of the amounts authorized by that \n     section, there are authorized to be appropriated out of the \n     Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) for \n     carrying out the infrastructure performance and maintenance \n     program under this section--\n       ``(A) $2,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 and \n     2005; and\n       ``(B) $1,750,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006, 2007, \n     and 2008.\n       ``(2) Equity distribution.--On October 1 of each fiscal \n     year, the Secretary shall reserve a sufficient amount of the \n     funding available to carry out this section to provide a \n     final equity adjustment, after making the apportionment under \n     section 105 of this title, for each State to increase the \n     percentage return for all highway apportionments, as compared \n     to the tax payments attributable to the States paid into the \n     Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account), \n     to--\n       ``(A) for fiscal year 2005, 91 percent;\n       ``(B) for fiscal year 2006, 92 percent;\n       ``(C) for fiscal year 2007, 93 percent;\n       ``(D) for fiscal year 2008, 94 percent; and\n       ``(e) for fiscal year 2009, 95 percent.\n       ``(3)(E) Remainder distribution.--On October 1 of each \n     fiscal year, the Secretary shall apportion the funds \n     available for allocation under this section among the several \n     States, after the application of paragraph (1), according to \n     the ratio that--\n       ``(1) the percentage of tax payments attributable to \n     highway users in each State paid into the Highway Trust Fund \n     (other than the Mass Transit Account), bears to\n       ``(2) 100 percent of tax payments attributable to highway \n     users in all States paid into the Highway Trust Fund (other \n     than the Mass Transit Account).''; and\n       (7) strike subsection (e), as redesignated, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(e) Redistribution of Allocated Funds and Obligation \n     Authority.--On the date that is 180 days after the date of \n     apportionment, or as soon thereafter as practicable, for each \n     fiscal year, the Secretary shall--\n       ``(1) withdraw--\n       ``(A) any funds allocated to a State under this section \n     that remain unobligated; and\n       ``(B) an equal amount of obligation authority provided for \n     the use of the funds in accordance with section 1101(a)(13) \n     of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \n     Transportation Equity Act of 2003; and\n       ``(2) reallocate the funds and redistribute the obligation \n     authority to those States that--\n       ``(A) have fully obligated all amounts allocated under this \n     section for the fiscal year; and\n       ``(B) demonstrate that the State is able to obligate \n     additional amounts for projects eligible under this section \n     before the end of the fiscal year.\n       ``(f) Application With Section 105.--Notwithstanding \n     section 105(a)(2)(H) of this title, section 105(a) shall not \n     apply to funds apportioned under this section.''.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2591 To Amendment No. 2388\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhoff] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2591 to amendment No. 2388.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n       ``Sec.   . This section shall take effect one day after \n     enactment of this Act.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the importance of \namendment No. 2388 without the second degree. It is a very important \ntime for us to start treating our States more equitably and this bill--\nI am sorry to say--is a step backward.\n  TEA-21 embraced as its simple goal the elimination of redistribution \nof highway funds based on political considerations. For example, under \nthe 1998 bill, Texas' rate of return rose from 77 percent to 90 percent \nin the formula programs. This means that for every dollar a Texas \ngasoline purchaser sent to Washington, we got 90 cents back on the \ndollar. So we contributed 10 percent of our revenue to other States. \nAll of the donor States in TEA-21 were raised to the 90.5 percent \nlevel. There has never been a time when we have treated donor States \ndifferently from one another until this year.\n  The bill before us creates a new superdonor status. Growing States \nand big States, such as California, Texas, Florida, and some smaller \nStates, such as Colorado and Arizona that are also rapidly growing, are \nlocked into superdonor status, still sending nearly 10 percent of our \nhighway funds that we need even more because we are fast growing.\n  My State is facing budget deficits and is trying to make those up so \nwe can spend the money we need to fix our highways. Our States are \nrapidly growing, and yet we are continuing to be asked to send 10 \npercent of our highway funds to other States. We are the States that \nneed the most new infrastructure, because we are experiencing the \ngreatest population growth.\n  My amendment would correct a small part of this glaring inequity. It \nwould take $9 billion from the nebulous IPAM account and redirect it to \nthe States that need it the most. Basically what you would do is take \nthe IPAM account, which contains projects chosen on the basis of \nfavoritism, and put that into the formula so that everyone is on a more \nlevel playing field.\n  It is not a level playing field. Neither my State nor any other donor \nState will come out of donor status under this amendment. But it will \nprovide gradual relief for these States to begin to work up to that 95 \ncent rate of return over the course of the bill.\n  Under my amendment, all States would receive a minimum of 91 cents on \nthe dollar in fiscal year 2005, and that minimum would rise 1 percent \neach year until 2009. My amendment would guarantee more money for every \nState. It would not reduce any State's formula percentage. It would not \nreduce any State's formula income by a penny. It simply distributes \nunallocated funds already in the bill, not increasing the bill, not \nlowering any State's income level. But instead distributing that money \nby projects, it will create a much fairer formula-based system.\n  For 50 years, the Federal aid highway program and the States have \nmaintained one of the world's finest highway networks. Highways are the \nfirst choice to transport most of the goods\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\nthat drive our economy. The majority of that system was designed in the \n1950s to help a rapidly growing Nation to connect to new population \ncenters, especially in the West.\n  Today there are other critical needs to be addressed. We are not in \nthe 1950s. We are in another century, and we have new problems. One of \nthose is the trade that has been created by NAFTA. That is not a \nproblem, except that it has increased the highway needs in the States \nthat have the corridors from Mexico to Canada. NAFTA has provided huge \nnational benefits. The resulting traffic is crippling to our Nation's \ninfrastructure. Early on smaller States and Western States needed extra \nhelp from larger and more established States such as Texas. Today the \nreverse is true.\n\n  The funding inequity is increasing at a time when States are growing \nmore equal in their abilities to contribute and our levels of existing \ninfrastructure among the States are much more similar.\n  In the name of fairness, why don't we go to a strict formula system \nthat will increase everyone's part of the pie on a more equitable basis \nthan when 100 Senators from 50 States go in a room and start trying to \ndivide the funding themselves, knowing that some States are going to be \nleft out, and some States are not going to be fairly treated? Why not \nmake it fair from the beginning?\n  My home State of Texas has borne the greatest burden over the life of \nthe Federal aid highway program. Since 1956, Texas has contributed over \n$5 billion more to the program than we have received back in funds to \nbuild and repair our own highways. Each and every year Texas has sent \nmore highway funding to Washington than it has received to cover \nprojects in our State.\n  Texas has more than 300,000 highway miles, the most of any State in \nour Nation. Our highways make up almost 8 percent of the total national \nmileage and 7 percent of interstates. As a result, the over 20 million \npeople of Texas necessarily buy more gasoline and contribute more to \nthe highway trust fund financed by the gasoline tax.\n  In the past 12 years, Texas and other donor States have made good \nprogress. In 1998, Texas received only a 77-cent return on every dollar \nsent to Washington, a loss of $1.7 billion. Current law guarantees us \n90.5 cents on the dollar, but this is still $2.6 billion less than the \ncontribution we make. This is a significant loss to a State that needs \nthe infrastructure improvement to take on the added traffic caused by \nNAFTA.\n  The minimum guarantee applies only to formula funding programs and \ndoes not restrict funds distributed through earmarks or by the \nadministration in the underlying bill. Though we had hoped for more \nequality this year, and we hoped for the minimum of 95 cents return on \nevery dollar we send to Washington, it has not happened.\n  Of course, I hope the chairman and the committee understand I could \nnot possibly support a highway funding formula so contrary to the needs \nof my home State. We are the biggest loser in this bill, to be sure.\n  I am also concerned about the precedent it sets to create a \nsuperdonor status for the largest, fastest growing States in our \ncountry. This is not a good precedent for a United States that is \nsupposed to be one United States.\n  Our States are much more equal now in ability to contribute and pay \nfor their own services. This is no longer a situation where we have \nvast amounts of western land that have no roads and no infrastructure. \nSo I hope we will not set a precedent of a superdonor State category \nwhere we take the largest, fastest growing States and treat them even \nworse than they have been treated before and for so long.\n  The bill before us distributes $227 billion in highway funds using a \nformula that will hold six States--Texas, California, Arizona, \nColorado, Florida, and Maryland--at this 90.5 percent rate of return \nfor 5 years. Only in the sixth and final year does the level increase \nto 95 cents. If Texas were to receive 95 cents for all 6 years, the \nformula would provide Texas hundreds of millions of additional dollars \nover this period. But the amendment I have pending today does not even \ntry to make up this discrepancy. What we are trying to do is increase \njust the rate of return 1 percent per year, starting at 91 cents, and \nreaching 95 cents in the last year. It is, I think, a reasonable \ncompromise. It is fair to every State. It increases every State's take \nin this bill, and it will set a precedent of fairer distribution, even \nthough there will still be many donee States that will get more than \nthey send to Washington.\n  The superdonor States have one aspect in common: They are the fastest \ngrowing States in America. But the formula in the bill offers the least \nrelief to the States whose needs are most pronounced: the States and \ncities with populations that are developing most rapidly. Three of \nthese six are also on the Southwest border, so we have the added burden \nof infrastructure needs brought on by NAFTA.\n  In 2002, Texas contributed 9.11 percent of the total dollars in the \ntrust fund, up from 8.27 percent 4 years earlier. Buying more gas \nallows us to contribute more funds. That is why when the distinguished \nchairman of the committee says, ``But you are getting more money than \nthe spending increases in this bill,'' I have to say, yes, but that is \nbecause we are contributing more. We are still getting less in return \nthan the other donor States that are going to be raised to a higher \nlevel at an earlier time.\n  So, yes, we are getting more than the 36 percent increase in spending \nin the bill--I am told we are getting 42 percent--but what we are \ncontributing is far more than the 42 percent growth we would be \nreceiving. It is an enormous loss to Texas over the period of this \nbill; that amount could go a long way toward alleviating the huge \ntraffic jams we are facing on our major NAFTA corridors.\n  Eighty percent of NAFTA traffic travels through my home State of \nTexas. And while the entire Nation benefits from that resulting \ncommerce, Texas bears the brunt of maintenance and upkeep on our \nhighways. In 2002, over 4 million trucks hauling 18 billion pounds of \ncargo entered from Mexico through 24 commercial border crossing \nfacilities. Over 3 million of those trucks--or 68 percent--entered \nthrough Texas. In addition to commercial traffic, 90 million personal \nvehicles from Mexico also traveled through the southwest border States.\n\n  So Texas, with its increased infrastructure burden, is getting a \nlower percentage of what it sends to Washington than almost all of the \nother States. I hope we don't break precedent and create this new \nstepchild in donor States because I know if we see it go through today, \nwe will see it again in every formula. So the inequity in formula \nfunding for Texas, California, and Florida will be imprinted on every \nformula we have in our system. This is a terrible precedent for a \ncountry that calls itself the United States of America.\n  To its credit, the committee did, for the first time, create a border \nand corridor fund that reflects the added burden on the States on our \nnorthern border with Canada and southern border with Mexico. I commend \nthe chairman and thank him for adding those funds. However, I have to \nsay the $1 billion for each of those funds, when Texas gets its \nportion, will still not bring us anywhere close to a fair share or \nmatch the amount we are losing by not being treated like other donor \nStates. The superdonor category just sets a terrible precedent.\n  I would love to take the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember to Interstate 35. Interstate 35 goes from the border of Mexico \nup through Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas. I had the unfortunate \nexperience of driving from Austin to Dallas one evening, and it was a \nparking lot. It took us longer to drive from Austin to Dallas--almost 6 \nhours--than it does to fly from Washington, DC, to California. It is \nridiculous. It is a parking lot because of the added traffic from \nMexico that comes through this very important NAFTA corridor.\n  I know small States have more voting power in the Senate. I also \nunderstand small States have traditionally had a larger piece of the \nfunding pie than larger States. However, I have to say I think the \nconcept of donor/donee States should go by the wayside, in a gradual \nmanner, because States are much more equal in their capacity to pay \nthan ever before, and some of these larger States on the border have a \nreal and huge infrastructure need due to NAFTA traffic.\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\n  I see my distinguished colleague from Arizona is in the Chamber. He \nwishes to speak on the bill and on my amendment as well. I am going to \nyield the floor, but first it is my great hope that the Senate will not \ntake the unprecedented move of creating superdonor States that are in \nfact the stepchildren of America. Creating such an inequity says, \n``because you are bigger, you should pay more,'' without considering \nyou are sending more to Washington, you are in a crunch from the NAFTA \ntraffic that is coming through your State, you have extra needs, you \nare a large, growing State, and you are being asked to take a 10 \npercent deficit on the funding you send to Washington despite all these \nreasons.''\n  It is time for the Senate to step up to the plate and say that we \nshould not have stepchildren in formula funding. This is a new concept. \nIn the past, the donor status has been shared by 20 to 25 States. So \nthe cost of helping smaller States has been less of a burden. It is no \nlonger fair to have such a disadvantage, and it is especially not right \nwhen many of these border States have greater infrastructure needs.\n  When we were trying to help the West, Texas stepped up to the plate, \nas other States did. Now it is time to help the States that have the \nfastest growing populations and the greatest infrastructure needs and \nnot to put them in a stepchild status for our country that calls itself \nthe United States of America.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield to the distinguished senior Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The senior Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment being offered by the Senator from Texas. Her eloquent \nexplanation of the amendment is very compelling.\n  Let me go back to the larger issue. It is fascinating to me that \nafter receiving a Statement of Administration Policy where the \nPresident of the United States says:\n\n       In total the Senate bill authorizes $318 billion in \n     spending on highways, highway safety, and mass transit . . . \n     a full $62 billion above the President's request for the same \n     period. . . .\n       Accordingly, if legislation that violates these principles \n     (such as this legislation, which authorizes $318 billion) \n     were presented to the President, his senior advisors would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  There was discussion amongst Republican Senators yesterday that we \nwill fix it in conference. I have this quaint and unusual idea that \nwhen we are authorizing $256 billion or $318 billion, maybe the whole \nSenate ought to be involved rather than ``fixing it'' in conference.\n  I cannot speak for my friends on the other side of the aisle--they \nare the opposition party--but how does this party, the party of fiscal \nsanity, the party of smaller Government, the party of lower taxes, the \nparty that insisted that any revenues to fund highways should come out \nof the trust fund, now support a bill--according to the last vote--\noverwhelmingly when the President of the United States and the American \npeople are saying ``enough.'' Enough deficit spending, my friends. \nEnough. We are mortgaging our children's futures.\n\n  We just found out we have been sold a bill of goods on the Medicare \nprescription drug bill. It is $153 billion more than it was advertised \nto be a few months ago. When does it stop? When does the Republican \nParty find its soul? And this bill is an outrageous manifestation of \nhow badly we have left our moorings. The amendment of the Senator from \nTexas at least restores some equity and fairness to this proposal.\n  I don't want to take too much more time except to mention one other \npoint about the President's message:\n\n       In addition, the Administration opposes inclusion in a \n     surface transportation bill of unrelated provisions regarding \n     Amtrak. Any legislation regarding the future of Amtrak should \n     be considered separately and should provide for meaningful \n     reforms. . . .\n\n  What is interesting about that aspect of the President's message is, \nas chairman of the Commerce Committee, none of the provisions that the \nadministration objects to came out of the Commerce Committee, the \nauthorizing committee. It was stuck in by the managers of the bill who \nhave about as much knowledge, expertise, and jurisdiction over Amtrak \nas I do over nuclear science.\n  It is fascinating the overreach of this bill. They add provisions for \nAmtrak that have nothing to do with their area of jurisdiction, and \nwhat we reported out of the Commerce Committee was not objectionable to \nthe administration.\n  Finally, this whole formula is just crazy. It is bizarre and \nbyzantine. In TEA-21, there was an immediate increase in the highway \nformula to provide each State a minimum return of 85 percent to 90.5 \npercent. The very first year of the authorization period, all donor \nStates received an immediate increase. It has still not been explained \nto me or any of my colleagues why we should wait 5 years before our \nshare increases. Why should we wait 5 years? It is patently unfair, and \nit is patently abusive, particularly for those of us who represent \nStates that are dramatically growing in population, which means that \nour needs, obviously, are greater.\n  I make no argument that my State deserves more, not in any way. I say \nthe citizens of my State deserve $1 back for every dollar they sent in \nthe form of taxes to the Federal Government.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have said on this floor on a number of \noccasions how the chairman and ranking member of the full committee and \nhow the subcommittee chair and the ranking member of the subcommittee \nhave worked together for more than a year to come up with a program \nthat we thought would be the most fair for this country.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona for whom I have the deepest respect, \nand my friend from Texas for whom I also have great affection, in years \npast we did not go through the turmoil of coming up with 95 percent for \nall States. In years past we just decided how many votes it would take \nto get a bill passed. Some States did very poorly.\n  When I started in this process, some States got less than 80 cents' \nreturn on every dollar. It was moved up to 80, then 85, then 90.5. We \nhave taken this gigantic first step from the last bill, which had no \nincrease, for 95 cents for every State. It is a remarkably fair, good \nway of doing business.\n  I say to my two friends--I acknowledge it is imperfect--but we have \nhad people who have run on computers numerous other programs to try to \ncome up with something that would satisfy the needs of this country. \nHow would the State of Alaska like it if for every dollar they paid \ninto the highway trust fund they got $1 back? Alaska would suffer. The \nState of Alaska, which has such tremendous, important needs and has \nweather conditions that make road construction and road rehabilitation \nextremely expensive, could not survive with a return of $1 for every $1 \nthey paid in.\n  My friends have indicated that would be the fair thing to do: For \nevery dollar a State puts in, they get a dollar back. It doesn't work.\n  Yesterday, the distinguished senior Senator from Wyoming spoke. \nWyoming is a perfect example of a State that cannot survive on dollar \nfor dollar. What we have done is taken into consideration in this \nformula States, such as Wyoming and Alaska, and made sure they get more \nthan $1. If some States get more than $1, some States are going to have \nto get less than $1. That is the way it is.\n  These big States--Texas, which has two votes in this body; Florida, \nwhich has two votes in this body; California, which has two votes in \nthis body--we could have made it so that all States got 95 percent \nexcept States with populations of more than 15 million people. That \nwould have been easy. We would have lost six votes. We could have still \npassed this bill.\n  We thought in fairness that those large States should also get 95 \ncents on the dollar, and we have done that. I think this is fair and \nreasonable, and I commend and applaud my colleagues on this committee.\n  We have a diverse group of Senators on this committee. We were able, \nworking for more than 1 year, to come up with a formula that met the \nneeds of this country to the best of our ability. To come in at this \nlate date and say:\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\nWe have a better formula, we have worked on it the last week, and your \nwork the past year does not mean much, and let's have the State of \nAlaska get a dollar back for what they pay in, the State of Wyoming get \na dollar back for what they pay in, and everybody will be happy and we \ncan go home--what we have done has been extremely fair.\n  I hope the Senate will respond as they did with this cloture vote. \nThis is a resounding vote that we had this morning because the Senators \nrecognized by a vote of 86 to 11 that what we have done is appropriate.\n  There are very few measures that come before this body that get a \nvote like this: 86 to 11. I think that represents fairness in this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield to me for a comment, \nthrough him, that is a correction?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will yield for 1 minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, I was incorrect in my \ncomments concerning the Amtrak provisions. These were provisions that I \nopposed in the bill and I was incorrect when I stated that they were \nput in by the committee. My apologies to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am going to withhold commenting on \nthis amendment because I have made notes. I know it was not \ndeliberately misrepresented, but the information is not accurate that \nwe have heard on this amendment. It is very important that everyone \nknow that, but I would rather have everyone vent everything they want \nto vent.\n  I wish to make one comment, first, though. The Senator from Nevada \npointed out what we could have done with the six fastest growing \nStates, the largest States. We could have lost six votes and never even \nlooked back. That is exactly what happened 6 years ago. They went into \na minimum guarantee program where they were counting votes. It was \ntotally political and that is what we are getting away from. We have a \ngood formula. I will defend that momentarily after we hear from \neveryone who is speaking in support of this flawed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, this bill contains a very carefully \ncrafted formula. This committee worked for close to a year to develop \nthe formula contained in S. 1072. Balance, that is what this bill is \nabout. The donor States such as Texas have gained 95 percent. That has \nbeen their goal for 6 years. Some would say for longer. Now they have \nachieved their goal and they are still complaining.\n  This formula is fair. The formula the Senator from Texas put forward \nwould undermine the highway program in many States and therefore I \noppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas, and I will explain a couple of reasons for that. \nFirst, there has been a suggestion to the States that did not receive \ntheir full share of funding, the fast growing States--California, \nTexas, Florida, Arizona, Colorado primarily--that there just was not \nenough money to be able to bring those States up to the same level as \nthe other States.\n  There is an acknowledgment that a lot of other States get to the 95-\ncent level long before these five States do. That is the primary reason \nfor the deficiency. In fact, as my colleagues can see from this chart, \nArizona is in the dark blue, and we have simply selected a State--and I \ndo not mean to pick on my colleagues from this particular State because \nthere are others that reveal the same kind of thing--this happens to be \nthe State of Missouri. We can see that beginning in the very first \nyear, Missouri is returned 95 cents for every dollar. That is \nguaranteed to the State of Missouri all the way across from the very \nbeginning. Whereas in my home State of Arizona, we are stuck at the \ncurrent level of 90.5 cents in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. It goes up \none- or two-tenths of a percent in 2008. It is not until the sixth \nyear, if the funding is available, that Arizona, as well as these other \ndonor States that I mentioned, would be brought up to the same level \nthat all the other States have been at all this time.\n  In the case of Arizona, the lost revenue during this period of time \nis about $160 million. So that is money Arizona would have received had \nit been treated the same as Missouri in terms of the 95 cents received \nper dollar.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is quite right that when there are States \nthat need more than a dollar, then there are going to be States that do \nnot get a dollar for every dollar in taxes that they send in. That is, \nof course, true. Under the Federal system I think there is an \nacknowledgment that it is not totally unfair that some States are going \nto send more in in gasoline taxes than other States. When it is way out \nof balance and the balance can be corrected, it ought to be corrected.\n  The argument has been that it would simply have cost too much money \nto bring States such as Arizona up to this level. I think it would only \ncost $2 billion. In any event, the Senator from Texas distributes $9 \nbillion over this period of time and makes these States whole.\n  One place that the $9 billion could have come from, had they wanted \nto, is the set-aside program in the committee-reported bill for \nsomething called the Infrastructure Performance and Management Program. \nThe IPAM is a--I do not want to call it a slush fund but it is a source \nof funding that is very unclear about where it is going to be spent.\n  Very little is known about the purpose of such a program, although \nthere are some who believe that it basically will be used to distribute \nto folks who vote for the bill and whose vote is needed for the bill \nand that the money, therefore, needs to be held in reserve in order to \nensure that in the end they will have enough money to do all that they \nwant to do. Why not use that money to bring the States such as Arizona, \nCalifornia, Texas, and those other States up to this 95-cent level? It \nis more than enough to do that.\n  So when they say there is not enough money to do what we are \ncomplaining needs to be done, that is simply incorrect. There is enough \nmoney. It just needs to be moved from this one program, which does not \nseem to have a very clear or fair purpose, and move it over to fund \nthis deficiency.\n  I have just used the State of Arizona with another State that is \nsomewhat comparable, in terms of size and so on, to illustrate the \npoint, but I think the same can be demonstrated for the other States \ninvolved. That is why I support the amendment of the Senator from Texas \nbecause what it would do is restore this funding level so that from the \nvery beginning all of the States would be treated the same.\n  Now, that can be done at whatever level of spending one wants to do \nit. I believe that the level of spending should be much less than the \nlevel in the bill. The President believes it should be much less than \nis in the bill. The President believes that the total amount should be \n$256 billion. That ought to be enough. That is a 21-percent increase. \nThat is what I think. Whatever the level of spending in the bill, it \nshould be fair as between the States.\n  Not all States can be treated exactly the same. We understand that. \nAt least it is fair to have a base level. I will give credit to the \nchairman of the committee and others; they wanted to get this base \nlevel at 95 cents and they got there for most of the States but they \ndid not get there for five or six of the States. My State happens to be \none of them. It is not fair to the citizens of Arizona.\n  As a result, I support the amendment because it would bring this \nlevel up to 95 cents for the entire period of time we are talking \nabout, not only in the very last year. I urge my colleagues to support \nfairness and to support the amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I, too, support the amendment of the \nsenior Senator from Texas. As a member of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, it has been my privilege to work with the Senator from \nOklahoma as the chairman and the Senator from Vermont as the ranking \nmember.\n  While admittedly I was not satisfied with the formula that came out \nof the\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\ncommittee, based on my belief and the good faith of the chairman and \nothers, we have been discussing ways that we could make this bill \nfairer to my State. The reason I support this amendment is because I \nbelieve it would do that--not just to the State of Texas but to also \nother what I would call superdonor States such as Florida, California, \nArizona, Texas, Colorado, and Maryland.\n  As the Senator from Arizona says, it is a matter of fundamental \nfairness. Texas contributes a dollar to the gas tax and, all things \nconsidered, currently gets back about 88 cents on the dollar. In fact, \nI have had some of my legislators come to see me and say that our \ntransportation needs are so great in Texas, given our size, given the \n10-year lifespan of NAFTA, increased truck traffic on our highways, \nthat we would just simply like to be able to keep that dollar in Texas, \nspend it on our own roads and not send it to Washington, DC, and have \n10 or 12 cents taken off that dollar and the remainder simply sent back \nto us. I understand this is a national transportation system we are \ntrying to take care of here. But I believe Texas, and I believe all of \nthe superdonor States, the ones that contribute the lion's share for \ntransportation needs in this country, are entitled to greater \nconsideration than is currently reflected in the formula.\n\n  I think the senior Senator, Senator Hutchison, has come up with a \ngood idea on how to do that, by using the $9.1 billion that is \ncurrently not distributed, which I understand remains in a \ndiscretionary spending account which can later be doled out. In other \nwords, this will not add to the cost of this bill. It is money that is \nalready figured into the bill but will simply be distributed according \nto the formula which she has already laid out, and which I think will \nnot only result in greater fairness to my State but also to other \nStates.\n  In the end, this does not just benefit the superdonor States--\nFlorida, Maryland, Arizona, Texas, Colorado. Indeed, under this \namendment every State would end up with more money, so I think every \nState would win.\n  If I can say a couple of more words, though, about the unusual \nposture of my State when it comes to the transportation dollars. As I \nmentioned earlier, NAFTA is a big consideration. Obviously, for the 10 \nyears NAFTA has been in effect, it has resulted in tremendous increases \nin trade and benefits to Americans, to Mexicans, and to Canadians. It \nhas raised the level of the water and all boats have risen. Because of \nthe increased trade, more products from our country were bought in \nMexico and Canada, and vice versa.\n  One of the things we are concerned about--we will have a hearing on \nit today in the Judiciary Committee--is our broken immigration system. \nOne of the best ways I believe we can deal with the causes of illegal \nimmigration is to increase trade with Mexico, for example, so the \nprosperity of that country will increase, jobs will increase, so people \nfeel less and less need to immigrate illegally to this country to \nprovide for their own families.\n  My point is this. Because of our proximity to the border, because we \nhave a 1,200-mile border, because of the number of border crossings we \nhave, Texas transportation infrastructure has simply borne a \ndisproportionate amount of the burden, from which eventually all of the \ncountry benefits because of this increase in trade and truck traffic I \nmentioned a moment ago. As a matter of fairness to Arizona, which is in \na similar situation, and Texas, our infrastructure has degenerated. It \nhas been overused, in a sense. The public safety has suffered because \nwe have simply been a donor State and have not been getting back enough \nof the gas tax dollar to help provide for our transportation needs in \nthe State.\n  As I say, as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nand the Transportation Subcommittee, I continue to hope--not just hope \nbut also will work toward trying to make this bill acceptable and fair. \nIt is certainly something I hope I will be able to support in the end. \nBut I do think the proposal of the senior Senator, resulting as it will \nin a greater distribution of discretionary funds now into a formula \nthat will then result in all States seeing an increase in \ntransportation funds, is a step in the right direction.\n  Finally, I would like to allude for a moment to the comments of \nSenator Kyl relative to the cost of this bill. I, too, believe in \nfiscal responsibility. I don't know ultimately how the Finance \nCommittee will find a way to pay for this bill in its entirety. I think \nit is clear the President is not going to go for either a gas tax or \nfor deficit spending. But should the overall amount of money be reduced \nfrom the current level to a lower level that would not require an \nincrease in the gas tax or an increase in deficit spending, then my \nunderstanding is essentially the formulas we are looking at right now \nare out the window and we are going to have to look to ways to live \nwithin our means. But also, at the same time, we have to make sure this \nbill is fair to all States, particularly, I submit, the donor States \nthat for a long time have paved roads and provided transit systems in \nother parts of the country from which the citizens of my State get no \nbenefit. That is a matter of fundamental fairness we need to take care \nof. I believe this bill, with this amendment, would go a long way to \ndoing just that.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I hope very much our colleagues will \nalso listen to the arguments against the second-degree amendment and \nfor this amendment. I know the committee tried very hard to balance \nwhat they considered to be every State's wishes and needs, but they \nhave made a major precedent-setting change in the business of the \nSenate by creating a new stepchild category for superdonor States.\n  They picked States that have other huge problems such as high growth \nand falling median incomes. Targeting these high-growth, large States \nthat have huge infrastructure problems and other problems that go with \nbeing on the border with another country is a major step in the wrong \ndirection.\n\n  I hope the chairman will reconsider. That is not likely right now, \nbut we have been trying to work with the chairman to see if there could \nbe some accommodation that would acknowledge the huge infrastructure \nneeds of these superdonor States created in this bill. I hope the \nSenate does not do this in the end. In our amendment every State comes \nout better. It will create a more level playing field. The existing \nbill is not a level playing field by any stretch of the imagination.\n  We are trying to gradually raise the percentage that every State will \nbe able to get when we are sending more to Washington than we receive \nin return. Our amendment simply assures that every State will get at \nleast 91 cents back from what it sends to Washington next year; the \nyear after that, 92 cents; the year after that, 93 cents; and the year \nafter that, 94 cents, until all the donor States reach 95. It would be \na gradual increase to 95. If we went to 95 immediately, it would \ndeliver even more to Texas. We are not trying to do that. We are trying \nto enact a modest increase aimed at a more equitable donor status.\n  We will never get $1 back for what we send to Washington in this bill \nor in this environment. My hope, of course, is that at some point we \nwill, that at some point other States will step up to the plate and \nsay: We can bear our fair share and we do not need other States to pay \nour costs. That is not the case today.\n  This amendment is a measured approach. Every State gets more under \nthis amendment. Alabama will receive $125 million more under this \namendment than they would under the committee bill before the Senate; \nAlaska, $13 million; Arizona, $216 million; Arkansas, $84 million; \nCalifornia, $1.30 billion; Colorado, $178 million; Connecticut, $66 \nmillion; Delaware, $16 million; the District of Columbia, $7 million.\n  All of these are increases in what these States will receive under my \namendment over 6 years: Florida, $481 million; Georgia, $288 million; \nHawaii, $15 million; Idaho, $35 million; Illinois,\n\n[[Page S1204]]\n\n$460 million more; Indiana, $291 million more; Iowa, $120 million more; \nKansas, $68 million more; Kentucky, $142 million more; Louisiana, $12 \nmillion more; Maine, $40 million more; Maryland, $164 million more. \nMassachusetts, $119 million more; Michigan, $337 million more; \nMinnesota, $217 million more; Mississippi, $96 million more; Missouri, \n$188 million more; Montana, $28 million more; Nebraska, $48 million \nmore; Nevada, $64 million more; New Hampshire, $29 million more; and \nNew Jersey, $265 million more.\n  Every State comes out better. It is more equitable and it takes out a \nlot of the politics. Senators who end up voting against my amendment \nthink they will do better by divvying up a $9 billion pot into specific \nprojects in their States, but all 100 Senators cannot come out winners \nthat way. I would rather see us respond in a statesmanlike way, divide \nall of the money by formula, and give every State a more equitable \nportion. Every State will be helped and that is how our country should \noperate, with greater equity and a more level playing field.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. What is the Senator seeking the yeas and nays \non at this time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I seek the yeas and nays on my amendment, and I seek \nthe yeas and nays on the second-degree amendment, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is only in order at this time to ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nvote on her amendment. I believe it takes unanimous consent. And I ask \nfor the yeas and nays, not a vote. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking consent to request the \nyeas and nays on the first-degree amendment?\n  Mr. REID. The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to it being in order to \nrequest the yeas and nays on that amendment at this time?\n  Without objection, the Senator may request the yeas and nays.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me make a parliamentary inquiry. I was trying to \nget the yeas and nays on the underlying amendment, but I need the \nparliamentary way to get there, which I think both Senator Reid and \nSenator Inhofe are trying to help do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consent has been granted for the Senators to \nseek the yeas and nays. Does the Senator seek the yeas and nays?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I seek consent to ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered on the first-degree amendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Texas, do you \nhave others who want to speak on behalf of your amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right.\n  First of all, I recognize we are not objecting to a rollcall vote \nlike some have been doing all week long.\n  I make a couple of comments about this because it has been \ninadvertently misrepresented. Let me talk a little bit about the States \nof Texas and Arizona. We have talked about this before. Arizona has a \n40 percent growth rate, dramatically greater than the average, which is \n35.6 percent. Arizona is comparable to Oklahoma in many ways. But \nArizona actually gets $40 million more than my State of Oklahoma.\n  If we average that amount over TEA-21, it averaged $463 million. It \ngoes up to $800 million at the end of this time and it reaches the \ndonor status that is desired. In the State of Texas, the average over \nthe 6-year period of TEA-21 was $2.1 million. It is the third highest \ngrowth rate in the Nation. It is the second highest amount of money, \nsecond only to California. It is part of the formula.\n  Let me say something about the formula. Everyone is deriding this \nformula. We went through the same thing 6 years ago. They did not like \nthe formula because everyone wants to get something more than perhaps \nthey are entitled to under any formula. That is human nature. We made a \ncommitment, working on this formula for over a year, that we would stay \nwith the formula. I am talking about a bipartisan bill, Democrats and \nRepublicans on our committee.\n  When we looked at the factors--this is not just some States: let's \nsee the big States and the little States and things like that--we \ncovered a number of things: total lane miles on the interstate; the \nVMT, that is the vehicle miles traveled; the annual contributions to \nthe highway trust fund attributed to commercial vehicles; the diesel \nfuel used on highways; the relative share of total cost to repair and \nreplace deficient highway bridges--like in my State of Oklahoma, we are \ndead last in the Nation--weighted nonattainment and maintenance areas; \nrate of return of donor States, donee States, fast-growing States.\n  We have ceilings. We have floors. It is a very complicated formula. \nYou don't come along at the eleventh hour and say, oh, we are going to \nchange one thing and everyone is going to be happy because if you did \nthat, then you are going to affect some other States in a way that is \ncertainly not fair.\n  Now, let's just look at some of the arguments that have been made. \nThe NAFTA corridor: Because of the insistence of one of the members of \nour committee, the junior Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, we added $280 \nmillion--this goes to Texas--under the Borders Program. The IPAM \nProgram, that has been ridiculed on the floor, is a program that takes \nprojects that are ready for construction. These projects can start jobs \nimmediately. You don't have to sit around and wait. That is why I am \npersonally offended when people come along and say, well, let's have \nanother extension. If we have another extension, none of this stuff \ngets done, none of the streamlining elements in this bill happen, which \nmeans we will not be able to do nearly as many roads per dollar as we \ncan under this bill. That is why we are going to have, at the end of \nthis thing, a 6-year bill. It is going to go to conference, and we are \ngoing to end up with a good bill. But we are not going to operate any \nlonger on the extensions.\n  Now, I know there is politics involved in these things. We have tried \nto keep this at a minimum. If you look at TEA-21, it was dominated by \nthe Northeastern States. You had several very important people on the \ncommittees.\n  Certainly, Congressman Shuster, over there from Pennsylvania--I \nserved for 8 years with him on that House committee--and, yes, they got \nup to a very large amount in TEA-21: $1.21 return for every $1 they \npaid in.\n  Senator Moynihan--we all loved Senator Moynihan--he had a lot of \ninfluence on the committee. New York, as a result of that influence, I \nbelieve, got $1.25 back for every $1 they paid in.\n  Certainly, our beloved John Chafee from Rhode Island did his best \nwork. They ended up with $2.16 for every $1 they paid in.\n  Montana--Senator Baucus was actually the ranking member of both the \ncommittee and the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure--\n$2.18. Now, there are reasons for this, of course, because they do not \nhave a lot of people paying up there. But you have to have roads. You \nhave to get through Montana. You have to get through the Western \nStates.\n  My State of Oklahoma--and I was on the committee, and I was on the \nconference committee--90.5 cents.\n  We have done a job here in really helping people out. But I want to \npoint out the most important part of this program. Everyone who stood \nup and talked about this new formula has talked about how everyone is \ngoing to get a little bit more. Let's stop and think about that. That \nis going to cost money, isn't it? I do not think there is a person who \nis supporting this bill who did not first come down to the floor and \ncomplain that we are spending too much money in this bill, that $255 \nbillion is too much--and you add the transit on there--it is too much \nmoney.\n\n  This amendment will increase the cost of this bill by $7.25 billion. \nIf you want to increase the cost, if you want to go tell the White \nHouse, ``No, we didn't like the $255 billion so we are going to raise \nit up to $262.25 billion,'' go ahead and do it. I don't think you would \nbe very well received. The\n\n[[Page S1205]]\n\nmoney has to come from someplace. It is coming from IPAM. Quite \nfrankly, I am not going to stand here and accept and support a change \nin the formula that increases the cost by $7.25 billion. It is totally \nunreasonable, and after a year we are not going to do it.\n  I say to the Senator, do you want me to yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I simply want to say, when the Senator finishes, we have \nbeen advised by leadership that they need a vote in the next 5 minutes. \nIf we have more speakers, then I will have no alternative but to move \nto table. But what we have agreed to do, I say to the chairman of the \ncommittee, on this side, is to allow an up-or-down vote, but there will \nnot be an up-or-down vote unless there is some acknowledgement that the \ndebate is going to end now because we have spent considerable time on \nthis amendment. It has been a good debate, but all things have to come \nto an end, and they will, either with a motion to table or an up-or-\ndown vote now.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am through, Madam President.\n  I want to reemphasize this amendment costs $7.25 billion more, and \npeople have to understand that.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much. I would direct, through the Chair, a \nquestion to the Senator from Texas.\n  Are you about to complete your statement?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Madam President, I would just like to take a couple minutes to \nrespond to the chairman's remarks, and then I will be ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we are not adding money to the bill. \nWe are taking money in the bill that is unallocated--promised but not \nyet granted to specific projects in specific States--and redistributing \nthat on a fairer basis than that of political rewards in project money. \nWe are trying to take the politics out and establish fairness for the \nStates made superdonors, or stepchildren, in the Senate's highway bill.\n  I hope people will look beyond their pet projects and see that \neveryone benefits and the money used is already in the bill. The \namendment does not add even a penny. Yet it creates a fairer planing \nfield for every State already.\n  So I hope the Senate will rise above project fighting and distribute \nthis funding on a formula basis in order to treat every State more \nfairly.\n  Madam President, when I came to the Senate, one thing that impressed \nme the most is that although I was a member of the minority party at \nthe time, no State ever was ever penalized for size or growth. Every \nState was given funding that matched its needs.\n  This bill is setting a new precedent that has never been the policy \nof the Senate to use big States as providers for other States. Everyone \ncan see this play is not fair.\n  I hope Senators will support this amendment. We are not adding a dime \nto the bill. We are redistributing the money that is in the bill in a \nfairer way. No one loses from the formula that is in the bill, and \neveryone gains much-needed funding.\n  I hope the bill does not go to the President without a formula \namendment. It would set a terrible precedent to institute a new \nsuperdonor category of States with more highway mileage and therefore \nalways paying more money to the highway trust fund than they will ever \nget back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we have discussed the formula, which is \nwhat the Senator from Texas has been discussing in the last couple \nminutes. I want everybody to know, this is 7.25 billion new dollars, \nnew spending under this formula. If you vote for this, you are voting \nto increase the authorized level by $7.25 billion.\n  If you look at the pending bill, it says: Under the IPAM Program, \nunder section 139 of that title, $2 billion for fiscal year 2004 and \nnothing thereafter. If you look at the amendment, it says:\n\n       $2,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. . . \n     .\n\n  That is $4 billion, plus:\n\n       $1,750,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006, 2007, and \n     2008.\n\n  You add it up, and that is $9.25 billion, $7.25 billion more than the \npending bill. Everyone has to understand that. When you vote for this, \nyou are voting to increase the spending under this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I echo what my good friend, the chairman \nof the committee, stated. The amendment does not keep the balance \nbetween donor and donee States. Our staff has run through many of these \noptions, 300-plus runs from the Federal Highway Administration, to come \nup with a fair balance between donor and donee States.\n  When you take a look at what is fair, we have heard complaints about \nthe increase, that they are not getting enough percentage increase, but \nwhen you look at the State of Texas, over the 6 years of the bill, it \ngets a 42-percent increase. That is $5.3 billion. If you look at the \nState of Arizona, it gets a 40.23-percent increase, or $1.11 billion \nover the 6 years. California has a 40.14-percent increase, or $6.1 \nbillion. There are a couple of States that even get 40-percent \nincreases. This amendment purports to increase fairness by giving an \neven greater share to some of the States that have the largest share of \nthe increase already. That does not have much to do with fairness.\n  This is a very ill-advised amendment. As the chairman has pointed \nout, there is not money in the bill. This would add approximately $7 \nbillion to the cost of the bill. I find it passing strange that some of \nthe cosponsors of this bill were ones who opposed the Bond-Reid \namendment to set the figure at $255 billion, and they have been very \nvocal in saying this bill spends too much. They would add about $7 \nbillion to the bill.\n  We are going in the wrong direction. We are being asked to reward \nthose States that are already doing better than almost any other State \nin terms of the increase in the money that is coming back. This bill \nfollowed the formula as best we could. We did get all States to \nincrease by at least 10 percent. We got all donor States up to 95 cents \non the dollar. But nobody, other than about two States, has made it up \nto a 40-percent increase.\n  To say certain States who are already in the 40-percent increase need \nmore is unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to move to table. We have waited. \nThe time has come. We either have an up-or-down vote now or I am moving \nto table. I am not going to yield the floor anymore.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, it is fine for the Senator to move \nto table.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. There was a misrepresentation that just occurred.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have the floor. I direct a question \nthrough the Chair to the Senator from Texas: Can we have an up-or-down \nvote? The leadership wanted one 5 minutes ago. We either do it now or I \nam moving to table.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, misrepresentations have just been \nmade. If the Senator feels he needs to cut off the ability to answer \nthat, the Senator is perfectly free to do so.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from Texas, how much more time do you \nneed to respond?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If there are no further arguments that misrepresent \nthe facts, I need 1 minute.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator be yielded 1 minute prior to a vote on \nthis matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  This bill came out of the committee with $9 billion in money that was \nunallocated. Now we are being told there is only $2 billion. It is a \nfair question to ask, where did the other $7 billion go?\n  The fact is, the money has not been allocated until we vote on this \nbill. We would have the ability to create a level playing field with \nthe exact same money that is in the bill. It has not been voted on by \nthe Senate. Where is the $7 billion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S1206]]\n\n                     Amendment No. 2591, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, the pending substitute has been available \nfor 2\\1/2\\ days now. Everything is in there. We dropped IPAM down to $2 \nbillion. You want to increase it to $9.25 billion. That is an increase \nof $7.25 billion. It has been down there. We all looked at the pending \nsubstitute. We read it. We have been debating it now for 2 days. It is \nan increase of 2.5.\n  Madam President, I withdraw my pending amendment so the Senator may \nhave her up-or-down vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2388\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2388 offered by the Senator from Texas.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSantorum) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan sent Congress what should be a much needed and sobering wake-\nup call. He warned that a lack of fiscal discipline could lead to \nincreased long-term interest rates and called for new steps to restrain \nspending.\n  In delivering the Fed's monetary report to the House Financial \nServices Committee, Mr. Greenspan said that should investors become \nsignificantly more doubtful that the Congress will take the necessary \nfiscal measures, then appreciable backup in long-term interest rates is \npossible.\n  Also, as we know, yesterday the administration transmitted its \nstatement of administrative policy which we will continue to talk about \nthroughout this debate. We all know the projected budget deficit for \n2005 is over $500 billion, half a trillion dollars. Almost every Member \nin this Chamber has been talking the talk about reining in spending, \nbut when are we going to start to back up our words with our actions? \nPassage of this bill would be the quintessential example of what we are \ndoing wrong and how we are not stepping up to future financial straits \nfor our children and grandchildren.\n  The current budget resolution provided $231 billion for the EPW \nCommittee to spend on its portion of the bill. That is the current \nbudget resolution. The pending EPW proposal would instead provide $255 \nbillion, or $24 billion over the current budget resolution by which we \nare to be abiding. The current budget resolution provided $37 billion \nfor the Banking Committee to spend on its transit portion of this bill. \nThe Banking Committee proposal contained in the pending bill provides \n$46 billion or 25 percent over the budget resolution.\n\n  I guess I have to ask a question about this body's adherence to the \nbudget resolution. We spend arduous days, and then with a vote-athon \nthat is the most unpleasant day and evening of the year--certainly for \nme and I believe for most of my colleagues--we come up with a budget \nresolution and one we at least commit to abide by.\n  This bill, at least in two instances which I am bringing to your \nattention, is $24 billion over the current budget resolution by EPW, \nand 25 percent or $9 billion over the budget resolution by the Banking \nCommittee.\n  A few days ago, the Wall Street Journal editorial entitled ``Road \nKill'' had some pretty harsh comments about what we are doing today. I \nwill not quote from all of it. The Wall Street Journal editorial says:\n\n       An old political adage has it that the most dangerous place \n     in Washington is between a Congressman and asphalt. That is \n     exactly where taxpayers now find themselves as Congress \n     conspires to pass another monster highway bill. The only good \n     news is that President Bush is showing signs he may fight \n     this election year.\n       The administration has its own highway proposal which is \n     hardly cheap. Mr. Bush is asking for $256 billion over six \n     years, which is 21 percent more than the past six years and \n     fairly close to Treasury estimates of revenue from the \n     current 18.4-cent-a-gallon federal gas tax that is earmarked \n     for roads.\n       Ah, but this isn't enough for the boys of summer \n     construction. The draft Senate bill demands $55 billion more \n     than Mr. Bush and is loaded with fiscal gimmicks that divert \n     money from general--non-gas-tax--revenues into roadbuilding.\n       One of the more embarrassing arguments from Congress's \n     highwaymen is that this is somehow a ``jobs bill.''\n\n  That is what we continue to hear on this floor over and over again.\n\n       So at least for parochial matter, Republicans claim to \n     believe in the superiority of government over private \n     spending. Some Econ 101: Highway spending rolls out slowly \n     over many years but new taxes are immediately taken away from \n     the more productive private economy.\n\n  I would like to repeat that.\n\n       Highway spending rolls out slowly over many years but new \n     taxes are immediately taken away from the more productive \n     private economy. Still, this is a fight worth having. \n     Congress will keep spending freely until Mr. Bush shows he's \n     willing to spend political capital to say no. In a letter to \n     Congress last week, Administration officials warned that any \n     bill that includes higher gas taxes, trickster accounting or \n     a siphoning of general tax revenues will face a veto. \n     Presidents who make veto threats and don't fulfill them \n     quickly come irrelevant.\n\n  There are one of two things that are going to happen and let's be \nvery clear about what is happening. One of two things is going to \nhappen.\n  No. 1, if we pass this bill, it goes to conference and the President \nof the United States makes good on his very specific veto threat. I am \nsure that will be of benefit to the President of the United States in \nshowing he is willing to crack down on reckless fiscal insanity, which \nis really what this bill is all about, or, somehow, a bill is passed by \nboth bodies and they go to conference and, without the participation of \nthe majority of Members of the Senate, the bill will be pared down to \nthe President's demands.\n\n  Either way, this bill is rendered meaningless. What we are arguing \nabout is a meaningless 1,300-page piece of document because the \nPresident has assured us that, unless it is a certain level, far lower \nthan the present level, he will veto it.\n  I don't know if the President has the votes to sustain his veto in \nthis body, but I am confident the President has the number of votes to \nsustain his veto in the other body. Either way, my dear friends of the \nSenate cannot come out of this looking good because we are so far over \nin excess of what the President has guaranteed he would veto.\n  As my colleagues who are managing this bill keep saying: We will fix \nit in\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\nconference. We will fix it in conference. The last time we fixed \nsomething in conference we got a Medicare prescription drug bill that, \nit turns out, was only $143 billion short.\n  I have seen things fixed in conference and there is nothing worse \nthan seeing a piece of legislation ``fixed in conference.''\n  So we are arguing about a piece of legislation that cannot pass--that \ncannot pass, certainly at its present level, by a significant number of \nbillions of dollars. We are in violation of our own budget resolution \nin this bill.\n  Therefore, I raise the point of order against the substitute \namendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Pursuant to section 904, I move to waive all Budget Act \npoints of order for consideration of the pending substitute in its \ncurrent status and the underlying bill as amended by the substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is debatable.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Parliamentary inquiry: Doesn't it have to be sent to the \ndesk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, the motion does not have to be in writing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for it to be sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to debate the measure, waiving the \nBudget Act point of order. I would point out the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, who has just spoken, is talking about the reckless \nfiscal insanity in this 1,300-page bill. A good portion of that is the \nCommerce Committee title, his committee's title. We don't know what is \nin that title.\n  We have laid out our bill. We have taken it through the committee. \nOur committee voted on it. We brought that bill to the floor. We have \nhad it out here. We are still trying to find out what is in the \nCommerce Committee bill. We are told it is very different than what was \npassed out of the Commerce Committee. We have just tried to make an \nanalysis of it and, as best we can tell, the budget resolution \nauthorized the Commerce Committee to spend $4 billion and it appears \nthe Commerce title before us spends about $6.5 billion. So we hope we \ncould help the Commerce Committee by waiving the Budget Act point of \norder.\n  Let me talk a minute about why this vote is so important. The vote is \non two very important issues. The first is the size of the highway \nbill--$255 billion for highways, $56 billion for transit. The second is \nfirewalls ensure highway trust fund dollars are spent on this Nation's \ntransportation needs. Last year, during consideration of the budget \nresolution, the Senate voted 79 to 21 in favor of funding the highway \nbill at $255 billion, and mass transit at $57 billion. That vote seemed \nto me to be a resounding victory for adequate funding levels for these \ntwo very important subjects.\n  The administration's proposed bill would fund highways at under $200 \nbillion over the next 6 years, and to cut that would cut $4.5 billion. \nFurthermore, the highway funding would not reach the level included in \nthe 2004 Omnibus bill until 2008, the second-to-last year of the bill. \nThis would result in a net loss of 850,000 jobs compared to the CBO \nbaseline, because that is how far the level would fall under that which \nthe House-Senate budget resolution authorized.\n  The funding levels in this Senate transportation bill are \nresponsible. When the budget was adopted there was a provision in there \nsaying the level for highways would be $231 billion unless other funds \ncould be put into the highway trust fund.\n  I commend the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman Grassley, and \nRanking Member Baucus, who have taken steps to ensure that they have \nclosed loopholes; they have directed into the highway fund new highway \nfund measures, and as a result, according to the Finance Committee, \nthis bill will not add to the deficit. Now, in fact, not only will this \nbill not add to the deficit, it will be a huge economic stimulus. \nEveryone knows $1 billion invested in transportation infrastructure \ncreates 47,500 new jobs.\n  In addition, in the last year for which we have statistics available, \nover 42,000 Americans lost their lives on our Nation's roadways in \nmotor vehicle accidents. Roughly 35 percent, or 14,000, of these are a \nresult of road conditions. It is likely our State may be higher than 35 \npercent because we have many narrow, two-lane roads, with far more \ntraffic than we have highway to accommodate. In other words, if you \nhave 15,000 cars a day using a two-lane, two-way road, people try to \npass at times that are not appropriate, and many other risks are taken \nby drivers with a result that there are head-on collisions and traffic \nfatalities.\n  This is a safety measure. The figures we have are figures that match \nthe initial representations, the initial 79-Member vote in this body. \nThe additional funding above the House-Senate joint resolution is \nachieved because the Finance Committee put additional funds into the \nhighway trust fund. That is a very sound way of going about it. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Budget Act waiver.\n  The Senator from Arizona also raised questions about why we are going \nto write it in the conference. We have been in touch with the White \nHouse and just learned after the bill had been brought to the Senate \nthey were reluctant to accept the figure we had. At this point we need \nto work with the House and the White House to come up with a final \nfigure.\n  I cannot imagine anyone thinking a bill we pass out of here, which \nhas so many different interests, will not be changed when it comes back \nfrom the conference with the House. We are not the only body. I have \nworked on a lot of conference reports and if it comes back looking very \nmuch like what we pass out of the Senate we have done a good day's \nwork. I have never seen it come back looking exactly the way it left \nthe Senate. That is how this place works. We have to have compromise \nwhen we go to the conference committee between the House and the \nSenate. When the White House feels strongly about it, they have a great \nsay because they have the final say. They have the final say whether it \nis signed or vetoed.\n  We have worked too long and too hard to get a good bill. The \nchairman, the Senator from Oklahoma, the distinguished ranking members, \nthe Senator from Vermont, the Senator from Nevada and the members of \nthe committee, worked on the EPW portion. The other portions have been \nworked on in their committees. We will do the best we can to follow the \noutlines we have and come up with our proposal.\n  We should remind those who criticize this measure, who say they want \nto know more about it, that we marked up our bill before Congress \nrecessed for Christmas and have used the base text throughout this \nentire process. For the past 2 weeks, we have consistently urged our \ncolleagues to come to the Senate and offer amendments. Our staff, my \nstaff, the other principal staffs, have been here late every night. We \nannounced last week that the staff was available to discuss amendments \nthroughout the week. Many Members took advantage of it. We tried hard \nto be open and accommodating to every Senator. That is why it is \nextremely frustrating to be criticized by Members who have never come \nto the floor to offer an amendment, let alone send their staff to meet \nwith the EPW Committee staff to discuss changes or to offer amendments \nfor consideration.\n\n  Even more frustrating, the fact that rather than offering suggestions \nor amendments, we are criticized for deficit spending. I remind my \ncolleagues, the point of order was raised by a colleague who \ncosponsored an amendment we defeated this morning that would add $7 \nbillion to the cost of the bill. It would add more to his State and \nseveral other States. It is beyond what is paid for in the bill. It is \nbeyond what is available in the bill.\n  There has to be some consistency. People say consistency is the \nbugaboo of small minds, but when we take a look at budget numbers, we \nought to be making adjustments in the numbers based on what is \navailable.\n  Second, when we are criticized for not being open with our bill, I \nurge the chairman of the Commerce Committee to bring his substitute for \nthe committee bill to the floor to discuss it, to let us know what is \nin it so we might make meaningful suggestions and directions.\n  As I said, we have not been able to review it in detail. It is not \nthe same\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\ntitle as reported out of the Commerce Committee. That Commerce \nCommittee bill which had allocated $4 billion under the budget \nresolution came in at over $6 billion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I will yield in a moment. I want to conclude my comments.\n  I urge my colleagues to waive the provisions of the Budget Act as \noutlined in the motion to waive previously submitted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question before he yields the \nfloor?\n  Mr. BOND. Certainly.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator could state--since he is moving to waive \nthe Budget Act because the bill exceeds the budget--in his opinion, \nwhat dollar amount does this bill exceed the budget?\n  Mr. BOND. The original proposal in the bill agreed on by the budget \nconference committee between the House and the Senate was below the \nSenate number. It came in at $231 billion.\n  The Finance Committee has fulfilled its obligation to raise enough \nfunds in the highway trust fund to enable us to reach the level of $255 \nbillion, the amount originally adopted by a 79-to-21 vote in the \nSenate. Rather than argue about that detail and the other details, I \nwant to put the measure to waive that and we can debate the Finance \nCommittee and other questions as they arise.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield further for a question, that was \nnot necessarily my question. My question was fairly specific. If you \naccept the number $255 billion as the number you are working from as \nthe budget number that would be defensible, by what amount does this \nbill exceed the $255 billion number? What is the specific amount?\n  I presume as one of the managers of the bill that the manager must \nknow that number.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest that my colleague ask the Commerce Committee \nchairman by how much his title exceeds the budget resolution. I believe \nour number is at $255 billion. I want to help out the Commerce \nCommittee by getting a waiver for what I understand--I cannot be sure--\nis a 50-percent increase over the budget allowed to the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, is the \nSenator's position that this bill does not exceed the budget, and \ntherefore, if that is the Senator's position, why would the Senator be \nasking for a waiver of the budget?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, to answer my colleague, it appears that the \nCommerce Committee is over the limit and we are going to have this vote \nat some point. This is a good time to have it. There will be questions \nraised about the Budget Act. My understanding is that the Commerce \nCommittee is over its $4 billion allocation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to respond to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor and I am happy \nto yield for a question to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware that the EPW portion is over, by $24 \nbillion, the budget resolution? The Commerce Committee is over by $2.5 \nbillion. The reason it is over by $2.5 billion is because of \nadministration requests. But I would be more than happy and would vote \nfor removing the $2.5 billion which the Commerce Committee is over and \nthe $24 billion that Environment and Public Works is over. That, it \nseems to me, would be fair.\n\n  Again, I hope the Senator from Missouri would look at the substitute \nthat contains the Commerce Committee's input in title IV. The Senator \nfrom Missouri keeps claiming that the Commerce Committee is not in \nthere. Look at title IV of the substitute, I say to the Senator from \nMissouri, and then you will find out what the Commerce Committee is. I \nam astonished he does not even know what is in his own substitute.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate that question from the Senator \nfrom Arizona and that answer, both of which were excellent, by the way. \nI am glad somebody around here--who is not necessarily a member of the \ncommittee bringing the bill to the floor--knows the number by which the \nbill exceeds the budget. I do think that is sort of an elementary item \nyou might want to know when you bring a bill to the floor of the \nSenate, by what amount do you exceed the budget, especially when you \nask to waive the budget.\n  The Senator from Arizona has answered that question. The bill exceeds \nthe budget by somewhere in the vicinity of $24 billion, I believe was \nthe Senator's statement, on the EPW side, and $2-something billion on \nthe Commerce side. I am not quite sure why we should be waiving the \nbudget on that size number. That is a big number: $24 billion.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be interested in getting an answer first from the \nSenator from Missouri, who refused to answer my prior questions with \nany specificity, before I yield for a question. I will complete my \nstatement and then yield.\n  Mr. BOND. All right.\n  Mr. GREGG. The point is, we see a bill which has been brought to us \nwhich is dramatically over--dramatically over--the number which was \nproposed by the President, and then the number that was passed by this \nHouse as a budget number, and now, when there is an attempt to bring \nsome fiscal discipline to the bill, we see the committee come forward \nand say, well, we don't know how much we are over or we are not going \nto tell you how much we are over, but we want to waive the budget.\n  At what point does fiscal discipline enter any of the discussion \naround this Senate? It appears to have become a fantasy land for the \npurposes of spending, and it is unfortunate because who is going to be \npaying this bill? Well, it is going to come out of the general fund, \nwhich means it will be added to the debt, which means that our children \nare going to pay for it.\n  Now, there are ways to fund a highway bill that are appropriate, and \nit is called going to the highway fund and using the money in the \nhighway fund. This proposal, as it came out of the Budget Committee, as \nit was presented by the President, represented a 19-percent increase in \nfunding, using dedicated funds. It was a very reasonable approach. But \nthe bill, as it is on the Senate floor today, represents something in \nthe vicinity of a 40-percent increase in cost, and it is not paid for \nwith highway funds. It is paid for by borrowing from the general fund, \nwhich means running up the debt, and that is inappropriate.\n  So the Senator from Arizona has raised a very legitimate point, which \nis that this bill violates the budget. Then, when he asked and I asked \nthe manager of the bill by how much, they could not answer the \nquestion, or they would not answer the question, which is ironic and \nmaybe reflects either their lack of knowledge of the bill or their lack \nof desire to tell us what the number is.\n  Now, the Senator from Arizona has put a number on the table. He \nbelieves this is $24 billion over the budget. That is a lot of money--a \nlot of money. I think the Senator is probably right. I certainly cannot \nunderstand why we would be waiving the Budget Act when we have those \ntypes of dollars being added to the deficit, when the deficit has \nalready ballooned beyond what anybody should reasonably expect a \ndisciplined government would be running.\n  Mr. President, I have a list of just how much this bill has gone up, \nand I will put it in the Record. I ask unanimous consent that this list \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  TRANSPORTATION PROPOSALS RAW NUMBERS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     In billions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n (1) TEA-21's Total Cost 1998-2003........  $218\n   Highways...............................  $167\n   Transit................................  $41\n   Safety, Motor Carrier Adm..............  $10\n (2) Straight 6-Year Extension (6 years @   $243.4\n FY03 Funding level of $40.5 million.\n   Highways...............................  $190.8\n   Transit................................  $49.2\n   Safety, Motor Carrier Adm..............  $3.4\n (3) Administration Proposal..............  $248\n   Highways...............................  $195\n   Transit................................  $50\n   Safety, Motor Carrier Adm..............  $3\n (4) ``SAFE TEA''--EPW's S. 1072..........  $318.5\n   Highways...............................  $255 (w/Finance additions)\n   Transit................................  $56.5\n   Safety, Motor Carrier Adm..............  $7\n (5) TEA-LU: House Bill...................  $375 (w/o Safety Money)\n   Highways...............................  $293\n   Transit................................  $82\n   Safety, Motor Carrier Adm..............

Young is now \n     negotiating w/ Thomas who intends to mark up a $318 billion \n     proposal in Ways and\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\n     Means that is very close to Inhofe's Senate bill.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. The TEA-21 total cost for 1998 to 2003 was a $218 billion \nbill. That included highways at $167 billion, transit at $41 billion, \nand safety and motor carriers at $10 billion.\n  A straight 6-year extension of that would have been a $243 billion \nbill, with highways at $190 billion, transit at $49 billion, and safety \nand motor carriers at $3.4 billion.\n  The administration's proposal was originally a $248 billion bill, \nwith highways at $195 billion.\n  SAFETEA, which is what is on the floor now, is a $318 billion bill, \nwith highways at $255 billion, transit at $56 billion, and safety and \nmotor carriers at $7 billion.\n  The House, which is talking about marking up its own bill, is at $375 \nbillion allegedly, with highways at $293 billion, transit at $82 \nbillion--and it is not really clear yet what the safety and motor \ncarrier number is, but it is pretty obvious if the House is over our \nnumber as we are taking this bill up on the floor, we are not talking \nabout a conference that is going to come back to the budget number. So \nour one opportunity to enforce the budget, to have fiscal discipline, \nand to not significantly aggravate the deficit is this vote that is \ngoing to come up on the issue of waiving the budget.\n  I certainly hope we will stand with the Senator from Arizona as he \ntries to enforce some fiscal discipline on this bill which, remember, \nif the budget number is put in place on this bill, it will be a 19-\npercent increase. We are not talking about cutting spending.\n  We are talking about cutting spending in a lot of accounts. The \nPresident has sent up a freeze budget for domestic, nondefense, and \nnonnational security issues, so we are going to have to cut some \nspending around here. This bill is not going to cut spending. If it \nmeets the budget, it is going to be up 19 percent. So it is not like we \nare asking people to take a hit or to reduce highway construction. In \nfact, highway construction will increase considerably if we go forward \nwith a bill which is within the budget, and it will also be \nresponsible, which is the key to this exercise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The junior \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think my colleague from Arizona makes a \nvalid point of order. And as the Senator from New Hampshire has just \npointed out, the bill clearly exceeds the budget; therefore, a budget \npoint of order is valid and should be supported by the Members of this \nbody. For those who would vote against the budget point of order, they \nare in effect saying: Throw the budget to the wind; we want to spend \nmore money than is authorized; and we are going to do that.\n  The response from our side, those people who wish we would stick with \nthe budget, is to vote to sustain the budget point of order so that we \ncan at least try to keep within the bounds we ourselves have set.\n  The rejoinder of our colleagues who oppose sticking to the budget is: \nWe will fix the bill in conference. But they are never willing to \ncommit they will bring a bill out of conference that does not violate \nthe budget.\n  That is our problem. That is why we cannot accept the proposition \nfrom our colleagues that we will just pass this bill, that it is all \ngoing to somehow magically get fixed in the conference. There have been \nno commitments made that the bill that comes out of conference will be \nconsistent with the budget. This is why the President has also \nexpressed concerns.\n  In the Statement of Administration Policy, after noting the fact that \nthe bill pending before us is $62 billion above the President's \nrequest--which was for $256 billion--the letter reads as follows:\n\n       The Administration's proposed authorization level of $256 \n     billion over six years is consistent with the three \n     principles listed above.\n\n  And those are the principles that have been read before that called \nfor a bill which does not raise taxes, which does not use smoke and \nmirrors, and which does not take money from the general fund to pay for \nthe highways.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       We support a reasonable [responsible] six-year bill and \n     support many of the provisions contained in this legislation. \n     However, we oppose S. 1072 and the pending substitute because \n     their spending levels are too high and they violate these \n     principles discussed above. Accordingly, if legislation that \n     violates these principles (such as this legislation, which \n     authorizes $318 billion) were presented to the President, his \n     senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  If we sustain the budget point of order that has been raised by my \ncolleague from Arizona, we will go a long way toward meeting what the \nPresident has asked us to do: to stick within the limits that he set \nand that we set. If, on the other hand, we support the motion to waive \nthe Budget Act of the Senator from Missouri, we have basically said we \nare not yet prepared to face up to fiscal realities. We are not \nprepared to show we are going to be fiscally responsible. But trust us, \nwhen we get to conference, we might or might not be doing something to \nbring us back into fiscal balance.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the budget point \nof order raised by the Senator from Arizona and to oppose the motion to \nwaive all budget points of order offered by the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I erred on a matter of decorum. I said I \nwould yield to the Senator from Missouri for a question. Unfortunately, \nI failed to do that. If the Senator from Missouri did have a question, \nI apologize. He has probably forgotten his question by now. It was a \nlong time ago. I am sure it was going to be a telling question, so it \nwas best that I wait anyway.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, to answer the question once more, he said \nhow much was it over the budget. As to the original budget passed by \nthis body, it is right at the budget, 255. How much is it over the \njoint House-Senate budget? It is $24 billion over, but that Budget Act \nspecifically said additional money put in the highway trust fund can be \nused for trust fund purposes. That is what we have done. The reason we \nasked to waive the Budget Act points of order is so we can stop the \ndilatory tactics that have dragged this out without getting a vote for \nalmost 2 weeks.\n  I would ask the Senator from New Hampshire if he intends to continue \nto delay, to attempt to prevent votes on the substantive amendments \nwhich may be brought to the bill. If he could give us some assurance \nthat he will not continue to use dilatory tactics and raise points of \norder, should we not waive the budget?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I knew the question was going to be a good \none. Let me point out that I offered an amendment 2 weeks ago. I was \nready to vote on it at any time over those 2 weeks. It is hardly my \ndilatory tactics that kept us from going to a vote on that amendment. \nIn fact, it was the manager of the bill who decided to take a \nparliamentary move which brought down my amendment and made it \nimpossible for me to get to a vote. Why would it be dilatory on my part \nthat the managers brought down my amendment without allowing me a vote?\n  I guess I would turn the question back to the manager. Is the manager \nat this point willing to vote on my amendment? In fact, I ask unanimous \nconsent to be allowed to bring forward, recognizing that it is not \ngermane at this time because the manager has positioned the bill so it \nis not allowed to be voted on, but I ask unanimous consent at this \npoint, because the managers asked for a vote, that I be given a vote on \nmy amendment, which was the amendment dealing with collective \nbargaining which was pending for a week and a half in this body and on \nwhich I was not given a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we object. It is not a germane amendment. \nThat was the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think that answers the question. It is \nnot I who has not asked for votes. It is not I who has been dilatory. I \nhave been aggressively pursuing a desire to vote on that very \nreasonable amendment for a considerable amount of time. I do not wish \nto waive my rights to maybe raise that issue at some point in the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, since the Senator from Missouri is on the \nSenate floor, I draw his attention to the index of his own substitute \nwhich has the commerce provisions of the bill in it in title IV. I wish \nhe would ask to strike his comments if he doesn't know what the \nCommerce Committee is. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but I am a \nlittle surprised that he doesn't know what is in his own substitute.\n  The Senate Budget Committee staff tells us that EPW is $24 billion \nover the budget; Banking, $9 billion over the budget; Commerce, $2.5 \nbillion over the budget--I would be more than happy to erase all of \nthose--for a total of $35.5 billion over the budget. Meanwhile, \neverybody in America is warning us about running up these huge \ndeficits. The President of the United States, the administration's \nproposed authorization level was $262 billion on highways and highway \nsafety, $50 billion over the President's request; $56 billion on mass \ntransit, $12 billion over the President's request. In total, the Senate \nbill authorizes $318 billion in spending on highway safety and mass \ntransit over the next 6 years, a full $62 billion above the President's \nrequest for the same period.\n  The President has guaranteed a veto. He has guaranteed a veto if we \ngo on with this number which the managers of the bill continue to \nstoutly defend. King Canute had a better idea.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to support the point of order which \nwas raised against the Budget Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe many questions were raised about \nfinancing. I see the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, in the Chamber. I will just note that he could answer those \nquestions, if he is recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to make a couple comments about the \nbill in general and spending.\n  We are debating whether to waive the budget point of order. There is \na point of order in order simply because this transportation bill goes \nway over--tens of billions of dollars over--what we voted on as a body \nand agreed to last year. That is why a budget point of order stands \nagainst this bill.\n  Transportation spending is one of the most legitimate uses of \ngovernment dollars. Everybody benefits by it. I don't think there is \nany question. Anybody you talk to agrees it is a legitimate use of \ndollars. But there are people who want to go above the budget, who want \nto spend more than the trust fund brings in. The trust fund is that \nmoney that comes in because of user fee taxes paid into a fund that are \nsupposed to build our roads and the like, the rest of the \ninfrastructure.\n  Instead of putting this tax on our children or on the next Congress \nbecause we are deficit spending and passing debt, when you pass debt on \nto the future, you are going to have to raise taxes in the future. We \nhave seen Congress doesn't cut spending. So because you are passing \ntaxes on to the future, the people who want a higher highway spending \nbill should have the courage to raise the taxes. I don't believe we \nshould. But if those people want to spend more money, they should at \nleast have the courage not to put it off to the next Congress to raise \ntaxes. That is why this point of order should be sustained.\n  To put this in the context of the economy and other spending, they \nare touting the jobs that will be created. Alan Greenspan testified \nthat the biggest threat to our economy and to jobs is runaway Federal \nspending. The markets are watching us right now. Whether somebody is a \nsupply side economist or a Keynesian economist, it doesn't matter what \nview they take, the one thing they will all agree on--whatever causes \nthe deficit, they may disagree--is the deficit is a huge threat to the \nfuture growth of our economy and jobs in America. And they are all \nwatching us right now. The markets are watching; the Federal Reserve is \nwatching what we are going to do on this very bill right now. That is \nwhy it is so critical we exercise some fiscal discipline on such an \nimportant issue.\n\n  It will help us all by voting for more transportation spending; it \nhelps us all for reelection. That is why this bill is so popular. We \npoliticians can get up here and tout how much money is coming to our \nStates; it is going to help you for reelection. But we have to think \nabout not just our parochial interests in our States but put that into \nthe broader context of the overall economy and also in the context of \nwhat we are doing to future generations.\n  If we keep deficit spending, we are putting taxes on to the future \ngenerations. We did the farm bill, the Medicare prescription drug bill, \nthis transportation bill--we have passed so many things, plus all of \nthe other discretionary accounts, on top of a war. And Americans \nunderstand that sometimes you have to deficit spend during recession \nand war. But we are out of the recession now. The war is still there, \nso we have that aspect of it. But to continue to add to the deficit \nwith all of this other discretionary spending and going above the trust \nfund I think is wrong.\n  That is why I call on colleagues, if they really want the $311 \nbillion, or whatever the spending amount is they come up to, not to \nplay games, not do this shadow game being done with a lot of the \nnumbers.\n  I appreciate what the chairman of the Finance Committee has tried to \ndo. He was given a task and he has done the best he possibly could. I \nthink too many games have been played. We ought to be honest. If we \nwant to spin that number and if people want that number, they ought to \nvote for a gasoline tax increase to pay for it. That should be the only \nway we do this.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks by saying I hope we act in \na more fiscally responsible way than we are doing within this bill. I \nam applauding the President for putting his foot down and saying enough \nis enough. We have to get our fiscal house in order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I spoke, similar to what I am going to \nsay today, last week on the floor of the Senate because I heard these \nvery same considerations and very same criticisms of the Senate Finance \nCommittee bill at that particular time. And at that particular time, I \nthought for Senators who don't have time to read legislation, or be \nadvised by their committees or by their staffs on what the committee \nmight be trying to accomplish--I ought to take time to inform \ncolleagues about what my committee actually did.\n  I can tell by the debate today that either no one was paying any \nattention to my explanation last week or they forgot or they didn't \ncare, because I am hearing the same criticism this week. I want to \nstate why that criticism is unfounded, and I want to say to my \ncolleagues that what we are doing in this legislation is following \nprecedent and making sure that money that ought to be in the trust fund \nis in fact in the trust fund, and that any sort of exemption we have is \nto make all those exemptions and/or subsidies perfectly consistent.\n  I have found the unfounded criticism of the legislation that has come \nout of my committee falling into two categories: First, the general \nfund money is going into the trust fund. In other words, nonroad-\nrelated money is going into the road fund and the highway fund, the \ntrust fund, the transportation fund, whatever you might want to call \nit. Second, the Senate Finance Committee has made changes that are in \nfact not legitimate changes but are gimmicks.\n  Let me respond to those. This response is not much different from \nwhat I would have stated last week. In response to the argument that \ngeneral fund money is going into the trust fund, under the Finance \nCommittee amendment no general revenue is transferred to the highway \ntrust fund. We keep hearing this incorrect allegation. I encourage the \ncritics to read the Finance Committee title of the transportation bill.\n  Under the Finance Committee amendment, the highway trust fund will \nretain more excise taxes. It is not general fund revenue. That is \nexcise taxes. And excise taxes go into this trust fund. We accomplish \nthis by eliminating the partial exemption for ethanol-blended fuel. \nEthanol-blended fuel users will now pay the full excise tax and the \ntrust fund will receive the\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\nmoney. The benefit will be taken as a tax credit against the general \nfund. And just to verify that this is a totally consistent policy, this \nis exactly as all other energy production incentives are handled.\n  Likewise, the trust fund, as a second source of revenue, will retain \nthe excise taxes collected from certain users, such as exemptions that \nare given to State and local governments. Those vehicles use our \nhighways, use our transportation systems; should they not be paying \ntaxes? Should that money not be going into the road fund?\n  Under the Finance Committee amendment, the refund is not charged to \nthe highway trust fund, so that every mile that a city of Des Moines \nvehicle puts on, that money would go into the road fund, just like the \ngas tax I pay for the car I drive on the highways in the State of Iowa.\n  Again, this means, then, that the trust fund retains more of the \nexcise taxes. So let's be clear. The Finance Committee amendment does \nnot transfer general revenue to the trust fund.\n  The second argument is that we have used accounting gimmicks. We hear \nthe allegations that the Finance Committee is doing this many times on \nthe floor of the Senate. It is an unfair, incorrect allegation. What \nthe Finance Committee did in our amendment to this transportation bill \nwas to ensure that the trust fund keeps more of excise taxes that \nshould actually be in the trust fund and should be spent on our \ntransportation system.\n  The Finance Committee also recognized that the trust fund should earn \ninterest on its balance. You know, just like we are telling our senior \ncitizens all the time, that surplus in the Social Security payroll \ntaxes coming in, that is not being paid out currently, is invested in \nTreasury bonds. The interest on that is accumulated and accounted to \nthe Social Security trust fund. So doesn't it make sense to ensure that \nany surplus in the transportation fund--and there must be some surplus \nto cover shortages after September 11 when people didn't drive as much \nand not as much road tax money was coming in--for items beyond what we \ncan plan for needs to be accounted? That surplus then earns interest. \nThat hasn't been accounted for in the highway fund. It now will be. \nThese changes align trust fund receipts with spending purposes.\n\n  There are policy initiatives that burden the highway trust fund that \nhave nothing to do with highway policy. We are going to unburden the \nhighway fund. These policy initiatives have, in fact, reduced highway \ntrust fund receipts, money that should have been available to build \nhighways, not available because of exemptions. We accommodate those \nexemptions. Accommodating an exemption, consistent with good accounting \npractices, is not a gimmick.\n  The effect is that these policy initiatives are carried in the \ngeneral fund where they belong. I heard one of my colleagues'--Senator \nMcCain--harsh criticism of the Finance Committee. Senator McCain's \ncommittee, the Commerce Committee, approved new spending of $7 billion \nin its programs. The Finance Committee didn't question the Commerce \nCommittee's needs and, without reservation, the Finance Committee found \na way to fund the needs of this specific committee doing their \nlegitimate work.\n  The Senator from Arizona legitimately put a burden on the Finance \nCommittee, and we accepted that responsibility within our jurisdiction, \nwithin our power, within our responsibility. We bore the Commerce \nCommittee's burden.\n  Now, after doing their work, the Finance Committee is criticized for \nwhat it did. It is easy to put burdens on others. It is easy to \ncriticize those who did the heavy lifting. It is a lot harder to find \nways to do the heavy lifting. But that is not their responsibility. \nThey did what they needed to do under the responsibilities of that \ncommittee for this transportation bill. I find no fault with what they \nhave done, and I assumed the responsibility as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, working with my 20 members, to make sure the money was \navailable.\n  This isn't just because that is something I assumed. This is \nsomething that last summer the leader of the Senate, Senator Frist, \nasked us to do. He got members of the Commerce Committee, the Banking \nCommittee, the Finance Committee, and the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee together and said that we needed to find something, a common \nground we could agree on or he didn't want to bring this bill to the \nfloor. That was last summer.\n  We didn't have time last year to get it done. We extended it until \nFebruary 29, but as far as I know, that same collegial assumption of \nresponsibility to produce good transportation policy is still in \neffect. The three committees decided what those programs should be and \nthe Finance Committee, the committee I chair, met our responsibilities.\n  Let's deal with reality for a second. As the cloture vote shows, the \nwill of the Senate is to provide resources at the levels provided by \nthese three authorizing committees. The Finance Committee did the job \nand provided funding at the outlay level. The Finance Committee \npreserved its role by maintaining the importance of the trust fund.\n  A week ago, I spoke to these points. I asked the critics, in light of \nwhere the Senate was on the numbers, how would you fix it? We have a \nfew vocal people throwing rocks at this bill. None of the rock throwers \nhave accepted my challenge and answered the challenge. What would you \ndo and have it be sustained by the Senate, particularly, as I stated \nlast week and I haven't said yet this week, when we did have that vote \nof 79 to 21 last year where there was a clear decision made by the \nSenate to spend a lot more money on transportation.\n\n  I was one of the 21 who felt we should not go that far, but how are \nyou going to argue with the Senate making a decision, with only 21 \ndissenting votes, that the Senate is wrong? I still may think they are \nwrong, but that doesn't change my responsibility to provide the revenue \nto meet the needs of the three committees, and I assumed that \nresponsibility. That is what we have done.\n  It is easy to criticize. It is a lot harder to legislate and do the \npeople's business, and that people's business I think is represented by \nthat 79-to-21 vote last year and by the work of the three authorizing \ncommittees--the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Banking \nCommittee, and the Commerce Committee--on how much money needs to be \nspent. It falls on my shoulders to do it. I have done it in a way that \nis consistent with the way excise tax money ought to be handled. It is \ndone in a way that any subsidy the Congress thinks ought to be \nestablished is done. What do you want me to do? Last week I said if you \ndon't like what we did, I am open to suggestion.\n  I have one promise that I made to my committee, in the meantime, \nabout the package that is before us. We followed the same policy that \nwe did in the tax bill of 2001, and that was to make some changes in \nthe payment of the corporate tax so that we would have a revenue-\nneutral bill coming before the committee. At least the leaders of the \nBudget Committee asked me and Senator Baucus during our committee's \ndeliberation to not use that source of revenue, and we are committed to \nresponding to that request. Beyond that, I think the bill voted out of \nthe committee stands, and it is one that meets our responsibility to \nthe Senate, to the leader who asked the four committees to work \ntogether, to the transportation needs of our Nation, and, most \nimportantly, in this body doing something in a bipartisan way which, if \nit isn't done, this body does not have a product for the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in my view--and I think it is the view of \nthe vast majority of the Members of the Senate and probably the \nmajority of Americans--this highway legislation is critical. It needs \npassing immediately. It is critical because our country so much depends \nupon our highways. The past highway legislation spent a good amount of \nmoney to help repair our roads, provide for new roads, bridges, and \nsafety. We know the importance of our infrastructure system.\n  This bill expired. We are now in an extension period. Because it \nexpired, we desperately need to pass replacement legislation.\n  It is also a jobs bill. This is a no-brainer. If we have lost--and \nnobody\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\ndisputes this figure--a couple to 3 million jobs in this country in the \nlast couple of years, we need to pass a bill that creates and provides \njobs. That is a highway bill. It does not take much brain power to \nfigure that one out.\n  I urge our colleagues to get on with it and pass highway legislation. \nWe should not let perfection be the enemy of the good. There may be one \nor two points--and they are not big points--that individual Senators \nmay want to have in this bill, but we should not let that get in the \nway. We should pass this legislation.\n  There are some Senators who say, oh, my gosh, this breaks the bank; \nit spends too much money. Respectfully, our President has suggested \nthis is too expensive and spends too much money. There is even talk of \na potential veto. Well, I doubt seriously that the President of the \nUnited States is going to veto this jobs bill. It just is not going to \nhappen. First, the President has not vetoed any bill in his \nPresidency--none. I doubt that his first veto would be the highway \nbill, a jobs bill.\n  Also, importantly, this bill does not increase the debt. It does not \nincrease the deficit. All of the revenue that will be spent for \nhighways is already paid for, except for a small portion of general \nrevenue that goes to pay for a portion of mass transit, but that was in \nthe budget resolution, and the budget resolution with respect to \nhighways does not increase our debt.\n  I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about that because for \nthose who say it breaks the bank, that is just not accurate. This bill \ndoes not do that. I might say, in my State of Montana, this is our jobs \nbill, this is our economic development bill. This creates and maintains \nabout 17,000 jobs in our State. We are a highway State. We do not have \na lot of people in our State compared to others and we have great \ndistances to travel, but we would like to have a highway program that \nenables us to get around in our State.\n  That is probably true for all of these folks from all around the \ncountry who come and visit Montana. They like to be able to travel on \nroads that do not have potholes. They want to be able to travel to \nvarious resorts in Montana to go skiing in the winter and backpacking \nand fishing, fly fishing, in the summer. My colleagues would be amazed \nthe number of people I meet who tell me they come to Montana, \nespecially in the summers, to go fishing and just have a good vacation. \nThey want the same highways in Montana that they will find in other \nStates of the Nation.\n  I just cannot say too strongly how much we need this legislation. I \nmight say, too, this has been a product of bipartisanship, which is so \nimportant. We all know that most anything of consequence that gets \npassed in the Senate is passed only when we work together, Republicans, \nDemocrats, House and Senate. That is this bill. That is this \nlegislation.\n\n  I take my hat off to the chairman of the EPW Committee, Senator \nInhofe, and to the ranking member, Senator Jeffords, who worked very \nclosely together.\n  I might also say that the money for this bill has to be authorized by \nthe Finance Committee. That is the committee of which I am the ranking \nmember, and the chairman of our committee just spoke preceding me. We \nhave all worked together, all four of us, on a bipartisan basis to get \na good highway bill passed. That is the only way we can do legislation, \nin my view.\n  The bill also corrects two mistakes. One of them currently--there are \na lot of them, but a lot of the money now that goes to the general fund \nshould go to the highway trust fund. For example, interest on the \nhighway trust fund currently goes to the general fund. Well, that does \nnot make any sense. It is interest on the highway trust fund. It should \ngo to the highway program. That is a no-brainer. The same with the \nethanol subsidy. There is a 2.5 percent deduction from the ethanol \nportion of the highway users tax that goes to general revenue. That \ndoes not make any sense. Folks who drive cars powered by gasohol drive \non highways just like people who drive cars powered by an ordinary gas \nengine. It seems to me that for anybody who drives on the highway, the \nexcise and gasoline taxes they pay should go to the highway trust fund. \nA portion of it should not go over to the general revenue. The Finance \nCommittee fixed that and there are some other changes as well.\n  To summarize, this is a good bill. It is needed. I urge my colleagues \nto pass it very quickly. The cloture vote was very reassuring. I think \nonly 11 Senators voted against cloture and that was because the \nremaining Senators who voted for cloture realized we have to proceed. \nWe have to get this bill passed; it is very important. I encourage my \ncolleagues to act accordingly.\n  I also thank my good friend, Senator Reid, from Nevada. He has worked \nhard on this bill, in a totally bipartisan way, knowing how important \nit is for Nevada. Nevada is a huge State. A lot of folks in Nevada live \nin Las Vegas and Reno, but I am sure the Senator would like to get up \nto the northern part of the State sometime, and this helps him do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I take a brief minute to express my appreciation, as I have \ndone in this Chamber before, to the chairman of the Finance Committee \nand the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senators Grassley and \nBaucus, for their outstanding work on this legislation.\n  For anyone to come to the floor and accuse the senior Senator from \nIowa and the senior Senator from Montana of being budget busters simply \ndoes not meet the facts of their careers. These two fine Senators are \nknown for pinching pennies. They are known as people who are concerned \nabout taxpayers' dollars, as indicated by the many disputes that have \narisen and the fact that we have criticized them a lot of times for not \ncoming up with enough money for different things.\n  For them to come forward on this bill means so much. It exemplifies \ntheir public service and also exemplifies the importance of this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Nevada. I \nthink he is one of the best Senators in this body and I think his \nstatement indicates--if one reads between the lines, listens to the \nmusic--why.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Miller are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to commend Senators Grassley and \nBaucus for the contributions they have made to this very important \nmeasure. They worked diligently to come up with the funding to pay for \nthe programs contained in this legislation. The Finance Committee has \nprovided the revenue to meet the needs of the three committees that \ncontributed to this bill. In doing so they protected revenue that \ndeserves to be in the highway trust fund and found appropriate ways to \noffset these costs. Through their hard work we can report that this \nbill is paid for.\n  Technically, a budget point of order can be lodged against this bill \nbecause a small amount of general revenue is needed. But I want all my \ncolleagues to remember that we have gone beyond the budget for the war, \nfor defense spending, and for tax cuts. Has the spending contained in \nthese type of measures resulted in the creation of U.S.-based jobs? \nThat is debatable. But this bill is a jobs bill. There is no doubt in \nanyone's mind that this bill will create many, many jobs. Should we \nbring this bill down over a small technicality? No. We should pass this \nbill today.\n  I yield the floor with full confidence that we will do so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the issue in the \nhighway bill on which Senator McCain raised a budget point of order. I \nam not sure I would have made it at this point, but a point of order is \nlegitimate. Frankly, if you believe in sustaining the budget, if you \nbelieve in a budget, this bill isn't paid for, and the budget point of \norder is well made.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the budget point of \norder even though I am relatively certain it will not pass. I have \ntried to restrain myself on making budget points of order. I think it \nis important that points of\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\norder be sustained. I thank my colleagues because almost every time \nlast year--about 60 times--budget points of order were sustained. As a \nresult, we saved hundreds of billions of dollars in spending. Now we \nfind ourselves confronting a highway bill.\n  I compliment Senator Jeffords and Senator Inhofe for their \nleadership. They have worked very hard to put together a bill with \nallocations and formulas which are fair in meeting our Nation's highway \nand bridge needs. I understand those needs are great, indeed. I \nunderstand they want to increase employment. I concur with the \nobjectives. They have worked long and hard to make that happen and to \ncome up with the funding formulas. I don't think Congress has worked as \nlong and hard on how to pay for it. I have heard compliments of our \ncolleagues, the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking \nmember. I compliment them as well. But the Finance Committee portion of \nthis bill doesn't pay for this bill that is before us. Those are just \nthe facts.\n  Somebody can say we think it is paid for, but I can tell you it is \nnot paid for. I will give you a couple of examples. Maybe I don't know \nhow to read, but I happen to be a member of the Finance Committee. The \nFinance Committee has revenue raisers to replenish the general revenue \nfund at about $22 billion, over 10 years. This bill is over 6 years. \nThe amount of money raised by this bill to replenish the general \nrevenue fund over 6 years is only $11 billion. It doesn't meet the gap.\n  If you look at the revenues on the scoring sheet that was handed out \nby the Joint Committee on Taxation of February 2, the corporate \nestimated tax payment due July through September of 2009 increased to \n119 percent of otherwise required amounts. That moves $11.4 billion \nfrom the year 2010 to the year 2009 so they can say we met our targets \nfor the first 6 years of the bill. That is a sham. That is a shell \ngame. To say that pays for this highway bill defies reality.\n  I told my friends--and they are my friends. Senator Grassley is one \nof my very best friends. I was elected at the same time Senator \nGrassley was elected. He and I will be very good friends long after \nthis bill. Senator Baucus and I are good friends.\n  But I think it does not pass the smell test. This shouldn't be \nenacted into law. They have assured me it won't be, that they will come \nup with a replacement. I haven't seen the replacement yet. But I just \ntry to look at the numbers and see if it adds up. The fact is right now \nit doesn't. Maybe there will be an amendment offered later by \nleadership, or maybe one offered by Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \nthat will pay for it. But right now, it doesn't. Right now, it relies \non this shell game of moving $11.4 billion from 2010 to 2009 and saying \nthat helps make it work. It doesn't.\n  I am amazed people think we are going to be able to get all of this \nhighway spending for nothing. This is a 46-percent increase over the \nlast highway bill, TEA-21. The President proposed 17 percent, but this \nis 46 percent. The House is proposing 72 percent. They talked about \nincreasing the gasoline tax to pay for it. But they did not. I am \nguessing they will have to come down. But where is the money coming \nfrom for the 46-percent increase? The Federal gasoline tax right now is \n18.3 cents. No one here has yet said let us increase the gasoline tax. \nThe President is opposed to that. I happen to agree with him. He thinks \nif States want to increase their gasoline taxes, let them do it. But \nright now we are saying we are going to increase Federal contract \nauthority and obligation authority, but we don't have any new money \ncoming in for it.\n  I looked at what the Finance Committee did. They came up with a bunch \nof transfers, most of which are taking money from general revenue funds \nand putting it into highway funds, some of which is sort of related to \nhighway and some not. That totals about $11 billion. It really comes up \nshort. Even if you said this escalating corporate estimated payment in \n2009 was legitimate--and it is not, and I wish somebody would come to \nthe floor and say that is very legitimate because it is not \nlegitimate--it is still short. So we are increasing the deficit.\n\n  It depends on whose baseline you are using to see how much we are \nincreasing the deficit, but the President forecasted the deficit at \n$500 billion-plus this year. This will increase that number. The \nPresident has deficit figures, estimates for this year $521 billion, \n$364 billion for the following year, and $268 billion for 2006. This \nbill is substantially higher than the President's number. Compared to \nthe funding that is actually in the fund, it is about $39 billion \nshortfall. Compared to the President's number, it is $29 billion. The \nPresident was pushing the numbers as far as he thought we could push \nthem without bankrupting the fund and without saying raid the general \nrevenue.\n  Let's look at what is coming into the fund right now. I mentioned we \nhave an 18.3 cent tax. Some is earmarked for transit, but if you add \nthe total amount of money coming into the fund, it is $228 billion over \nthe next 6 years. This bill would result in estimated outlays of $281 \nbillion. That is a difference of $53 billion. The Finance Committee \ncame up with about $11 billion from general revenue, increasing to $14 \nbillion including fuel fraud receipts to the trust fund, so $14 \nbillion. So there is a shortage. It is not paid for. It will increase \nthe deficit. I hope everyone understands that. I will hear a lot of \nspeeches saying this deficit is too high. I want Members to know this \nbill will increase the deficit. It is not paid for. If it was paid for, \nit would not be increasing the deficit. It will increase the deficit. \nThe total amount of money coming under this bill is $242 billion and \nthe outlays are estimated to be $281, and the contracts we are making \nare greater than $281 billion. The obligation limits are $290 and the \ntotal budget authority is $318, and $318 billion is about a 46 percent \nincrease over present law. We did not increase gasoline tax, so that is \ntoo big of an increase. It is not paid for.\n  The point of order made by my colleague from Arizona should be \nsustained. I am relatively certain it will not be sustained. I hope \npeople understand, in my opinion, we are making a mistake. We should \nuse user fees to pay for the highway program. If we break that link and \nsay highways should be financed out of general revenue funds such as \nincome taxes or payroll taxes, there is almost no limit to how much \nthis bill could cost.\n  There used to be a limitation on the highway program and the mass \ntransit program. You said users have to pay for the program; when you \nfill your car with gasoline, you are paying for the roads that you are \nusing. That makes sense. We will be breaking that link under this bill. \nWe are breaking it with general revenue financing and we are not paying \nfor it even at that.\n  Some Members, Senator Conrad or others, may have an amendment to pay \nfor it. That would probably be better than just deficit financing.\n  But we are making a mistake when we break the link between the user \npay and paying for highways or not. If people say, I want a 60 or 40-\npercent increase in gasoline tax, you want a 50-percent increase in the \nhighway program--this is almost 50 percent--you would have to increase \nthe gasoline tax by 9 cents. You want 50 percent more of a program, \nincrease the gasoline tax from 18 cents to 27 cents.\n  That is not what we are voting on. What we are voting on is \nincreasing the program by 46 percent and we will take some money out of \ngeneral revenues to pay for it. That puts more pressure on the deficit. \nI don't diminish for a second the good intentions of the authorizers \nwho are working to help build a national infrastructure that is in \ndesperate need of more resources. I do not denigrate their efforts one \niota. I compliment them. They worked a lot longer than we did on the \nFinance Committee to pay for it. Again, I am not disparaging the work \nof the chairman and ranking member, but it falls short and it needs to \nbe improved. It will not fund this bill. It relies on a shell game of \nat least $11.5 billion.\n  They said they are trying to raise $22 billion to replenish the fund \nand they do that over 10 years and we find about $11.4 billion is a \nshell game. It does not meet the needs of financing the bill if people \nwant to say legitimately the bill is paid for.\n  We have to be honest. We have to say this bill is taking a lot of \nmoney out of general revenues and it will increase the deficit to pay \nfor the 46-percent increase in highways. People need to know just the \nfacts. People are always\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\nentitled to their own opinion, but I don't think they are entitled to \ntheir own facts. The facts are this is a tremendously large increase in \nthe highway program that is not yet paid for and will increase the \ndeficit. Therefore, I urge our colleagues to vote in favor of the \nbudget point of order later this afternoon.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We are talking about rates of increase from the last \ntransportation bill to this bill, 43 percent. The President is \nproposing a level of spending. What does this represent as an increase \nover the last?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The President's proposal increases from $218 billion to \n$257 billion, an increase of 17 percent.\n  Mr. CRAIG. There is a 17-percent growth rate above current levels of \nexpenditures. Is that annualized?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Over the 6 years, a 17-percent increase. The bill before \nthe Senate in contract authority is an increase of 46 percent.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is annualized?\n  Mr. NICKLES. It is 46 percent over the 6-year period. You have a 6-\nyear bill. The bill that just expired, TEA-21, was $218 billion over \n1998-2003. This new bill will be a total of, for contract authority, \n$308 billion; total budget authority would be $318 billion.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was gone during part of the discussion \non this issue. I would like to reemphasize a couple points. First of \nall, when we talk about 40 percent or 43 percent, we are talking about \nover a 6-year period. Generally we are in the mindset of talking about \nfrom year to year down here, and there are people walking around \nthinking we are talking about a 40-percent increase. We are talking \nabout, if you would amortize it and put it the way we normally discuss \nthings, 6.2 percent a year. This is in infrastructure, things you see \nout there. I think people need to understand that.\n  Secondly, those of us who were in the business of putting together \nthis bill over the last year, along with its formula and everything \nelse that is being criticized, considered all these things. Then we \nwent, as we should, to the Finance Committee and said: All right, how \nare we going to pay for this? And, yes, we can do it. I do not want to \nget inside the minds of Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus as to what \nconsiderations they were making during this time, but I will say this, \nthey are the guys who are running the Finance Committee.\n  They have said this bill is going to be paid for. They have said the \nthree criterion the administration sent down some time ago--that, No. \n1, it would not increase gas taxes; No. 2, it would not have any fun-\nand-games type of bonding fixes; and, No. 3, it would not add to the \ndeficit--is met.\n  There are 100 people in this Chamber, and I know there can be any \nnumber of them who are going to disagree. But I believe if we take this \nto the committees that have the jurisdiction, have the expertise, have \nthe resources, have the personnel, have the staffers who can put these \nthings together, that is the place it should be, and they have given us \nthe assurance this bill will be paid for.\n  We just had a vote today. We defeated an amendment that would have \nincreased the amount of money by $7.25 billion in this bill. In other \nwords, the transportation portion of this, the highway portion of this, \nwould go up from $255 billion to $262.25 billion. I think a lot of \npeople who voted in favor of that amendment are the same ones who are \ntalking now about the fact this is too much.\n  I know we have the genuine division of interpretations as to what the \nFinance Committee did and how this thing is really going to be paid \nfor. But I have often said--in fact, I said to the administration that, \nto me, instead of coming down and saying this bill is going to have to \nbe $50 billion less, I would think they would be better off to say: So \nlong as the bill is paid for, does not add to the deficit, does not \nincrease taxes, then we would support it, we would not veto it. I am \nhoping before this thing is over that is where we will be.\n  Let's keep in mind one other thing, too. We are sending a bill to \nconference. In conference all kinds of things happen. I had occasion to \nspeak with the Speaker of the House at length yesterday. We understand \nwhen it gets into conference we are going to be able to look at this \nand take everything into consideration. At that point, we will be able \nto really evaluate this finance package and see where we are. There is \nno one out there who is going to say: I want deficit spending. I do \nnot. That has never been my philosophy. I think the senior Senator from \nOklahoma has known me well for many years, and he has heard me say for \nmany years that we, who are fiscal conservatives, are big spenders in \ntwo particular areas: One is in national defense and the other is in \ninfrastructure.\n  As I have heard different individuals such as from Arizona and Texas, \nI am reminded of what happened during the Thanksgiving holidays and the \nChristmas holidays. We are used to this in Oklahoma. I can remember \nsomeone saying: Well, I came from California. As I came across Arizona, \nthey had such great roads. I came across Texas and everything was \ngreat. I sure could tell when I got to Oklahoma. They had lousy roads. \nThat is what we have been plagued with for a long time. Our bridges in \nthe State of Oklahoma are dead last of the 50 States.\n  This is a spending bill that is paid for. It does not increase the \ndeficit, in the opinion of the Finance Committee. I take their word for \nit, and I know others may not. For that reason I know this discussion \nis good, but we need to move along.\n  We are going to be moving along. There is much more cooperation on \nthe floor now. I have to say, this has not been a partisan fight. This \nhas been something where there are honest philosophic disagreements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe and I have been in touch with \na number of Senators on the other side. What we would like to do is \nhave anyone who wants to speak on waiving the point of order do that, \nand then, when that is done, we are going to ask consent to set aside \nthe waiver and go to the next amendment, which would be Senator Kyl, \nwho has another amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand from one of the proponents of the budget \npoint of order they do not wish to concur to setting aside the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. OK. That settles that. I would advise all Senators, then, \nwe will not be able to vote on this until maybe a little before 2 \no'clock. Both leaders have indicated there are people who have problems \nwith being here, and they have agreed to let them not be here, so we \nwill try to speed that up and get to Senator Kyl as quickly as we can.\n  I would say this: If there is no more debate and it is completed on \nthe point of order waiver, rather than sit in a quorum call, I would \nsuggest maybe Senator Kyl could talk about his amendment to just speed \nthings up when we finish the point of order vote.\n  I want to say to everyone here, I think sometimes mornings are a \nlittle testy around here. I think, as the day has gone on, we have \nworked out an arrangement where, to this point at least, we have had \nup-or-down votes, and we are going to continue to do that for the \nforeseeable future. The main thing Senator Inhofe and the rest of the \nmanagers and I want to do is make sure people feel they have had a fair \nshake here. We hope we are accomplishing that. We are certainly trying.\n  I indicated to the Senator from Arizona that at the appropriate \ntime--and probably this is an appropriate time--I would talk publicly \nabout statements I made on the floor yesterday. There was some, I \nthink, very serious debate yesterday, and I indicated during that \ndebate the Senator from Arizona was--I think the words I used were ``at \nthe\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\nbeck and call of the White House.'' I would like the Record to reflect \nthat was a poor choice of words, that the Senator from Arizona on many \noccasions has been independent on issues the White House has propounded \nand advocated.\n  And so without belaboring the point, if there is an apology that is \nnecessary, I am certainly willing to do that and apologize to my friend \nfrom Arizona, who I have the highest regard for. If I did anything to \nhurt his feelings, embarrass him or--in hindsight, it does not make me \nlook very good to be name-calling. That is basically a subtle way of \nname-calling, and I apologize for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the \nwords of my colleague from Nevada. I would like to make two points. \nFirst of all, when my staff showed me this morning the words of the \nSenator from Nevada--and they seemed to be very concerned about it--\nthey probably were a little astonished that my reaction was not \nparticularly negative. I said: Look, people say things on the floor not \nexactly the way they meant to express them, and I simply attribute it \nto that. Then I chuckled. The Senator from Nevada and I talked a bit \nabout it, because I said: My friends at the White House might wonder \nwhat on Earth the Senator from Nevada was talking about when they \nappreciate the fact that I don't support the amount of funding in the \nhighway bill even that the President supports, that I don't support the \namount of the funding in the energy bill, and in some cases I have been \nkind of a royal pain for folks in the administration.\n  I try to support the President all I can, and I do support the \nPresident a lot, but we all find ourselves sometimes in opposition to \nthe administration, sometimes in support of the administration. But I \ndo appreciate the sentiment of the Senator from Nevada. He certainly \ndid not mean to suggest, I know, that I only do things if the President \nwishes them. I appreciate his comments just now.\n  I also appreciate what else he said, which is the debate has been \nconstructive, that there has been a process to try to get amendments to \nvotes. Just to reiterate that, and describe what I think might happen \nhere next, the budget point of order my colleague from Arizona raised a \nmoment ago has been amended by the Senator from Missouri. I checked \nwith the staff for Senator McCain, and he has no objection to having \nthat vote at or about 2 o'clock, depending upon what the managers of \nthe bill wish to do in that regard. He would be prepared, as I \nunderstand it, to come to the floor just before then to make closing \ncomments about that point of order.\n\n  I also know Senator Graham is here and wishes to speak. Rather than \nlay aside the pending business, my suggestion would be to go ahead with \nthat, have any other people speak on it who wish. The managers should \ncertainly be the ones who determine what time the vote is. I will \nsimply express what Senator McCain's staff has told me, which is that \nhe has no objection to voting at or about 2 o'clock and would presume \nto be here for a few minutes ahead of that time to speak on this budget \npoint of order.\n  Then presumably following that, if there is not a Democrat who wishes \nto offer an amendment at that time, I would like to offer an amendment \nwhich should not take very long to debate and would be happy to have a \nvote on that amendment as soon as debate time is concluded. I mean \nperhaps half an hour or something in that timeframe. I don't know who \nall might want to speak on it, but I don't have that much time left, \nand I want to save a little bit of time to speak on other business as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I must say this has been \na very interesting first year in the Senate. Our country has been \nchallenged in many ways. I have listened to this debate about the \nhighway bill. If I were a citizen of Oklahoma, I would be pretty proud. \nYou have two Senators down here expressing different points of view but \nin a very articulate way.\n  The problems Senator Inhofe related in Oklahoma are very real in \nSouth Carolina. We are billions short of the money we need for bridges \nand roads. It is an honest-to-God legitimate problem. This is not about \ngetting reelected. When people say that, I disassociate myself with \nthat. This is about trying to do some good for the country \neconomically.\n  One good thing about the highway bill that needs to be said more is, \nit is not just about jobs. That is very important. But another thing \nfor sure, these jobs are going to be here. When you pave these roads \nand you build these bridges, most of the time, if not all the time, \nAmericans are going to be doing the jobs.\n  One of the reasons we have had a kind of jobless recovery is that the \njobs that are being created are being created overseas. When you look \nat trying to create a domestic opportunity for somebody to go to work, \na bill such as this is an excellent opportunity for people to go to \nwork.\n  Whether or not it busts the budget, I have had a fascinating \nopportunity, sitting in the chair for the last hour, to try to figure \nall that out. Senator Nickles is going to be sorely missed by this \nbody. I find him to be an extremely smart, capable person. Senator \nGrassley and Senator Nickles are very good friends. I like them \nboth. Senator Grassley took the floor about the bill being paid for.\n\n  Here is where I come down. The President has made a decision for the \nfirst time in his Presidency to threaten to veto a bill if it goes \nabove $256 billion. To the defense of the people in the Senate, there \nhas been a little bit of bait and switch here. The White House at one \npoint in time was not so inflexible in growing the number. I don't know \nwhat has happened there, but something has happened. My best guess is \nthat the President sees a trend that is pretty disturbing to our party \nand maybe the country in general. We have lost sight of our fiscal \nresponsibilities. The deficit is larger than anyone would like. It is \ngoing to grow.\n  The things we have done in the past have all been necessary. A \nprescription drug benefit can save you money because if you keep people \nout of the hospital with a prescription drug, that is a lot better than \nhaving to treat them in the hospital. But at the end of the day I voted \nno on that bill because I believed that by the way we set it up, \nutilization rates would go through the roof.\n  I am totally convinced that the marketplace works in two ways: It can \nbring out the best in people or the worst. If you have a dollar \ncopayment, if you make under $12,000 a year as a senior--and a lot of \npeople are in that situation--your payment under the Medicare \nprescription drug bill is $1. That is it. I just really believe that \npeople are going to start using drugs at a higher rate and that if you \nare in the middle of the pack, as a middle-income senior, this is not \nthat great a deal. The donut hole will be filled in because of \npolitical pressure. The means test is a great idea and the health \nsavings accounts is a great idea, if we can hang on to them.\n  At the end of day, my fear was that the Medicare bill would not be \n$395 billion; it would explode. Even in my wildest dreams, I never \nbelieved it would explode by some $130 billion in a week. So the \nestimate of 395 is now 534.\n  Let me tell people in South Carolina about these estimates. It is a \nguess at best. It is an educated guess. The deficit is an educated \nguess. Two years ago we had trillions of dollars of surpluses as far as \nthe eye could see over a 10-year period. The truth is, you really can't \ngovern based on what is going to happen 10 years from now because you \nreally don't know. You can govern pretty well if you will watch every \nyear or every couple years where you are and project down the road and \nnot let this thing get out of hand.\n  The highway bill is not like the farm bill. The farm bill was \nspecial-interest driven even more than the highway bill. I wound up \nvoting for the farm bill. The amount of money we spent on the farm bill \nwas more than I felt comfortable with, but I wound up voting for it \nbecause I am trying to get my legs here as a new Senator.\n  Senator Inhofe and Senator Grassley were the two leading proponents \nof the tax cuts. I am very glad I voted for the tax cuts because I \nthink they have helped the American economy. But we are going to have \nto make a decision in\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\nlight of everything we have done in the last year--the war, the tax \ncuts, because it does take money away from the budget in the short \nterm, but it has helped the economy--how far do we go down this road, \nno pun intended.\n  I guess I have made a decision. I have made a decision that the \nPresident's desire to not see this bill grow over 256 is probably a \ngood decision. You hate to do it on a bill where so many people have \nworked so hard to address legitimate needs and to clean up the mess of \nhighway funding. Senator Inhofe, his colleagues, and his ranking member \nshould take great pride in the fact that they have taken the funding of \nhighways that was kind of a hodgepodge and made it more professional. \nYou brought money back into the highway trust fund that should have \nbeen there all along. You have taken interest payments on highway trust \nfund moneys that went to the general revenue and you have brought them \nback. I congratulate you for trying to build a stronger fund because we \nneed a stronger fund.\n\n  Here is the really hard part for me as a conservative. The average \nperson in my State works until about May, or now almost June, to pay \ntaxes. If you are out there working for a living, when you add up your \nState tax and local tax and Federal tax and you look at your pay, it \ntakes you almost half the year before you start working for yourself. \nSo the last thing I want to do is come up here and put another burden \non people.\n  The worst thing I could do is come up here and lie to people. This is \nthe truth: Our highway funding needs are far in excess of the money \ncoming in from the gas tax, the mass transit taxes. We are trying to \nget more money back into the pot, and I don't want to use general \nrevenue.\n  The reason I don't want to use general revenue is that it would be a \nbad principle. If you start using general revenue to fund highways, \nthen you will just have total budget chaos. The authors of this bill \nhave tried to avoid that as best they can. They put money back into the \nfund. In their opinion, it is not enough.\n  We are at war. The Senate highway bill is increased by 43 percent. I \nam sure every penny could be used in a legitimate manner. But when you \ndo the family budget and when you do your budget back home at a \nbusiness entity, to raise one area by 43 percent would be a very \ndifficult task to do to keep the budget balanced. As much as I would \nlike to get money into Oklahoma and South Carolina in a more robust \nfashion, I don't believe a 43 percent increase, given our financial \ndilemma up here with the war and other problems, is going to be \nfiscally sound.\n  With the President's increase of 18 percent and 43--I hope we can \nreach a compromise. The House version of 70 percent is not going to \nhappen. The key issue is, how can you get more money in the trust funds \nwithout raising taxes? Down the road, I don't see how you do that. So \nsome time in the near future, America is going to have to come to grips \nwith a couple of competing concepts. The war on terrorism was \nunexpected in many ways, in terms of its scope and cost. Maybe it \nshould not have been, but it was. Every day we are trying to get better \nin fighting that war. We have spent a lot of money we did not plan to \nspend but couldn't afford not to spend. That is on the deficit.\n  The recession is finally over. That has been hurting our revenues. As \nI see it, as a fairly new Member of this body, future budgeting is \ngoing to be tough to get this thing back to balance in my lifetime. We \nare going to have to do some things we have never done before. I think \nthere have been a lot of creative things done to the trust fund to make \nit more solvent in the future.\n  This is a bridge too far for me. I want to build bridges, but there \nare too many being built given our other needs right now. Probably, \nover time, conservatives are going to have to come to grips with a gas \ntax increase, which is going to be the only legitimate and honest way \nto make up the shortfalls in terms of our highway needs in this \ncountry. You can play with the numbers all day long, but a legitimate, \nhonest debate over whether we need new revenue has been had in this \nbill. The question is how to do it.\n  I think this bill borrows money. This bill is not paid for. The point \nof order is legitimate. I am not blaming anybody because the needs are \nreal. But some day, somehow, somewhere, we are going to have to start \nsaying no to something. The President has chosen to say no to this \napproach to highway funding.\n  This President has not vetoed a bill since he has been in office. \nWhether or not he will veto this particular bill, I don't know. But his \nletter was correct in terms of his concerns about the way we are going \nas a Nation, in terms of spending. I hope and pray we can work out a \ncompromise between the House and Senate and the President that will do \nmost of the things Senator Inhofe would like to do, because those are \nlegitimate concerns. They will not be able to get everything they want, \ngiven the amount of money we have to spend. That is probably true of \npeople in South Carolina who voted for me or did not vote for me. This \nyear, you are not going to get everything you would like because times \nare tough.\n  My hope is if we cannot do a 6-year bill we can agree on, which will \nwithstand the highway road building projects in a way that will allow \nthings to go forward, we will come back next year after the election \nand look at some long-term solutions. That is my hope. At the end of \nthe day, I think the President will veto this bill, and it will be a \ndebate that probably needs to be had about how far you can go before \nyou literally not only break the bank but make it impossible for the \nbank to be restored.\n  I know a lot of people have worked long and hard. Senator Grassley \nwas given the job of trying to come up with some offsets, and he is \nright, it is hard to do. I think Senator Inhofe has looked at the \nhighway trust fund every way you can look at it to try to make it more \nsound and secure and to get legitimate revenue into the pot. \nUnfortunately, at the end of the day, the amount of money we are going \nto spend has a deficit component, in my opinion. I may be wrong. But \nthe President sees it that way. The politics of this bill is probably \nthe most important decision we will make this year in terms of domestic \nspending. If we can resolve this issue in a way that maintains budget \nintegrity and gets money out into the country to create jobs, we have \nset a good tone for the rest of the year. But if the political \ndiscourse about this bill at the end of the day divides us along many \nlines, and creates an us-versus-them attitude and we try to say one \nside is good and the other side is bad--that is about where we are \nright now--the prospect of a consensus down the road to maintain the \nfiscal discipline we need to balance the budget one day I think will be \nlost. I don't know how it happened, but it has happened.\n\n  All the forces that are in play post-9/11 and before are coming \ntogether on this bill--the obligation of the country to defend itself, \nthe obligation of the country to make itself economically viable by \nimproving infrastructure, the moral duty for one generation not to put \nso many burdens on the next so that they cannot survive, making hard \ndecisions that are inconsistent with some of the things you have said \nas a politician in the past, like raising taxes--all of those concepts \nare coming to bear on this bill. To me, this bill and how we resolve it \nis a test of character as much as it is of anything else.\n  Do we have the ability to set aside our individual hopes and dreams, \nwhatever they may be--whether deficit reduction, highway spending, \nnever having a tax increase, whatever drives your train--can we find \nsome common ground? If we leave the playing field having a veto that \nwas overridden, the consequences to this country, not just the \nRepublican Party, are extremely serious because if we cannot control it \non highways, as popular as that might be, how will we ever control it \nwhen it comes time to repair Social Security?\n  That trust fund is $5 trillion short of the money it needs to \nmaintain solvency by 2042. By 2075, that trust fund is $75 trillion \nshort of the money it needs to maintain solvency. Those are numbers \nbeyond comprehension. How did we get into that mess? Both parties, in \nmy opinion, have played games with the real problem of Social Security, \nbecause nobody in the past has really wanted to embrace the looming \nproblem Social Security faces. Why? It is very hard in any election \ncycle to talk about Social Security, because people who are on it get \nscared to death.\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\n  I was born in 1955. There were over 16 workers for every retiree when \nI was born. Today, there are three workers for every retiree. Twenty \nyears from now, there are going to be two workers for every retiree.\n  The point I am making is Social Security has a problem that is not \ncreated by the Republican or Democratic Party. Social Security is \nfunded by payroll taxes. That is the exclusive source of money coming \ninto Social Security. The highway trust fund is funded by gasoline \ntaxes. If you think the highway bill is a problem, trying to live \nwithin these numbers, you have not seen anything yet when it comes to \nSocial Security. The consequences of having 2 workers for every retiree \nversus 16 for every retiree when I was born are huge.\n  In 2042, which is not that far away, the only way we can keep the \nchecks coming is to reduce benefits across the board by 28 percent or \ndouble taxes. To sit on the sidelines for the next 30 years and argue \nwith each other is unacceptable because after 2042, it gets worse. The \nhighway bill has a similar problem but not nearly as dramatic. I think \nevery dollar we will spend in this highway bill has a legitimate \npurpose.\n  If we overspend this year, if we go to 43 percent this year and add \nto the deficit and not have a fiscally sound plan to save the highway \ntrust fund, we set in motion the forces that come back to haunt us. If \nwe could solve the highway problem in a bipartisan fashion, then maybe \nwe will solve Social Security in a bipartisan fashion. But the truth is \nthat the highway needs, the infrastructure needs of this country cannot \nbe maintained at the current rate of revenue flowing into the trust \nfund. That problem gets worse over time, not better.\n  I do not want to pass on every problem on my watch to somebody else. \nI would like to be thought of as somebody who at least embraced a few \nproblems on my watch in a serious way and did things outside the box. \nThere is nothing outside the box about trying to create offsets. We do \nthat all the time. There has been some outside-the-box thinking about \nthis trust fund and recapturing money, and that will make this trust \nfund more solvent and more sound over time.\n  At the end of the day, in my humble opinion, we can't afford, at this \npoint in our Nation's history, with a looming deficit that seems to \nhave no end, a nation at war that seems to have no end in the short \nterm, to increase spending on something as meritorious as highways at \nthis level now this way. That is why I think this vote on this bill \nwill define us for the rest of this year and maybe in years to come.\n  I am totally convinced of the following: That if the leaders of the \nHouse and the Senate sat down with the President, we could find a way \nto put new money into the trust fund, get through this conflict, and \nnext year talk about some new funding that would be permanent over \ntime. I think that is possible. I hope that happens because the quality \nof the people with whom we are dealing are capable of doing that. I \nwill not be in that room as a junior member.\n  I just have one vote, and my vote will be cast for a purpose. It is \nnot to deny anybody a chance to improve their State or for us to \nimprove the economy through better infrastructure. I will vote no, and \nhopefully the President will have some support for his veto threat. \nThat ``no'' vote is cast to say let's look at a different way, a better \nway of resolving this issue. This, right now, is sheer, tough politics.\n  People wonder: If they vote no, will they lose all their highway \nprojects. That won't be up to me. People have to choose the path they \nthink is best to manage their bills and to run the Senate. But I can \nsay for absolute certainty that the best way for me to go home and get \nreelected is to be me. I am not going to try to change and become \nsomething overly opposite of what I ran on. So I believe if I vote no \nwith the proposition that 43 percent is more than the taxpayers can \nafford right now in terms of retiring the deficit over time, that this \nis a bridge too far, most people will agree with me.\n  That is my hope; that is my bet. But if they don't, I am still going \nto vote no because the reason I was sent here, I assume, was to use the \nbest judgment I can muster. And the best judgment I can muster after \nhaving listened to this debate, which I think has been good and \nhealthy, is that this highway bill has been innovative. We have done \nsome things to make the trust fund sound, and the needs are real, but \nwe are going too far. We are putting too much pressure, combined with \nthe other actions that we have taken, on future generations, and \nsomebody sometime has to say: Whoa.\n  That is what I intend to do--to cast my vote with the idea of let's \nlook at this in a new and different way in light of the rest of our \nproblems.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I thank you for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I compliment the \nSenator from South Carolina on his comments. I, too, will be voting no \non this motion to waive. As a member of the Finance Committee who \nworked on this legislation, I just want to say that the reports about \nthis bill not being paid for are accurate. There are games clearly \nbeing played to try to move money from one year to the next, to cover \nup money by moving money from the year 2010 to 2009 and pretending this \nis new money. In fact, this increases the deficit in 2010 because it is \noutside the window of what this bill deals with; it is only a 6-year \nbill.\n  We have provisions that increase taxes in areas that have nothing to \ndo with transportation in order to fund transportation dollars. I know \na lot of people don't care about that. Most people in this Chamber, \nobviously, by their votes are not going to care about that. We \nincreasingly care less and less how things are funded around here. At \none time around here we were actually concerned about that.\n  I admit, I am guilty on my own account having voted for this Medicare \nbill we just passed where we increasingly, over time--it took us a \nwhile--increasingly over time we separated the funding taxes and stream \nfor Medicare from the money we actually spent on Medicare because the \ndemand was so great to provide Medicare services that we decided just \nto fudge and lose a little general fund revenues, then a little more, a \nlittle more, and then a lot more and a lot more, and all of a sudden \nnow the Medicare Program has grown and the vast majority of it is now \nfunded, in large part, by general fund revenues. It has no relation to \nthe Medicare tax that we pay. That is only a small part of the program, \nas it turns out.\n  Highways and transit have always been funded historically by user \nfees. Most of it is gasoline taxes, but there are other excise taxes \nand special taxes that are put on transportation. Why? Because the \nconcept was we were going to create a Federal gas tax and collect money \nfrom the users.\n  One of the points we hear over and over is this is a user fee. It is \nnot a general tax, but we are going to tie the amount of money we \ncollect to the people who use it, and that makes sense. Those who use \nthe roads should pay for the roads, and the costs should be passed \nalong to those who benefit from the use of the roads, from the \nbusinesses that pay the taxes and individuals, for that matter. There \nwas always this nexus, and that stood us in stead.\n  The argument was made for years around here that we were paying more \ntaxes than we needed to pay because we weren't spending all the money \nthat was coming in, and that was a legitimate complaint we had two \ntransportation bills ago to spend all the money that was coming in and \nnot use some of these gas taxes to pay for other Government spending to \nhide the real cost of Government.\n  I supported that because I supported the concept that when someone is \nbeing taxed on gasoline and other excise taxes, that money should be \nused to improve the roads on which they are driving.\n  We were able to accomplish that 12 years ago. Six years ago we said \nwe not only are going to take all that money, but the money that \naccumulated over time, we are going to spend that down. I thought: That \nis really a general fund transfer, but legitimately that money was put \nin there for that purpose. OK, I will support that.\n  Now we are saying there is no more money left in the trust fund, \nthere are no more revenues coming, but we still want to spend more. \nWhy? Well, I have developed an axiom in Washington and\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\nthat is: Never get between a Congressman and asphalt because you are \ndestined to get run over. And that is exactly what is happening in the \nSenate and the Congress.\n  There are a few of us who will soon be roadkill on the Senate floor, \nwho are going to try to get between a Congressman and a Senator and the \nability to go back home and say look what wonderful road projects I am \ndelivering.\n  I am for road projects. I am for transit projects. I believe we need \nto improve our infrastructure. I just think we need to be honest how we \nare paying for it. So let's be honest about it. We are not paying for \nit.\n  Now, if any of my colleagues went home, as I did, over the break, one \nof the things they probably heard over and over again was the \nprofligate spending that is going on in Washington, DC. Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, there is no difference between us, we are all just \nspending money like there is no tomorrow and there is no deficit.\n  So many of us came back saying there is a point where we need to rein \nthis in. We have huge deficits that go off in the future. It is time \nfor us to start drawing the line, and it is important not just because \nwe have huge deficits but it is important to signal to the markets, it \nis important to signal to those who value our currency, that we are not \ngoing to allow this fiscal irresponsibility to continue; that we are \nnot going to continue spending at outrageous rates of growth like the \n45 percent increases that are in this bill.\n  I think it is unfortunate that the highway bill is in the crosshairs \nbecause this is a bill that is very important. I understand that. But \nlet's be honest about it. The signal we are sending is; the throttle is \nstill wide open; we are going to spend, spend, spend. Of course, we \nwill justify it by saying a whole host of things about how important \nthis is to our economy and all the other things, but the bottom line is \nwe are spending a ton of money and we are not paying for it. We are \nadding to the deficit and we are doing something very dangerous, which \nis taking money from the general fund to fund highway programs.\n  I think it is wrong. That is why there is a budget point of order \nagainst this bill. Now, I understand we are not going to succeed \nbecause this amendment or this point of order gets between a \nCongressman and asphalt. Most amendments will fail when that is the \ncase.\n  The bottom line is, somebody somewhere in this Senate is going to \nhave to start getting between Members of the Senate and House and the \nprojects they want to deliver back home. Otherwise, this deficit is \njust the beginning of problems.\n  I had an opportunity to spend a little time with the President up in \nPennsylvania this morning. I had a chance to chat with him just briefly \nabout this legislation. Let me assure my colleagues, any Member of this \nSenate who thinks they are going to go back home and get a bill that is \n$290 billion or $318 billion or $375 billion, which is what the House \nwas talking about, they may be able to do it but they are going to have \nto do it by overriding a veto.\n  Again, that is the old axiom that maybe the President is going to try \nto stand between a Congressman and asphalt. The President has a pretty \nbig roadblock that has to be gotten through, and I am one Senator who \nis going to support that roadblock because I believe we have to at some \npoint start to say fiscal responsibility matters and we are not doing \nit.\n\n  I would rather have us have a vote on the floor of the Senate right \nnow about gas taxes. If my colleagues want to fund this program, fund \nit by putting a gas tax in place. Where is the courage of the people \nwho say we need more roads to pay for the roads? That is the problem we \nhave. We always want to spend more money, do more things, and we do not \nwant anybody to pay for it today. Whether it is Medicare, highways, or \nwhatever the case may be, it is spend more now, get the political \nbenefit, and pass on the bill to that future generation that, by the \nway, I do not have to worry about because I am not going to be running \nwhen they are voting; I can always give them something and pass it on \nto the next generation and they will not be mad at me.\n  At some point, this Ponzi scheme is going to come up. In my mind, \nthis is a Ponzi scheme. It is wrong.\n  Now, I admit--and I am going to talk about this later, not now, \nbecause this is a debate on the budget point of order--this is a bad \nbill for a lot of reasons. One is because it uses general fund \nrevenues. No. 2, it raises the deficit. It is not paid for. There is \nalso a reason I will talk about later, which is what it does to my \nState, which is a grave injustice. It is counter to everything.\n  This entire area of funding transportation projects from Washington, \nDC, which is a fairly recent phenomenon, the whole idea was to \nfacilitate national security and defense but also interstate commerce.\n  What does that mean? That means States that shoulder the burden of \ncarrying cross traffic should get paid by other States that do not have \nthat burden but get the benefits of it. I daresay there is no State in \nthe Union that carries more cross traffic than Pennsylvania. Yet we \nbecome a donor State under this bill, which is an outrage. That is a \nparochial interest about which I will talk at another time.\n  The philosophical and, I believe, fiscal reasons to oppose this bill \nhave been laid out clearly by several people in the Chamber. It is \nwrong. We will lose, but ultimately the American economy will lose. The \nimpact and ripple effect of this bill, which will send a signal to \nthose who are looking at the Congress of the United States to see \nwhether we are going to constrain spending, will be profound and will \nmultiply innumerable times the number of job losses versus the job \ncreation in this bill. This is a bad jobs bill, and we need to put an \nend to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I probably will not win this vote since I \nthink the sentiments of many of the Members were expressed in the \ncloture vote, but I think it is important to point out again that the \ntotal spending in this bill exceeds the current budget resolution by \n$35.5 billion. We are facing a $500 billion deficit for the year 2005. \nIn the Armed Services Committee hearing the other day, the Secretary of \nDefense pointed out that they will be coming in for a supplemental \nappropriation, many billions of dollars, after the elections, probably \nsometime in January. Our service chiefs mentioned that they might be 4 \nmonths' short of being able to operate with the funding they have. Our \npriorities seem to be passing a bill that exceeds the budget resolution \nby $35.5 billion.\n  I note the presence of the Budget Committee chairman, who I think \ndoes an outstanding job. I appreciate the credible efforts he has made \nboth as chairman and otherwise for fiscal sanity. I wonder if we ought \nto waste our time this year going through the couple of weeks of trying \nto come up with a budget, or should we consider, as many House Members \nhave and other Members of this body, that perhaps we should make the \nbudget resolution signed into law by the President of the United \nStates? With all due respect to my dear friend from Oklahoma, who has \nbeen here many years, this makes a mockery of the entire budget \nprocess.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee came to the floor \nand raised these old chestnuts as to how we are going to finance it. My \nall-time favorite is customs user fees. Again, I ask my friend, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, how many times have we used customs \nuser fees as a way of paying for something which has now given us a \nhalf-trillion-dollar deficit, the party of the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution in 1994?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the Senator from Oklahoma \nto respond to my tirade.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will respond to the question of my colleague and \nfriend, and the question was how many times we have used customs user \nfees. They have been used several times, although I do not know that we \nhave passed it. It is used to help pay for more spending in many cases, \nmaybe other tax cuts, but it has not been enacted into law. My guess is \nit will be at some point, but I think my friend from Arizona is making \na very valid point and I appreciate that.\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\n  My colleague asked, if we pass this, do we still need to pass a \nbudget? I happen to think we do. Because we passed a budget last year, \nwe saved hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of spending over a 10-\nyear period of time. The budget resolution helped make that possible. \nSo I hope we will still be able to pass a budget resolution in spite of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend, I thank him for his hard work. Again, \nI do not look forward to the most unpleasant day we have this year in \nthe Senate, and that is when we all vote every 30 seconds on issues of \nhuge import and none of us have a clue as to what we are voting for \nwhen we do it.\n  Again, I don't think it is through any fault of the chairman of the \nBudget Committee that this is over the budget resolution by $35.5 \nbillion. But, if this is the process we should go through when we are \nauthorizing or appropriating money--we have a budget resolution. It \ncalls for a certain amount of money to be spent for a certain function. \nBut then we can get the chairman of the Finance Committee to come down \nand say, Don't worry about what we decided in the budget resolution; we \nwill just find some more money. Usually customs user fees is one of the \nold chestnuts that are drawn out of the fire to be used over and over \nagain.\n  The other thing about this, my dear friends, the House of \nRepresentatives just decided to delay by 4 months consideration of the \ntransportation bill. Why? Because there is an outright revolt over \nthere, because they are closest to the people, about these totally out-\nof-control spending practices which have given us these unprecedented \nhigh deficits. I hear a rumor that they may do what is probably the \nright thing to do and just extend for 1 year the existing \ntransportation legislation.\n  So what do we do? We are passing legislation of which the President \nof the United States has guaranteed a veto. Again, I like to point out, \nit is the Republican Party that is the majority. It is the party of the \nPresident of the United States that is in the majority here, yet we are \npushing a bill to which the President says he is unalterably opposed. \nWhat is going on?\n  I hope my colleagues will consider voting to uphold this budget point \nof order. It is clearly valid. This budget point of order is clearly \nvalid.\n  My friend from Oklahoma said he wished I hadn't raised this point of \norder because he doesn't like to see the budget really overridden. A \nvote against upholding the budget point of order, to waive the budget \npoint of order, will basically override the work of the Budget \nCommittee. I hope my colleagues will take that into consideration if \nthey vote to waive this and future budget points of order.\n  It is interesting, on this bill no further budget point of order can \nbe raised, according to the waiver that is before the Senate now. No \nmatter how outrageous, no matter how egregious, we have waived this \nbudget point of order and future points of order.\n  There is something wrong with this system. Let me remind my \ncolleagues again, we have been on this for 2 weeks. For 1 week we \ndidn't have a single vote. Yes, I oppose unanimous consent agreements. \nI never ever opposed votes on amendments. I was in favor of those. Why \ndidn't we have a vote on the Gregg amendment? The reasons are obvious: \nBecause they didn't want a vote on it. But that was not a reason to \nstall any process. But that is behind us.\n  Now we are faced, as of yesterday, with a veto threat from the \nPresident of the United States because of the tremendous $35.5 billion \nincrease in spending over the budget resolution and about $62 billion \nabove the President's request on this legislation.\n  I urge an affirmative vote, a vote against the motion to waive the \nbudget point of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise as the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. There is no question that this budget point of order is well \ntaken, in the sense that the legislation before us as it is at this \nmoment is not paid for. It is not paid for in any way that is serious.\n  In the Finance Committee, Senator Nickles and I raised this point \nrepeatedly and secured a commitment from the chairman and the ranking \nmember that, before this legislation would leave the floor, it would be \npaid for. I had offered an amendment to pay for this bill in the \nFinance Committee and only withheld that amendment based on the \ncommitment that we were given by the chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee that this bill would be fully paid for before it \nleaves this Chamber. I am trusting in the chairman and the ranking \nmember to keep their word--to keep their word to me, to keep their word \nto Senator Nickles--that before this bill is passed, it will be paid \nfor.\n  It is on that basis that I will vote to waive the Budget Act. But I \nthink it should be abundantly clear Senator McCain is correct in saying \nthat, as it is before us, this bill is not paid for.\n  I do want my colleagues to know that in the Finance Committee the \nchairman and the ranking member pledged that before this bill leaves \nthis Chamber, it will be paid for. I trust them at their word. They \nhave made that commitment. I can say that they have kept commitments to \nme in the past. I am counting on them to keep that commitment that in \nthis Chamber, before this bill leaves the floor, that it will be paid \nfor--and not by any timing changes; not by moving corporate receipts \nfrom 2010 to 2009, or any funny-money financing, but really paid for.\n  I should add, I am disturbed that this waiver takes down other \npotential budget points of order except out of the conference \ncommittee. Out of the conference committee, if it is not paid for, we \nwould still have budget points of order apply. But I must say I am very \ndisturbed that this waiver will be for all budget points of order \nbecause there are other legitimate points of order that could be raised \nunless this problem is fixed, as the chairman and ranking member have \npromised this will do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the waiver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSpecter) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2473 To Amendment No. 2285\n\n           (Purpose: To provide for a substitute to title V)\n\n  Mr. Kyl. Mr. President, if the managers of the bill have nothing at \nthis point, I have an amendment at the desk which I would like to call \nforward. The amendment is No. 2473.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2473.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of February 11, 2004, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me briefly describe for my colleagues \nwhat this amendment does. In simple terms, it reduces the funding we \nhave provided for the transit and highway purposes of this bill from \nthe amount in the substitute offered by the Senator from Oklahoma to \nthe amount requested by the President; namely, $256 billion over the 6-\nyear period.\n  That is the amendment. There are some features of it we could \ndiscuss, if you like, and I would be happy to answer questions from my \ncolleagues. But the gist of this amendment is simply to say, we \nunderstand the bill before us is too expensive. The President has said \nhe supports a $256 billion number. The statement of position by the \nadministration would recommend a veto if the bill violates the \nprinciples set forth by the President, including specific reference to \nthe substitute that we are considering.\n  So it seems to me if we want to ensure the bill will not be vetoed, \nif we want to demonstrate that we are going to begin to spend money \nwisely here, then we should be willing to support the level requested \nby the President over 6 years, which is $256 billion.\n  Now, we have quoted before from the Statement of Administration \nPolicy. What I would like to do is quote from the President's press \nofficer, Scott McClellan, on board Air Force One this morning at just a \nlittle after 10 o'clock. After talking about some other things, he had \nthis to say about the question of the highway bill before the Congress. \nHe said:\n\n       This is the first test for the Congress when it comes to \n     spending restraint. And the President's proposal is at $256 \n     billion.\n\n  I am reading from the comments this morning of the President's press \nsecretary. He said:\n\n       This is the first test for the Congress when it comes to \n     spending restraint. The President's proposal is at $256 \n     billion. This is for the next 6 years. It's a 21 percent \n     increase above the previous 6 years, and we urge Congress to \n     show spending restraint in moving forward on this \n     legislation.\n\n  That is the basis for this amendment, to limit our funding for \nhighway transit purposes for the next 6 years to this level, $256 \nbillion.\n  Let me get into a little bit of detail about what the Finance \nCommittee did to come up with a larger number. One of the reasons it is \nimportant for us to focus on this number is because in all three \nrespects that the President's advisers laid out in the statement of \nposition of the White House, the bill before us violates the principles \nlaid down by the President. Those three principles which caused the \nadvisers to the President to recommend a veto if any of them were \nviolated are as follows: That the transportation infrastructure \nspending should only rely on gas tax revenues and that there not be any \nincrease in gas tax or other Federal taxes.\n  This bill raises other Federal taxes. This bill provides new spending \nthat doesn't come out of the highway trust fund but, rather, results \nfrom work the Finance Committee has done to close a variety of \ncorporate loopholes. We are familiar with some of the corporate \nloopholes the Enron executives were able to take advantage of, for \nexample. There are some other provisions we were able to close which \nrepresent tax increases for the people who otherwise would have been \nable to take advantage of those loopholes.\n  Those tax increases will produce revenue--I have forgotten the exact \namount, but in the neighborhood of $50 billion or thereabouts. That was \nrevenue we counted on to use in providing relief to our manufacturing \nfacilities because we are going to be taking away from that some \nspecial tax treatment the World Trade Organization held to be \nimpermissible under the WTO principles. Our European trade competitors \nbrought a case against us in the WTO, and we lost that case.\n  The way in which we gave tax advantages to our manufacturing \ncompanies can no longer exist. We have committed to the WTO we will \nchange our tax laws so those advantages no longer exist. However, we \nrecognize we have lost a lot of manufacturing jobs over the last \nseveral years. We don't want to simply reduce for those companies the \noffending provisions. We want to substitute something else so our \nmanufacturing corporations and other corporations will have the tax \nstructure to continue to grow economically, to continue to produce jobs \nand hopefully create new jobs.\n  If we use the revenue the Finance Committee came up with for this \npurpose--and it is called the FSC ETA reforms--if we use those revenues \ninstead to build highways, I don't know where we are going to come up \nwith the money to aid our manufacturing firms. I mean this with all \nsincerity. It is fine to respond to our general contractors who are \ngreat people back in our home States; we are going to be spending a lot \nof money on highways. We are going to be increasing spending by 21 \npercent if we just adopt the amendment I have laid forth and the number \nthe President has requested. But I don't know how we are going to look \nour manufacturing constituents in the eye, and particularly the people \nwho work for them, and say: Gee, we are sorry. We spent the money we \nwould have provided to you on building highways.\n\n  I don't know where we are going to get the money to support the tax \nrelief to these manufacturing corporations if we use all of that money \nfor this purpose.\n  That is exactly what the Finance Committee bill does. The chairman of \nthe committee has said the bill is paid for. This is how the bill is \npaid for. So we have increased taxes, and we are going to be \ntransferring that revenue from a project we all committed to, and we \nhave to move this forward by March or there will be retaliation by our \ntrading partners in Europe. They have waited patiently for a year and a \nhalf or 2 years now. We have to do that. But now we are going to apply \nthose revenues to this bill. Why? Because the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee felt he had an obligation, in view of the Bond amendment that \npassed last year, to find some way to fund the level the Senate had \npassed.\n  It raises taxes. It violates the President's principle. On that alone \nthe President's people would recommend a veto. We should not do it.\n  Secondly, the President's principle was the bill should not be funded \nby mechanisms that conceal the true cost to taxpayers. This bill \nobviously conceals the true cost to taxpayers because it doesn't limit \nhighway and transit spending to revenues we collect in taxes from those \nrevenue sources. The gas tax produces $196 billion in revenue over 6 \nyears. But we don't limit the spending on highways to $196 billion. \nInstead, we have found other ways to increase that amount of money.\n  In the Finance Committee we went over all of these various options, \nand there are some of them that make enough sense that I am willing to \nsupport them and say: All right. You could go above the gas tax \nrevenues of 196. You can get up to about 210 to $214 billion and argue \nwith a straight face this is money that is real money and could, in \nfact, be attributed to the highway trust fund.\n  But beyond that, we are in fact concealing what we are really doing. \nThat gets into the third principle, which is we should not be funding \nfrom the general fund; that we should fund from the revenues we derive \nfrom the gas tax and should not take money from the general fund for \nthis purpose. This substitute violates that principle that until now \nhas guided our spending for\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\nhighway projects. It is there both to protect highway users to make \nsure the money in the fund will be used for highway purposes--a point \nthat was eloquently spoken to by the chairman of the committee, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, a day or so ago.\n  It also protects those people who don't pay a great deal into the \nfund because they don't drive very much and they don't buy very much \ngas. It protects them from having to pay income taxes to support roads \nthey never use. We have always had the principle that we are not going \nto dip into general revenues, because once you begin doing that, there \nis literally no constraint, up until now. Now for the first time we are \ngoing to dip into general revenues.\n  How does this bill violate that principle and the second principle of \nconcealing from the American people exactly how these revenues are \ngoing to be spent? It pretends money is in the trust fund that is not \nthere. By saying that, I don't mean to denigrate the purposes or \nmotives of my colleagues who created this mechanism. But the fact is, \nno new revenue is being created by the collection of gas tax revenues \nto be put into the trust fund. We are simply going to deem that money \nwas put there without it ever having been put there through the gas \ntax.\n\n  For example, there is an exemption for schools and churches and \nStates and towns. So when your local school bus drives around and has \nto refill the gas tank with gas, we don't charge them the Federal gas \ntax for that. What we are going to do now is pretend as though we did. \nWe are going to say, there is $9 billion that would have been collected \nif we had done that, so we are going to pretend as though there is $9 \nbillion in the highway trust fund.\n  The other thing we are going to do is, if you buy ethanol, you get a \n5.2 cent exemption. You don't pay the full 18.3 cents. You pay 18.3 \nminus 5.2. We are going to pretend as though that 5.2 cents was \ncollected and transferred to the highway user fund. When I say that, \nthe mechanism is we are going to actually collect that tax, but then we \nwill rebate it to the taxpayer. So it actually was collected once, but \nit has also been rebated. So again, no net new money.\n  Since you have to pay highway contractors in real dollars--they don't \npave these highways for nothing, with fake money--how do you do it? \nThat is where this corporate tax increase money comes in. The Finance \nCommittee closed these tax loopholes, raised taxes on these \ncorporations, and produced--again, the number is roughly 50 billion. If \none of my colleagues wishes to correct me, I am happy to be corrected, \nbut say it is $50 billion.\n  That new tax increase from corporations is going to then be taken \nfrom the general fund and transferred over to the highway trust fund. \nThat is general revenues.\n  So all three of the principles that the President laid down will have \nbeen violated. We have increased taxes on corporations, we have \nobscured the fact that the highway trust fund doesn't pay for all of \nwhat we are spending here, and we have transferred money from the \ngeneral fund into the highway trust fund in order to pay for the bill \non which we are about to vote.\n  In all three respects, we have violated the principles that the \nPresident's statement of policy laid down. Given the fact that the \nadvisers to the President said they would recommend a veto if we do \nthat, and if we move forward with legislation--I will cite the sentence \nfrom the Statement of Administration Policy:\n\n       Accordingly, if legislation that violates these principles, \n     such as this legislation--\n\n  These people are saying ``this legislation'' violates those \nprinciples--\n\n       Accordingly, if legislation that violates these principles, \n     such as this legislation, which authorizes $318 billion, were \n     presented to the President, his senior advisers would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  As that letter says, and as Scott McClellan confirmed, the \nPresident's proposal is $256 billion, a 21-percent increase over the \nprevious 6 years. That ought to be enough. That is why I offered as an \namendment for colleagues to vote on here the opportunity to support the \nPresident and say, enough is enough, a 21-percent increase is enough--\nwe don't need to spend more--and, as a result, we are going to exercise \nfiscal restraint and pass a bill that is funded at the $256 billion \nlevel.\n  I would like to yield the floor now to any of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to offer a \nfew observations about my friend's amendment. He has spoken with his \nusual eloquence. I listened with care to the three points he raised. I \nsay this with entire sincerity, even though I confess that I didn't \nagree with a word he said.\n  I was in the Chamber yesterday and had with me the survey of the \nDepartment of Transportation on the needs of the United States of \nAmerica for transportation. It was about the size of this volume I have \nin my hand. It was an exhaustive survey that concluded we needed a \ntransportation infrastructure bill of around $375 billion to take care \nof our crumbling transportation infrastructure.\n  It is a fact that I have not heard contested, much less contested \nsuccessfully, on this floor, that 32 percent of the roads in the United \nStates are in poor or mediocre condition; 36 percent of the urban roads \nare in that condition; 28 percent of the bridges are substandard; we \nlose $65 billion a year in productivity and man-hours because people \nare trapped on congested roads; there is $50 billion a year in extra \nmaintenance costs that we have to pay because our automobiles have \nmaintenance problems due to the fact that the roads are no good.\n  Who hasn't been in a situation where they have rolled over a \npothole--and not always on some subdivision road but on a highway--and \nblown out a shock or their tires have gone out of balance? It is \nbecause of the road, and you have to pay for that. It is not going to \nget better if we don't do something to make it better.\n  This is what I don't understand from the critics of the bill. What do \nthey want to do? Are these roads just magically going to fix \nthemselves? Is there something defective about this survey? That is \nwhat the Department says in terms of its academic study, if you will. \nWe all know it is true. We encounter it every day here on the east \ncoast, and we encounter it when we are in our States. My friend from \nArizona talked about the bill conceals something. It doesn't conceal \nsomething. It is an attempt to meet the problems of transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  What is concealing things is to pretend that the problem doesn't \nexist, to set an arbitrary limit for how much we are going to spend and \nsay, based on what we are willing to spend, that is what we need to \nspend, instead of honestly assessing where we are in terms of \ntransportation infrastructure in this country and coming up with the \nmoney one way or another to meet the needs.\n  The critics are concealing the fact they don't intend to do anything \nabout the problem. This is what they say: Well, OK, you cannot raise \ntaxes to raise money to deal with the problem. You cannot use bonding \nbecause we have never done that before. Everybody else in the country \ndoes it. I spoke at some length about this yesterday. I will not \ninflict it anymore on the Senate. Everybody else in the country bonds \nfor roads and highways and bridges, but we cannot do it here. Now we \ncannot use general revenue either. So go ahead and fix the roads, but \nyou cannot raise taxes, use bonds, or use general revenue. Go ahead and \nget the $375 billion.\n  That is concealing the fact that they are not going to do anything \nabout the problem. We are going to continue losing the $65 billion a \nyear in lost productivity, $50 billion in increased maintenance--and \nwhat about the people who die because the roads are no good? What about \nthose people? Tell them we don't need to do any more? Tell their \nfamilies we don't need to do any more for transportation \ninfrastructure?\n\n  I hear my friends say it is not fair to use general revenue, not fair \nto the taxpayers. There are a lot of people in Missouri who get up \nevery day, and they have worked hard and been fortunate enough that \ntheir lives are going pretty good. Maybe they are single or they have \nfamilies. They work and get taxes deducted from their paycheck every \nweek. They pay the taxes at the pump. They pay all the other taxes they \nhave to pay. On April 15, they write another big check. Because their \nlives are going good and they don't need a lot of extra help, they \ndon't participate in a lot of Federal programs\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\nthat we have here. They support them. They want people with needs to \nhave access to help. They don't participate in it because they don't \nneed it. If you stopped and asked them, what is it you get directly out \nof the taxes you send to Washington, and they stop and think about what \nit is that Washington does that makes a difference for them day to day, \nabout the only thing they would say is the roads. They would say: It \nwould help if I could get to work in the morning.\n  Sure, we have a problem with the fiscal future of the country. That \nis not even considering what we have to do with Medicare and Social \nSecurity when the baby boomers begin to retire.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I didn't hear the figures the Senator mentioned that were \ntied to lost productivity and maintenance. What were the figures?\n  Mr. TALENT. It is around $65 billion a year in lost productivity \nbecause people are trapped in traffic jams.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, it certainly makes sense. We have \nthe workers of the country every morning going to work--and I see it in \nMissouri--and they are trapped in traffic jams. That is time they are \nnot spending on the job producing goods and services and wealth for the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The other figure on maintenance was what?\n  Mr. TALENT. It is about $49 billion in extra maintenance costs \nbecause the roads are not good.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. TALENT. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. My friend's memory is very good. The figure is $67 billion. \nAnd people wait in traffic and waste 5.6 billion gallons of gasoline \nevery year.\n  Mr. TALENT. I appreciate the question of the Senator from Nevada, \nalso.\n  If you went to that taxpayer and said, what do you get for the money \nyou send to Washington, and they thought about it, they would say, \nwell, the roads.\n  I have people say to me: We don't really want anything, but it would \nbe nice if you would fix the roads. It would be nice if you had an \nextra lane on that bridge or it would be nice if I didn't have to, when \nmy kid went out on a date at night, wait up at night, not worrying \nbecause I thought the kid would get into trouble but whether my kid was \ngoing to get home on those roads.\n  So I think the people who are paying the income taxes of the country \ninto the general revenue of the United States of America would \nappreciate it if we used a little bit of that to fix their roads. I \ndon't know whether that fits whatever rules of accounting we have been \nfollowing in the past. I think it would make a difference for the \npeople of the country.\n  You know what I don't think is fair--what is not fair is to pass the \nbill for the Nation's infrastructure on to the next generation, knowing \nwe have not done our part to pay it.\n  Yes, this highway bill is bigger than the last highway bill. As \neverybody said, it is about 30 percent bigger. The gap between where it \nis and where it should be is bigger, too, and what that tells us is \nwith each highway bill, we are failing more and more to get to where we \nneed to be, and it is going to have to get bigger and bigger as time \ngoes on if we are going to make up for this transportation deficit.\n  I used this example yesterday. You are a homeowner, and you have a \nhole in the roof. You have to consider what options you are going to \nuse to pay for fixing it. But what isn't an option is not fixing it \nbecause if you don't fix it, it doesn't get any better; it just gets \nworse and eventually the roof collapses. I think we should do our part \nand face honestly what we need.\n  I appreciate the managers of the bill getting this bill up to the \nlevel they have. I ask them to hang tough. We need a highway bill at \nthat level. I made a point of saying yesterday that we need it more \nthan that. I am hopeful, as this process goes on, that we can persuade \nthose who, with the sincerest of intentions, are concerned about the \nfiscal state of the country, that we don't improve the fiscal state of \nthe country by undermining the economy that produces the wealth on \nwhich this Government depends.\n  We are going to meet these needs in the future. We are going to meet \nit through growth. America is going to go out and produce and create \njobs and grow and make enough for everybody. America will rescue us \nfrom this fiscal situation if America can get to work in the morning, \nand that is what this bill is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the \namendment. The previous speaker has outlined articulately the huge loss \nin productivity this Nation suffers because of the present situation \nwith respect to our highways, and that if we don't do something about \nit, we, obviously, are not going to get the productivity we need. With \ninternational competition from all over the world now, lost \nproductivity becomes even more important as we go forward.\n  Many in this body have argued that the level of funding in our bill \nis too low. In fact, if we look at the transportation needs of the \nNation, they may be right. What we have done in this legislation is to \nfollow the will of the Senate.\n  Last year, during debate on the budget, this body overwhelmingly \nvoted in favor of the budget levels contained in this bill. In \naddition, our levels are almost $60 billion less than the House \nproposal--again, $60 billion below the House. In fact, our bill falls \nright between what the President wants and what the House wants. We are \nin the right place. I could be wrong--maybe I am--that we should accept \nthat low a level, but we will never get this bill to the President's \nlevel. And without a bill, we risk missing out on the creation of many \njobs.\n  The American people need these jobs. The biggest problem we have \nright now is the lack of effort to pull forward and increase \nproductivity and to increase the number of available jobs. This bill \nwill do it. It will create thousands of new jobs, and it will create \nthem within proper areas of expenditure.\n  This is a good bill. I would like to see it a little bigger. Maybe we \nwill get it a little bigger. The House is certainly going to give us \nthat opportunity. Right now what we should do is pass this bill and get \nit on to the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this will be brief because I think we are \ngetting redundant in some of the things we are saying. I do find it a \nlittle bit puzzling that the people who are promoting this type of an \napproach--whether it is temporary extension or a narrowed-down version \nand spending less--are the same ones who were willing to spend $7.25 \nbillion more just a few minutes ago.\n  On the issue of amount, the 40 percent we keep battering around, we \nhave to remind ourselves that when we look at Government programs that \nare worthwhile Government programs, it is not unusual to have an \nincrease of 6 percent a year. I draw a distinction between this and a \nlot of programs we have--I have a long list I could read about foolish \nthings we do around here wasting money.\n  As a fiscal conservative, I believe in spending more in certain \nareas. One area is national defense and another area is infrastructure. \nI know that is what we are supposed to be doing here. In fact, the \nSenator from Missouri has access to a survey that shows that 69 percent \nof the people in America, as opposed to 22 percent against it, favor \nspending more money right now in this climate on infrastructure--roads \nand bridges. That is what we are here for.\n  I do want to say again--and I am sorry about being redundant, but it \nis very important--the President sent over three criteria. I think the \nfirst two we can't even argue about. We are not talking about raising \ngas taxes. He wasn't talking about plugging corporate tax loopholes. He \nwas talking about increasing gas taxes. We don't do that.\n  Secondly, some of the things he considered to be gimmicks, we are not \ndoing. I know the Senator from Missouri would like to approach the more \ncreative types of financing.\n  In the third area where he talks about taking out of the general \nfund, that is one that could be debated. I am fully willing to take \nmoney out of the general fund if it got to the general fund from the \nhighway trust fund. And it never should have.\n  One sentence out of the Finance Committee says:\n\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\n\n       In the view of the tax committee, these tax policy benefits \n     have nothing to do with highway use and should not burden the \n     trust fund.\n\n  In other words, if you are going to pass something having to do with \nvehicles that use less fuel, or something similar to that, that is \npolicy and has nothing to do with traveling on roads. Because those \nvehicles travel on the same roads as other vehicles, why have the \nhighway trust fund pay for that? I think that is absurd.\n  I was here in 1997 when we had a balance of $16 billion in the trust \nfund. The previous administration wanted $8 billion. We said let's take \nhalf out of the $16 billion. So they took that out of the highway trust \nfund and put it in the general fund. That ought to go back. That is a \npolicy of being honest with the people. I think it is a moral issue, in \na way, because 99.9 percent of the people who pay their taxes are \nwilling to do that, assuming that goes to building roads and repairing \nbridges, and it is not because we have been raiding the trust fund over \nand over for the 18 years I have been here.\n  That is what this is all about. The Senator from Missouri is exactly \nright. We can't continue to do nothing. We are going to have to rebuild \nour bridges and roads.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first I wish to correct something I said. I \nwas trying to estimate the amount of money the Finance Committee has \ncome up with in corporate loophole closings. That is a gross way of \nsaying what we did. We have changed several provisions of law that are \ngoing to raise revenue. It amounts to a tax increase on certain kinds \nof businesses, but it represents good policy. Some of this follows the \nEnron scandal.\n  I thought we had gotten up to about roughly $50 billion. Actually, \nthe amount is $22 billion. I stand corrected on that. That would be a \n$22 billion tax increase if you want to put it that way.\n  Second, there are two things to which I want to respond. My colleague \nfrom Missouri basically made the argument: But our needs are great; we \nhave a great need to rebuild our highway system.\n  First, I don't want my views to be characterized as I don't care \nabout building highways; that I don't think we have needs. Of course we \nhave needs. We have all kinds of needs. If the Congress responded to \nevery need that every Member brought forth, we would have a budget that \nis five times as big as it is right now. We can't possibly satisfy all \nof the needs of all of the people all of the time with the revenues we \nhave, and it is probably a good thing because it does force us to set \npriorities.\n  That is what this amendment does. It says we would like to have maybe \na 42-percent or 41-percent increase over the last 6 years in highway \nspending, but everything else in the budget is going to be less than 1 \npercent, except for homeland security and defense.\n  If we can set a priority with health, education, welfare, and justice \nand all of the other activities we do, if we can create a budget that \nhas growth of less than 1 percent for those activities, then why do we \nhave to have more than a 21-percent increase in highway funding, which \nis the amount that $256 billion finances?\n  That is the amount the President will support. I do not want my \ncolleagues to characterize this amendment as against highway funding. \nIt is a 21-percent increase. Is that not enough? No, my colleagues say \nit needs to be 41 percent. Well, that is a legitimate argument, a \ndifference of opinion: Do we need to increase it 41 percent or 21 \npercent? But do not mischaracterize the argument that those of us who \nthink 21 percent is enough are somehow against doing something about \nour infrastructure.\n  The final point I want to make is to respond to the Senator from \nOklahoma. As to the rationale used, and he characterized it correctly a \nmoment ago, in the Finance Committee by those people who say this money \nought to be attributed to the highway trust fund, we only raised $196 \nbillion in gas tax revenues, but we have made some public policy \ndecisions, the results of which have denied money to the highway trust \nfund and because of that we ought to attribute those funds to the \nhighway trust fund.\n  One public policy decision is that schools, towns, and churches \nshould not pay the gas tax. That is a legitimate public policy \ndecision. So we do not collect the gas tax. But the logic is stood on \nits head to say but because that is a decision that denies funds from \nthe trust fund we should pretend as though we put the money in the \ntrust fund.\n  The bottom line is, the general revenues of the country are paying \nfor that policy decision, and the same thing is true with respect to \nthe ethanol tax. We do not collect 5.2 cents of it. Now we are going to \ncollect it and rebate it, and they say that hurts the highway trust \nfund. Fine. Then charge the tax. Do not pretend as though we charge the \ntax and say that justifies attributing that money to the highway trust \nfund when, in fact, there is no money, and the only way one gets the \nactual money in the highway trust fund is going over to this $22 \nbillion in new corporate taxes, taking it from the general revenues and \nthen putting it in the highway trust fund.\n  That is why I think we should limit this funding to $256 billion, a \n21-percent increase. The President says that ought to be enough. I \nagree with the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, from time to time I say nice things about \nSenators on this side of the aisle, and I do not often enough say nice \nthings about those on the other side of the aisle. I want to say the \npresentation made by the junior Senator from Missouri is one of the \nfinest presentations I have heard in many years in the Senate. It was \nlogical. It was to the point. It laid out what we, the four managers of \nthis bill, have been trying to do, and how difficult it was to arrive \nat the point where we are. I want to express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Missouri for an outstanding statement. It was well \ndelivered and had a lot of substance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. This \nis an opportunity for the supporters of this legislation to avoid a \nPresidential veto, in two ways. One, bring it down to the President's \nnumber and, two, the criteria established by the statement of \nadministration policy highway spending should be financed from the \nhighway trust fund, not from the general fund of the Treasury. All \nspending for highways should be authorized and appropriated from the \ntrust fund and derived from taxes imposed on highway use. It says the \nadministration supports an authorization level of $256 billion. So to \navoid a Presidential veto, I think the Kyl amendment is very important.\n  I do not want to comment on the statement of the Senator from \nMissouri, but I was entertained by his comments about the hole in the \nroof. I will tell the Senator from Missouri, there is actually a hole \nin the net, there is a hole in the safety net. Maybe highways are more \nimportant than people's Social Security and health care to the Senator \nfrom Missouri, but the fact is, and ask any expert, including testimony \nby Alan Greenspan just yesterday, this deficit is going to destroy \nAmerica, and the first casualties will be Social Security and Medicare \nbecause they are unfunded mandates to which we just added, with the \nsupport of the Senator from Missouri, a $400 billion and now $543 \nbillion debt on the taxpayers of America.\n  So if he is worried about a hole in the roof, I hope we are worried \nabout a hole in the net, the safety net, the guarantee that we have \nmade to people who are the least able to defend themselves and help \nthemselves in our society. Those are recipients of Social Security and \nMedicare. Both systems are going bankrupt while we spend 60-some \nbillion dollars more than the President wants and $35 billion more than \nthe budget resolution we passed calls for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator from Nevada would permit the Senator from New\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\nHampshire to speak, then I am happy to let the vote go forward after he \nhas concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak a few moments in support \nof the amendment, and perhaps to address some of the issues and \nconcerns that have been raised as well. I begin with the points made by \nthe Senator from Arizona about the overall size of the bill. This \namendment, if and when adopted, would certainly reduce the total amount \nof funds available in the bill, but the increase in highway spending \nrelative to the last 6-year bill would still be 21 percent. To suggest \nthat somehow the supporters and proponents of this amendment do not \nwant to invest in infrastructure, do not want to improve the safety of \nour highways, do not want to improve the quality of our bridges, do not \nwant to expand in some cases the existing interstate highway system, is \nsimply not correct.\n  We are not engaged in a debate about the value of infrastructure. We \nare engaged in an important debate and discussion about how much is \nenough and about how much we can afford and, as Senator McCain of \nArizona pointed out, what our overall priorities are going to be.\n  I understand for some a 20 or 30 or 35-percent increase in spending \nis not enough. I certainly believe it is enough, given that the \nPresident has pledged to veto a bill that is at that level, given that \nwe have other pressing national security issues, Social Security \nmodernization questions, a Medicare bill that was passed last year that \nis going to be far more expensive than even the supporters of that bill \nsuggested. We do have other priorities among which we are going to have \nto choose.\n  I think it is very misleading to suggest the supporters of this \namendment do not care or are not willing to commit that money we are \ncollecting in excise taxes, gasoline taxes, to this kind of investment. \nThis bill as it is currently written breaks the budget. It violates the \nbudget resolution. We just had a vote to waive the budget requirements, \nto waive a budget point of order so this bill could go forward, because \nit violates the budget resolution, because it breaks the bank, because \nit is far more than was prescribed in that budget resolution. As a \nresult, it is going to significantly increase the deficit.\n  In addition, the legislation contains financing mechanisms that are \ndisingenuous at best, and phony at worst. We are diverting general \nrevenue funds that were never intended to go into the highway trust \nfund into the highway trust fund, and we are doing it by crediting \nmoney to the highway trust fund that is never collected. We say, well, \nif we had excise taxes that applied to States, cities, and towns, we \nwould collect more in excise taxes, so let's pretend we collected those \ntaxes and put them in the highway trust fund. That is simply wrong.\n  When that money is credited to the highway trust fund, it has to be \ntaken from somewhere else and it is being taken from general revenues. \nI think it is instructive to go back to the last debate we had when we \nwrote a highway bill--in fact, in 1998--and the proponents of a very \nlarge highway bill at that time said the only thing we are asking for, \nand the only thing we ever will ask for, is that all of the money we \ncollect in gas taxes go to highways. That was essentially accomplished \nwith the writing of that bill.\n  Today we are listening to a debate that pretends that commitment was \nnever even made.\n  The goal seems to be to scrape every penny possible into the highway \ntrust fund in order to pass a bill that is as large as it could \npossibly be. That certainly is not OK by me.\n  I am sure there are some people here who would like to raise gasoline \ntaxes. I am certainly willing to have that vote. There are some people \nwho would like to pass bonding authority. I am certainly willing to \nhave that vote. But somehow the supporters of those ideas, while they \nwant to talk about those ideas and suggest there is a conspiracy to \nprevent them from doing those things, don't really want to have those \nvotes because they know they would not win.\n  This bill adds to the deficit, and we do have an extraordinarily high \ndeficit right now. Our economy is just beginning to grow. It is \ncertainly not the right time to raise taxes, but I think it is the \nright time to begin to exercise some fiscal restraint.\n  Another question that I think is begged by some of the claims thrown \naround in this debate is, What is the role of States in highway and \ninfrastructure--transportation spending? There is certainly a tone that \nsuggests the State of Missouri, or the State of Texas, or the State of \nNew Hampshire, or California somehow do not have the wherewithal to \ndesign and build a decent road; they don't have the commitment or the \nforesight to levy excise taxes, collect those taxes, hire good people \nto run departments of transportation, and invest in maintenance or \nsafety, bridge management, or new highways.\n  I think that is simply wrong. States are not incapable. States \ncertainly care every bit as much as any Member of this Senate about the \nsafety of their roads, and about their potential for economic growth.\n  If you look at the highway fatality rates of the different States, \nsome States have done a much better job than other States in dealing \nwith the safety issues that were discussed earlier by some Senators. I \nthink States have not just an important role but a leading role to play \nhere. Certainly in my experience they set better priorities. They tend \nto spend the money a little more efficiently.\n  That brings me to my final point. Ultimately, what we are really \ntalking about is a redistribution of funds. If you think literally \nabout what we are doing, the Federal Government is collecting 18.4 \ncents for each gallon of gasoline sold in the State of New Hampshire or \nthe State of Missouri, or Oklahoma, literally bringing that money here \nto Washington, and then we are engaging in a debate as to how to divide \nup that money to send it back to the States. It makes you wonder what \nthe purpose of this diversion is in the first place because I can \nassure you, the laws of physics, finance, or nature result in less \nmoney ultimately going back to invest in pavement or bridges or transit \nat the local level than ever came to Washington in the first place--\nunless you believe all the administration, oversight, and regulation \nthat comes from Washington with regard to transportation is free.\n  It is not. Ask any worker at the Department of Transportation. They \nmay wish they were earning a better wage but they are certainly not \nworking for free. There is a significant overhead cost. That does not \nmean there is no Federal role at all in these programs or projects or \ninvestments, but I think we need to be a little more careful in our \ndebate and discussion. Certainly we need to be a little more careful \nwith the use of the moneys we are collecting, and be more careful in \nthe debate or discussion than to somehow suggest the Federal Government \nis the only entity that has the ability to make a good decision about \nwhich 5- or 10- or 50- or 100-mile stretch of pavement ought to be \ndealt with first and foremost in our States.\n  If you don't think we are just talking about a redistribution of \nmoney, take a look at the tables that are part and parcel of this \nlegislation. The percentage redistributed to each State is spelled out \nin excruciating detail, year after year. You can see one State has \n102.5 percent of what was collected from that State in gas taxes in \nyear 1. Then it might go to 104.8 percent and then 95.4 percent and \nthen 93.2 percent. The only reason to calculate such specific \nstatistics is that ultimately this is a vote and a battle over a \nformula for redistributing the money we took from our States and our \nconsumers in the first place.\n  I think there is some value in a discussion about whether we should \nleave more of that money at the State level in the first place. \nCertainly we could give the opportunity to those States that would like \nto collect that excise tax in the State to spend it locally, and I \nbelieve a little bit more efficiently than Congress might do here in \nWashington.\n  That is not part of this debate, empowering States, empowering \nconsumers, empowering local officials to collect and invest a little \nmore of their share of these excise taxes, but perhaps in the future it \nwill be. But at the very least, we can take up and support the\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\namendment before us today that will bring this bill into compliance \nwith the budget, that will bring this bill to a level that will not be \nvetoed by the President, that will bring this bill up to a level that \nwill ensure we do not have to raid the general fund; that we don't have \nto raid taxpayers' funding that they are sending for programs other \nthan laying pavement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, may I make a suggestion. This last vote took \n35 minutes. We have people who have been waiting to offer amendments \nall day. We have a number of amendments lined up for people to offer. I \nwould hope the leadership would call a halt to these votes after a \nreasonable period of time.\n  There are people who have already come to me, there are people who \nhave come to Senator Inhofe and the two leaders, about how long this is \ngoing to take. It could take a long, long time, but it is going to take \na lot longer time if these votes go on endlessly. So I would hope we \ncould terminate these votes more quickly.\n  If people miss a vote now and then, it is not the end of the world. I \nhope everyone would be in agreement. People feel very strongly about \nthese amendments, and they have a right to offer them. The decision has \nbeen made today by the managers of the bill to let them offer them, to \nhave up-or-down votes on them. Until there is some change, that is what \nwe are going to continue to do. But everyone should not be punished by \nthe dilatory nature of Senators for whom we wait around endlessly. I \nhope the next vote will be 20 minutes and then we will call it quits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2430 To Amendment No. 2285\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2430.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2430 to amendment No. 2285.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify the penalty for nonenforcement of open container \n                             requirements)\n\n       On page 147, after the item following line 24, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1409. OPEN CONTAINER REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 154 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking subsection (c) and inserting the following:\n       ``(c) Transfer of Funds.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall withhold the \n     applicable percentage for the fiscal year of the amount \n     required to be apportioned for Federal-aid highways to any \n     State under each of paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of section \n     104(b), if a State has not enacted or is not enforcing a \n     provision described in subsection (b), as follows:\n\nThe applicable percentage is:\nFiscal year 2008.............................................2 percent.\nFiscal year 2009.............................................2 percent.\nFiscal year 2010.............................................2 percent.\nFiscal year 2011 and each subsequent fiscal year.............2 percent.\n       ``(2) Restoration.--If (during the 4-year period beginning \n     on the date the apportionment for any State is reduced in \n     accordance with this subsection) the Secretary determines \n     that the State has enacted and is enforcing a provision \n     described in subsection (b), the apportionment of the State \n     shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount of the \n     reduction made during the 4-year period.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment about which I have \nspoken previously. It deals with the subject of drunk driving. More \nspecifically, this amendment deals with the issue of open containers of \nalcohol in vehicles. It is similar to an amendment that was voted on \nand approved by the Senate when we passed the previous highway bill 6 \nyears ago. I would like the opportunity to explain what this amendment \ndoes and what it means.\n  Let me describe to my colleagues an organization that most of them \nknow well, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a wonderful organization that \nsprang up over recent years dealing with the issue of drunk driving.\n  Every 30 minutes someone gets a call that their loved one has been \nkilled by a drunk driver. That is a relentless number of deaths caused \nby something that can be avoided and can be dealt with, if we get tough \ndealing with drunk drivers. The scourge on American highways from drunk \ndriving is not some mysterious illness for which we don't have a cure. \nWe know what causes it. We know what cures it.\n  Let me offer some statistics: Of the children from birth to 14 years \nof age who were killed in alcohol-related crashes in 2001, more than \nhalf were passengers in vehicles with drivers who had been drinking; 23 \npercent of the children under 15 years of age who were killed in motor \nvehicle crashes were killed in alcohol-related crashes in 2001; the \nleading cause of death for children 4 to 14 years of age is motor \nvehicle crashes, too many of them, far too many, as a result of \nalcohol.\n  During the year 2001, 8,054 passenger vehicle occupants under 15 were \ninvolved in fatal crashes. It is estimated that 269 children under age \n5 were saved as a result of child restraint. The statistics about \nsafety issues with children are really quite remarkable. It is \nespecially compelling to take a look at what is happening with respect \nto drunk driving. It is important to understand what we can do about \nit.\n  The amendment I have offered is very simple and would be hard to \noppose. It says that nowhere in this country should you, driving a \nvehicle, come to an intersection and meet someone else driving another \nvehicle who is drinking while they are driving. It ought not be legal \nanywhere in this country to drink and drive. It ought not be legal in \nthis country anywhere for there to be open containers of alcohol in \nmoving vehicles.\n  Some say: Well, but that is the State's decision. That is a decision \nthe States ought to make.\n  Thirty-six States have already made that judgment. Thirty-six States \nhave said they agree, under no condition\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nshould there be open containers of alcohol in passenger vehicles on the \nroads.\n  There are 14 States, however, that don't make that same judgment. \nThere are some that prohibit consumption by the driver but say it is \nfine if others in the car are drinking alcohol. There are some that say \nit is OK to have open containers of alcohol, but you can't have it when \nthe car is in motion. You just have to pull off to the side of the \nroad. There are others that have prohibitions on open containers that \napply only to drivers. But one State has an exception for frozen \ndaiquiris. Sound goofy? It does to me. Let me say that again.\n  We have 14 States that do not comply with the requirement that would \nprohibit alcohol in a moving vehicle on America's roads. There are \nseveral States in which there are no laws at all with respect to \nalcohol in vehicles. You may, in some of those jurisdictions, put one \nhand around the neck of a bottle of Jack Daniels, put the other hand on \nthe steering wheel, start your car, begin to move, and you are \nperfectly legal. You may drink and you may drive. That is unforgivable.\n\n  Nowhere in this country should we have laws that permit drinking and \ndriving or drinking in vehicles that are on American highways. This is \nnot rocket science. We know how to prevent this, and 36 States do.\n  Six years ago, when we passed the legislation creating the highway \nbill, we had a vote on this. It was a tougher amendment that I offered \nthen. It would have imposed a penalty that 5 percent of the highway \nfunds that were going to a State be withheld unless that State complied \nwith the requirements to prohibit open containers of alcohol in \nvehicles. That passed the Senate 52 to 47. The first year it was losing \n5 percent; the second year and thereafter, losing 10 percent of the \nhighway funds. That was tougher than this amendment.\n  This amendment provides that if States do not comply with a \nprohibition on alcohol in passenger vehicles, then they will lose 2 \npercent of their highway funds each year during the 6 years. The \namendment that passed the Senate 6 years ago--an amendment I offered \nand one that was supported by a majority of my colleagues--was watered \ndown in conference. The requirement still existed, but it was a \nrequirement that said, in effect, you better watch it. It said if you \ndon't comply, some of your highway funds, a small amount, will go to \nhazard mitigation or safety programs. Money is fungible, so these 14 \nStates that have not complied have not minded that because they have to \nuse money for hazard mitigation in any event. So we have 14 States that \nhave decided it is all right in some circumstance or in some form to \nhave alcohol in your moving vehicles.\n  I mentioned that one State does actually have a small prohibition \nagainst this practice, saying that apparently drivers only cannot \ndrink, with the exception of a frozen daiquiri. There is actually a \nfrozen daiquiri exception.\n  I think I have the exception here. In this particular State, just to \nshow you the extent to which States have gone to produce their own \nversion of whether you ought to be able to drink and drive: It shall be \nunlawful for the operator of a motor vehicle, when the vehicle is on \nthe public highway or right of way, to possess an open alcoholic \nbeverage or container or consume an alcoholic beverage in the passenger \narea of a vehicle.\n  Then it describes alcoholic beverage: Beer, ale, port, or stout, so \non, wine, distilled spirits. Open container means any bottle, can, or \nother receptacle--(B) except open alcoholic beverage container shall \nnot mean any bottle, can, or other receptacle that contains any amount \nof frozen alcohol beverage unless the lid is removed and a straw \nprotrudes.\n  I don't think there ought to be a State in this country where you \nought to be able to drink and drive. It is as simple as that.\n  It is a fact that conditions have changed dramatically in this \ncountry, and thank God they have. It wasn't too many years ago when a \ndrunk driving arrest produced a slap on the back and a knowing grin--\nwell, you got caught, did you, old buddy? These days, it is far more \nserious than that.\n  A wonderful organization called Mothers Against Drunk Driving decided \nto stop the carnage on America's roads. They have had a dramatic impact \nin Congress and in State after State. I have met most of the presidents \nof that organization in recent years. All of them have lost children to \ndrunk driving accidents. They are all passionately committed to \nstopping this. Again, there is no mystery to this. We understand what \ncauses these deaths, and we understand how to stop it.\n  I have told my colleagues before that, at 10:30 at night, I received \na call that my mother had been killed by a drunk driver. I will not \ndescribe that except to say the horror of that call, that happens over \nand over and over again in this country, is a horror you never forget. \nIt is so tragic because none of it has to happen. All we have to do is \nget serious about drunk driving and enforcing our laws and having the \nright laws.\n  I wish we were as tough and serious as Europe is. In most of Europe, \nyour attitude had better be that you will not even think about doing \nthis. You don't dare get caught in Europe drunk driving. The \nconsequences and penalties are far too great. That is what I wish we \nwould do in this country.\n  For about 12 years now, I have been unable to successfully persuade \nthe entire Congress that there ought to be such penalties to require \nevery State in this country to make a very simple statement with their \nlaw, and that would be that, in no circumstance, at no intersection, at \nno time shall anybody be driving a vehicle in this country and drinking \nat the same time and be perfectly legal. It is nuts, in my judgment, to \nhave laws that allow that to happen--and not just drivers. Yes, there \nare circumstances where drivers can drink and it is legal in this \ncountry--in addition to others in moving vehicles who are consuming \nspirits and wine, beer, liquor. It is not the right thing to happen in \nthis country. We have gone well past the time when this ought to be \ndebatable.\n  My colleague, Senator DeWine--who, incidentally, supports my effort \nhere--offered an amendment dealing with drunk driving which I \nsupported. My colleagues in this Chamber know this is an important and \nserious issue. They also know that this is the place to address it. If \nyou were going to address the issue of drunk driving, it seems to me \nyou would address it in this venue, right here on this bill.\n  We spent a great deal of money putting together a piece of \nlegislation using Federal revenue that we collect and send back to the \nStates. We have every right to impose a restriction that says we expect \nthe States to have a prohibition on open containers of alcohol. As I \nhave indicated to you, 36 States have such a prohibition. This \nrelatively small map shows, in dark green, all of the States that \nalready have legislation that causes a complete prohibition on the \nconsumption of alcohol in a moving vehicle.\n  The legislation I offer would simply require the other 14 States to \ncomply. In fact, a fair number of the 14 are close to complying. I \nbelieve it would not be much effort for them to do so. Only those few \nStates that are remaining, where they insist on some sort of personal \nright to allow people to drink and drive, would object. There is no \njustification for that objection.\n\n  When someone turns an automobile into an instrument of murder because \nthey decide to get drunk and drive, then there need to be consequences. \nOne of the consequences, in my judgment, is not only to get tough with \ndrunk driving, as Mothers Against Drunk Driving have all across the \ncountry--they have gone to court and they have represented victims and \nthey have insisted on changing State laws. They have been here in the \nCongress and have been very successful in dealing with Federal law \nchanges.\n  In addition to that, they support this, and I believe we ought to \nchange Federal law one more time to make this prohibition on open \ncontainers stick across the country. Once again, there is no \njustification to say that anywhere, anytime, under any circumstance, \nsomeone ought to be able to drink and drive. Too many of us--many in \nthis Chamber, in fact--have experienced a phone call and that phone \ncall is one we never, ever forget because it is such a senseless \ntragedy and needless death when someone gets\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\ndrunk and decides to get into a vehicle and it results in the death of \nanother American.\n  Let me make a couple of additional comments and then I will complete \nmy presentation. We know from studies that have been done that \nprohibitions on open containers of alcohol in vehicles--the laws that \nexist--have made a difference. They have deterred both moderate and \nheavy drinkers from driving. We know those laws are successful. In \nfact, some States have had the laws for many years, and there are a \ngood many studies that describe that success. States with prohibitions \non open containers in vehicles have had significantly lower rates of \nalcohol-related fatalities than States without. States with open \ncontainer prohibitions have had lower numbers of hit-and-run crashes \nthan States without such laws.\n  In every single State in this country, the majority, by far--80 \npercent, 90 percent, 76 percent, 91 percent--of the people say they \nsupport passing legislation prohibiting the open container of alcohol \nin vehicles.\n  My amendment is not hard to understand. It is simply written. It is a \nshort amendment. The objective of it is quite clear, and the passion \nwith which I have, for 12 years, worked to try to effect this change \nremains. I don't know how the vote will occur today. I regret that some \nwill decide we cannot take the simple step of saying to the American \npeople that nowhere in this country should you be able to drink and \ndrive. I regret that some will oppose that. My hope is that perhaps the \nSenate once again today will decide, on this issue, to do what is \nright. If so, perhaps we can go to conference and do what is right.\n  We won't know the names of those whose lives we saved, but I can tell \nyou they are young children, high school students, babies, senior \ncitizens, workers, moms, and they are grandpas. A lot of people's lives \nwill be saved if we take this step, pass this requirement, and get \npeople off America's roads who now drink and drive and, in some parts \nof the country, who drink and drive legally. In my judgment, that is \nunforgivable. I don't want any American, under any circumstance, to \ncome to any intersection at anyplace in this country and meet someone \ndriving another vehicle who is driving with one hand on the steering \nwheel and the other hand on the neck of a bottle of Jack Daniels, \ndrinking whiskey, and it is legal. That situation exists in this \ncountry and it ought not to.\n  If this Senate doesn't have the stomach to take that simple step, I \nwonder whether we have the capability to legislate on much of anything.\n  That completes my remarks. I don't know what the procedure might be. \nI expect we will have a vote on that. I suggested that the manager of \nthe legislation, the chairman, accept it by unanimous consent or by a \nvoice vote, or at least vote for it. I don't know what the chairman \nintends to do.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate the choices, but it is going \nto be none of the above. I know the Senator is very passionate about \nthis issue. I also know that currently in title 23 there is this 1.5 \npercent that is taken out of the programs it is designed to be used for \nand put into other programs, such as the section 402--the alcohol-\nimpaired driver countermeasures and all that. Now, this is different in \nthat it takes money away--well, look at it this way. The States pay the \ntaxes that go into the Federal Government, and then we take those and \ngo back to the individuals and say: Unless you do something in the \nwisdom of us here in Washington, even though your State does not agree \nwith it, we are going to withhold your money.\n  Let me share a short story with my friend from North Dakota. Many \nyears ago, I was elected to the State legislature. My first trip to \nWashington was 1967. Do you know what it was for? To testify before the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee protesting Lady Bird's Highway \nBeautification Act of 1965 because of this very reason: philosophically \nusing money that comes from the State to blackmail them to do \nsomething, however good the cause.\n\n  I was sympathetic with Senator Warner on his seatbelt amendment, but \nI had the same objections. I think the Senator is going to find some \nphilosophical objections to his amendment. Yet I assure everyone within \nearshot, the Senator from North Dakota is very passionate about this \nissue, he believes in it, but I will respectfully vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this most surely is a mandate, and those \nwho believe no mandate is worthy ought to oppose this.\n  I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, the proposal that has existed now \nfor some years in which we have tried to encourage the States to comply \nis a very simple proposition that has not worked.\n  The encouragement has been to say you will lose highway construction \nmoney that will go into hazard mitigation if you don't comply. Fourteen \nStates have not complied. In some States, it is legal to drink and \ndrive. I say this to my friend from Oklahoma, if ever there is a case \nfor a mandate, it ought to be to say that, as a nation, we have a \nnational purpose and a national interest in deciding that nowhere in \nthis country on no public highway shall it be legal to drink and drive \nat the same time. I think there are enough Americans who understand the \nconsequences of this and the tragedy of it to understand why it is \nnecessary for us to be aggressive.\n  We can decide that we don't like mandates. That is perfectly \nacceptable. But that then will not solve this problem. I guarantee, if \nwe pass this legislation and the other 14 States comply, lives will be \nsaved.\n  In any event, aside from the mandate issue, I don't expect there is \none person in the Senate who will come to the Chamber and say: I really \nthink it is good public policy to allow people the choice, to let \npeople choose whether they want to drink while they drive. If someone \nhas a hankering thirst for whiskey and a powerful need to drive at the \nsame time, God bless them, get them on the road. There is not one \nSenator who will come to the Chamber and say that because that is nuts \nand we know it.\n  There is no justification for allowing anybody in this country to \ndrink and drive. None, none at all. If this Congress cannot take baby \nsteps in the right direction dealing with public safety, then a lot \nmore lives will be lost. This is not radical. This is easy. This is not \ncomplicated. This is simple.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I do not wish to speak on the amendment. \nI wish to speak on the bill.\n  First, I have great respect for the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member. I understand this is one of the toughest jobs we have, \ntrying to draft a highway bill which everybody thinks is fair. I \nsuggest it is an impossible task because someone is going to benefit \nand someone is not. All we can do as Members is try to make our case as \nto why our respective States should be treated in a manner that befits \nits condition.\n  In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we have historically benefited \nfrom the Federal highway program. We have benefited in the sense that \nmore money comes to our State than we have paid in taxes to the Federal \nhighway fund.\n  I would make the argument that is as it should be. Of course, every \nSenator will stand up and say that is as it should be, everyone should \nbe a donee State and, of course, that is impossible to do.\n  The question is, Why should States be donor States and why should \nStates be donee States? I will give my rationale, which I think is the \nrationale underpinning the whole reason the Federal Government gets \ninvolved with highway programs.\n  Of course, all of our States have highway departments. All of our \nStates have departments of transportation. All of them have gas taxes, \nexcise taxes that raise money for the purpose of providing roads. The \nquestion is, Why does the Federal Government do what is already being \ndone by the States? There is one overriding reason.\n  Originally, the Interstate System was designed for moving defense \nitems around in times of war. That was the Interstate System. The \nreason for the Federal Government's involvement has to do with \ninterstate commerce. And the reason for a Federal gas tax is to make \nsure there is a network of highways that facilitates interstate \ncommerce.\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\n  For example--and I use the example of Florida--you want to make sure, \nif you are an orange grower in Florida, that you get your products \nbefore they perish to market over a system of roads. So you are willing \nin Florida, which has virtually no interstate traffic, to pay a little \nbit more for Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, \nMaryland, and Pennsylvania to have good roads so you can get your \nproducts up to New York, Boston, and places such as that.\n  The idea is that States that may not have a lot of cross-traffic are \nwilling to pay other States that do to facilitate commerce on behalf of \nthat State. That, to me, is a very logical reason for there to be a \nFederal gas tax.\n  That being the premise of my discussion, I want to get to my State. \nOne additional premise. What causes a lot of trouble for roads? There \nare two major causes that I can think of--there may be more and I will \nbe happy to hear them. The two major causes are weather--and I \nchallenge anybody to go out in the DC area and drive around, now that \nwe have had a lot of freezing, thawing, snow, and ice, and look at all \nthe potholes. It is not a common occurrence in this area because we \ndon't have a lot of thawing and freezing generally. We do now. We are \nhaving weather like Pennsylvania.\n  A lot of freezing and thawing beats up the roads in combination with \nwhat? Really the biggest thing that beats up roads is weight, heavy \ntrucks--heavy trucks pounding and beating up roads. Heavy trucks, in \ncombination with freezing and thawing, really kick a lot out of the \nroads.\n  A premise of my discussion is, No. 1, what is the purpose of this \nbill? The purpose of a Federal tax is to facilitate interstate commerce \nin those States that benefit from the cross-traffic that occurs in \nother States that don't get an economic benefit. I remind my \ncolleagues, if a heavy shipment is going from Florida to New York and \nit goes through the State of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania gets all of the \naggrieved road problems and none of the economic benefit.\n  Weather and heavy truck traffic. Let's look at the situation in my \nState. Why do I bring up my State? Because my State historically has \nbeen a donee State. Historically, we have benefited from the Federal \nprogram. Why?\n  The reason we benefited, based on the premises I laid out before, is \nbecause we get a heck of a lot of cross-State traffic, heavy truck \ntraffic that neither originates nor is destined for our State. In other \nwords, our State gets no economic benefit from heavy trucks in large \nnumbers rolling through our State.\n  Let me give you the numbers. As far as ton miles--what am I talking \nabout here? Heavy trucks, weight that hurts highways weight that \ndestroys highways, disproportionately to car traffic.\n  As far as ton miles, we are fifth in the country in ton miles--fifth \nin the country in ton miles in our State.\n  Now, that does not necessarily say Pennsylvania deserves more money \nbecause we get all of this heavy traffic. Let's look at an additional \nfactor which I think is vitally important--in fact, more important when \nit comes to this formula--and that is how much of that heavy traffic is \njust going through our State and does not stop, how much of that \ntraffic gives no economic benefit to our State.\n  We are third in the percentage of heavy truck traffic going through \nour State that does not stop. Forty-seven percent of the heavy truck \ntraffic going through our State does not stop in my State. Our State \ngets no benefit from these heavy trucks beating up our roads and \nrolling through our State. There are only two States that have a higher \npercentage, and that is Indiana and Ohio. Which States have more heavy \ntruck traffic than Pennsylvania? Well, Texas does. They are No. 1. \nTexas, obviously, is a much bigger State than Pennsylvania, but only 15 \npercent of the traffic going through Texas is not originating or \ndestined for Texas. So they do not get near the amount of cross-traffic \nthat we do. So most of the heavy truck traffic is to some economic \nbenefit either to someone who is getting shipped the goods or shipping \nthe goods.\n  What is the second one? California. Only 2 percent of the heavy truck \ntraffic going through California is just going through California and \nnot stopping there. So my colleagues can see what I am talking about. \nIt is not just that we get heavy truck traffic.\n  What is the point of this tax? What is the point of this formula? To \ncompensate States that are what we call in the airline business fly-\nover States. Well, we are a crossover State. Vermont happens to send a \nlot of stuff through our State--ice cream and milk and all that kind of \ngood stuff. But the fact is, the reason I have not been happy with this \nbill and have been critical of it and have voted to try to change it is \nbecause I believe if we look at the numbers and look at the weather \nfactors we have to deal with, which a lot of the country does not have \nto deal with, particularly the South, and look at the number of vehicle \nmiles--I mean, look at this. Here is Pennsylvania. These are all the \ninterstates that go through Pennsylvania: I-70, I-76, I-78, I-79, I-80, \nI-81, I-83, I-84, I-90, I-95, I-476. I-99 is an interstate--but it is \nnot interstate--that is just in Pennsylvania. Look at all of these \ninterstates where heavy truck traffic is trundling through, beating up \nour highways, with no economic benefit to our State.\n  What is this Federal tax intended to do? It is to say to States that \nget no economic benefit from having that traffic go through those \nStates that we are going to compensate them. But what happens in this \nbill? We actually contribute to other States that do not have near the \ntraffic we do coming through our State for no benefit.\n  One of those States--and I do not want to pick on a particular State, \nbut to me it is the most dramatic example because a lot of traffic for \nthat State goes through Pennsylvania--is Florida. How many interstates \ndoes Florida have? Really three: I-95, I-10, and I-75. I-4 is an \ninterstate but it goes from Daytona to Tampa, so it is not really an \ninterstate. The fact is, there are three.\n  And by the way, less than 3 percent of the traffic that goes through \nFlorida is originating somewhere else and destined somewhere else--3 \npercent of all the traffic. In our State, 47 percent of the truck \ntraffic is neither originating in our State nor is destined for our \nState; Florida, 3 percent. Yet look at what happens. Florida--yes, it \nis a bigger State. It has more people. I understand that. Do they have \nice, snow, and freezing rain in Florida? Do they have heavy trucks \nrunning over their roads? Do they service other economies and do other \nStates benefit from the traffic going through Florida? The answer is, \nno, no, and no. Yet over the 6 years of this bill they are going to get \na billion dollars more than a State that is shouldering the burden of \ntrying to keep this economy up and going by carrying truck traffic, \nheavy destructive truck traffic, through our State.\n\n  So one might ask, and I know several have: Senator, why are you so \nupset about the way this bill is put together? Again, I am not being \ncritical of the chairman or the ranking member. They have a tough job. \nI am focusing on one aspect. I happen to believe it is a very important \naspect of why highway formulas are put together. I am sure the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma will tell me, well, there are other factors where \nPennsylvania does not stack up. Pennsylvania is a State that does not \nhave as many people as Florida, or is not as big geographically as \nCalifornia or Montana. I understand those are all factors.\n  Again, if we look at the central premise of why we are here, why do \nwe have a Federal tax program for highways, we have to ask that \nquestion. It is not because we want to raise money and just turn it \nback to the States. I hear it said on this issue that every State \ndeserves 95 cents on the dollar. Let me just say something very clear. \nWhy? Why does every State deserve 95 cents back on the dollar? Why does \nthe State of Florida, with only 3 percent of its traffic is cross-\ntraffic, deserve money from a Federal program that is designed to help \nfacilitate interstate commerce? They are the beneficiary of all of the \nother States when a truck runs from Florida or to Florida, and the \nroads get the heck beat out of them. They do not originate in my State. \nSo I am not picking on Florida, but that is the most dramatic example.\n  The fact is, if this program is designed to help States that are \ncarrying the burden of other States and getting no economic benefit, if \nthat is the reason we have a Federal highway program--and I would argue \nthat is the principal reason we should have a Federal highway program--\nthen States\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\nsuch as Pennsylvania and Ohio--and my sympathy goes to Ohio. I know \nSenators DeWine and Voinovich are enthusiastic about the improvements \nin this bill, and they should be improved. They have been on the short \nend of the stick for a long time. Indiana and Illinois, the States that \nare sort of the freeway of the heavy trucks and the bad weather, those \nare the States that the rest of the States in this country, \nparticularly in the region, should be helping out because they benefit \neconomically by having good roads going through those States.\n  I think I have a valid complaint. That complaint will go on deaf ears \ntoday because this bill will pass and instead of Pennsylvania being a \ndonee State to help compensate us for the 47 percent of heavy truck \ntraffic that goes through our State, for which we get no economic \nbenefit, now we are going to contribute to other States and have the \nblessing of carrying their truck traffic on top of it. To me, that is \nunfair. It is an injustice to the people of Pennsylvania who are going \nto be driving on those pothole-filled roads that are going to be \npothole filled because of heavy trucks going through our State, beating \nthem up, and providing no jobs except crews running around trying to \nfill potholes with tax dollars from Pennsylvania residents.\n\n  That is not what interstate commerce is all about. That is not what \nthis tax was designed to do. It is an outrage that the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania is being treated in this fashion. I am hopeful that after \nmy explanation those who are in authority, who can look at this and \nhopefully fix this problem, will see that we have a legitimate \ncomplaint, and we will have an opportunity in conference to try to \naddress an issue which I think is going to hurt interstate commerce and \njob creation because we are not going to have the quality of roads in \nPennsylvania to shoulder that 47 percent of the truck traffic that goes \nthrough our State of which we get no economic benefit.\n  It will hurt my State because in my State the quality of roads will \ndecline. I understand some will say the money goes up in this bill. \nYes, the money goes up. That is assuming we get a bill at this level, \nwhich is looking increasingly uncertain given the President's comments. \nSo the money probably is not going to go up as much as this bill \nsuggests it will. So keeping the same formula, our increases are going \nto look less and less, as will every other State.\n  This bill spends about a 45-percent increase in highway funding. We \nget a 19-percent increase. Finally, I make the argument that this \npremise that every State is entitled to 95 cents back on the dollar is \nwhat happens in Washington all the time. We set forth a goal and \npurpose for legislation which is we are putting this bill forward, and \nwe are putting this system forward to help facilitate the interstate \ncommerce of America. That is what it was designed to do. But what we \nturn it into is: No, this is money coming from my State and I deserve \nit back.\n\n  If that is the case, if that is what this is for, I am for repealing \nthe whole thing and just letting the States raise the money. If that is \nwhat we are going to do, let's not bother. If this is all just about \nraising the level on the Federal level and giving it back in the \npercentage which they raised it, why are we here? We are here because \nwe wanted to help those States that carry the disproportionate burden \nof making the economy of the rest of the country work and getting no \neconomic benefit from it. That is what originally, I would argue, the \nhighway formulas have accomplished, at least for my State.\n  I can stand up and say for Ohio it didn't work that way, and it \nshould have. I don't know what happened that it didn't. I understand \nfor other States it didn't work that way. At least it did for mine, and \nI hope we can have it work more equitably for the purpose for which \nthis legislation was originally intended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSantorum, for his very cogent remarks about the highway bill and its \neffects on Pennsylvania. I associate myself with what my colleague from \nPennsylvania has said.\n  I think it is unfortunate we have a bill which appears to be heading \nfor a Presidential veto. We have a bill which quite a number of States \nfind unsatisfactory.\n  I compliment the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, the chairman \nof the committee, and Senator Jeffords, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, as a whole, for their very strenuous efforts. But I do \nbelieve Pennsylvania is not being treated fairly. Senator Santorum has \ngone over the specifics about our State, which has very heavy traffic \ngoing through the State, the third heaviest truck traffic State in the \nNation. Almost half of the trucks which go into Pennsylvania do not \nstop in Pennsylvania. There are very difficult problems of weather, \npotholes, and highway deterioration that require Pennsylvania be \ngranted more of the funding.\n  Pennsylvania has traditionally been a donee State, which means \nPennsylvania receives more than the funds which Pennsylvania \ncontributes to the trust fund. Now Pennsylvania, for the first time, \nwas turned into a donor State, so Pennsylvania is contributing more to \nthe trust fund than Pennsylvania is receiving. I think that just is not \nappropriate.\n  I have also expressed my concern earlier in voting against cloture, \non the first cloture vote earlier in the week, about the concerns I \nhave for the size of the budget. There has been a clear-cut statement \nfrom the White House that the President is not going to agree with the \nfigure present in the Senate bill. That is why I voted against cutting \noff debate, because I think to be fruitful in what we are doing here we \nare going to have to work with the President's figure.\n  We all know about the ballooning deficit, in the range of $500 \nbillion. We all know about the national debt. We have very heavy \nexpenditures in many areas. We have a budget that has been submitted \nwhich grants a very small allocation for discretionary spending. In the \ncontext of where we are with the deficit, it seems to me the President \nis correct, that this bill ought to be pared, at least to some extent.\n\n  The bill is ultimately going to have to be signed by the President, \nalthough it is a matter of speculation as to whether there are enough \nvotes to override a Presidential veto. But I am not prepared to \noverride a Presidential veto and I am not prepared to support a bill \nwith this funding flow, where there has not been some accommodation \nwith the White House, some accommodation with the President.\n  There are many steps before the matter comes to a final \ndetermination. There will be final action taken by the Senate, which \nappears to be passage. We will have to see whether there are more than \n67 votes in favor of the bill. There will be a conference. Senator \nSantorum and I are continuing to talk with the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member and others on the committee to try to \nget a more equitable share for Pennsylvania. But on this state of the \nrecord, I cannot support this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand there is a pending \namendment, the Dorgan amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to set that amendment aside temporarily and \nspeak on an amendment which I intend to withdraw.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No objection is heard. The Senator from \nLouisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2615 To Amendment No. 2285\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I send this amendment to the desk for its \nconsideration, but my intention is to speak for about 10 or 15 minutes \nand then I am going to ask to withdraw the amendment because, \nunfortunately, even though this is an extremely meritorious concept, I \nam not certain we have the votes for it at this time, but I thought I \nshould take some time to talk about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] for herself, Mr. \n     Breaux, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Pryor, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2615 to amendment No. 2885.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a program to apportion funds to States for use \nin the acceleration and completion of coordinated planning, design, and \n     construction of internationally significant highway projects)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n       (17) FINISH program.--For the FINISH program under section \n     178 of that title, for each of fiscal years 2004 through \n     2009, an amount equal to 6.4 percent of the amounts received \n     in the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit \n     Account) for the fiscal year under section 9503(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       On page 389, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 18__.

FINISH program.''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Breaux, Senator Pryor, and Senator Lincoln from \nArkansas--the two Senators from Arkansas and Louisiana. There are other \nSenators who are very interested and have given us a lot of \nencouragement as we moved forward with this concept.\n  I first want to thank the leaders of this bill for their tremendous \nwork in putting a very balanced transportation bill together. You can \nsee how controversial and emotional some of this debate is regarding \nhighways and jobs. Highways, if not built correctly or built in the \nright way, or if rail or mass transit isn't provided, if the trade \nburden is too heavy on one area, can cost jobs, as you just heard the \nSenator from Pennsylvania speak.\n  This is a very complicated and very big bill and a very expensive \nbill, but one we certainly have to find a way to afford because it is \nthe infrastructure on which our economy in large measure is built. It \nis not the only infrastructure. I would like to remind everyone that \nschools and education are just as important, but our highways, our \nrail, and our Interstate System particularly are the foundation for \njobs and economic growth.\n  The concept of the amendment I talk about--again, I am going to \nwithdraw it--is to pull a few percentage points of dollars away from \nthe general program and direct it to the completion of major interstate \nroutes that are in desperate need in order to handle the new \ninternational trade and the increased truck traffic and the increased \nmoveable inventories that are in large measure traveling by truck on \nour highways because of policies we have as a Congress put into place \nover the last couple of years.\n  We have an Interstate System to be proud of. We have made mistakes \nover the decades as we have constructed it. Obviously we have not been \nas sensitive to the environment when we began this several decades ago \nas we are today. But it has been a remarkable achievement of the \nAmerican people, to dedicate their tax revenues and their gasoline tax \nrevenues and general tax revenues. It is a true partnership between the \nFederal Government and local governments, as we built this Interstate \nSystem, primarily built by the Federal Government.\n  As you can see, these are the major corridors throughout our country. \nIn the early days of the country, as trade was more east-west, as we \ntraded more with Europe and with the Pacific rim, our highways have had \nto move across the country and of course the whole Nation has been on a \nwestward expansion. It started on the east coast and then moved \nwestward.\n  The problem now is States such as Louisiana and Texas and in large \nmeasure Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri--the heartland \nStates, these States right here in the middle of the country--are under \na tremendous burden as the population has increased. I realize two-\nthirds of our population lives within 50 miles of a coast. I am from a \ncoastal State so I understand the populations are very heavy. But the \npopulations are also very heavy right here in the heartland and there \nsimply are not enough interstates moving north-south.\n  That is what this amendment attempts to do, to say to those writing \nthese policies--and all of us have an input in that--let us pay \nattention to finishing some of these interstate corridors. From \nLouisiana, the corridors that are most important to us are I-49 and I-\n69. I will talk about that in just a minute.\n  Again, the map shows the concentration of interstates is east of the \nMississippi River, not west. The Western States, particularly those in \nthe center, need to have additional interstates that are completed. I-\n49 would affect Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and others; I-69 \nwhich is not completed, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, \nKentucky, Indiana, and Michigan; I-35, which is not completed, Iowa and \nMinnesota; the CANAMEX interstate, which is not yet completed, Arizona, \nNevada, Utah, Idaho; and ports to plains, Texas, Oklahoma, and \nColorado.\n  Although I did mention Pennsylvania, I want to put up another map. I \nknow the chairman has worked very hard. I am sure he and the staff know \nthese numbers, but 46.6 percent of the truckborne traffic that comes \nfrom Canada comes through this entrance right here, and 49 percent that \ncomes from Mexico or through Mexico comes through this point.\n  The I-69 corridor, which is not finished, is a very important \ncorridor to be completed because other corridors that do exist--there \nare probably one or two others in this section--are not enough to \nhandle the percentage of the traffic.\n  The Senators from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter and Senator Santorum, \nwith New York and Pennsylvania right here, are feeling the sting of a \nlot of those trucks coming through, not stopping, not delivering goods, \nnot delivering jobs, but creating a lot of traffic, havoc, a lot of \npotholes, and accidents are coming through these corridors because of \nthe way our economic system is developing.\n  Do we want to stop the economic growth? Absolutely not. But we have \nto provide for it. That is basically what our amendment attempted to \ndo.\n  I wish to speak for a few more minutes about it, but I am hoping as \nwe draw some attention to this corridor and the percentages of trade \nthat come through on a north-south direction we can get more help and \nmore support.\n  I think the committee has done a beautiful job. I have worked with \nthe chairmen on both sides. Louisiana has been treated fairly. This is \nnot a complaint from the State of Louisiana. I like the idea that our \nState, along with many others, is getting a bit more money under the \nnew formula.\n  I think it sounds very fair when you say every State should get at \nleast 95\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\npercent of what they put in. But the problem with that is it sort of \ntakes away a bit from our concept of interstates and completing \ninterstates. Whether it helps Louisiana or not, ultimately, when these \ncorridors are completed, it helps every State. In this case, two of the \ncorridors I am speaking about would cut through Louisiana, and would be \na great help to us, and also to the whole Nation and our metropolitan \nareas.\n  That is the underlying concept of the amendment. Again, to generally \ndescribe it, it would take a small percentage--6 percent--which equates \nto about a $16 billion commitment over the next 6 years to finishing \nanywhere from four to five of the major corridors through the middle \npart of the country. This is only one. There would be others that \nwould fall into this concept and this amendment.\n\n  Let me keep the I-69 chart up for 1 minute and talk about one of five \nthat will be completed in the middle part of the country.\n  I-69 will serve the Nation's top 25 seaports, 13 inland waterway \nports, and 15 of the Nation's top air cargo ports. One of the reasons \nwe need to finish I-69 is because it helps to link our seaports, our \nwaterways, and our airports. That is true for every one of these \ncorridors that would be proposed in this plan.\n  When I-49 is complete--hopefully one day soon--it will extend from \nNew Orleans to Kansas City, but it benefits the whole Midwest part of \nthe country, from the great port of New Orleans, the port of Houston, \nthe port of Mobile, with huge amounts of trade and traffic which are \ngoods imported and exported moving through these ports. They need \nnorth-south corridors. We simply don't have enough north-south \ncorridors. We have a lot of east-west corridors but not north-south \ncorridors.\n  Once completed, the I-49, I-29, and I-35 corridors will intersect \nwith nine other east-west interstates, including I-94, I-190, I-80, I-\n70, I-44, I-40, I-30, I-20, and I-10. Building the north-south \ncorridors connects them to the east-west to make this grid workable and \nhelps all of us to be more efficient and profitable as we move goods \nand services around and through this great Nation.\n  There is one final point I want to show a picture of. This is a hard \npicture for me to look at, but the ranking Member from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, has actually seen this with his own eyes. He was gracious \nenough to come down to Louisiana. We were literally standing there \nlooking at a bridge, which is not in this picture frame. The Senator \nasked me what would happen to the bridge if there was an accident. At \nthat point, a large shrimp trawler literally hit the bridge, knocking \nthe mast of the trawler off and knocking the nets down. The bridge was \nout of commission for several hours. The Senator witnessed that \nhimself. There is only one way in and one way out.\n  But the frightening thing for people who are observing and listening \nto this today is this is the main highway for offshore oil and gas \nrevenues coming into the continental United States. This is LA-1. \nEighteen percent of the imports and a majority of the offshore oil and \ngas drilling that is done happens at the end of this road. With a heavy \nrain, it goes under water. This road needs to be elevated and \nprotected. The marshlands need to be restored. All of that can be done \nwith the right kind of investment.\n  This is probably one of the worst examples of not using our Federal \nresources directly and well, in the sense that $6 billion is produced \nfrom the Treasury off the shores of this highway, but we can't get one \npenny to broaden or fix this highway--that is not true. We have, \nthrough the generosity of the chairman, gotten some money to fix and \ndesignate this highway. But this is one of the corridors that could be \ngreatly improved by a commitment to finish the major economic corridors \nwe rely on for our security and which give us energy security--but also \nin the middle part of the country to help us move oil and gas off our \nshores to light up Chicago, New York, or places in Pennsylvania and \nVermont, and move goods through the Gulf of Mexico. This is a major \ncorridor.\n  My amendment seeks to re-focus only a small percentage--6.4 percent--\nof our Federal highway spending on finishing our network.\n  My proposal calls for creating a finish program. The finish program \nwould provide enough funds to finish or substantially finish a few \nhighways of international significance.\n  In 1995, we dissolved the interstate program and left behind a few \nmajor uncompleted segments. From its founding by President Eisenhower \nuntil its dissolution in 1995, the Federal interstate program provided \na dedicated stream of funds to build our system of interstate highways.\n  This map of completed interstate's shows the concentration of \ninterstates east of the Mississippi River and the great gaps in the \nnetwork that exists west of the Mississippi River, particularly north-\nsouth interstates.\n  ISTEA and TEA-21 provided a new program that listed a number of high \npriority corridors that are vital to national economic development, but \ndid not provide the funding to construct these highways.\n  The proposed finish program would provide the necessary funding to \nfinish or substantially finish the most significant of these \nCongressionally designated high priority corridors so that we can begin \nclosing the remaining gaps in our national network.\n  All of the proposed roads for the FINISH program have already been \nCongressionally designated high priority corridors, yet we haven't \ngiven them priority funding. Many segments of these roads do not exist. \nSome of these roads exist but are inadequate and are awaiting \nimprovements. All of these proposed road projects link our borders \nnorth and south. All of these proposed road projects will bring \ntremendous social and economic benefits for both their regions and for \nthe Nation.\n  Of the six corridors that I propose be included in the FINISH \nprogram, I want to focus on three specific corridors that I know best \nbecause they directly impact Louisiana. These three specific corridors \nare: I-69, I-49 and LA-1.\n  When completed, this will span the Nation's heartland, connecting \nCanada and Mexico through the States of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, \nKentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas.\n  Since the passage of NAFTA, Canada and Mexico are now the U.S.'s \nmajor trading partners. In 2001, 80 percent of U.S. trade with Mexico \nand 67 percent of U.S. trade with Canada was transported by truck. The \nI-69 corridor accounts for over 63 percent of the Nation's truck-borne \ntrade with Canada and Mexico. This map of the I-69 corridor shows that \nthe Michigan border points of Detroit and Port Huron account for over \n46 percent of the Nation's truck-borne trade with Canada. The Texas \nborder between Laredo and the Lower Rio Grande Valley accounts for over \n49 percent of the Nation's truck-borne trade with Mexico.\n  I-69 will serve the Nation's top 25 seaports, 13 inland waterway \nports and 15 of the Nation's top air cargo airports. This corridor \nwould directly serve 25 million people. I-69 will provide economic \ndevelopment in some of the Nation's most impoverished regions, \nincluding the Mississippi Delta and the lower Rio Grande Valley.\n  In the I-69 corridor States, there are over 9.1 million people living \nbelow the poverty level. In 6 of the 9 corridor States, the population \nin poverty exceeds the U.S. average. Currently, only two sections of \nthis corridor--Interstate 69 from Port Huron, MI to Indianapolis and \nInterstate 94 from Port Huron to Detroit and west to Chicago--are \ncomplete and open to traffic. However, these sections are in need of \nupgrading. The remainder of I-69, from Indianapolis south to the \nMexican border, is in varying stages of completion. Location and \nenvironmental studies are near completion and many sections are under \ndesign work and construction.\n\n  When completed, I-49 will extend from New Orleans to Kansas City. \nWhen completed, it will provide a continuous trade highway from Canada \nthrough the Midwest and New Orleans to Latin America.\n  Major portions of the route are already constructed: In Louisiana, \nfrom Lafayette to Shreveport as well as other sections in Arkansas and \nMissouri. Environmental work has been completed for every unconstructed \nsection of the roadway. Records of decision for every one of these \nsections\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\nhave been signed by the Federal Highway Administration. Project funding \nis the only remaining obstacle to the completion of the Interstate.\n  I-49 is a nationally significant freight distribution and inter-modal \ncorridor that will service the deepwater ports of South Louisiana, New \nOrleans, Houston, Beaumont--four of the top five ports in the Nation by \ntonnage--the Great Lakes ports of Duluth, Superior, Chicago, Gary and \nMilwaukee, as well as numerous other inland waterway ports throughout \nthe Midwest and plains States.\n  The I-49 corridor bisects a 420-mile north-south gap in what is \npotentially one of the most agriculturally and industrially productive \nregions of our country between I-55 to the east and I-35 to the west. \nOnce complete, the I-49/I-29/I-35 corridor will intersect with nine \nother east-west interstate highways including: I-94, I-190, I-80, I-70, \nI-44, I-40, I-30, I-20 and I-10.\n  With existing rail facilities along the corridor including BNSF, \nKCS--now NAFTA Rail--and Union Pacific, completion of I-49 will spur \nthe creation and expansion of major inter-modal facilities from Canada \nto the Gulf of Mexico. Once complete, I-49 will provide $817 million in \nannual savings to the Nation's economy by reducing travel time, \ntransportation costs and congestion. Over 6 years, these savings will \ntotal over $4.9 billion. Coincidentally, the total remaining cost to \nconstruct I-49 is estimated at about $4.9 billion. Construction and \ncompletion of I-49 will support the creation of up to 206,290 new jobs.\n  I thank the chairman from Oklahoma and the ranking member from \nVermont. Of course, the Senator from Nevada had a great deal to do with \nthis bill. I thank them for their balanced approach. But I suggest to \nthem if we could accelerate the completion of some of our major \ninterstates in the middle part of this country, it would help everyone. \nIt is desperately needed from an economic, security, and safety \nstandpoint for the 30 or 40 States that are tremendously affected by \nthe lack of this kind of infrastructure.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2615 Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2615), to amendment numbered 2285, was withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have just spoken to Senator Dorgan. He is \nin the cloakroom and he wishes to speak for a few minutes prior to the \nvote on his amendment. We should advise the Senate there should be \nanother vote in the next 10 minutes or so. Does the chairman agree with \nthat?\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, we should emphasize we will \nnot have more 38-minute votes. It could help the situation to be \nprepared for perhaps two more votes, if that is necessary.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate my chairman acknowledging the fact at this \nstage--things could happen later on--we have another amendment on our \nside and two more amendments on the other side, and that is all we know \nof on this bill. There may be other things come up but that is what the \nmanagers have been told.\n  I underline and underscore what the chairman of the committee has \nsaid. It is not right to have these votes go 38 minutes. People have \nother things to do. It is unfair to the Members here, voting on time, \nto nonchalantly walk in, knowing the vote has been held up. These are \nnot close votes. There is nothing that will be damaged by someone \nmissing a vote. If you have an important engagement, tell that to your \nconstituents. It is unreasonable to do this. I hope later we will \nacknowledge that and help move the bill forward.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is there any way the votes could be stacked at a set \ntime so we would know about votes later tonight?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the junior Senator from Louisiana, we \nhave tried that today and we have had objections to stacking votes. We \nwill continue to try. We would be elated to do that. We know the \nschedule is extremely difficult for everyone but it is especially \ndifficult for a mother of two children at home.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Senator Breaux and I are entertaining for Mardi Gras \nthis weekend. We are honored to have 2,000 of our friends in town. But \nhe will have a good time anyway.\n  Mr. REID. Knowing Senator Breaux--and this is directed toward him--we \nhope he does not have too good of a time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding Senator Dorgan is here and will \nspeak. If he could confine his remarks to less than 10 minutes, we \nwould have no objection to accepting his amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is we could dispose of \nthe amendment I have offered in a moment.\n  Let me again explain this amendment. Six years ago, the Senate did \npass an amendment that is slightly tougher than the one I now offer \ndealing with the issue of drunk driving. It specifically deals with the \nissue of open containers of alcohol in vehicles.\n  We understand that nowhere in this country should someone be able to \ndrink and drive at the same time. Yet there are still jurisdictions \nwhere that exists. The Senate has had a vote on this. When we \npreviously considered this legislation 6 years ago, the Senate voted in \nfavor of my amendment. It did get watered down in conference. My \nunderstanding is that the amendment would now be accepted, and I \nappreciate that. I have spoken twice on it and have fully explained it. \nI feel passionately about this piece of public policy.\n\n  I thank Mothers Against Drunk Driving and all of the other Senators \nacross this country who dedicate their time and commit their lives to \ntry to do something to make a difference about drunk driving and save \nthe lives of so many in this country who are at risk as long as there \nare people who are drinking and driving in the United States.\n  I thank the two managers of the bill.\n  I yield the floor with the understanding the amendment is accepted.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. May I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is my amendment will be \ncleared by an approval of a voice vote and I ask that that occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2430) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like my fellow Senators to learn \nof some of the tremendous advances we have been able to make under this \nbill in the past relative to the changing needs of our Nation. I am \ngoing to spend just a few minutes on the North Street Revitalization \nProject.\n  This effort is an innovative transportation project in Vermont that \ndemonstrates the value of the Transportation and Community and System \nPreservation Program, also know as the TCSP.\n  When the TCSP was authorized in TEA-21, the city of Burlington \nquickly realized that this innovative program could be used to \nrevitalize a blighted neighborhood called the Old North End.\n  North Street is located in the heart of Burlington's Old North End.\n  The North Street revitalization project was born of a need to \nreinvigorate one of Burlington's oldest and most densely populated \nneighborhoods, a neighborhood where nearly a third of\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\nthe inhabitants fall below Federal poverty levels, where over 85 \npercent of elementary school children receive free and reduced price \nlunches.\n  It has been a wonderful example of a community using transportation \nfunds to fight sprawl by investing in an older urban neighborhood.\n  I do not exaggerate when I say that efforts to revitalize the Old \nNorth End have been underway for over 20 years. The early TCSP Program \ngrant for North Street has been the single most important factor in the \nsuccess that the project is finally achieving.\n  I am pleased to report that the project is out to bid and \nconstruction will commence this spring. In addition, business activity \nin the neighborhood is way up and housing investment is increasing. The \noptimism is infectious and the infrastructure work has barely just \nbegun.\n  As you can tell, I am very excited by this project. But I have chosen \nto highlight the project for another reason.\n  The North Street revitalization project is an excellent example of \nthe benefits of the TCSP. The TCSP allows projects such as this one to \ndevelop all over this country. It encourages communities to consider \nthe ways in which transportation investment can improve mobility, \neconomic vitality, and quality of life.\n  I am pleased to say that we have continued this program in our \nreauthorization package and increased the funding associated with it. \nThis is only one of the many excellent programs that this bill \nauthorizes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I just want to speak briefly because there \nhas been some talk and discussion floating around the Chamber that one \nof the proposals that is being considered is to use customs fees to try \nto fill the failure of this bill to meet its budget obligations.\n  As we have discussed earlier, the bill is about $24 billion over \nbudget, minimum. I think that is a conservative figure, but that is the \nnumber that is being accepted as the number that is given.\n  Unfortunately, a lot of the additional spending in the bill, rather \nthan coming from the highway trust fund, which is where it logically \nshould come from because the highways should be paid for by the highway \ntrust fund, comes from a variety of movements of dollars, which \nessentially ends up with the general fund funding the highway trust \nfund from between about $226 billion up to about $255 billion, I \nbelieve. Off the top of my head, I think those are the numbers that are \npicked up by general fund activity that is now alleged to be highway \nfund activity, which is inappropriate. We should pay for roads with \nhighway fund activity.\n  But I just want to put a marker down that if we--on top of all this \nother gamesmanship as to how this is being paid for, and the deficit, \nwhich is being added to by this bill--move to try to use customs fees \nto give a figleaf of financial correctness to this bill, we would be \nmaking a serious and inappropriate error.\n  First off, the use of customs fees would be a direct raid on the \ngeneral fund because it would mean that fees, which are dedicated and \nwhich go into the general fund and would support the Customs Service, \nand anything else the general fund needs to spend them on, would then \nbe moved over to the highway fund. That would be inappropriate because \nthat would mean, yes, it might fill up the highway fund with more \nmoney, but it would take money out of the general fund, and you would \nhave to borrow to cover that and you would end up aggravating the \ndeficit to the extent you did that.\n  So it would not accomplish anything other than to give you a figleaf \napproach to fiscal responsibility. But even more importantly, this \nwhole issue of customs fees has been around the track so many times. It \nhas been used so many times here that I would think people would start \nfeeling a little reticent about trying to use it again. Literally, \ncustoms fees have gone around the track probably more times than \nSeabiscuit.\n  I just want to list a few times we have used customs fees--the same \ncustoms fees, by the way.\n  We used customs fees to pay for H.R. 7 in the 107th Congress, which \nwas the Community Solutions Act. We used customs fees to justify--we \nnever used them. We use them to justify that the bills are within the \nbudget. That is what this whole exercise is about. We used them again \nin the 107th Congress on the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. We used \nthem again in the 107th Congress for the Personal Responsibility, Work, \nand Family Promotion Act. We used them again in the 107th Congress for \nthe American Competitiveness and Corporate Accountability Act. We used \nthem again in the 107th Congress for the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nImprovement Act. We used them again in the 107th Congress for the \nServicemembers' Tax Assistance for Noteworthy Duty Act.\n  That was the 107th Congress. We used the same custom fees six times \nin the 107th Congress. That is amazing, gamesmanship at a new level.\n  Then we move to the 108th Congress. How many times have we used \ncustom fees so far in the 108th Congress? Well, it was used for the \nPrescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act; the jobs and growth tax \nrelief reconciliation bill. It was used for the Relief for Working \nFamilies Tax Act. It was used for the Relief for Working Families Tax \nAct twice, in fact. It was used for the Rebuild America Act by the \nHouse. It was used for the Health Care Coverage Expansion and Quality \nImprovement Act. And, of course, we are considering using it for this \nact.\n  At some point we have to have some modicum of fairness and \nforthrightness about what we are doing around here. I will strongly \nresist using custom fees as a vehicle for giving a figleaf of fiscal \naccountability to this bill because that is all it is. It is not \nlegitimate to use it. We know it won't be used. Its only purpose would \nbe so that people could come to the floor and argue that they somehow \npaid for this bill when, in fact, the practical effect of it is that it \nwill never be used. It has not been used yet in the prior 13 instances \nI have cited. And if it were used, it would mean a direct shift of \nfunds out of the general fund into the highway fund, creating a deficit \nsituation in the general fund, aggravating the deficit to the extent \nthat it was scored as being used in the highway fund.\n  It is bad policy. I wanted to lay down an early marker that this \nshould not be a manner in which we proceed on this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2502 To Amendment No. 2285\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have at the desk amendment No. 2502. I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2502.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the highway stormwater discharge mitigation \n                                program)\n\n       Beginning on page 876, strike line 12 and all that follows \n     through the matter between lines 6 and 7 on page 880.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment to S. 1072 preserves the \nbasic expansion of eligibility for storm water mitigation projects but \nremoves a mandatory 2 percent set-aside for storm water which was added \nin committee. While I protect storm water mitigation project \neligibility for funding from highway programs, I oppose sending another \nFederal Government mandate to the States, telling States they must set \naside 2 percent of their surface transportation programs for\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\nstorm water activities regardless of the actual need in the State.\n  There are few greater champions of Federal funding for water quality \nand drinking water in the Senate than myself and my colleague from the \nState of Maryland with whom I chair and serve as ranking member--\ndepending upon who is in control--of the appropriations subcommittee \nwhich funds water projects and programs in the EPA budget. Senator \nMikulski and I year after year have squeezed the rest of the budget to \nput badly needed funding for clean water and safe drinking water \nmeasures into our bill because we know there are great needs. Every \nyear we have to restore hundreds of millions of dollars that OMB, on a \nbipartisan basis, always takes out of the State revolving fund.\n  Last year we appropriated $1.35 billion to States for the clean water \nfunds and $850 million to States for their drinking water funds. Every \nyear we appropriate millions of dollars to protect, sustain, and \nrestore the health of our Nation's water habitat and ecosystems.\n  We spend millions of dollars funding water programs for the \nChesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, Lake Champlain, Long Island Sound, \nand the Great Lakes. Last year we sent hundreds of millions of dollars \nmore to member States for targeted investments in their water \ninfrastructure. We do that every year for our colleagues because we \nbelieve so much in providing clean and safe drinking water for our \nfamilies and local communities.\n  In this highway bill, I was also proud to join my colleagues, \nSenators Inhofe, Jeffords, and Reid, in expanding the eligibility for \nstorm water mitigation projects. Current law allows States to spend \nsurface transportation program funds on storm water mitigation needs. \nIn S. 1072, section 1601, we expand storm water eligibility to allow \nStates to spend National Highway System funds on storm water mitigation \nneeds. States can spend up to 20 percent of a project's cost on \nenvironmental restoration or pollution abatement such as storm water \nmitigation. However, that amount will be left up to the State and the \nindividual conditions at the site of each project. We should not set an \narbitrary number in Washington and force States to set aside that \namount.\n  We are not talking about a small amount of money. A mandatory 2 \npercent set-aside equals almost $1 billion over 6 years. That is $1 \nbillion States must divert from their surface transportation programs \nregardless of need. By now, many of you have heard from State DOTs that \nthey oppose a mandatory set-aside. Almost none of them, and nobody who \nis running highway programs, likes to have mandatory set-asides. Our \nStates certainly do not appreciate mandatory set-asides from \nWashington.\n  We also must remember that not every State has the same environmental \nconditions or needs. A State's need to spend highway funds on storm \nwater will differ depending on the individual conditions in each State \nor each part of the State. States in the upper Midwest, States in the \nWest, States in the Great Plains will not see the same rainfall nor \nstorm conditions as States in the East. Nonetheless, all States will be \nforced to set aside 2 percent of their STP funds for storm water unless \nthis section is struck.\n\n  What sense does it make for a State which has tremendous highway \nneeds but relatively few storm water needs to set aside 2 percent? Let \nme repeat, with my amendment, storm water mitigation projects are still \neligible for funding from highway programs. We preserve and expand \nstorm water funding eligibility. States will be free to spend the \namount of money they believe necessary to address storm water needs in \ntheir State. There may be years in which Missouri spends more than 2 \npercent on storm water needs. But our State has heavy rainfalls.\n  This vote is about whether we want to impose another mandate on our \nStates. I urge my colleagues to turn back this Federal Government \nmandate to say what the needs of every State are. There may be many \nStates for which this is not appropriate. I urge my colleagues to let \nStates decide how best to spend their highway dollars, and I urge \nsupport of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, the four of us--the chairman, \nranking member, chairman, and ranking member--have worked tirelessly to \narrive at a point where we can complete this bill. This is an important \namendment.\n  The Senator from Missouri has worked with us, the three managers--if \nI said weeks, it would not be valid; it is months. We are at a point \nwhere we simply cannot do this. I will make a commitment to my friend \nfrom Missouri that when we get to conference or when we work on this or \ndo our deal with the House, I will personally be involved in this and \ntry to work out something that would be satisfactory to the Senator \nfrom Missouri. It simply won't work at this stage. I ask that the \nSenator withdraw the amendment at this time.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2502 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my cohort on the \nSurface Transportation Subcommittee. We have worked together over the \nyears. I raise this point for the entire Senate so they know we are \ngoing to have to address it in the Congress, because there are many \nStates that I am sure we will hear from that do not need this. In order \nto move the bill along and to avoid causing our colleagues to have \nanother vote--perhaps those who need to get away--I withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senator did that because \nit was to strike a provision I worked on in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the amendment \noffered by my colleague Senator Bond to strike the Committee's \nstormwater mitigation program.\n  The full committee adopted an amendment I offered with many of my \ncolleagues to begin to address--for the first time--an unfunded Federal \nmandate on our localities.\n  I regret that my colleague opposes helping our localities with the \nserious financial burdens imposed by the Clean Water Act to correct \nstormwater runoff problems. I have heard him tell the Senate that this \nstormwater provision is a mandate on our state highway departments, but \nhe has not told you the rest of the story.\n  The rest of the story is that the existing Clean Water Act regulatory \nprogram requires all of our communities to obtain a permit for their \nstormwater discharges and flood control projects. According to many \norganizations who are on the front lines in dealing with this problem, \nthey strongly support this modest provision to begin to address \npollution problems from existing highways.\n  This modest program of $160 million annually is a very small part of \nthis massive $311 billion bill. It begins to fund an unfunded Federal \nmandate. Most importantly, our states want this program.\n  The Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control \nAdministrators--our state officials responsible for improving the water \nquality of our rivers, lakes and streams--have written urging that the \nSenate retain this small program.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I refer to a portion of the State \nofficials letter:\n\n       Communities throughout the nation, including numerous \n     smaller towns and counties are required under the Clean Water \n     Act to obtain discharge permits for stormwater. Even those \n     communities, which have long understood the value of \n     protecting their drinking sources and recreational waters \n     from stormwater impacts, are already hard-pressed to cope \n     with the cost, as they have been absorbing the costs of \n     discharges from highways. This represents an unfair burden to \n     these communities and we believe it is fair for the \n     transportation funding system to remedy this problem where \n     existing highways and other roads cause significant runoff \n     problems.\n\n  The Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies has written that\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\n``This amendment marks a crucial step toward addressing the billions of \ndollars in expenditures that state and local governments are required \nto make in controlling stormwater generated by our nation's highways. . \n. .\n  Similar letters of strong support have come from the Association of \nMetropolitan Sewerage Agencies, the Association of Metropolitan Water \nAgencies, the American Water Works Association, and the Association of \nState Floodplain Managers, and numerous other groups.\n  The support for the Committee's provision is strong because everyone \nrecognizes that stormwater runoff from highways is a known impediment \nto good water quality. Some have calculated that this runoff is the \nleading cause of pollution for nearly 50 percent of our national \nrivers, lakes and streams.\n  Roads collect pollutants from tailpipe emissions, brake linings, oils \nand other sources. During storms they mix with other contaminants of \nheavy metals and road salts that wash into our waters. This result is \nseriously degraded water quality of our rivers, lakes and streams.\n  Today, every new highway must include methods to control this runoff. \nBut, there is a large need for our states and local governments to \nconstruct stormwater mitigation projects on existing roadways to meet \nthe requirements of the Clean Water Act. Under federal regulations, \neven our smallest communities and counties will be required to \nimplement projects to control stormwater runoff.\n  The modest program in the Committee bill requires States to dedicate \n2 percent within the Surface Transportation program--one category of \nhighway funding--to control stormwater runoff from our roads.\n  It is true that stormwater mitigation projects are eligible for \nfunding under the NHS and Transportation Enhancements program. However, \nthe funding demand for these programs is great.\n  I have also heard the author of this amendment that will punish our \nlocal governments say that we will work to fund these stormwater \nactivities under the Clean Water Act. The Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, however, has struggled unsuccessfully with financing our \nNation's multi-billion dollar water infrastructure needs. We've come to \nno consensus or new financing package.\n  In 2000, EPA estimated at least $8.3 billion over 20 years in local \nfunding needs to address stormwater requirements. The modest program in \nthe bill before us provides approximately $958 million over 6 years. \nThis is simply some small relief to our localities to address pollution \nfrom existing highways.\n  Our States want this program. Our communities deserve to have some \nrelief from this unfunded Federal mandate.\n  For the benefit of all of my colleagues--make no mistake--this is not \nthe only requirement on how States spend Federal highway dollars. The \nbill before us is full of mandates on our States. Even the proponent of \nthe amendment has offered his own mandate in the bill. It requires that \nStates divert 2 percent of the National Highway System funding to \nconnector roads that are not even on the National Highway System map. \nPerhaps this is a worthy goal, but again, it is a mandate on our States \non how they use their Federal highway funds.\n  I ask my colleagues to carefully consider this amendment and ask that \nthey not move to take away this critically needed funding from our \nlocalities and work to meet unfunded mandates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. This has been a long, arduous 2 weeks for me and the other \nmanagers. We are at the point now that I understand we can soon go to \nfinal passage. If there is something to the contrary, I would certainly \nlike to know about that.\n  Prior to final passage, the chairman of the committee has some \nmatters that need to be disposed of. I wanted to alert everybody we are \ngetting close to the end of this matter.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have the managers' amendments that we \nhave talked about for a long period. I ask unanimous consent that they \nbe agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor and cannot \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, yesterday, I filed an amendment with \nSenator Allen and Senator Burns to the Household Goods Moving portion \nof SAFE-TEA. Under the circumstances, I will not call it up. The \namendment's purpose is to enact meaningful consumer protections that \nalso safeguard small businesses and their employees.\n  Each year 1.5 million households hire commercial moving companies to \nmove their household goods to another state. There are almost 3,000 \nfederally registered motor carriers who transport household goods \nacross state lines. Most of these moving companies are small \nbusinesses--Mom and Pop family-owned businesses.\n  In addition to the thousands of licensed small business movers, there \nare countless unlicensed and unregistered movers. Everyone agrees that \nthe vast majority of movers provide quality service in an ethical \nmanner, but there are some ``bad apples'' that don't follow the rules \nto the detriment of consumers and other reputable small businesses. \nThese ``bad apples'' take advantage of consumers with misleading \nestimates, baiting them with deals that are ``too good to be true.'' \nThey're also known to hold customers' household goods hostage while \nthey demand higher fees.\n  The predatory tactics of these ``bad apples'' give the entire moving \nindustry a bad name. They hurt consumers and they threaten thousands of \nlegitimate small business moving companies, endangering the jobs of the \ntens of thousands of employees and the families that depend on them. \nCongress needs to commit itself to enacting reforms that will help stop \nunscrupulous movers and their predatory tactics and protect consumers \nand the small business jobs in the moving industry.\n  I appreciate Senator McCain and his staff's efforts in this area. \nMany of the reforms in the Household Goods Moving portion of SAFE-TEA \naccomplish these goals. I believe that Congress can enact legislation \nthat will protect consumers, small businesses and the thousands of jobs \nin the household good moving industry. My amendment works to punish \n``bad apples,'' protect consumers, safeguard the thousands of \nlegitimate small businesses, and sustain the good jobs in the moving \nindustry.\n  When I was Chairman of the Small Business Committee in the House, I \nlearned that sometimes regulation offered even with the greatest of \nintentions could unfortunately have an opposite and devastating impact \non the people it intended to protect. It is clear that some of the \nprovisions in the underlying bill will not hinder unscrupulous ``bad \napples,'' but instead seriously harm legitimate small businesses and \nendanger American jobs and the families that depend on them.\n  I have some concerns about the consumer protections that were \nattached, because some of them operate in a way where they burden the \nhonest businesses and do not stop the dishonest ones. That is always \nthe nightmare with regulation when we do it. Sometimes they end up \nmaking it difficult for the people who are trying to comply with the \nlaw, and the corner cutters still cut corners and we end up with the \nworst of both worlds.\n  There is a provision in the bill that was added in the Commerce \nCommittee, for example, that would allow lawsuits against movers who \ndon't use the absolute shortest route to get the household goods from \none place to another. That is very understandable because some of the \nbad apples will drive around town in order to build up the price and \nget a higher fee for the moving.\n  At the same time, they are very legitimate reasons why a business may \nnot take the shortest route--safety reasons, for example. What I am \nsaying is we need to look at the provisions that were enacted in \ncommittee in conference to make certain that we do the best job we can \ndo of protecting consumers while partnering with the legitimate small \nbusinesses, because they want the bad apples out of the business as \nwell. All of us have had an experience or we know of friends who\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nhad experience with these businesses that want to hurt everybody.\n  We want to protect consumers. We have to do it in a way that partners \nwith the good companies. We don't want to drive their costs up, which \nwill then be passed along to consumers. Worst case, some of these \nlegitimate small businesses will have to go out of business. These \nissues deserve further consideration in the conference.\n  Our amendment offers commonsense solutions.\n  My amendment protects a legitimate small business mover's right to \ncollect for additional work requested by the customer at the time when \nhis or her goods are delivered.\n  My amendment enhances consumer protections. State enforcement laws \nshould strictly protect consumers by prohibiting movers from holding a \ncustomer's goods hostage.\n  My amendment defends legitimate small businesses' right to recoup \nattorneys fees if they are determined to be ``in the right'' by a \ncourt.\n  My amendment also addresses provisions in the underlying bill that \nhave little to do with consumer protection.\n  For example, if the underlying bill is passed as written, attorneys \ncould legislate through prosecution the route a legitimate small \nbusiness mover must take when delivering household goods.\n  Admittedly, this provision was designed to protect consumers from \n``bad apples'' that literally take their customers for a ride, using \nlonger routes and charging higher fees.\n  But, unfortunately, the way the provision is written, mom and pop \nsmall business moving companies would also suffer and be exposed to \nlawsuits and fines that will threaten their business and the jobs of \ntheir employees. Attorneys should not determine the fate of legitimate \nsmall business movers.\n  Small business movers are experienced and they know which highways to \ntake in traffic and in bad weather. In St. Louis, Missouri, we have two \ncentral highways: highway 40 and 44. It's clear to anybody who travels \non those highways that 44 is often the quicker route in rush-hour \ntraffic. But, this provision would take away an experienced drivers \nright to choose. It could be mandated that he use only highway 40.\n  Legitimate movers don't make their money scamming customers; they \nmake their money getting shipments on and off, on-time.\n  Despite the fact that this provision is intended to protect \nconsumers, it could have the opposite effect, requiring movers to take \nless efficient routes; routes they knew were slower because they drive \non those roads everyday; and all because an attorney decided it was \nquickest.\n  As a result, the longer shipment times would translate into higher \ncosts for consumers since carriers would be forced to petition for \nhigher fuel tax surcharges, a cost born by consumers.\n  I believe that it's important in situations like these to reach out \nto the stakeholders in the community of legitimate small business \nmovers those who are affected by these provisions and partner with them \nto determine the proper solution. Everybody wants to stop the ``bad \napples.''\n  This list goes on and on. Many of the provisions do not protect \nconsumers and force unnecessary and burdensome regulations on mom and \npop small businesses across all 50 States; possibly causing an increase \nin carrier rates across the country; harming legitimate small \nbusinesses--and not the ``bad apples''; and threatening the jobs and \nlivelihoods of the thousands of employees in the moving industry. These \nissues deserve further consideration in conference and I urge my \ncolleagues to continue their good work; and to partner with the small \nbusiness moving community to punish the ``bad apples'' and enact \nmeaningful consumer protections, safeguard small businesses and protect \nthe jobs of the tens of thousands of employees and families that depend \non them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, earlier today the Chairman of the Senate \nCommerce Committee was here on the floor charging Chairman Inhofe and \nour EPW Committee with inserting Amtrak legislation into our highway \nbill. Shortly thereafter, I was glad to see that same Senator rise to \napologize for this incorrect statement. Because the truth is, that the \nprovisions the Senator was talking about are actually in his own \ncommittee's title of this bill.\n  So now that it is established not even the Chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee knows what is in his title, I think it is only appropriate to \naddress some of the problems in that title.\n  Earlier today I discussed a few of the problems I have seen in that \ntitle. At that time, I pointed out that we still have not heard from \nthe Commerce Committee Chairman what is in his title. Well, we still \nhaven't had an explanation . . . and if that committee's chairman \ndidn't know that the Amtrak provisions were actually in his own title, \nit makes me wonder if anyone actually knows what is in the Commerce \nCommittee title of this bill.\n  That said, I am back here again to briefly address a few more \nproblems with the Safety Title of this bill. And in an effort to safe \ntime, I will not call up amendments to fix these problems, but I hope \nthat these concerns can be addressed in Conference.\n  I am concerned that certain provisions in the Commerce Committee's \nTitle go a little too far in specifically directing the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration to publish final rules on a wide \nvariety of new vehicle safety requirements. I am all for highway \nsafety, but to assume that today, we know enough to tell NHTSA exactly \nwhen it must promulgate over a dozen rules, covering many elements of \nvehicle design to crash testing, over the next few years, seems \ndisruptive to NHTSA's safety priorities. I am not an expert in this \narea, but let me read what the administration thinks of this amendment. \nI remind my colleagues that earlier today we were told by the Commerce \nCommittee Chairman that none of the statements in the SAp were in \nrelation to his committee's title. Well, this if from the statement of \nadministration position on this provision issued February 11.\n  ``The administration strongly opposes mandate rulemakings for NHTSA \nand the FMCSA. These provisions predetermine timetables and outcomes \nwithout adequate grounding in science, engineering and proof of net \nsafety benefits. By prescribing specific requirements and mandating \npriorities, these provisions will delay or interfere with ongoing \nsafety initiatives and may have the unintended consequence of \nredirecting agency resources away from programs that will do more \noverall good for safety.''\n  My main concern is that these mandates disrupt NHTSA's safety \npriorities and might not be the best use of its resources. We have \npassed laws that govern the issuance of motor vehicle safety standards \nrequiring NHTSA to consider all available safety data when setting new \nstandards and that those new standards must meet the need for highway \nsafety, as well as be reasonable, practicable and appropriate for the \nvehicles to which they apply. This amendment, by telling NHTSA it must \npromulgate certain standards, is inconsistent with existing law and has \nthe potential to require NHTSA to publish standards that might not be \nin the best interest of highway safety. I hope that the sponsor of the \namendment will agree to work with me, and others, to ensure that we \nactually improve highway safety and not do harm by requiring the \nexperts at DOT to divert valuable and limited resources from their true \nsafety mission.\n  Mr. President, this debate is not personal. But I cannot stand idly \nby and have one Member or a handful of Members tell us all that the EPW \nCommittee is a budget buster, or is the only part of this package that \ncarries a veto threat, or that Amtrak provisions are in our title, or \non and on.\n  The truth, Mr. President, is that this bill is paid for, is budget \nneutral based on the Finance Committee title which pays for increases \nover the budget resolution. For the Record, of all the titles above the \nbudget resolution (though paid for), it's the Commerce Committee title \nthat is the highest increase over their allocation. In fact, that title \nis a 50-percent increase over the budget allocation.\n  Mr. President, it is also true that the Commerce Committee title is \nnew. It is\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\nnot what was reported out of Committee, and it was not altered by the \namendment process here on the floor. Instead, it was changed by the \nCommerce Committee staff, and apparently not even the Chairman knows \nwhat is in it.\n  I want a good highway bill. There are some real problems with this \ntitle, and I urge my colleagues to take a close look at it. And I hope \nwe can address some of these harmful mandates in Conference.\n  We had thorough discussions when other safety provisions had come \nforward. This one has been slipped into the commerce title. There are \nsome real problems. Earlier today, we were told by the Commerce \nCommittee that none of the statements in the Statement of \nAdministration Policy were in relation to the committee title. Let me \nread from the Statement of Administration Policy on this provision \nissued February 11:\n\n       The administration strongly opposes the numerous mandated \n     rulemakings for NHTSA and the FMCSA. These provisions \n     predetermine timetables and outcomes without adequate \n     grounding in science, engineering, and proof of net safety \n     benefits. By prescribing specific requirements and mandating \n     priorities, these provisions will delay or interfere with \n     ongoing safety initiatives and may have the unintended \n     consequence of redirecting agency resources away from \n     programs that will do more overall good for safety.\n\n  I think this provision disrupts NHTSA's safety priorities. We passed \nlaws that govern the issuance of motor vehicle safety standards. \nUnfortunately, they are not going to be able to use the full scientific \nand engineering information they wish to if they are forced to take the \nprovisions in this amendment.\n  This is inconsistent with existing law. I hope in the conference we \nwill work to change these so we do not foul up the efforts of NHTSA to \nuse the best safety and engineering to achieve goals that have not been \ndiscussed or debated on this floor. I hope we can change that part.\n  Finally, the truth is, this bill is paid for. It is budget neutral \nbased on the Finance Committee title. For the record, all of the titles \nin the budget resolution are paid for. It is the Commerce Committee \ntitle that is the highest increase over the allocation. It is 50 \npercent over the allocation. These are problems we are going to have to \ndeal with in the conference. I assure my colleagues we need to address \nall of these issues.\n  I close my comments by thanking the chairman, Senator Inhofe, the \nranking member, Senator Jeffords, and my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Reid of Nevada, for the cooperative way we have worked through \nthis bill. There is a long way to go before we get to a conference \nagreement with the House that we hope will be able to include concerns \nby the administration so we will be able to move quickly to get a good \nhighway bill which will deal with our tremendous overwhelming \ntransportation safety problems in the United States and put people to \nwork sooner rather than later.\n  Finally, as I said, I support the proposal raised by my colleague \nfrom Missouri, and I hope that can be included in the conference.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill to move the \nhighway and transportation bill forward and get a good bill that can \nmake a great deal of difference for the economy, for jobs, long-term \neconomic growth and, most of all, for the safety of transportation in \nthe United States.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2333 to Amendment No. 2285\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2333 to amendment No. 2285.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To encourage States to give priority to pedestrian and \n    bicycle facility enhancement projects that include a coordinate \n            physical activity or healthy lifestyles program)\n\n       On page 389, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 18__. PRIORITY FOR PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITY \n                   ENHANCEMENT PROJECTS.\n\n       Section 133(e)(5) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) Priority for pedestrian and bicycle facility \n     enhancement projects.--The Secretary shall encourage States \n     to give priority to pedestrian and bicycle facility \n     enhancement projects that include a coordinated physical \n     activity or healthy lifestyles program.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my amendment concerns transportation \nenhancement projects, and the need to promote physical activity and \nhealthy lifestyles. In particular, my amendment gives priority to \ntransportation enhancement projects that include a coordinated physical \nactivity plan.\n  Over the last 20 years, new public health threats have emerged--\nobesity and the chronic diseases associated with poor nutrition and \nlack of physical activity. In fact, chronic diseases now account for 75 \npercent of our Nation's $1 trillion annual health care costs.\n  The health statistics on obesity are staggering. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, two-thirds of Americans \nover overweight or obese, and the rates of obesity have doubled in \nchildren and tripled among teenagers since 1980.\n  Obesity also increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, \nseveral kinds of cancer, and other health problems. Approximately \n300,000 deaths a year in the United States are associated with obesity \nand being overweight.\n  Spiraling rates of obesity don't just affect individuals, they place \na burden on the average taxpayer and on the Federal Government. The \nU.S. Surgeon General estimates that obesity costs the Nation $117 \nbillion a year in health care and related costs. Physical activity \nalone costs over $75 billion per year.\n  There is no single solution to the problem of obesity and overweight. \nThis is a complex problem, and it must be addressed creatively and \ncomprehensively. One opportunity is before us today in the \ntransportation bill.\n  The amendment that I am proposing today concerns transportation \nenhancement projects, a long standing transportation program under \nwhich a large share of our hiking and bike trails on non-Federal lands \nare built.\n  Such trails, paths, and projects can play an important role in \npromoting physical exercise in our communities. My amendment seeks to \nencourage transportation trail enhancement projects to include physical \nactivity and healthy lifestyle programs. Very simply, within the \napplications a State or planning organization receive for trail or bike \npath funding, it gives priority to trail projects that encourage \ncoordinated physical activity or healthy lifestyle programs. It does \nnot shift the balance of funding to trail enhancement projects from \nother allowable categories. It certainly has no impact on the total \ndollars that go to enhancement projects.\n  This amendment does not micromanage funds or tie the hands of States \nseeking to make choices that are most appropriate to their needs. I \nbelieve individual States and local planning organizations should have \nflexibility to make decisions about their transportation priorities. \nAnd my amendment preserves that flexibility.\n  Possible examples of such efforts might include an exercise course on \nthe side of a trail; or perhaps an exercise program run by a local \nrecreation department. We have had tremendous success with local trails \nand bikeways.\n  If we do not start seeking out opportunities to encourage healthier \nlifestyles for Americans, whether it be in an obvious place such as a \nchild nutrition or health care bill, or in a less obvious bill such as \nthis transportation bill, we will all pay the price--both in our health \nand in our budgets. I ask for the support of my colleagues on this \ncommonsense amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2482.\n  The amendment (No. 2482) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. TALENT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know there are discussions going on, but \nI would like, if at all possible, to begin to bring matters to a close \nin the next several minutes. While some final decisions are made on \nthis important bill, I will make a closing statement and then we will \nsee what the outcome is on the remaining amendments.\n  The transportation bill that we have been considering for the last 2 \nweeks is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will \nconsider in this second session. It is important not only for \nmaintaining and improving our transportation infrastructure system--\nsomething that we talked a lot about over the last 2 weeks--but it is \nalso important, as has been discussed, for creating jobs.\n  Conservative estimates are that this legislation would create as many \nas 1.6 million jobs over the life of the bill, and some analysts now \nbelieve it can create as many as 2 million new jobs.\n  This legislation is also important for our Federal-State partnership. \nThe bulk of expenditures in this country for our public infrastructure \nprograms, for building, for expanding and maintaining transportation \nsystems is not Federal dollars but State and local expenditures. The \nFederal share from all public infrastructure spending in this country \naverages about one-quarter or 25 percent. That is the Federal share.\n  Further, at the Federal level annual spending for ground \ntransportation programs represents less than 2 percent of all Federal \nspending. But this important spending serves as a catalyst for economic \ngrowth. I believe it is a small investment we can make in our economy. \nIt is an essential investment in moving our economy forward while also \nmaking it safe for us to use our highways and our intercity rail \nsystems.\n  The funding for our Federal highway and mass transit infrastructure \nsystem is complex, it is obscure, and I freely admit that it is \nconfusing. Here in the Senate, the legislation involves at least six \nstanding committees, sometimes with overlapping jurisdiction.\n  The financing of our Federal highway system includes spending subject \nto annual appropriations. It also includes automatic or mandatory \nspending. The financing of these expenditures comes from many sources--\nfrom gas taxes, from excise taxes, from user fees, and from general \nrevenues.\n  But this afternoon, I would like to address in as simple a way as I \ncan my understanding of the Federal spending issue that clearly has \nfrustrated both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Several points: First, this is a 6-year authorization and spending \nbill. The administration supports enactment of a 6-year bill. While \nthey do not support the level of resources this bill devotes to \ntransportation spending, I hope we will be able to find a compromise \nwith the House of Representatives and the administration that will meet \nall concerns.\n  We are currently operating all these programs under a temporary \nextension that expires on February 29. Before the end of the month, we \nwill have to once again temporarily extend the expiring authorities.\n  Funds have already been provided for the programs this year in the \nOmnibus appropriations bill that we enacted last month, but \nauthorization to expend those funds will lapse at the end of this \nmonth.\n  Point No. 2: The bill--or I should say more precisely the four \nbills--highways, mass transit, safety programs, and financing--\nestablish an overall level of ``contract authority.'' For the next 6 \nyears, this contract authority is estimated to total $318 billion.\n  What is contract authority? There has been a lot of confusion. I was \non the Senate floor as we talked about this bill in the last several \nweeks. And, indeed, throughout Capitol Hill, people do not fully \nunderstand what contract authority is.\n  Contract authority is created in law, authorizing the Federal \nGovernment to enter into contracts and incur obligations in the future \nbut in advance of, or even in excess of, funds available for that \npurpose.\n  The funds actually necessary to carry out that contract authority \nmust be provided later--usually later in the appropriations bill--and \nit is called liquidating appropriations.\n  Point No. 3: How will this bill before us today, if enacted, impact \nFederal spending in the future? There has been a lot of focus on \nspending today, and a lot of fracturing of the discussions on this \nspending.\n  Interestingly, the bill also includes language that limits the amount \nof this $318 billion in contract authority that can be obligated or \nliquidated over the next 6 years. This bill sets that limit to be $290 \nbillion, which is nearly $28 billion less than the level at which the \ncontract can be set.\n  If one is concerned about spending, it is this so-called obligation \nlimit that really matters--not the contract authority. Therefore, when \nI compare what the Senate bill proposes to spend versus the President's \nbudget request, it is a difference of about $6 billion a year.\n  I am committed to resolving this difference as this legislation works \nits way in regular order through the Senate and conference with the \nHouse.\n  Fourth and last point: Since this bill limits the amount of contract \nauthority that can be obligated over the next 6 years, one possible \nsolution might be to reduce the higher contract level to a level that \nwe actually believe will be obligated and spent. There may be some who \ncan explain the difference, but simplistically I think that those two--\nthe obligation limit and the contract authority--should be the same.\n  Indeed, the President's budget sets both the contract authority and \nthe obligation limit at identical levels. Therefore, I suggest that we \nall remain flexible on this spending issue, and that as this bill goes \nforth we give consideration to reducing the contract authority level \ndown to what we truly expect to spend.\n  Today, even before this bill ever becomes law, the Federal aid to the \nhighway trust fund is estimated by the administration to have $25.6 \nbillion in unobligated balances. This is in unobligated contract \nauthority.\n  Let me repeat. Today, we have put on the books $25.6 billion in \ncontracts that we have not fulfilled and are not likely to honor \nbecause we have been limited--or will be limited--by previous \nlegislation to the level of these obligations.\n  Thus, I am convinced that as this bill proceeds we can find ways to \nreduce its costs and address the concerns raised by the President.\n  This is a very difficult and complicated legislative issue. I \ncongratulate all the committees involved, especially the committee \nchairmen and ranking members and their staffs who have brought this \nlegislation to the Senate for consideration. Indeed, it is because of \nall the complexities involved that they are to be truly congratulated \nfor even getting this far.\n  In closing, just as an aside, let me conclude that one lesson that we \nmight learn from these legislative exercises surrounding the highway \nbills over the last several weeks--indeed months--is as we look to the \nfuture, we may want to rethink the structure of our committees in this \narea. We may want to find ways that could streamline this overall \nlegislative process to make funding more transparent and to improve the \noverall oversight of these various transportation programs.\n  I probably would find that restructuring of committees and how we \nconsider major infrastructure legislation in the Congress even more \ndifficult than just passing a highway bill. But I think we need to \nstart thinking about this for the future.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we would like to at this point yield for a \nunanimous consent request of the Senator from Ohio.\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the amendments I filed \nyesterday, along with Senator Stevens, was in relation to what I am \ncalling the Denali Transportation System. I am disappointed the full \namendment will not be part of the bill, but I am grateful for the \nefforts Senator Inhofe and others who were able to accommodate even \npart of it.\n  As my colleagues know, the National Highway System we established in \nthe 1950s not only brought benefits to individual States but to the \ncountry as a whole. It has more than lived up to its promise of greater \naccess, an improved quality of life, and increased wealth for all \nAmericans. Throughout the United States, a modern highway system \nconnects virtually every single community in every single State--except \none.\n  The majority of Alaskan communities remain unconnected. Alaska has \nbeen left far behind the rest of the Nation, with a road system that is \nno system at all. If the highway system is the Nation's skeleton, \nAlaska is still missing its arms and legs.\n  As a result, many Alaskan communities are punished with third-world \nconditions and an extraordinarily high cost of living, and the Nation \nas a whole is that much poorer because Alaska's tremendous natural \nwealth cannot be shared.\n  This is not the first time that Congress has dealt with a similar \nproblem. When the Appalachia region needed extra assistance, Congress \nresponded to the call by providing $450 million per year for the \nAppalachia commission to construct the Appalachia Transportation \nSystem. The bill before us proposes to increase that sum even further, \nto $590 million per year.\n  A 1998 Congressional Research Service report reads as follows:\n\n       In 1964, a Presidential commission on Appalachian region \n     reported that ``geographic isolation'' was the very basis of \n     its development lag. The commission argued that development \n     ``could not proceed until its regional isolation was overcome \n     by its penetration by an adequate transportation network.''\n       Further, they said, a system was needed ``to and from the \n     rest of the nation and within the region itself.''\n       Their core argument: ``before development could take place \n     in Appalachia, major investments had to be made in basic \n     public facilities.'' This was coupled with a belief that the \n     ``barrier-effect of Appalachia's mountain-chains was a major \n     cause of underdevelopment'' and led to a proposal that a \n     development highway system be built ``to break the isolation \n     of Appalachia's economically depressed regions.''\n       Importantly they noted, ``that the routes not be chosen to \n     ease congestion or upgrade heavily traveled areas but to \n     stimulate traffic through remote areas that have a \n     development potential.''\n\n  My amendment would allow the Denali Commission to begin doing for \nroadless areas of Alaska what Congress authorized for Appalachia. \nHowever, there are some critical differences. I want to emphasize that \nword ``roadless.''\n  In the Appalachia region, communities were isolated by poor roads. In \nAlaska, they are isolated by no roads. We are not asking for an entire \nnetwork of major highways, only for the simple ability to move people \nand goods overland from one place to another. The dirt roads Appalachia \nstarted with would be regarded as a blessing in Alaska.\n  Second, we are proposing only to construct connections for \ncommunities that have no current access--no highway, no rural two-lane \nroad, no dirt road, or improvements to the internal roads in these same \nisolated communities. The latter is critical for residents to get to \ntheir schools, to clean water sources, to clinics and stores and \ngarbage dumps.\n  Third, and most important, we are not asking for similar funding. I \nunderstand the fiscal realities before us today. The amendment I filed \nasked for only $50 million per year for Alaska. As revised, it will \nprovide $30 million.\n  The increase this bill contains for Appalachia is almost three times \nthat sum. In all, the Appalachia system will receive almost 12 times \nwhat we are asking.\n  I do not object to spending money in Appalachia. I think that money \nhas gone to good use. I simply believe we would get even greater value \nfrom a modest investment in the 49th State.\n  Alaska is rich in resources that can and should be a driving force \nfor the Nation's economy, stimulating hundreds of thousands of jobs \nthroughout the country. It is in an ideal location to be a crossroad \nfor international trade, both by air and by sea, especially if you \nbelieve predictions that warming trends will open up a northern sea \nroute to Europe in a few short years.\n  Yet we remain poor both in population and in highway miles. The \nformula funds we receive through the highway bill are not sufficient to \nallow the construction of new links between communities, no matter how \nbadly they are needed.\n  I also understand some of my colleagues wish to create a new \nAppalachia-style system for the lower Mississippi area. I noted some \npictures of a bridge were displayed on the floor yesterday, and it was \nsuggested that that bridge was inadequate. At least the citizens of \nthat area have bridges to complain about. My constituents do not.\n  It is important to make the point that this is not just about \nAlaska's needs. We all expect and demand certain basics for our \nconstituents: clean water and food, warmth, shelter, schools and \nmedical services.\n  In my State, because of the isolation of so many communities, all \nthese services have to be duplicated over and over again, because the \nNative people of these isolated communities are eligible for and \nreceive Federal assistance to ensure they have access to those \nservices.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues suggest that Alaska demands a \ngreat deal. Let me suggest that we would be happy to demand less, if we \nwere in less desperate need. No State--or its citizens--can prosper \nwithout adequate transportation systems. In much of the country, such \nsystems have been in place since before the American Revolution, and \nhave been constantly changing, adapting and being upgraded ever since. \nIn much of Alaska, in contrast, residents are still forced to travel \nbetween communities by boat, or on frozen rivers, just as they did when \nthe Territory of Alaska was first purchased from Imperial Russia. In \nthis day and age, such a situation is completely unacceptable. It is a \nlasting mark of neglect, and it is past time to rectify it.\n  The Denali Transportation System will provide far greater benefits \nthan costs. As we enter an era where gigantic natural changes are \noccurring in the Arctic environment, and ice-free maritime \ntransportation through the Arctic Ocean is expected to become a reality \nwithin decades, it is critical that we begin to prepare ourselves for \nthose changes. Adequate transportation connections to--and within--\nAmerica's only Arctic State are imperative.\n  This is a time for foresight. The key to long-term prosperity is wise \ninvestment. Investing in Alaska is investing wisely for the future of \nthe entire nation, just as investing in Appalachia was a wise choice. \nWe have incomparable resources and vigorous citizens. It is time we \nhave the transportation system that will allow those assets to be used \nas they should be.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \ncloture motion on the bill and then ask the bill be read for a third \ntime.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I object.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I withdraw the previous unanimous consent request and now \nsend the managers' amendment to the desk. We have no further debate on \nthe managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent to vitiate \ncloture on the bill and then ask that the bill be read a third time and \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to say a word about tax \nprovisions being included in non-tax titles. The Finance Committee has \nsole jurisdiction over tax matters. The reasons for this are rooted in \nthe U.S. Constitution. As a committee, it is imperative that we weigh \nin on all tax matters. This is particularly true with the provision \nincluded in the EPW Committee Substitute. We have heard from the \nJustice Department that this provision, as drafted, could jeopardize \nlaw enforcement efforts against organized crime and money laundering. \nThe provision did not have the benefit of committee review or process. \nI appreciate the sponsor's interest in this issue. But I would remind \nMembers that the chairman and ranking member take the responsibilities \nof the Finance Committee seriously. When we go to conference, I also \nwant to ensure that regardless of the fact that the provision is \nincluded in the EPW title, the tax-writers are given responsibility to \noversee the provision.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chairman for his comments, and I look forward \nto working with him to resolve this matter.\n\n\npreserving parks, recreation areas, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and \n                             historic sites\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to engage the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nVoinovich, on the intent of his amendment regarding the preservation of \nparks, recreation areas, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic \nsites. The amendment would require the Secretary, when making a finding \nof de minimis impact, to consider all ``avoidance, minimization, \nmitigation, and enhancement measures'' that have been incorporated into \nthe project. Could you explain how this provision would be implemented?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. This language serves an important function: it builds \nin an incentive for project sponsors to incorporate environmentally \nprotective measures into a project from the beginning in order to \nsupport a finding of de minimis impact.\n  Obviously, there will be projects whose impacts will exceed the de \nminimis threshold even when mitigation measures are taken into account. \nFor those projects the traditional Section 4(f) requirements will \napply. But there also are many projects that could meet the de minimis \nimpact standard if the project sponsor commits to take specific actions \nto reduce or offset the project's impacts on Section 4(f) resources. \nThis amendment will make it possible for a finding of de minimis impact \nto be made in those situations.\n\n\n                           Revenue provisions\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, during the Finance Committee consideration \nof the tax title of this bill, there was significant debate on the \nprovision in the bill that would shift a portion of corporate estimated \ntax payments from 2010 into 2009. This provision raises $11.4 billion \nin the year 2009, but loses $11.4 billion in the year 2010. The \nChairman included this provision in his bill in response to concerns \nraised by me and the Chairman of the Budget Committee that the highway \nspending is not fully paid for over six years. I appreciate his \nsensitivity to my concerns. I believe that the spending in this bill, \nwhich occurs over six years, should be fully paid for over the same six \nyear period. However, I do not believe that the shift in corporate \nestimated tax payments in the most appropriate way to achieve the goal \nof fully funding this bill over six years. The provision proposed by \nthe Chairman shifts a hole in general revenues from one year into \nanother.\n  In lieu of me offering an amendment during the Finance Committee mark \nup to replace the shift in corporate estimated tax payments with \ndifferent revenue offsets, the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the \nCommittee made a commitment to work with me to find new offsets before \nthe highway bill is voted off the Senate floor. The second degree \namendment that I have filed to the amendment by the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Nickles, would have executed the commitment that was made \nto members of the Committee during the Finance mark up.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to work with \nmy colleague on the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, and with the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee on this matter. I \nshare the concern of the Senator from North Dakota about using a timing \nshift in the corporate estimated tax payments as a way to pay for the \nspending in this bill. Although I realize that this payment shift has \nbeen used as an offset previously by the Finance Committee and this \nbody, I do not support using the provision in the legislation before us \ntoday. I agree with my friend from North Dakota that real spending \nshould be offset with real revenues. Senator Conrad's second degree \namendment to my amendment striking the shift in corporate estimated tax \npayments would replace the $11.4 billion that is shifted into 2009 with \nreal revenue over the six year period of the bill.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. My friend from Oklahoma is correct. My amendment would \nhave replaced the provision shifting corporate estimated tax receipts \nwith an extension of IRS and Customs User fees, and with several tax \nloophole closers that are included in S. 1637, the JOBS Act. These \nmeasures have already been reported by the Senate Finance Committee. I \nthank the Senator from Iowa for trying to include our amendments in his \npackage of technical tax measures. Unfortunately, because certain \nprovisions of my amendment are considered non-germane, we were unable \nto consider it on the floor today. I hope that the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Committee will continue working with me as the \nlegislative process moves forward to address my concerns.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I, too, am disappointed that we were unable to consider \nthe amendment of the Senator from North Dakota. I look forward to \nworking with him and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance \nCommittee to find a way to fulfill the commitment that was made during \nthe Finance Committee mark up of the highway bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I support the amendments offered by my colleagues from \nNorth Dakota and Oklahoma. I\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\nwant to assure them that I fully intend to make good on the promise \nmade in the Committee mark up. In a separate statement I made today, I \nlaid out for the Senate the history of the use of the corporate shift. \nIt has been used in varying forms on a number of tax bills that have \nbeen enacted. In making this agreement, I do not concede that it is an \nimproper provision for the tax writing committees to use. As the \nlegistlative process moves forward, I pledge that I will continue \nworking to address their concerns.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I concur with the statement of the Chairman of theh \nFinance Committee, and pledge to continue working to address the \nconcerns of my colleagues from Oklahoma and North Dakota.\n\n\n                      Transit funding for Michigan\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee. The \nSAFETEA bill provides over $656 million in transit formula funding to \nthe State of Michigan and while this represents a 53 percent increase \nover our funding under TEA-21, it still falls short of our transit \nneeds. The Michigan Department of Transportation, MDOT, estimates that \ntheir routine Federal capital needs over the next 6 years just to \nmaintain existing systems and services would exceed $1 billion. This \ncomes at a time when Michigan's ridership continues to grow. Over the \nlife of TEA-21, Michigan's transit ridership has grown from 81.6 \nmillion passengers in 1997 to over 89 million passengers in 2002--close \nto a 10 percent increase. The Senior Senator from Michigan and I have \nsubmitted a request on behalf of MDOT to help close this funding gap. \nThe request would provide MDOT with $120 million in the 5309 Bus \nDiscretionary account over the next 6 years. Would the chairman and \nranking member work with us in conference to provide MDOT with this \nnecessary funding to support Michigan's transit needs?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Michigan in making \nthis request. Michigan has tremendous transit needs. There are bus \nsystems operating in every one of Michigan's 83 counties, from the \nurban Wayne County to rural counties in the Upper Peninsula. Despite \ncovering all counties, service in many areas is minimal, creating a \nreal hardship for working families who cannot afford to own a car. This \nshortfall exists despite the significant contribution by Michigan \ntaxpayers. Michigan ranks sixth, behind five States with rail, in \ndirect support for its public transit systems. Under TEA-21, Michigan \nranked last in Federal transit funding among the Great Lakes States, \nand only received 43 cents back on every transit dollar it contributed \nto the highway trust fund. To help close this equity gap, I would also \nurge the chairman and ranking member to work with us in conference to \nprovide these critical transit funds for Michigan.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will work with my colleagues from \nMichigan to address this issue in conference and provide this critical \nfunding for their transit systems.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I, too, will do everything I can to support funding in \nMichigan in conference.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We thank the chairman and ranking member.\n\n\n                           golden gate bridge\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wanted to discuss the importance of the \nseismic retrofit project for the Golden Gate Bridge.\n  The Golden Gate Bridge is an internationally known landmark. The \nbridge was constructed with local funding and opened in 1937, serving \nas a critical link in California's highway system.\n  The Golden Gate Bridge now carries 40 million vehicles a year and is \nvisited by more than 10 million people annually. However, retrofitting \nthis bridge to withstand an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.3 is an \nexpensive undertaking, with a total cost of $392 million.\n  The Golden Gate Bridge District paid for the first part of the \nretrofit--$71 million--with tolls. But, tolls will never raise enough \nmoney. Federal assistance is needed to protect this national treasure.\n  In TEA-21, I was able to obtain $50 million for the seismic retrofit \nof the Golden Gate Bridge. I would like to be able to provide funding \nfor this project in SAFETEA.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the Senator from California on the importance \nof the Golden Gate Bridge for the State's highway system. I support \nworking with you during conference to ensure that the Golden Gate \nBridge District can receive funding for seismic retrofit.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I also agree with my colleagues from California and \nNevada that the Golden Gate Bridge is very important for the State. I \nalso support working with the Senator from California in conference to \nprovide funding for the Golden Gate Bridge District.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you for your support.\n\n\n                     spirit high priority corridor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee for all of his fine work on this highway \nbill the Senate is now considering. I know he has had a very difficult \ntask to balance the infrastructure needs of each state, and I \nappreciate the excellent job he and his staff have done.\n  If I could, I ask the chairman if he is familiar with the proposal to \ndesignate U.S. Highway 54 in the States of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, \nand Kansas as the SPIRIT high priority corridor on the National Highway \nSystem?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I am familiar with the proposal and am pleased to be \na sponsor of the bill of the senator from New Mexico to designate U.S. \n54 as a high priority corridor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I know the chairman is aware that community leaders in \nthe four states have been working for 9 years to focus attention on the \nSPIRIT corridor because of the heavy truck traffic on the route and the \nimportant role that transportation plays in economic development. Is \nthe chairman aware that Senators Roberts, Domenici, and I have offered \nan amendment to the highway bill to designate the SPIRIT corridor as a \nhigh priority corridor, but the managers of the bill have stated they \nprefer to consider it during the conference with the House?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, the Senator is correct. I am aware of the amendment \nand will do my best to consider including the SPIRIT corridor \ndesignation in the conference report on the highway bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the chairman for his consideration of my \namendment in the conference.\n\n\n                 protecting history and natural beauty\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Ohio, \nMr. Voinovich, for his hard work, fairness, and responsiveness that he \nshowed to me as he worked to resolve issues involving the preservation \nof parks, recreation areas, waterfowl and wildlife refuges, and \nhistoric sites.\n  In 1970, it was a privilege for me to serve as the chairman of \nAmerica's Bicentennial Celebration. During that time I had an \nopportunity to visit many historic sites across this country. In \nVirginia we have a proud heritage that is enriched by the preservation \nof hundreds of historic properties. These sites have witnessed the \nshaping of our Nation. Today, they serve as our outdoor classrooms that \nbring alive the history of our democracy and our communities. They are \nliving treasures of our past and are the foundations for our future.\n  For these reasons, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my \ncolleague on the intent of his amendment. I understand that the \namendment directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations \nclarifying the factors to be considered and the standards to be applied \nin determining whether alternatives are ``prudent and feasible'' under \nsection 138 of title 23 and section 303 of title 49. Would the \namendment by my colleague that is included in the managers substitute \nalter or weaken the standards established in the Supreme Court's 1971 \ndecision in the Overton Park case?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. This amendment does not alter or weaken the Overton \nPark standards for determining what constitutes prudent and feasible \nalternatives. In authorizing this rulemaking, it is our clear intention \nthat Overton Park will continue to serve as the lodestar--the \nfundamental legal standard--for defining and evaluating feasible and \nprudent alternatives. Under this standard, an alternative is considered \n``not prudent'' if it would result in cost or community disruption of \nextraordinary magnitude, and is considered ``not feasible'' if it \ncannot\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\nbe constructed as a matter of sound engineering. This amendment would \nnot change those long-standing definitions of ``prudence'' and \n``feasibility.''\n  The basic problem we face today is the gradual accumulation of \ndifferent interpretations of the Overton Park standards over the past \n30 years. In particular, the lower Federal courts' interpretations of \nthe Overton Park standards have resulted in considerable confusion and \nuncertainty about how to determine the ``prudence'' of alternatives. \nThe net result is that Section 4(f) is sometimes viewed as an \ninflexible prohibition--an ``avoid at all costs'' requirement. That \nmistaken interpretation of Section 4(f) leads to many of the so-called \nhorror stories that we hear so much about.\n  With this amendment, we are directing the Secretary of Transportation \nto issue regulations clarifying the application of the ``prudent and \nfeasible'' test in a variety of circumstances. For example, it is only \ncommon sense to recognize that the ``prudence'' of an avoidance \nalternative depends in part on what you're avoiding, and how hard it is \nto avoid it. Are we dealing with a major part of great significance to \nthe community--such as the famous Overton Park in Memphis, Tennessee? \nOr are we dealing with an easily replaceable ball field in an area \nwhere a replacement can be located without detriment to the interests \nof the affected users? Both of these parks receive a substantial degree \nof protection under Section 4(f). But what's prudent in one situation \nis different from what's prudent in the other, depending on a range of \nfactors, including the degree of harm and the consequences to other \nresources from avoiding it. Those are the kinds of distinctions that \nneed to be clarified in the regulations.\n  In short, the sole purpose of this amendment is to require the \nSecretary of Transportation to issue regulations that provide more \ndetailed guidance on applying the Overton Park standards on a case-by-\ncase basis. The result will be greater consistency in the application \nof the standard throughout the country.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would also like to assure the Senator from Virginia \nthat I concur with the explanation provided by the Senator from Ohio \nthat it is our intent to retain the Overton Park standards as the \nfundamental legal standards to be applied in determining prudent and \nfeasible alternatives.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would concur with the comments of my colleagues and \njoin Senator Warner by reiterating the need to preserve our history.\n  In my state of Vermont, we have a wealth of history and natural \nbeauty. To see the wildlife that populates the Missisquoi Wildlife \nRefuge or the covered bridges used by our forefathers is to experience \na heritage that we all want preserved for future generations.\n  Section 4(f) has helped preserve these treasures. The Revolutionary \nWar site at Fort Venegence on Route 7 in Pittsford, Vermont, was \navoided as a result of 4(f).\n  An excellent collection of historic metal truss bridges across the \nConnecticut River was rehabilitated, not replaced, as a result of 4(f).\n  A road in the Danville Historic District was narrowed in order to \nkeep the historic characteristics of the historic village because of \n4(f).\n  Section 4(f) protections have served us well and will continue to \nsafeguard our precious resources in the future.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, those of my colleagues who have Native \nAmerican tribes located in their States will understand the importance \nof the Indian Reservation Road funding authorized as part of the our \nhighway program. However, they may not be aware that the Indian \nreservation roads program does not treat all States equally. There are \nserious deficiencies in the inventory of road miles eligible for \nfunding under the Indian Reservation Road--IRR--program.\n  Yesterday, I filed an amendment intended to address this issue. I \nunderstand the National Congress of American Indians and other groups \nfavor action on this matter, and I would certainly be willing to \nentertain any suggestions for improving the current amendment. \nUnfortunately, it appears the present situation may make it impossible \nfor the Senate to deal appropriately with this important matter.\n  In most areas of the country, the BIA had a reasonably complete \ninventory of roads and road needs by 1993, and these were incorporated \ninto the IRR inventory. In Alaska that is not the case. The inventory \nnumbers for Alaska are in no way complete, nor are they based on an \nactual count of road miles. They are based instead on a 1993 document \nthat was never intended to serve as a complete inventory. The document \nwas essentially a list of specific project requests known at that time. \nAs a result, it omitted even core infrastructure in many villages, and \ncompletely overlooked approximately one-third of the villages in Alaska \nthat should have been included.\n  Furthermore, BIA policy does not allow the situation to be corrected, \nas it arbitrarily limits increases in the inventory to 2 percent per \nyear. While this may be appropriate in areas for which an accurate \ninventory was available in 1993, it is by no means equitable for \nAlaska's Native villages. In addition to missing entire Native \ncommunities, the BIA's inventory data has other flaws such as simply \nnot having complete or current construction cost data for large parts \nof Alaska.\n  Let me add also that Alaska is not the only State where inventory \ndeficiencies are a problem. Around the Nation, there are 93 to 99 \ntribes, depending on how you count, that have zero recorded inventory. \nBy far the greatest numbers are in Alaska and California, but there are \naffected tribes in the East, the Midwest, the Southwest, the Pacific \nNorthwest, and the Plains States--in short, throughout the country. If \nthe Indian Reservation Roads program is to function the way it was \nintended to function, a new national inventory must be completed and it \nmust be completed fairly. Congress must act to ensure that the absence \nof information on roads is not treated as the absence of need.\n  In recent years, our Native communities have themselves attempted to \nbegin the planning and inventory process needed to develop a true \ninventory or a long-range transportation plan.\n  However, very little of this work product has actually been accepted \nby the BIA. Once inventory updates began to be submitted to BIA on a \nlarge scale, we found that the BIA was applying a ``2 percent'' limit \nto inventory increases. In Alaska we were limited to 365 miles in the \n2001 update--2 percent accumulated from 1993--and since then, the limit \nhas been about 45 miles per year. For a State with 229 tribes, a \ntragically deficient BIA inventory, and a transportation need that is \nsecond to none, the current policy is an absolute travesty of \nmismanagement.\n  Legislation would not be necessary if the BIA were willing to correct \nits own mistakes, but it has not done so. The inventory updating \nprocess has been a nightmare for Alaska Natives. BIA has changed the \nrules every year, has imposed requirements over and above what is \ncontained in its own guidance manuals, and on occasion has changed the \nrules so close to the deadline for submittals that compliance is \nvirtually impossible\n  In my opinion, the current formula and inventory system is based on \nan implicit BIA policy decision to focus future funds on the existing \nincomplete system, rather than on creating a system that serves all of \nthe Nation's tribes equally. That is not BIA's decision to make, and it \nis not the process required by the law, but it is the apparent \nreality--and it badly needs to change.\n  Mr. President, among the amendments I filed for this bill is one to \nencourage additional motorcyclist training, which was cosponsored by \nSenators Inhofe, Stevens, and Campbell. This matter is in the \njurisdiction of the Commerce Committee. It is deeply disappointing to \nthink that the Senate may not act on it. Lives will be lost as a \nresult.\n  My amendment has the full support of the American Motorcyclist \nAssociation, the Motorcycle Riders Foundation, the National Association \nof State Motorcycle Safety Administrators, regional and local riders \ngroups throughout the country, and many others.\n  The single best way to prevent accidents is to provide better \ntraining.\n  A study of the California Motorcyclist Safety Program designed by Dr. \nJohn Billheimer and completed in 1996 found that rider training \ndramatically reduces accidents, and thus eliminates injuries and \nfatalities. Specifically, the study stated,\n\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\n\n       Analyses of statewide accident trends show that total \n     motorcycle accidents have dropped 67 percent since the \n     introduction of the California Motorcyclist Safety Program, \n     with a drop of 88 percent among the under-18 riders.\n\n  Current statistics from the Commonwealth of Virginia are equally \namazing. Virginia has approximately 110,000 registered motorcycles. \nSince 1998, there have been 7,099 motorcycle crashes in Virginia and \n222 of those crashes have been fatal. Yet out of all those accidents, \ntrained riders were involved in less than 4 percent of the total, and \nthe number of fatal accidents involving trained riders is just 1.8 \npercent.\n  What this tells us is that the vast majority of motorcycle accidents \ninvolve riders who have not received proper training, and that when \nriders do receive training, the accident rate will drop dramatically.\n  My amendment is simply intended to encourage States to support \nmotorcycle rider training and to adopt other important measures to save \nlives and prevent injuries. A State which demonstrates that it is \nmaking improvements in motorcycle safety would qualify for a grant of \n$100,000 per year, which is to be used to further improve and expand \nformal training for motorcyclists and for programs to improve driver \nawareness of motorcyclists.\n  Let me also stress that participation in this program is voluntary. \nNo State is being forced to comply, and the amendment contains no \nsanctions for those which do not. This is strictly an incentive to do a \nbetter job at saving lives.\n  Why is this important? I have addressed this issue in detail in a \nprevious statement, but let me recap some of the key points.\n  There are almost 5 million motorcycles operating on America's \nroadways, covering almost 17 million miles per year. Many more are used \noff-road, and some estimates put the actual number of riders at up to \n20 million. The number of riders is steadily increasing every year, and \nas that number increases, so do accidents. At the same time, we are \nfalling farther and farther behind in training people to ride safely.\n  The single best way to avoid injuries, fatalities, high insurance \ncosts, lawsuits, medical costs and all the other factors that come into \nplay is by avoiding the accidents in the first place.\n  The authors of the ``National Agenda for Motorcycle Safety'' agree. \nThe ``National Agenda,'' published by the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, was a cooperative effort of that agency, along \nwith the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, the National Association of \nState Motorcycle Safety Administrators, and a host of others \nrepresenting the insurance industry, law enforcement, riders, traffic \nsafety experts and others.\n  The National Agenda identified a number of steps needed to reduce the \ntragic rate of motorcycle accidents. Rider education was one of its \n``essential'' recommendations.\n  Unfortunately, there is currently no uniform process for providing \nsuch training. Although many, if not all, State provide at least moral \nsupport, most training is funded almost entirely by the students \nthemselves, who pay up to $300 per person for the privilege. Many \nStates also collect additional fees--often a nominal charge of $5.00 \nfor a motorcycle operator's license--but it doesn't always go toward \ntraining programs.\n  That means there are more people who need and want training than \nthere are programs to deliver it. Throughout the country, the waiting \nlist for training class ranges from several weeks to several months.\n  In California, which has one of the oldest and strongest programs, it \nmay take as long as 3 months. In Wisconsin, motorcyclist groups self-\nfund training classes, but the waiting list may be as large as 7,000 \npeople. In Illinois, almost 11,000 people were trained last year, but \nnearly 4,000 were turned away for lack of space. That is happening in \nState after State.\n  The number of untrained riders is increasing, and we urgently need to \nreverse that trend. If you can pass your State's operator test, you can \nride. And if you just spent thousands of dollars on a new motorcycle, \nthe chances are you won't be letting that new motorcycle license go to \nwaste. But passing a test doesn't make you a safe rider--that takes \neither years of experience--or it takes formal training.\n  The longer we ignore this issue, the more lives will be lost, the \nmore injuries will be suffered, the more insurance rates for both \ndrivers and riders will go up, and the more families will be harmed. \nThis body should be acting, not avoiding.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak in \nsupport of the transportation bill now pending before the Senate and \nurge my colleagues to support final passage of the legislation.\n  This is an important bill that will create thousands of wellpaying \njobs, make needed investments to the Nation's bridge, highway, and mass \ntransit infrastructure while injecting billions of dollars a year into \nthe economy and saving commuters millions of hours on the roads. The \nchairman and subcommittee chairman along with the ranking member and \nthe senior Senator from Nevada have worked hard to craft a highway bill \nthat balances the often conflicting needs of the States. Similarly, as \na member of the Banking Committee, I want to recognize the bipartisan \nmanner in which the chairman and ranking member worked with all \ncolleagues to craft a transit package that meets the varying transit \nand bus service needs for our constituents.\n  In my remarks, I follow a host of other Senators who have come to the \nfloor over the past week to highlight the importance of passing a \nrobust transportation bill. In many respects, the matter we are \ndebating has a more direct and daily impact on our constituents than \njust about any issue the Congress considers. Reducing accidents through \nincreased road safety, replacing and refurbishing aging infrastructure, \nand moving people more efficiently and effectively go directly toward \nimproving the quality of life throughout the Nation.\n  South Dakota is a large State and its citizens often time have to \ntravel extraordinary distances to visit friends and family, receive \nmedical care, or connect to major economic markets. With thousands of \nmiles of roads, efficient, reliable, and dependable transportation is \ndirectly linked to the prosperity of rural America and our quality of \nlife. The first emphasis of a transportation bill should be on a robust \nhighway program. Without a comprehensive Interstate Highway System and \nsecondary feeder roads it would be very difficult for the constituents \nof my state and those in other rural places to travel and earn a \nliving. The bill before the Senate recognizes the national interest in \ntransportation in and across rural America.\n  Passing a highway bill is also good for our economy. The jobs created \nthrough this legislation are permanent, high-paying jobs that will spur \nfurther economic development and put people to work in what has largely \nbeen a jobless economic recovery. According to the South Dakota \nAssociation of General Contractors, if the Congress passes this highway \nbill over 20,000 new jobs will be created in my State in the next 6 \nyears. The importance of passing the bill goes beyond job creation. \nGood highways in rural areas also enable agricultural products and \nnatural resources to get from source to market. The farm-to-market road \nsystem developed by the State depends upon a vast and reliable network \nof interstate highways, in good condition, to move products throughout \nthe country and grow the economy.\n  As a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee with jurisdiction over bus and transit programs, I believe \nthat the transportation bill makes important investments in rural and \nurban transit. Transit and especially bus service; however, is an \nimportant link in rural America where social service providers, local \ngovernments, and state agencies struggle to provide reliable bus \nservice. Federal aid to transit and buses is the crucial link ensuring \nthat reliable and dependable service exists throughout many \ncommunities.\n  In meeting with transit providers across South Dakota, I fully \nunderstand the unique challenges toward providing reliable and \ndependable bus service over longer traveling distances. Although routes \nare more heavily used in urban areas, certain basic needs for public \ntransit remain constant in urban and rural areas: there must be a \ndriver, parts must be purchased, and\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\ncostly, but necessary, insurance obtained. The transit title considered \nby the Senate recognizes for the first time these unique challenges in \nconstructing a financing mechanism that will grow rural transit and \nenhance service. Chairman Shelby and Senator Sarbanes deserve much of \nthe credit for working with rural state Senators on the committee to \nincorporate this provision in the final bill.\n  It is vitally important that the Senate pass the transportation, \ntransit and road safety bill pending before the Senate. As a member of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, I am pleased that the committees \nconstructing this bill did so within the budget framework this body \nadopted last year. The Senate-passed Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Resolution \ncalled for a six-year transit program totaling $56.5 billion. The \nSenate Finance and Banking Committees have worked diligently to \nconstruct a comprehensive and forward-looking bill that stays within \nthe budget while addressing the Nation's critical infrastructure needs.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate considers legislation to reauthorize \nFederal transportation programs, I want to take a few minutes to \naddress the transit programs authorized in the bill. As a member of the \nSenate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee with jurisdiction \nover bus and transit programs, I believe that the transportation bill \nmakes important investments in rural and urban transit. Chairman Shelby \nand Senator Sarbanes have performed an admirable job in constructing a \ntransit title that enhances bus and transit service in large \nmetropolitan areas, as well as rural States like mine.\n  South Dakota is a large State and its citizens oftentimes have to \ntravel extraordinary distances to visit friends and family, receive \nmedical care, or connect to major economic markets. With thousands of \nmiles of roads, efficient, reliable, and dependable transportation is \ndirectly linked to the prosperity of rural America and our quality of \nlife. The first emphasis of a transportation bill should be on a robust \nhighway program. The bill before the Senate recognizes the national \ninterest in transportation in and across rural America. Transit and \nespecially bus service, however, is an important link in rural America \nwhere social service providers, local governments, and State agencies \nstruggle to provide reliable bus service. Federal aid to transit and \nbuses is the crucial link ensuring that reliable and dependable service \nexists throughout many communities.\n  In meeting with transit providers across South Dakota, I fully \nunderstand the unique challenges toward providing reliable and \ndependable bus service over longer traveling distances. Although routes \nare more heavily used in urban areas, certain basic needs for public \ntransit remain constant in urban and rural areas: there must be a \ndriver, parts must be purchased, and costly, but necessary, insurance \nobtained. The transit title considered by the Senate recognizes for the \nfirst time these unique challenges in constructing a financing \nmechanism that will grow rural transit and enhance service. The transit \ntitle recognizes the special challenges facing low density states by \ncreating a new rural density program for rural transit and elderly and \ndisabled transit. By calculating the population density of a State \nalong with the size of the State, the program ensures that rural States \nwith demonstrated transit needs will receive a fair share of the \nbillions of dollars in new transit spending over the next 6 years.\n  As a proponent of the new rural program it is necessary to recognize \nthe indispensable role of Chairman Shelby and Senator Sarbanes toward \nensuring that this program was included in the transit mark. Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle worked in a constructive and bipartisan \nmanner that produced a product that was unanimously supported by the \nBanking Committee. The consequences of our actions mean that transit \nproviders in Pierre, Huron, Aberdeen, and other South Dakota \ncommunities will be able to expand service at a time when the demand \nfor rural bus service is increasing. Connecting people in rural America \nto medical care, jobs, and family and friends is the legacy of this \nbill.\n  Therefore, it is vitally important that the Senate pass a \ntransportation bill and incorporate the transit title into the broader \ntransportation and road safety legislation pending before the Senate. \nAs a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I am pleased that the \nvarious committees constructing this bill did so within the budget \nframework this body adopted last year. The Senate-passed Fiscal Year \n2004 Budget Resolution called for a 6-year transit program totaling \n$56.5 billion. The Senate Finance and Banking Committees have worked \ndiligently to construct a comprehensive and forward-looking bill that \nstays within the budget while addressing the crucial bus and transit \ninfrastructure demands facing our country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003, \nSAFETEA, S. 1072. I support this legislation. I believe it is a good \nfirst step toward funding our Nation's transportation infrastructure \nand creating jobs.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the benefits of this \nlegislation for my home State of Illinois.\n  The Federal transportation bill, S. 1072, would make the largest \ninvestment to date in our Nation's aging infrastructure, $318 billion \nover the next 6 years. In short, this legislation would increase the \nState of Illinois's total Federal transportation dollars and provide \ngreater flexibility. It would help improve the condition of Illinois's \nroads and bridges, improve funding for mass transit in Chicago and down \nState, reduce traffic congestion, and address highway safety and \nprotection of our environment.\n  The bill would provide $255 billion over 6 years for highways and \nother surface transportation programs. Illinois has the third largest \nInterstate System in the country; however, its roads and bridges are \nrated among the worst in the Nation. The State can expect to receive \nmore than $7.6 billion over 6 years from the highway formula contained \nin the Senate bill. That is a 37-percent increase or $2 billion more \nthan the last transportation bill, TEA-21.\n  With these additional funds, the Illinois Department of \nTransportation will be able to move forward on major reconstruction and \nrehabilitation projects throughout the State.\n  Mass transit funding is vitally important to the Chicago metropolitan \narea as well as to many downstate communities. It helps alleviate \ntraffic congestion, lessen air emissions, and provides access for \nthousands of Illinoisans every day. S. 1072 includes $56 billion over 6 \nyears for mass transit. Illinois would receive about $2.9 billion over \n6 years under the Senate bill, an increase of $500 million or 21 \npercent more than the last transportation bill.\n  This legislation also preserves some important environmental and \nenhancement programs, including the Congestion Mitigation and Air \nQuality, CMAQ, Program. CMAQ's goal is to help States meet their air \nquality conformity requirements as prescribed by the Clean Air Act. The \nSenate bill would increase funding for CMAQ from $8 billion to $13 \nbillion--an increase of 62.5 percent. Illinois received more than $460 \nmillion in CMAQ funds in TEA-21; the State is expected to receive an \nincrease in CMAQ funding under the Senate bill.\n  With regard to highway safety, Illinois is one of 20 States that has \nenacted a primary seatbelt law. S. 1072 would enable the State of \nIllinois and other States that have passed primary seatbelt laws to \nobtain Federal funds to implement this program and further improve \nhighway safety.\n  I know this legislation is not a perfect document. Illinois's highway \nformula will be improved by this Senate bill, and I hope our House \ncolleagues can add to our effort. Amtrak reauthorization and rail \nfreight transportation funding are noticeably absent. And important \nroad and transit projects from around my home State have not yet been \nincluded. I will work with my Illinois colleagues in the House to \nensure that Illinois receives a fair share of transportation funds--\nhighway, transit, and highway safety--in the final conference report.\n  With the passage of this legislation, the Senate has upheld its \nobligation to reauthorize and improve our Nation's important \ntransportation programs.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House to move quickly to resolve their \ndifferences. This bill should have been\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\npassed last year. Any further delay at this point could jeopardize \nconstruction and the jobs we so desperately need in Illinois.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the managers \nof the bill for their hard and tireless work on one of the most \ncomplicated pieces of legislation we will consider--second, perhaps, \nonly to the Energy bill.\n  In this Senator's opinion, this bill, known as the Safe, Accountable, \nFlexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act, or SAFETEA, \nrepresents a tremendous step forward in the life of our country's \ntransportation policy. While this is by no means a perfect bill and, \nquite frankly, I don't think such a thing exists, I believe this is a \ngood bill. I am convinced that the Chairman and Ranking Member have put \ntogether a bill that treats our many States and varied interests as \nfairly as is possible.\n  With respect to my own State of New Mexico, this is a bill that will \nprovide immeasurable economic benefit to our State. The most visible \neconomic impact is on jobs. Thousands of New Mexicans will go to work \nas a direct result of this legislation. We have repeatedly been told \nthat for every $1 billion spent on roads, more than 40,000 jobs are \ncreated. Over the 6-year span of this reauthorization, we will spend \nover $2 billion in the State of New Mexico. Quick math tells me that \nthis will mean that over 80,000 jobs will be created in New Mexico \nalone in the next six years.\n  New Mexico is the fifth largest State geographically and has a \npredominantly rural population. This means that our population is very \ndependent on roads to keep us connected. Better roads will mean that \npeople and goods will be able to move throughout our State in a safer, \nmore efficient manner. Commerce will certainly benefit, bringing \nadditional economic benefit to New Mexico.\n  Additionally, passage of SAFETEA will ensure that our State continues \nthe improvements to our roads and rails begun under TEA-21. New Mexico \nroads will be safer for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Safer \nroads mean fewer accidents, fewer emergency road visits for victims of \naccidents, fewer lost days of work and productivity as a result of \naccidents. Aside from the much more important physical and emotional \nbenefits, prevention of these accidents will bring on economic benefits \nas well.\n  While New Mexicans are primarily road-travelers, there is also a \nsignificant need for public transportation, both by bus and by rail. I \nam pleased with work done by the Banking Committee on the Transit \nportion of this transportation reauthorization bill. New Mexico will be \na better place become of this portion of this bill.\n  Some of you know that I worked with the Native American leaders in \nNew Mexico and throughout the country to create the Indian Reservation \nRoads program over 20 years ago. Each time we have reauthorized our \ntransportation programs, I have worked to ensure that this program is \ntaken care of. This year is no different. While the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee was not able to accept all of my \nrecommendations, or all of the Indian Affairs Committee's, I am pleased \nthat the Chairmen and Ranking Members were willing to work with us to \nimprove the program on the floor.\n  Now I know that the Statement of Administration Policy indicates that \nthe President's advisors will recommend that he veto the bill if it \nremains at the current funding level. It is my great hope that we will \nbe able to work with the White House and at the House of \nRepresentatives when this bill gets to Conference to find a way to \nprovide adequate funding for our Nation's transportation needs. This \ncountry needs the certainty of a six-year reauthorization in order to \nplan for multi-year projects. I believe we are taking an imporant step \ntoward providing that certainty today by sending this bill to a \nConference Committee. I look forward to working with the Conferees to \nmake this bill even better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this reauthorization of the highway and \ntransit program is one of the most important pieces of legislation that \nwe will consider in this Congress. Its enactment will help restore the \nfederal commitment to our surface transportation infrastructure--the \nlifeblood for our economy as well as our quality of life.\n  Ensuring that our Nation has a modern, safe and efficient \ntransportation network has been one of my highest priorities in the \nUnited States Senate. As ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking, \nHousing and Urban Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over our \nnation's transit programs, and as a member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, I have fought vigorously to bolster federal investment in \ntransportation infrastructure and to put in place a sensible, balanced \nframework in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n1991 (ISTEA) and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century \n(TEA-21) to enable the nation to sustain its economic growth and \nenhance the quality of life of our citizens.\n  The reauthorization bill, known as the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, \nand Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003, or SAFETEA, that is \nbefore the Senate authorizes $318 billion in funding over the next six \nyears for maintaining and improving our Nation's and States' highways, \nbridges and transit systems and addressing safety issues.\n  There is a huge backlog of needed repairs, replacements and upgrades \nto bring our transportation network--our roads, bridges, transit \nsystems and railroads--up to standards. The Department of \nTransportation's Conditions and Performance Report estimates that an \naverage of $127 billion per year is needed over the next two decades to \nmaintain and improve the condition of these systems. Other estimates \nshow an even greater need. This backlog constrains our Nation's \neconomic competitiveness, leaves more and more Americans stuck in \ntraffic, contributes to air pollution and results in unnecessary \nfatalities. In my judgment, we must make prudent investments in our \ntransportation systems not only to prevent further deterioration of the \nnetwork--but to improve the system, relieve congestion and save lives.\n  These investments will also boost our economy and create jobs--at a \ntime when new jobs and a boost to the economy are desperately needed. \nThe United States Chamber of Commerce has estimated that each $1 \nbillion invested in transportation infrastructure creates 47,000 direct \njobs and there are indirect impacts as well. The Texas Transportation \nInstitute has estimated that in 2001, Americans in 75 urban areas spent \n3.6 billion hours stuck in traffic, with an estimated cost to the \nnation of $69.5 billion in lost time and wasted fuel. As these figures \nshow, congestion has a real economic cost, in addition to the \npsychological and social costs of spending hours each day sitting in \ntraffic. We cannot afford to let these costs of congestion grow any \nfurther. The investments made under this bill will help us make \nprogress in our efforts to combat traffic congestion and deteriorating \nconditions on our Nation's roads, bridges, and transit systems.\n  For our Nation's roadways and bridges, this legislation authorizes an \naverage increase of nearly 36 percent in funding to enable states and \nlocalities to make desperately needed repairs and improvements. \nMaryland's share of highway funding will grow by 40 percent over the \nnext 6 years compared to the level provided in TEA-21--more than a $1 \nbillion increase to help upgrade our highway infrastructure.\n  As a small ``bridge'' State with criss-crossing interstate routes, a \nState with high population density and with high traffic congestion, \nMaryland has tremendous highway infrastructure needs. Maryland is the \nfifth most densely populated State in the Nation. Maryland roads, \nincluding both State highways and other roads, now serve almost 54 \nbillion vehicle miles of travel annually. Our State has the second \nlargest urban interstate traffic density and the sixth largest \npercentage of roads in urban areas in the United States. As part of the \nnortheast corridor Maryland experiences an extremely high volume of \nthrough traffic, especially on roadways such as I-95. Maryland is one \nof the few States in the Nation with two major metropolitan areas, \nWashington, D.C. and Baltimore, and two major beltways with some of the \nhighest traffic volumes in the country--in excess of 150,000 average \ndaily traffic--within 30 miles of each other. Our state has the\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\nsixth highest congestion cost in the nation, and these congestion costs \ncontinue to rise. According to the Texas Transportation Institute, from \n2000 to 2001, the annual cost in Washington, DC is up from $631 to \n$667/year. In the Baltimore Region, the annual cost went up from nearly \n$400/year to $455/year. In the Washington metropolitan area we have the \nsecond longest average commute time in the Nation.\n  In the next 20 years, Maryland's driving age population is expected \nto increase by nearly 20 percent, the number of licensed drivers by 25 \npercent, and the number of registered vehicles by 29 percent and this \nwill mean significantly more traffic on our roads and pressures on our \ntransit systems. Maryland's Department of Transportation is at a \ncrossroads, facing deficient roads and bridges as well as key gaps and \nbottlenecks within the State's transportation system that are known to \ncause delay and congestion. Maryland has an estimated unfunded capital \nneed for more than $13.2 billion in highway maintenance, construction \nand reconstruction over the next ten years. Clearly, Maryland must have \nadequate funding to address these transportation challenges and to \nfacilitate overall mobility and the funds made available under this \nmeasure will be a significant help in this regard.\n  Importantly, the measure preserves the dedicated funding for the \nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality, CMAQ, program which helps States \nand local governments improve air quality in non-attainment areas under \nthe Clean Air Act; the Transportation Enhancement set-aside provisions \nwhich support bicycle and pedestrian facilities and other community \nbased projects, as well as the other core TEA-21 programs--Interstate \nmaintenance, National Highway System, Bridge and the Surface \nTransportation Program. Likewise, TEA-21's basic principles of \nflexibility, intermodalism, strategic infrastructure investment, and \ncommitment to safety are retained.\n  I am especially pleased that the legislation includes a provision \nwhich sets aside 2 percent of a State's Surface Transportation Program \nfor stormwater runoff mitigation. According to the Environmental \nProtection Agency, polluted stormwater from impervious surfaces such as \nroads is a leading cause of impairment for nearly 40 percent of U.S. \nwaterways not meeting water quality standards. In the Chesapeake Bay \nregion, it is estimated that runoff from highways contributes nearly 7 \nmillion pounds of nitrogen, 1 million pounds of phosphorous and 167,000 \ntons of sediment annually to the Bay. In Maryland alone, the Center for \nWatershed Protection estimates that the 7500 miles of Federal-aid \nhighways generate yearly loads of 1.2 million pounds of nitrogen, \n127,000 pounds of phosphorous and 25,000 pounds of sediment into \nMaryland waterways and eventually into Chesapeake Bay each year. The \nstormwater provision will provide more than $73 million for the Bay \nStates and local governments for stormwater abatement of which $15 \nmillion would be available for Maryland.\n  For our Nation's transit systems, the legislation authorizes $56.5 \nmillion--$15.5 billion more than provided in TEA-21--to modernize and \nexpand our transit facilities. These funds will go a long way to \nmeeting the growing demand for transit in cities, towns, rural areas, \nand suburban jurisdictions across the country. Maryland's formula share \nof transit funding will grow by nearly 60 percent over the next 6 years \nfrom $572 million to $907 million. These funds are absolutely critical \nto Maryland's efforts to maintain and upgrade the Baltimore and \nWashington Metro systems, the MARC commuter rail system serving \nBaltimore, Washington, DC, Frederick and Brunswick, and the Baltimore \nLight Rail system. Bus systems and para-transit systems for elderly and \ndisabled people throughout Maryland will also receive a big boost in \nfunding.\n  I am particularly pleased that the legislation includes the Transit \nin Parks Act or TRIP which I introduced. This new Federal transit grant \ninitiative will support the development of alternative transportation \nservices--everything from rail or clean fuel bus projects to pedestrian \nand bike paths, or park waterway access, within or adjacent to national \nparks and other public lands. It will give our Federal land management \nagencies important new tools to improve both preservation and access. \nJust as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is essential to \nmoving large numbers of people in our national parks--quickly, \nefficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact.\n  I especially thank the staff of the Banking Committee for the fine \nwork done on the transit title of the bill. First, I commend Chairman \nShelby and his staff, including Sherry Little, Rich Steinmann, Peggy \nKuhn, and of course, Doug Nappi and Kathy Casey. I also compliment my \nown staff, who did a superb job, providing needed additional resources \nto meet the transit needs of all Americans. My transit team was most \nably led by Sarah Kline, and I also thank Aaron Klein, Charlie Stek, \nand Kate Mattice. Let me also acknowledge the major contribution made \nby the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation and the staff of \nSubcommittee Chairman Allard, Tewana Wilkerson, and Ranking Member \nReed, Neil Campbell.\n  Like any other complex and comprehensive piece of legislation, this \nbill has its share of imperfections. But if we are to ensure not only \nthe safe and efficient movement of people, goods and services, but also \nthe future competitiveness and productivity of our economy, we must \nmake these investments, and move forward with this legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in approving this measure.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the \namendment submitted by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nTalent. I, like him, have been inundated with phone calls and letters \nby small business owners throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia \nexpressing great concern with the moving provisions included in the \nSafety Title of the TEA-21 reauthorization legislation.\n  I believe the intentions for mandating these changes to current \nregulations governing the moving industry are well-intentioned. We have \nall heard horror stories about families having their belongings held \nhostage by a rogue moving company attempting to extort further \nrevenues. This is a serious problem and the Federal Government needs to \nmake sure regulations are in place to protect consumers and the vast \nmajority of moving companies that act in good faith and provide a \nvaluable service to millions of American families.\n  My constituents that move Virginia families from their old homes to \ntheir new ones have expressed their belief that these moving provisions \ngo too far to try and reform an industry that is largely composed of \nlaw-abiding small businesses. By crafting broad language to target the \nsmall minority of ``bad actors'' in the moving industry, the Safety \nTitle will unnecessarily and significantly burden those that follow \nexisting regulations and go to great lengths to ensure consumers are \nsatisfied with the outcome of their move.\n  We cannot ask small businesses, which often cannot absorb large \nadditional costs in the services they provide, to have no recourse when \na consumer inaccurately describes the services required. A small moving \ncompany cannot provide additional and often labor-intense services \nwithout appropriate recourse to collect for those services. By forcing \nmovers to relinquish shipments for the initial price quoted provides no \neffective recourse to seek payment when other services are requested or \nrequired. This amendment would allow movers to collect any added \nexpenses at the time of the delivery, or if there is disagreement about \nthose charges, allow movers to recoup expensive attorneys' fees if it \nis determined that the mover was correct in assessing the additional \ncharges.\n  Additionally, we should carefully consider the language we include \nwith regard to providing States the authority to enforce Federal \nregulations. I understand that the moving industry is fully supportive \nof permitting State attorney generals to hold rogue movers accountable \nfor consumer protection violations. However, it may be ill-advised to \nleave open the possibility that issues beyond consumer protection will \nbe interpreted in varying ways by the States. If a moving company \ncannot be confident that there is a consistent application of these \nregulations, it will make it difficult for them to implement uniform \npractices.\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\n  As we consider the highway bill and continue to refer to it as a jobs \nmeasure, I believe we must make sure all provisions are appropriately \nmeasured and do not injure legitimate small businesses. Rogue movers \nare no more likely to adhere to the rules outlined in this legislation \nbecause they do not adhere to current statutes regarding the shipment \nof citizens belongings. I will state again, I believe the vast majority \nof U.S. movers abide by our laws and go to great lengths to ensure that \nthey provide a quality service to consumers. The Safety Title \nlegislation was crafted with a noble purpose, but I believe it would \nunduly hurt legitimate small businesses and I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this amendment, which provides a more measured \nand even-handed response to a small, but high-profile problem of \nunscrupulous movers.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have been in a difficult \nparliamentary situation which has precluded my offering my amendment, \nbut had I offered it, it would have accomplished the following.\n  My amendment would keep intact long standing provisions that protect \npublic health, the environment, and the rights of citizens and states \nto have meaningful participation in transportation decisions.\n  While I know the authors have worked very hard to strike a balance on \nthe provisions in this bill, I believe their language to ``streamline'' \ntransportation planning processes is ill-advised and will have severe \nand unintended consequences.\n  No one can argue with the theory behind ``streamlining'' \ntransportation projects.\n  No public official wants to slow and encumber its State's transit, \nhighway, bridge, rail, or other major construction projects.\n  Unfortunately, the assumption behind the streamlining in this bill is \nthat crucial tools to protect the environment, such as performing \n``environmental impact statements,'' are the reason behind the long, \nprotracted projects that go on for years. That is patently incorrect \nand this misconception must be put to rest.\n  In 2000, the Federal Highway Administration queried its divisions in \nall States, asking for a list of all projects requiring an \n``Environmental Impact Statement'' that had been in preparation for \nover 5 years.\n  What they learned should inform this body as it seeks to address the \nproblem of delay.\n  The Highway Administration found that a 70 percent--a large majority \nof the delays, were due to five issues--all unrelated to the \nenvironment.\n  They were: one, lack of funding; two, low project priority; three, \nlocal controversies; four, project complexity; and five, late changes \nmade in the scope of a project.\n  If our purpose is really to bring greater efficiency to \ntransportation planning, we must address the primary reasons for \ndelay--those which are listed here.\n  The National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA--which this bill seeks to \nweaken--was signed by President Nixon for very good reasons. When \ncitizens and all relevant agencies are given the opportunity for \nmeaningful participation in project planning, any needed adjustments \ncan be made early in the process, saving states time and money.\n  The approach outlined in this bill would essentially allow the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation to waive the NEPA process if it so \ndesired. That would be like a manufacturer that waits until its product \nis already designed before checking to see if it even serves the needs \nof consumers. Clearly, such an approach is clumsy, inefficient, and far \nmore expensive in the long run if design changes are needed.\n  As written, the language in the substitute amendment is confusing and \neven contradictory.\n  It first states that despite NEPA or ``any other law'' that agencies \nare accountable for, the Department of Transportation is given the \nauthority to make the final decision on the need for, and purpose of, a \ntransportation project.\n  At the same time, the bill contains a standard ``savings clause'' \nwhich states that no other law--such as NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and \nthe Clean Water Act--will be preempted by this very language.\n  This is inherently ambiguous and you can bet it will lead to more \nlitigation. It will without doubt slow the progress on transportation \nprojects--the very outcome this so-called ``streamlining'' language \nseeks to remedy.\n  Instead of just handing final decisionmaking authority over to the \nU.S. Department of Transportation, DOT my amendment outlines a simple, \ntraditional process that will allow all relevant agencies to resolve \nconflicts which can arise. DOT has neither the expertise nor the \nstatutory authority to make pivotal decisions on matters of public \nhealth and the environment.\n  Overarching decisionmaking authority should not be handed off to DOT.\n  This amendment restores the balance of authority that has \nhistorically existed across all relevant agencies and departments--both \nState and Federal--to facilitate thorough, responsible project \nplanning.\n  My home State of New jersey perfectly illustrates the crucial role of \nour health and environmental agencies in making transportation planning \ndecisions.\n  For years, New Jersey has implemented responsible, aggressive \nenvironmental law enforcement policies.\n  Yet because of up-wind pollution and large metropolitan areas, health \nstandards for ozone are being violated in every county in New Jersey--\nwhich has some nine million residents.\n  According to New Jersey's department of environmental protection, 45 \npercent of our ozone pollution is caused by motor vehicle exhaust.\n  The group, Physicians for Social Responsibility, reports that \nnationwide about 15 million Americans suffer from asthma, which is \ntriggered and exacerbated by ozone. In the last 20 years, the \nprevalence of asthma has risen over 60 percent.\n  An analysis performed a few years ago estimated that for just one \npollutant, particulate matter, 2,300 to 5,400 people die prematurely \nevery year in New Jersey. Mobile sources account for about 30 percent \nof the particulate matter emitted into the air. Nationally, some 20,000 \nAmerican citizens die prematurely from this pollutant.\n  Think about that. America grieves for the 536 American soldiers we \nhave lost in Iraq since March of last year, and rightly so. Yet in that \nsame 1-year period 20,000 Americans died unnecessarily from just one \nair pollutant--particulate matter.\n  Consider toxic air pollutants. Seventeen of New Jersey's 21 counties \nrank among the 100 most polluted counties in the Nation and the risk of \ncancer in four of our counties is up to 3000 times higher than EPA's \nhealth threshold. A primary cause of these toxic emissions is mobile \nsources.\n  My point is that with such serious health threats related to \ntransportation on the increase throughout the country, now is not the \ntime to pare back the role of our public health and environmental \nprotection agencies in decisionmaking on Transportation projects. The \nmeaningful participation of these agencies is needed more today than \never before.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation is simply not equipped or \nqualified to make the ultimate decisions with regard to public health \nand the environment. The stakes are too high.\n  I urge my colleagues to support public participation. I urge them to \nsupport agency cooperation that protects public health and the \nenvironment. And I urge them to support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, my distracted driving amendment addresses \none of the most serious highway safety problems in our Nation: \ndistracted and fatigued driving.\n  When drivers talk on their cell phones, change radio stations, eat, \nor otherwise fail to devote their full attention to driving, they pose \na threat not only to themselves, but to others. Drivers who are drowsy \nor tired pose a similar threat.\n  I am particularly concerned about the use of hand-held cell phones \nwhile driving, which the California Highway Patrol recently reported \nwas the number one cause of distracted driver accidents in their State. \nAccording to a study by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, ``the use \nof cell phones by drivers may result in approximately 2,600 deaths, \n330,000 moderate to critical injuries and 1.5 million instances\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\nof property damage in America per year.'' Other studies have reached \nsimilar conclusions. One, published in the New England Journal of \nMedicine in 1997, concluded that the ``use of cellular telephones in \nmotor vehicles is associated with a quadrupling of the risks of a \ncollision during the brief period of a call.'' That study went on to \nsay ``this relative risk is similar to the hazard associated with \ndriving with a blood alcohol level at the legal limit.''\n  States, counties and municipalities around the country have \nconsidered legislation affecting the use of hand-held cell phones while \ndriving. New York enacted a ban against the use of hand-held cell \nphones while driving in 2001. A number of municipalities in my own \nState of New Jersey have also chosen to enforce bans within their \nborders, including Marlboro, Carteret and Nutley. New Jersey itself has \nenacted a law that imposes additional penalties on those driving \ninfractions where cell-phone use has been determined to be a factor.\n  This patchwork of laws, however, does not take the place of a \nconsistent, Nation-wide ban. That is why I introduced the Mobile \nTelephone Driving Safety Act last year. That bill would provide \nincentives for States to adopt bans on hand-held cell phones, and I \nhope that we can build more support for this legislation in the future. \nHowever, this amendment proposes a more modest first step that I have \nworked out with the managers of the bill from the Commerce Committee, \nSenators McCain and Hollings.\n  The main provision in the amendment would provide Federal funds for \nStates to implement programs designed to address distracted and \nfatigued driving, by making such programs an eligible use of funds \nunder the Section 402 highway safety program. These programs might \ninclude public education campaigns, additional training for law \nenforcement, and implementation of laws that specifically address \nfatigued or distracted driving.\n  The amendment also calls for several demonstration projects to \nspecifically test ways of combating distracted driving. And it directs \nStates to work with local law enforcement officials to find ways to \ncollect more accurate data about how the use of electronic devices in \nvehicles affects traffic safety.\n  In sum, this amendment helps address some of the most important \nhighway safety issues we confront. And it does so without requiring any \nnew funds, or putting any additional burdens on the States. I want to \nthank Senators McCain  and Hollings for their cooperation on this \nmatter, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have submitted an amendment to \ncontinue an important Federal program begun in TEA-21 that addresses a \nunique problem with the roads in and around the Nation's single largest \nIndian reservation and the neighboring counties. Through this program, \nNavajo children who had been prevented from getting to school by \nfrequently impassable roads are now traveling safely to and from their \nschools. Because of the unusual nature of this situation. I believe it \nmust continue to be addressed at the Federal level.\n  The Navajo Nation is by far the Nation's largest Indian Reservation, \ncovering 25,000 square miles. Portions of the Navajo Nation are in \nthree States: Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. No other reservation comes \nanywhere close to the size of Navajo. The State of West Virginia is \nabout 24,000 square miles. In fact, 10 States are smaller in size than \nthe Navajo reservation.\n  The counties in the three States that include the Navajo reservation \nmust maintain the roads used by county school buses but receive no \nFederal or local tax funds to maintain the roads. Nearly all of the \nland area in these counties is under Federal or tribal jurisdiction. As \nI understand it, counties in States with large reservations are not \nrequired to maintain roads on the reservation. Of course, no other \nreservation is anywhere close to the size of the Navajo reservation.\n  According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, about 9,800 miles of \npublic roads serve the Navajo nation. Only about one-fifth of these \nroads are paved. The remaining 7,600 miles, 78 percent, are dirt roads. \nEvery day school buses use nearly all of these roads to transport \nNavajo children to and from school.\n  In response to this unique situation, I authored a provision in TEA-\n21 to provide annual funding to the counties that contain the Navajo \nreservation to help ensure that children on the reservation can get to \nand from their public schools. Under section 1214(d) of TEA-21, $1.5 \nmillion is made available each year to be shared equally among the \nthree states that contain the Navajo reservation. These Federal funds \ncan be used only on roads that are located within or that lead to the \nreservation, that are on the State or county maintenance system, and \nthat serve as school bus routes.\n  For the last 6 years, the counties have used the annual funding to \nhelp maintain the routes used by school buses to carry children to \nschool buses to carry children to school and to Headstart programs. The \namendment provides a simple 6-year reauthorization of that program, \nwith a modest increase in the annual funding to allow for inflation and \nfor additional roads to be maintained in each of the three States.\n  Continuing this program for 6 more years is fully justified because \nof the vast area of the Navajo reservation--by far the Nation's \nlargest. I do believe the unique nature of this situation can only be \ndealt with effectively by the Federal Government. I am pleased to have \nmy colleague, Senator Domenici, as a cosponsor, and I hope all Senators \nwill support our amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters supporting this \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   San Juan County Commission,\n\n                                  Monticello, UT, January 6, 2003.\n\n     Re: Indian School Bus Route Safety Reauthorization Act of \n         2003\n\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: San Juan County, Utah wants to \n     express our appreciation to you for your efforts to secure \n     funding to improve the Indian School Bus Routes. San Juan \n     County has approximately 25% of the total land area on the \n     Utah portion of the Navajo Nation.\n       The County is currently maintaining 611 miles of roads on \n     the Navajo Nation. 357 miles are natural surface, 164 miles \n     are of a gravel surface and 90 miles are paved. Most of these \n     roads are used by school bus in the transportation of \n     students to and from the different schools.\n       The County has three high schools that are operated by the \n     San Juan School District on the Utah portion of the Navajo \n     Nation (Whitehorse High School in Montezuma Creek, Monument \n     Valley High School in Monument Valley and Navajo Mountain \n     High School in Navajo Mountain). In addition, the school \n     district has two elementary schools located in Halchita, near \n     Mexican Hat and in Montezuma Creek. The Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs has two boarding schools that also operate within the \n     County boundaries at Aneth and Navajo Mountain. In addition \n     there are pre-schools that are located in Monument Valley, \n     Halchita, Toda, and Montezuma Creek.\n       One major example of the funds that have been previously \n     used was to pave the nearly six miles section of road in the \n     Navajo Mountain area. Navajo Mountain is an isolated \n     community located in the southwestern corner of San Juan \n     County. There is a single highway in and out of the \n     community, with the nearest community located over seventeen \n     miles to the south in Arizona. The road still is dirt for ten \n     miles south of the Utah boundary, but the County was able to \n     pave the road on the Utah side this past year making the road \n     passable year round and greatly improving the safety for the \n     students and residents.\n       We would strongly encourage the re-authorization of these \n     funds for this important need.\n           Very truly,\n     Ty Lewis,\n       Commissioner.\n     Manuel Morgan,\n       Commissioner.\n     Lynn H. Stevens,\n       Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Board of Supervisors\n\n\n                                             of Apache County,\n\n                                     St. Johns, AZ, March 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building.\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Bingaman: I strongly express my appreciation for \n     your effort for the passage of the Transportation Equity Act \n     for the 21st Century (TEA-21). The TEA-21 funds were utilized \n     to purchase some gravel for school bus routes within the \n     Apache County, District II, on the Navajo reservation where \n     it was badly needed.\n       Without your effort and other members of Congress, such \n     road improvements would have never been possible on the \n     Navajo reservation.\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\n       Please accept the enclosed information on the Apache \n     County, District II plus the resolutions of the local Navajo \n     community chapters as our thanks.\n       Again, thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Tom M.

In order to \n     best use these funds, we have entered into agreements with \n     the Bureau of Indian Affairs and various established school \n     districts. These agreements allow us to expand the budgets \n     for roads in the school districts and receive maximum benefit \n     for funds spent.\n       The funding to date has been spent as follows: Funding of \n     road worker salaries, $63,226; purchase of road working \n     equipment, $215,651; purchase of road building materials, \n     $173,313.\n       This material, labor and equipment helps to maintain over \n     1,300 miles of school bus routes. Even though these funds are \n     extremely helpful, the current amount of funding is \n     inadequate to meet the needs that are encountered in these \n     remote lands.\n       Navajo County fully supports your efforts to not only \n     continue the present funding, but also the efforts to \n     increase the annual amount. If this funding was not \n     available, the school children on the reservation would be \n     the ones who suffer.\n       Please continue your efforts to enhance the TEA-21 funds. \n     If you need further information, please call me at (928) 524-\n     4053.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jesse Thompson,\n     Supervisor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Operations Department,\n\n                                    Kayenta, AZ, January 20, 2004.\n     Re: Letter of Support\n\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     Attn: Denial J. Alpert, Legislative Assistant,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the Kayenta Unified \n     School District (KUSD) and Navajo County Board of \n     Supervisors, I write in support of the TEA-21 grant that the \n     federal government allocates to the State of Arizona and \n     distributes to the Navajo County Board of Supervisors. The \n     TEA-21 Grant greatly impacts the Kayenta Unified School \n     District and the surrounding communities it serves on the \n     Navajo Reservation.\n       For example, during the 2002-2003 school year, Kayenta \n     Unified School District graduated 188 students from Monument \n     Valley High School, and out of the 188 students, 120 students \n     were bused to and form school daily and many of these \n     students live off paved roads. The district buses travel over \n     350,000 mile on an off unpaved roads and transports 2,105 \n     students a day. The overall enrollment at Kayenta Unified \n     School District is 2,600 students.\n       The district is allocated $30,000.00 from the TEA-21 grant \n     annually to support the salary of a heavy equipment operator. \n     Currently, the district has 35 bus routes, and 25 of these \n     routes are on unpaved roads. The heavy equipment operator \n     grades all unpaved roads and with assistance from the TEA-21 \n     grant, we are able to maintain these roads adequately. Most \n     of all, the unpaved roads need to be safe for student \n     transportation, and it is important that we maintain these \n     bus routes, so KUSD is requesting that your office continues \n     to financially support this funding for all Indian \n     reservations, but more importantly, to ensure safe \n     transportation for our students.\n       Furthermore the TEA-21 grant should be equally distributed \n     among the three states that receive this grant. The purpose \n     of the grant is to improve or maintain unpaved roads on the \n     Indian Reservations, especially when inclement weather sets \n     in. With many unpaved roads, the assistance from the TEA-21 \n     grant has made it possible for our students who live in \n     remote areas to continue to remain home and attend school. \n     Otherwise these students would have to go to a boarding \n     school and live away from home. Navajo families in our \n     surrounding areas and Kayenta Unified School District greatly \n     benefit from the TEA-21 grant.\n       Your continuous support and allocation in awarding Kayenta \n     Unified School District is greatly appreciated.\n       If there are any questions please contact me at (928) 697-\n     2130.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Julius Young II,\n     KUSD/Operations Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Fort Defiance Community Chapter,\n\n                                                Fort Defiance, AZ.\n\n Resolution of the Fort Defiance Chapter Expressing an Appreciation to \nSenators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman and Other Members of the U.S. \n Congress for Their Efforts and Support of Funds Allocation to Apache \nCounty and Other Counties Within the Navajo Nation for Road Maintenance\n\n       Whereas:\n       1. The Fort Defiance Community Chapter of Arizona is a \n     certified Navajo chapter government pursuant to 26 N.N.C. is \n     delegated governmental authority with respect to local \n     matters consistent with Navajo laws, including custom, \n     traditions and fiscal matter; and\n       2. The Fort Defiance Community Chapter population of 5,581 \n     people have at least (800+) miles of excess dirt roads and \n     the Apache County, District II maintains seven (7) miles of \n     dirt road; and\n       3. The Fort Defiance Community Chapter realized that in the \n     past, the Apache County was unable to defray the cost of \n     gravel for the dirt roads; however, this past year, the \n     Apache County was able to gravel two (2) miles of school bus \n     routes in Fort Defiance area; and\n       4. The Fort Defiance Community Chapter knows that the \n     Apache County, District II lobbied for its funds such as the \n     TEA-21 (Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century) and \n     was funded to gravel some of the county routes which are bus \n     routes; and\n       Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved That:\n       1. The Fort Defiance Chapter sincerely expresses an \n     appreciation to Senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman and \n     other members of the U.S. Congress for their efforts and \n     support of funds allocation, especially the TEA-21 \n     (Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century) to Apache \n     County and other counties within the Navajo Nation for road \n     maintenance of school bus routes.\n       2. The Fort Defiance Chapter further supports that the \n     gravel of dirt roads continue so that all motorists and \n     school busses travel safely in all types of weather.\n\n\n                             CERTIFICATION\n\n       We hereby certify that the foregoing resolution was duly \n     considered by the Fort Defiance Community Chapter at a duly \n     called meeting at which a quorum was present and that same \n     was Motioned by: Larry Anderson and Seconded by: Louva \n     Dahozy, and passed by a vote of 26 in favor and 0 opposed and \n     1 abstained, this 28th day of February, 2000.\n     Albert Deschine,\n       President.\n     Rena C.

Senator Bingaman: We are aware that Congress will be \n     considering bills to reauthorize the TEA-21 funding for local \n     roads that provide access to the Navajo Reservation. These \n     funds are of special significance to San Juan County.\n       The Public Works Department of San Juan County regularly \n     maintains over 400 miles of roads that are adjacent to or \n     provide access to the Navajo Reservation. These roads are \n     critical to the population in the service areas. School buses \n     depend on our County workers to keep the roads maintained and \n     to provide other essential services.\n       Over the past five years, we have received $953,688 from \n     the TEA-21 program for the maintenance of roads and bridges \n     in these areas. The assistance received under this program \n     will be crucial if we wish to continue to provide these much \n     needed services to the residents on the Navajo Reservation \n     and their visitors.\n       I would like to thank you for your hard work on behalf of \n     the citizens on San Juan County and urge you to support \n     legislation that would extend the TEA-21 Program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Tony Atkinson,\n     County Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Gallup-McKinley County\n\n\n                                               Public Schools,\n\n                                    Gallup, NM, December 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Regarding the reauthorization of \n     TEA-21 legislation, I would like to be up front in support of \n     this bill. Our Gallup-McKinley County School District cannot \n     function without a decent roads maintenance program. Our \n     school district has established a good partnership with the \n     McKinley County Commissioners' Office. Mr. Irvin Harrison, \n     McKinley County Manager, is very instrumental in addressing \n     the many roads maintenance issues. Of course, the money to do \n     the actual maintenance work comes from the Indian School Bus \n     Route Safety Reauthorization Act.\n       Let me explain why the Gallup-McKinley County Schools \n     consider TEA-21 is practically indispensable. Our district \n     daily transports 9,089 students and covers 16,070 miles. The \n     9,089 students are almost all Native Americans residing on \n     Indian reservation land or checker Board Areas. The majority \n     of the roads are dirt or unimproved. Our bus fleet totals 146 \n     and 27 buses are equipped with lifts. Senator, you can \n     imagine how delicate it is to make sure the roads are safe \n     and all-weather condition. On an annual basis, our miles \n     driven exceed 3,047,269. Without the county's roads \n     maintenance program, our buses would deteriorate as quickly \n     as we buy them and absenteeism would climb astronomically. \n     What is so\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\n     unique about our district is, its 5000 square miles size and \n     reported unpaved road transportation nears 400,000 miles. \n     What the McKinley County Roads Department maintains include \n     grading, placing gravel with some degree of compaction, \n     repair work on drainage appurtenances and providing drainage \n     solutions to rain damaged areas. Gallup-McKinley County \n     School District is still expanding. A new high school is \n     under design in Pueblo Pintado. A safe bridge is absolutely \n     essential right next to the new school site.\n       Senator, I recall 3 years ago that you took a ride in one \n     of our buses west of Gallup. I understand you enjoyed the \n     rough ride. I thank you for taking the time from your busy \n     schedule to visit our school district.\n       I am confident that the reauthorization of TEA-21 will be \n     an historic event because this piece of legislation indeed \n     relates to the No Child Left Behind initiative. All weather \n     and safe roads provide the means to get the children to \n     school on time. Absentees and tardiness are discouraged with \n     a reliable transportation to school. I urge your colleagues \n     to jump on the bandwagon and support the Indian School Bus \n     Route Safety Reauthorization Act of 2003. Please call me if \n     you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen S. White,\n     Acting Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Gallup McKinley County\n\n\n                                               Public Schools,\n\n                                                       Gallup, NM.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Hon. Jeff Bingaman: The Gallup McKinley County Schools \n     serve over 15 thousands students, of which over 10 thousand \n     are bussed daily. Our District's school buses travel 9,250 \n     miles daily, one way. Several miles of these roads are \n     primitive dirt roads with poor or no drainage. Several do not \n     have guard rails and some are not maintained by any entity. \n     The inability to safely negotiate school buses over these \n     roads during wet, muddy and snowy conditions greatly \n     restricts our ability to provide adequate services for \n     families living along these particular roadways. Funding for \n     school bus route road maintenance is vital to providing safe \n     and efficient transportation for thousands of students \n     throughout our County.\n       The School bus route maintenance programs have helped \n     tremendously. Our County Roads Division (McKinley County) has \n     been extremely helpful in maintaining hundreds of miles of \n     bus route roads. The route improvements completed recently in \n     the North Coyote Canyon, Mexican Springs, Johnson loop, \n     Tohlakai, CR-1, Crestview, Lyanbito and Bluewell have \n     provided us with the ability to safely negotiate these areas \n     and transport hundreds of students to various schools.\n       The School bus route program is a very important program. \n     Our County Roads division worked diligently to provide safe \n     access and passage for our school districts 160 school buses. \n     Without the school bus route program, it would be impossible \n     to maintain safe conditions on these roads. To insure the \n     safety of our school children and families, it is imperative \n     that the reauthorization of the TEA-21 Bill be realized.\n       Your help in sponsoring bills, which address the unique \n     situations with respect to school bus route roads, have been \n     greatly appreciated. Your continuing support of the school \n     bus route program (TEA-21 Bill) will enable us to continue to \n     safely and efficiently transport our students. It is through \n     these cooperative efforts that we are able to serve the \n     hundreds of families living in our County. Thank you for your \n     continued efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ben Chavez,\n     Support Services Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                The Navajo Nation,\n\n\n                                         Rock Springs Chapter,\n\n                                                   Yah-Ta-Hey, NM.\n\n Resolution of Rock Springs Chapter, Eastern Navajo Agency--District 16\n\n       Requesting and Recommending to the United States Senators, \n     Honorable Jeff Bingaman and Honorable Pete Dominci to \n     Reauthorize the TEA-21 Bill for Continued Funding to the \n     County of McKinley, State of New Mexico for Improvement of \n     School Bus Routes Leading to and within the Navajo Indian \n     Reservation which is Supported by Rock Springs Chapter \n     Community.\n       Whereas:\n       1. The Rock Springs Chapter is a certified chapter and \n     recognized by the Navajo Nation Council, pursuant to CAP-34-\n     98, the Navajo Nation Council adopted the Navajo Local \n     governance act (LGA) which directs local chapters to promote \n     all matters that affect the local community members and to \n     make appropriate decisions, recommendation and advocate on \n     their behalf, and;\n       2. The Rock Springs Chapter is requesting and recommending \n     to the United States Senators, Honorable Jeff Bingaman and \n     Honorable Pete Dominci to Re-authorize the TEA-21 Bill for \n     Continued funding to the County of McKinley, State of New \n     Mexico for improvement of school bus routes leading to and \n     within the Navajo Indian Reservation which is supported by \n     Rock Springs Chapter Community, and;\n       3. The Rock Springs Chapter is established to plan, \n     promote, and coordinate the community, economic, and social \n     development for the community, including an oversight of \n     coordinator and support for federal, state, tribal, and other \n     programs and entities; and\n       4. The Rock Springs Chapter Community are highly concerned \n     of their students attendance due to poor road conditions, \n     lack of improving and maintaining bus routes and how it \n     effects the daily transports of students as well as daily \n     travel for community members, and:\n       5. There are vest miles of (dirt roads) school bus routes \n     that still require improvement. Poor roads contribute to poor \n     education, health issues, economic growth, unemployment, and \n     fatalities in our rural (community) county.\n       Now, Therefore Be It Resolved:\n       1. The Rock Springs Chapter strongly supports the foregoing \n     resolution to the United States Senators, Honorable Jeff \n     Bingaman and Honorable Pete Dominici to Re-authorize TEA-21 \n     Bill for Continued funding to the County of McKinley, State \n     of New Mexico for improvement of school bus routes leading to \n     and within the Navajo Indian Reservation.\n       2. The Rock Springs Chapter Community hereby supports the \n     continuation of improving and upgrading the vast miles of \n     dirt roads school bus routes.\n\n\n                             certification\n\n       We, hereby certify that the foregoing resolution was duly \n     presented and considered by the Rock Springs Chapter at duly \n     called chapter meeting at Rock Springs Chapter, New Mexico \n     (Navajo Nation) at which a quorum was present and the same \n     was passed with a vote of 33 in favor, 00 opposed and 00 \n     abstained on this 18th of February, 2003.\n       Motion: Ted Billy.\n       Second: Rose Mark.\n     Raymond Emerson,\n       Chapter President.\n     Harriett K. Becenti,\n       Council Delegate.\n     Lucinda Roanhorse,\n       Acting Community Services Coordinator.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I have submitted an amendment which \naddresses the serious national problem of drunk driving by helping to \nensure that when drunken drivers are arrested, they can't simply get \nback into their car and put the lives of others in jeopardy. The \namendment is based on legislation known as ``John's Law'' that I have \nintroduced in the Senate and that has already been enacted at the State \nlevel in New Jersey.\n  On July 22, 2000, Navy Ensign John Elliott was driving home from the \nUnited States Naval Academy in Annapolis for his mother's birthday when \nhis car was struck by another car. Both Ensign Elliott and the driver \nof that car were killed. The driver of the car that caused the \ncollision had a blood alcohol level that exceeded twice the legal \nlimit.\n  What makes this tragedy especially distressing is that this same \ndriver had been arrested and charged with driving under the influence \nof alcohol, DUI, just 3 hours before the crash. After being processed \nfor that offense, he had been released into the custody of a friend who \ndrove him back to his car and allowed him to get behind the wheel, with \ntragic results.\n  We need to ensure that drunken drivers do not get back behind the \nwheel before they sober up. With this amendment, States would be \nallowed to use some of their drunk driver prevention grant money from \nthe Federal Government to impound the vehicles of drunk drivers for no \nless than 12 hours. This would help ensure that a drunk driver cannot \nget back behind the wheel until he is sober. And that would make our \nroads safer, and prevent the loss of many innocent lives.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this commonsense measure. And I \nwant to express my appreciation to Senators McCain and Hollings for \ntheir cooperation on this matter.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexplain my objections to the transportation reauthorization bill. I \nwant to make it clear to everyone in this chamber, and more \nimportantly, to the people of Wisconsin, the reasoning behind my vote \ntoday. This legislation is important to me; I wholly support a 6-year \ntransportation reauthorization bill. I understand the need, on so many \nlevels, for long term transportation funding. This is especially true \nin Wisconsin, where the harsh winters make transportation planning \ncritical. And across the Nation, I know that investment in our \ntransportation infrastructure is vital to our safety and our economy. I \nknow how a 6-year bill affects planning for cities and States, affects \njobs across the country, and the overall impact that a 6-year \nauthorization has on the economy. I have heard the statistics, read the \ndata and seen the charts. But\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\nmost importantly, I know that if I were to support this bill today, I \nwould not be doing my best to represent the people of Wisconsin.\n  Every time Congress has faced reauthorizing a transportation funding \nbill, I have had to fight for Wisconsin's fair share. And under TEA-21, \nWisconsin received the best possible return over the course of the \nbill. Under TEA-21, Wisconsin received an average rate of return of \napproximately $1.02 to every dollar the State contributed to the \nhighway trust fund. This fair return did not come without a fight, \nhowever, and prior to TEA-21's passage, I worked diligently to ensure \nthat Wisconsin saw its fair share of transportation dollars.\n  This bill, however, throws those hard-won and well-earned returns \naway. By the second year of the bill, Wisconsin's rate of return will \ndrop from almost $1.03 to $.95. According to preliminary estimates from \nmy State's Department of Transportation, Wisconsin stands to lose an \naverage of $80 million every year for the 6-year life of the bill under \na 95 percent rate of return. In other words, the difference between a \nhundred percent and 95 percent rate of return results in millions of \ndollars lost for Wisconsin. How can I support that?\n  That is why I sought to offer an amendment, which would have helped \nWisconsin recoup some of the loss under this bill. My amendment would \ncorrect one of the largest problems that midwestern States have faced \nover the past several years. Midwestern States account for almost 70 \npercent of the loss of funds that is associated with the ethanol tax \nexemption. Wisconsin's loss has more than tripled within the last 3 \nyears alone. My amendment would change States' TEA-21 average by adding \nthe ethanol losses that occurred between 1996 and 2001. By applying the \nrevised averages to the portion of the bill that calculates the minimum \na State can receive, Wisconsin would stand to gain in the range of $50 \nmillion every year of the bill. This would help the State gain back the \nlosses that we faced due to ethanol.\n  Unfortunately, because of the rush of leadership on both sides of the \naisle to finish the transportation bill, efforts to offer amendments \nimproving the bill were procedurally blocked. I am very disappointed \nthat so many of my colleagues--so many whose States do well under this \nbill--have shut out the rest of us who want to debate our ideas for \nmaking the bill fairer and better. This is politics at its worst. And \nthe result will be a huge amount of public resources divvied up by a \nformula crafted in secret, unimproved with the ideas from--unresponsive \nto the needs of--too many States like Wisconsin.\n\n  Fortunately for Wisconsin and these other States, this bill is far \nfrom law despite our work this week. The White House is insisting on \nbringing the cost of the bill down by billions before the President \nwill sign it. The House is developing a bill including an increase in \nthe gas tax that has little support in the Senate. If a 6-year \nauthorization does become law this year, it will not look anything like \nthe behemoth we have voted on today.\n  And for all these reasons, I could not vote for this legislation--\nvote to pass the losses contained in this legislation to my State. I \nwill not be part of a process that puts the Senate stamp of approval on \nan embarrassing backroom deal that has a lot more to do with log \nrolling than road building. I will not push through legislation that \ndoes not give Wisconsin drivers and Wisconsin taxpayers their fair \nshare.\n  A safe and secure transportation network is important to the people \nin my State. The Wisconsin highway system requires constant attention \nand repair, to offset the damage caused by harsh winters and hot \nsummers. Every year during the appropriations process, I have worked to \nsecure funding for on-going projects critical to ensuring safe roads \nand a stable economy. I support the Senate's decision to pass a 6-year \nauthorization. But not this bill. I cannot in good conscience support \nthis bill, which represents an embarrassment to the Senate and a \nserious loss to my State.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this difficult bill \nfor the hours and days of work that have gone into this bill. This \nlegislation is the most difficult the Senate will deal with this year. \nIt goes without saying that there are more moving parts of this bill \nand that's what makes it so difficult. It affects every State in the \nUnion in important ways: infrastructure and jobs. Every Senator in this \nbody knows and understands that. All of us here are in need of both and \nit affects rural and urban areas alike.\n  If I have learned anything during my tenure here, it is this: It is \nimpossible to out build America's love for the automobile.\n  The Subcommittee on Communications of the Commerce Committee has \nlooked at this along with the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation. \nWe have spent hours discussing safety and efficiency. We have passed \nlegislation in telecommunications making it easier to telecommute. The \ndeployment of broadband Internet services is lagging due to several \nreasons, but it becomes vital to the easing of congestion found in our \nmorning and evening commutes--labor and consulting laws to deal with \nthe one who stays home two of the five working days and uses either the \ntelephone or Internet to correspond and perform his or her office \nresponsibilities. It is being done in Washington, D.C. as we speak.\n  Great strides have been made in telemedicine and distance learning \nusing these new and exciting communications tools. What I am trying to \nsay is simple. It is not just a highway bill to move people but to move \npeople and commerce. It is just one more item that is the \ninfrastructure to do many things. The Internet has allowed Montana to \nmove closer to downtown Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Seattle, Denver, \nor San Francisco. For that matter, it has opened up the world and world \nmarkets to us in rural areas as never before.\n  Now why do you ask why Montana has a huge interest in our roads and \nhighways? We still depend on our farm-to-market roads. We are at the \nend of the line for product and the head of the line for the natural \nresources that are in high demand in every corner of the Nation.\n  Here is the problem. It is a problem that has been dealt with by so \nmany Senators and Congressmen in a fair way. Montana has only 28 people \nper lane mile on our Federal aid highways when the national average is \n124. That is on Federal aid highways. In another area, our per capita \nincome is below the national average. If that is not enough, rural \nMontana has long stretches, fewer people with smaller incomes. In fact, \nyou have heard me use this expression a lot: ``We have a lot of dirt \nbetween light bulbs.'' We also have ways of financing the modern day \nneeds for modern day roads. We have huge holdings of federally owned \nlands--federally owned national parks, national forest lands, Indian \nreservations, and public lands. They all have transportation needs that \nare unique to their areas. That limits our tax base, thus the need for \nsome assistance in fulfilling the transportation needs for the entire \ncountry.\n  Overall, I am very supportive of the bill before us today, but I do \nhave some concerns and issues I wish we had more time to deal with.\n  As the bill is written now, Montana would not receive funds under the \nimpaired driving or occupant protection sections of this bill. I have \ntwo amendments that create a minimum guarantee to States such as mine \nthat desperately need assistance is these areas. If it is a national \nprogram, then everyone should be able to access those funds. I \nunderstand the incentive-based approach my colleagues have written but \ncreating programs that exclude some States is not the right direction.\n  Senator Shelby did a great job, and I thank him for his work and \nassistance on rural transit. Even though Montana receives a 169 percent \nincrease from TEA-21, it translates into modest dollars. Now here is my \nproblem. We have an aging rural population. I have 14 counties that do \nnot have a local physician. So routes taken in Montana must traverse \nthese areas where we have modest ridership and long travel distances. \nThese new transit funds will help us meet those needs.\n  While we are on the subject of mass transit, it is time to face the \nsituation of Amtrak.\n  Let me state at this point that I have been and continue to be a \nsupporter of Amtrak. With all its problems, all the bumps, scars, and \nwarts, Congress has listened to our folks at home, and it is clear they \nwant a national passenger\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\nsystem. It is costly. There are all kinds of studies and reports that \none can draw from to deal with Amtrak, and I have yet to see any change \nin how it does business. We demagog the issue a lot and sometimes we \nsee some attempt to change it but nothing that would change it \ndrastically. We all demagog well, but we have shown no political will \nto change it. Regional needs and issues come front and center when we \ntry.\n  There are those who think of Amtrak as a light rail commuter system, \nso the interest and money flows in that direction. It is the only \nnational passenger railway system this country has. Let me repeat--it \nis the only national passenger system we have. If it takes money from \nthe Federal Treasury to subsidize, then so be it. But if there are \nareas where it is being used as a local commuter service, then are the \ntaxpayers of the Nation subsidizing a local problem?\n  Amtrak is just one of many important rail issues we should discuss \ntoday. When looking at rail policy, I believe it is important to \nconsider the outlook of the rail customers along side that of the \nrailroads, and those views are quite different.\n  In my State and many others across the Nation, we have the issue of \ncaptive shippers, and the economic impact to our States is no small \nitem.\n  We have heard from more and more shippers about decreased \ntransportation competitiveness and, as a result, increased \ntransportation rates.\n  Let me give a quick description of what has happened in this country \nthe last 20 or so years. In 1980, there were 40 class I railroads in \nthis country. As a result, Congress passed the Staggers Act that year \nwith the intent that regulation would be eased and competition would \nendure and drive the marketplace ensuring rail rates would remain \nreasonable. Through regulatory involvement and a stifling amount of \nconsolidation, we find ourselves with essentially four class I \nrailroads today, two in the east and two in the west.\n\n  Together with Senators Dorgan and Rockefeller, I introduced S. 919, \nthe Railroad Competition Act of 2003 which is represented in several \namendments before us today. Our intent is to correct the model and the \neconomic structure that allows monopolistic behavior in the freight \nrail industry. Contrary to what you have heard from the railroads, \nthere are no provisions in our amendments that are re-regulatory. The \nbill restates the original intent of the Staggers Act of 1980 which has \nbeen eroded by mergers and regulatory interpretation.\n  Our amendments will not penalize the railroads or create an \nenvironment where railroads cannot compete with other transportation \nmodes. In fact, our amendments will create competition among our \nrailroads improving transportation efficiencies in our economy. I am \nthe last Member of Congress who would introduce a measure that would \ndrive a railroad out of a local economy, simply due to the fact that my \nState of Montana is nearly entirely captive to one railroad.\n  The bottom line is the railroad industry in this country is allowed \nto legally operate in a business model that breeds monopolistic \nbehavior.\n  Montana is a classic case of what happens to rail customers when you \neliminate competitive transportation alternatives. Our rail rates are \nsome the highest in the Nation and my shippers end up subsidizing rail \nrates in regions where competition is present. Our rail customers pay \nmore for less service. The rail customers in regions with competitive \nalternative pay less and receive more service.\n  American agricultural shippers are the most vulnerable to predatory \nmarketing by monopolistic practices of railroads. The farm producer, \nunlike every other industry in America, cannot pass the freight costs \nonto anyone else. They must simply eat the cost.\n  It has been 24 years since the enactment of the Stagger Act, and \nneither the marketplace nor the Surface Transportation Board has \ncorrected the obvious monopolistic behavior of our railroads. I ask \nthat my colleagues seriously consider the rail customer issues we have \nin this country.\n  Finally, I appreciate the hard work of the managers of this bill and \ntheir consideration for rural America. It is my hope we begin to move \nforward on the highway bill and I look forward to its timely passage.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I take a few minutes today to talk \nabout the transportation reauthorization bill before the Senate and why \nit is so important that we deliver a strong, well-rounded bill to our \nStates.\n  This bill authorizes the largest increase of funds for California \nover 6 years since I have been in the Senate. That increase is $6 \nbillion for California roads over the next 6 years.\n  As a donor State, California sends more tax dollars to Washington, \nDC, than we receive back. This bill over the next 6 years would greatly \nimprove that status.\n  For the first time, this bill brings California, and all donor \nStates, to a 95 percent rate of return. California is currently at a 90 \npercent rate of return. In other words, for every dollar California \nsends to Washington, it gets back only 90 cents for maintenance and \nimprovement of our highways. This bill would allow California to \nreceive 95 cents back on the dollar in the sixth year of the \nauthorization of the transportation bill.\n  While that increase does not happen as quickly as I would like, this \nbill provides California with an overall $6 billion increase for \nimportant highway programs.\n  As a Californian, transportation is the backbone of our economy. \nCalifornia has two of the Nation's busiest ports--Los Angeles/Long \nBeach and Oakland, and California ports handle half of all cargo coming \ninto the United States.\n  We need roads that are equipped to handle the flow of goods and the \ntruck traffic that comes with it.\n  Mr. President, three-quarters of all goods shipped from California \nports are now transported by truck along California roads. Roads that \nare in desperate need of repair. Thirty-seven percent of California \nroad conditions are rated ``poor.'' Only 11 percent of roads nationwide \nhave that same rating. On the other hand, only 13 percent of roads in \nCalifornia have a ``good'' rating while 46 percent of roads nationwide \nhave the same classification.\n  At the same time, travel on California roads increased 97 percent \nbetween 1980 and 2000, while population increased 42 percent in the \nsame period.\n  We are all familiar with pictures of California gridlock. Cars \nsitting on our freeways, moving at a snail's pace.\n  The facts bear out the images. Los Angeles has had the worst traffic \nin the nation for 16 years in a row. San Francisco and Oakland are tied \nwith Atlanta and Washington for second place. San Diego ranked sixth.\n  Traffic congestion in California costs motorists $20.4 billion \nannually in lost time and fuel.\n  All this in a State that has six non-attainment air quality areas, \nwith 70 percent of the State in the reformulated gasoline program \nbecause our air is so dirty.\n  California needs an infusion of cash to pay for highway enhancements \nto allow an easier flow of traffic to reduce the amount of time trucks \nand cars are idling, increasing air pollution. That is just one step we \ncan take to allow communities in my State to reach air quality \nattainment.\n  We also need money for public transit to reduce the amount of cars on \nthe road, reducing air pollution, and decreasing the amount of time my \nconstituents have to spend commuting every day.\n  California has some of the largest regional transportation systems in \nthe country including the Bay Area Rapid Transit, BART, CalTrain, the \nrail service between San Francisco and San Jose, and Metrolink, \nSouthern California's regional transit system.\n  My State is facing a crisis. Without Federal highway dollars my local \ncommunities will not be able to eliminate bottlenecks on our highways \nto improve air quality. As a result, they will be out of conformity \nwith Federal air quality regulations, and will lose even more Federal \nhighway dollars. This will become a never-ending cycle. Without money \nthey can't conform, and without conforming they can't get money.\n  California also needs this bill for economic reasons. According to \nthe Department of Transportation, each $1 billion in new infrastructure \ninvestment creates 47,500 new jobs: 26,500 of\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nthese are directly related to construction, engineering, contracting, \nand other on-site employees, and 21,000 are indirect jobs resulting \nfrom the spending associated with the investment.\n  We would not have to wait long to feel the benefits of this \ntransportation bill. Transportation construction contractors hire \nemployees within a few weeks of obtaining a project contract. These \nemployees begin receiving paychecks within 2 weeks of hiring. In other \nwords, if the bill is passed tomorrow, three weeks from now \nconstruction sites would be bustling with activity. We can't afford to \ndelay.\n  In an economic recovery that has so far been jobless, the Federal \nGovernment must do what it can to create jobs.\n  Improving our transportation infrastructure is one of the critical \nthings we can do to create all sorts of jobs.\n  According to the California Employment Development Department, job \ngrowth in the coming year in California will be a dismal 1 percent \nabout 142,000 jobs in all--barely more than half the 10 year average.\n  California needs a robust transportation bill to help clean the air, \nease congestion on the roads, and create jobs.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I rise in opposition to the final \npassage of S. 1072, the ``Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act of 2003, SAFETEA.'' However, this vote does \nnot come without great difficulty, because I understand how vital this \nlegislative package is to the transportation infrastructure of Georgia \nand the country as a whole.\n  I understand that the future growth of my state largely depends on a \nrobust transportation program, particularly in Atlanta and its \nsurrounding counties. Georgia's commuters are suffering from some of \nthe most notorious congestion in the country and without the crucial \nfunds from the reauthorization of the highway funding bill, the time \nthey spend commuting will only get worse. I also clearly understand \nthat the funding from this bill will be used for highway and transit \nprojects that would greatly enhance the vast transportation \ninfrastructure in Georgia. However, I believe that these improvements \ncan be made in conjunction with sound fiscal policy.\n  Last year, in a vote that I did not support, the Senate moved to \nincrease the contract authority in the budget resolution for \ntransportation spending to $272 billion. The SAFETEA bill on the floor \nof the Senate today breaks this unprecedented level by further \nincreasing the contract authority by $36 billion, this being an \nincrease of 46 percent over the previous level. In other words, to pass \nthe Senate's version of the SAFETEA legislation, the Senate will have \nto vote to set aside its own budget resolution. In addition, the \nlegislation contains a significant funding gap between the desired \nspending levels and the anticipated transportation-related excise tax \nreceipts. Simply put, the gas tax receipts used to finance most federal \nsurface transportation projects will not keep pace with government \nspending. Over the next 6 years, the Congressional Budget Office \nprojects that the gas tax receipts for highways and transit will \ngenerate roughly $233 billion--about $80 billion less than the contract \nauthority provided in the SAFETEA legislation on the floor of the \nSenate. The Finance Committee has produced a plan to make up the \ndifference in a series of revenue boosting maneuvers that simply move \nrevenue generators out of general revenues into the Highway Trust Fund. \nHowever, at the end of the day when we realize that there just isn't \nenough money from the Highway Trust Fund to pay for this bill, \ninevitably, the burden will fall on the General Fund to make up the \ndifference. The deficit will continue to grow and that is an option \nthat I cannot support.\n  In this time of soaring budget deficits, we must hold the line on \nspending. We must draw a line in the sand and say that we will not \ncontinue to lay the burden of these ever increasing deficits on the \nshoulders of our children and our grandchildren, because they will pay \nthe price of Congress's profuse spending habits. It is up to us to \nmonitor ourselves and if we do not start by limiting the spending \ncontained within this bill, the deficit will only increase. I am not \nwilling to leave these problems to be dealt with by future generations. \nOur President has given us an amount that he would support for the cost \nof this highway bill. He has requested that we limit our spending to \n$256 billion to work with over the next 6 years. Even with this \nlimitation, this figure represents a 21 percent increase over the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), enacted in \n1998. I believe that this rational increase would still have a positive \neffect on Georgia's transportation infrastructure, while doing \nsignificantly less damage to our Nation's economy.\n  I urge my colleagues who will be Senate conferees when this \nlegislation moves to conference to pursue fiscal responsibility and \nwork to reduce the total cost of this bill before the conference report \nreturns to the Senate floor for final passage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Michigan is a long time donor State that \nfor 50 years or so has sent more gas tax dollars to the Highway Trust \nFund in Washington than are returned back in transportation \ninfrastructure spending.\n  The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity \nAct of 2004, SAFETEA, addresses this inequity by returning more money \nto donor States which for years have seen a portion of their highway \ntrust fund contributions shifted to ``donee'' States. These ``donee'' \nStates have benefitted from antiquated Federal highway formulas which \ngive them more Federal highway funding than they paid into the highway \ntrust fund.\n  I have been fighting to correct the inequity faced by donor States \nlike Michigan for decades. We have made some progress, but we won't be \nsatisfied until we get the full return on our gas tax dollars after the \ncosts of administering the program are allocated. For instance, in \n1978, Michigan was getting somewhere around 75 cents on our gas tax \ndollar. The 1991 ISTEA bill brought us up to approximately 80 cents per \ndollar and the 1998 TEA-21 bill guaranteed a 90.5 cent minimum return \nfor each State.\n  SAFETEA moves us in the right direction toward correcting the \ninequity in the distribution of highway funding. I cosponsored an \namendment that would have, if adopted, provided additional funding to \ndonor states to bring them more quickly to equity. While the inequity \nshould be corrected immediately rather than gradually over the life of \nthe 6-year bill, it is an important step forward that donor States will \nall achieve a 95 cent return by the sixth year of this bill, a level \nthat is much better than in prior bills.\n  Under this legislation, Michigan will get more than $2.1 billion \nadditional dollars over 6 years to pay for badly needed transportation \ninfrastructure improvements. In all, under the formula portion of this \nbill, Michigan will get over $7.4 billion over 6 years which represents \nmore than a 40 percent increase over TEA-21, plus additional funds from \nother sections of the bill.\n  Our Nation has significant infrastructure improvement needs. For \ninstance, according to the Federal Highway Administration, FHWA, \ncongestion at border crossings can lead to delays of over 80 minutes. \nThe lost productivity from this congestion has a negative impact on the \nNation's economy. It also causes environmental problems in the border \nregions. We need to get trucks and people across the borders more \nquickly and with greater safety.\n  I am pleased the bill managers have accepted my proposal to \ndistribute funding for the bill's enhanced and expanded Border \nPlanning, Operations, and Technology Program based on documented usage \nand trade flows at individual border crossings. Under my proposal, \nborder infrastructure funding would be distributed using criteria that \nis based on the cargo weight, trade value and the number of commercial \nand passenger vehicles crossing the particular border. This means our \nNation's busiest border crossings will get the Federal funding needed \nto improve this important economic infrastructure. Distributing the \nfunds by this formula gives border projects more stability and \npredictability and is good public policy. It will also enhance U.S. \neconomic activity and growth by facilitating the more efficient flow of \ngoods, services and people at U.S. border crossings. Michigan, home to \nour Nation's top two commercial vehicle\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\ncrossings on the northern border, the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit and \nthe Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, would receive approximately $204.5 \nmillion from this account over 6 years to improve its border \ninfrastructure.\n  SAFETEA also makes an important change to the ethanol tax subsidy \nthat will benefit my State of Michigan. At issue is the fact that the \ncurrent ethanol subsidy comes at the expense of the highway trust fund \nand those States such as Michigan and Ohio that consume ethanol. Under \ncurrent law, ethanol consuming States end up, under the formula, \ngetting less back in federal highway funds. The Michigan Department of \nTransportation estimates that Michigan's annual revenue loss is $37 \nmillion a year in Federal aid because of the way the taxes on ethanol \nare credited.\n  To fix this, this bill shifts the cost of the ethanol tax subsidy \nfrom the highway trust fund to the general fund. Once ethanol taxes are \ncredited at the same rate as gasoline, 18.4 cents a gallon compared to \nthe current 13.2 cents a gallon on ethanol, for the purposes of \ncalculating inputs into the highway trust fund, the highway trust fund \nwill grow. So, too, will the size of Michigan's and other ethanol \nconsuming States' contributions credited to the trust fund. The bottom \nline is with the ethanol fix, Michigan will receive more Federal \nhighway dollars over the life of the 6-year bill.\n  This legislation provides $56 billion for mass transit over 6 years, \na significant increase over the prior reauthorization bill. Under the \ntransit title, Michigan would get $656 million over 6 years, an \nincrease of $230 million or 53 percent over TEA-21. This moves us in \nthe right direction on mass transit.\n  There are few Federal investments that will have such a large and \nimmediate impact on job creation and economic growth than investments \nin our Nation's transportation infrastructure. The efficient \nfunctioning of our economy depends on a reliable multimodal interstate \nsystem that is made up of highway, bus, rail, shipping and air \ntransportation. We need to maintain and improve these systems and we \nneed to address the costs and frustration of increased traffic \ncongestion. This bill goes a long way to improve the operation of our \ntransportation system and to keep us competitive in a global \nmarketplace.\n  The Federal infrastructure investment of $318 billion contained in \nthis bill, while increasing the efficiency of our transportation \nsystem, will also spur the creation of thousands of jobs in every State \nacross this Nation. The Department of Transportation estimates that \nevery $1 billion in new Federal investment creates more than 47,500 \njobs. With Michigan standing to gain over $7.4 billion dollars over the \n6-year bill, an increase of more than $2.1 billion over the last 6 \nyears, this bill would mean almost 100,000 new jobs in Michigan and the \nretention of almost 250,000 jobs. These are good paying jobs and jobs \nthat Michigan needs for economic recovery and to replace some of the \njobs we have lost in manufacturing. These are jobs that we need in \nMichigan and throughout our country.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wish to express my view regarding the \nSafe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of \n2004, SAFETEA, S. 1072.\n  This legislation reauthorizes our Nation's surface transportation, \nfreight, and mass transit programs, which are so vital to the \ninfrastructure of my State of Idaho and to the Nation. Idaho is \nconsidered a ``donee'' State, one that receives more Federal dollars \nfrom the Highway Trust Fund, HTF, than we contribute. This is due to \nthe low population density, reduced tax base, and several miles of \ninterstate that run throughout the State.\n  Thanks to the hard and careful work of my colleague, Senator Crapo, \nwho serves on both the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee \nand the Environment and Public Works committee, I believe Idaho has \nreceived fair and equitable treatment in this bill. I applaud the \ncommittee and especially Senator Crapo for recognizing that large, \nrural States have to maintain the infrastructure that our farmers, \nlong-haul truckers, tourists--and most important, our citizens--use \nevery day.\n  However, Mr. President, I would like to voice my concern with the \nlegislation now before us.\n  Last year the President proposed his version of SAFETEA to Congress. \nBoth House and Senate committees of jurisdiction quickly began their \nwork to forge a bill that addresses our Nation's needs. Although \nneither was successful in bringing the bill to the floor, after a year \nof work, the Senate will vote on our version of the bill today.\n  As I have seen it, the President's proposal would authorize $256 \nbillion in highway and transit funding over 6 years. This is a $45 \nbillion, or 21 percent increase from the 1998 reauthorization referred \nto as ``TEA-21.'' The legislation before the Senate is calculated at a \ntotal cost of $318 billion, with $311 billion of the total amount under \ncontract authority.\n  For obvious reasons, my concern is that this legislation sends the \nwrong signal to the American taxpayers. Before I go further, I must say \nthat I strongly support the need to maintain and improve the \ninfrastructure of this Nation. I also understand the impact this \nlegislation has on creating jobs and its role in strengthening our \neconomy, which continues to grow and expand.\n  The benefits of this bill are many, but I cannot support the funding \nlevels proposed in this bill. Recently the Congressional Budget Office, \nCBO, predicted that the federal deficit will reach $477 billion this \nyear. These figures are sure to fluctuate, but I think Congress must \nact responsibly by keeping spending under control.\n  The bill before the Senate is roughly $62 billion above the \nadministration's request, and $24 billion over budget. We have already \nfaced a motion to waive the budget today, which directly undermines the \nbudget we all agreed to last year for FY2004.\n  It is a tough choice for me to oppose this bill. Thanks to the bill's \nmanagers, Idaho will greatly benefit from the formula's allocation for \nboth our highway system and our transit needs. However, I cannot allow \nfor future generations of Americans to pay for the fiscal \nirresponsibility of our actions now.\n  It is my hope that when this legislation is placed before a \nconference of the House and Senate, that common sense and fiscal \nresponsibility prevails, and I will be able to cast a vote in favor of \na final conference report.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will respond to some criticisms of the \nFinance Committee package.\n  There is an allegation that the Finance Committee did not pay for \nthis bill. Let me be clear. The Finance Committee adhered to the \nfollowing principles in carrying out its responsibilities:\n  The Finance Committee funded the trust fund by increasing the amount \nof excise tax receipts retained by the trust fund.\n  The Finance Committee funded the bill at the outlay number--that is \nthe cash flow impact on the trust fund. Some have pointed to \nobligations and contract authority numbers. Those numbers were not and \nare not relevant to the Finance Committee role. It is unfair to compare \nnumbers for contract authority or obligation with receipts. That is \napples and oranges. The Finance Committee matched receipts and outlays.\n  In accordance with Finance Committee members' desires, the deficit \nimpact of matching receipts and outlays was offset with general fund \nrevenue raisers. Those numbers match up.\n  That is the bottom line. The Finance Committee did its job.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a summary of \nthe Finance Committees funding title for the highway bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Summary of Finance Committee Funding Title\n\n       Finance Committee jurisdiction extends to the highway use-\n     related excise taxes, the highway trust fund, and the \n     expenditure authority of the highway trust fund. The Finance \n     Committee acted primarily on the cash flow into and out of \n     the trust fund. Cash flow into the trust fund is represented \n     by trust fund excise tax receipts. Cash flow out of the trust \n     fund is represented by trust fund outlays. Matters involving \n     contract authority and obligation limits are not Finance \n     Committee subject matter and the committee did not speak to \n     them.\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, current \n     law trust fund receipts will total $227.8 billion over the \n     six year period. CBO projects $196 billion in highway account \n     receipts and $31.8 billion in mass transit account receipts.\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\n       The authorizing committees' actions placed demands on the \n     trust fund of $231 billion for highways and $36.6 billion for \n     transit for the six year authorization period. That means a \n     total of $267.6 billion in demands on the trust fund.\n       Prior to Finance Committee action, demands on the trust \n     fund exceeded receipts by $39.8 billion over the 6-year \n     period. To make up this funding gap, the Finance Committee \n     developed two categories of proposals. The first category \n     increased trust fund receipts by tightening compliance. The \n     second category included accounting changes that raised trust \n     fund receipts.\n       The compliance changes raised trust fund receipts by $5.6 \n     billion over the authorization period. These changes were \n     also scored as revenue raisers by the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation. These proposals have no impact on the budget \n     deficit.\n       The budget resolution assumes that 2.5 cents per gallon of \n     gasohol receipts, currently held by the general fund, will be \n     transferred to the trust fund. That transfer raises trust \n     fund receipts by $5 billion over the authorization period. \n     The Finance Committee also assumed that trust fund balances \n     would be spent down by $7.5 billion over the authorization \n     period. Adding all of these changes together with the \n     compliance changes, the Finance Committee closed the gap by \n     $18.1 billion over the authorization period. That left a \n     funding gap of $21.7 billion.\n       The Finance Committee proposed to close this gap with a \n     group of trust fund accounting changes. These proposals raise \n     trust fund receipts by shifting the burden of tax policies \n     from the trust fund to the general fund. In the view of \n     Finance Committee, these tax policy benefits have nothing to \n     do with highway use and should not burden the trust fund. \n     Included in these proposals is a repeal of the partial \n     exemption for ethanol-blended fuels. The tax benefit for \n     ethanol, like nearly all energy production incentives, is \n     transferred to the general fund through a tax credit. The \n     same effect is applied to refunds for special categories of \n     users such as state and local governments. Finally, the \n     highway trust fund will earn interest on its balance, so that \n     the highway and transit programs are not prejudiced. This \n     second category of proposals closed the funding gap, but, \n     without revenue offsets, would have increased the budget \n     deficit by $21.7 billion.\n       Finance Committee members decided that this second category \n     of proposals should not have a deficit impact. To this end, \n     the Finance Committee title includes a group of loophole \n     closers previously approved by the committee.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of Finance Committee staff prepared analysis. This \nanalysis reconciles trust receipts and outlays. It also reconciles the \ndeficit impact of the proposal with general fund revenue raisers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n   TEA 21 Reauthorization bill funding projections, February 2, 2004\n\n                             [In billions]\n\nHighways:\n  Contract Authority..............................................255.0\n  Obligation Limitation...........................................238.0\n  Commerce Obligation...............................................6.5\n  Outlays.........................................................231.0\n                                                               ========\n\nAmount needed to Fund EPW/Commerce Spending.......................231.0\nGas Tax Baseline--Projected Gas Tax Receipts......................196.0\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \nAdditional Funding Needed..........................................35.0\n                                                               ========\n\nRevenues additions to Highway Trust Fund:\n  Fuel Fraud Compliance and Mobile Machinery........................5.0\n  2.5 gasohol.......................................................5.0\n  **5.2 Gasohol.....................................................9.0\n  **Interest on Trust Fund balance..................................2.0\n  **Gas Guzzlers....................................................0.5\n  **Amend Fuel refund mechanism in IRC..............................8.0\n  Spend down partial Trust Fund balance.............................5.5\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n      Additional Revenue for Highway Trust Fund....................35.0\n                                                               ========\n\nTransit:\n  Baseline 2.86 cents from each gallon taxed.......................31.8\n  Spenddown of partial MTA balance..................................2.0\n  Fuel Fraud........................................................0.6\n  **Interest on MTA.................................................2.2\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n      Total Transit from Trust Fund................................36.6\n                                                               ========\n\n**Revenue Offsets:\n  Expansion of limitation on depreciation of autos.................0.03\n  Tax Shelters/Corporate Governance................................15.8\n  Enrol Tax Shelters................................................3.2\n  Expatriation......................................................3.3\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n      Total Offsets................................................22.3\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There has also been some mention of the use of a \nprovision accelerating the payment of corporate estimated taxes. The \nprovision has been attacked as a ``gimmick.'' It has been attacked as \n``funny money.'' The provision is fairly straight forward. It increases \nthe payment of the third quarter corporate estimated tax deposits by \n119% for 2009. This measure has the effect of shifting $11.4 billion \nfrom fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010. It makes sure the bill will \nbe offset for the five- and six-year periods.\n  Let the record reflect, Mr. President, that this technique and \nvariations on it have been used frequently over the past decade. Most \nof the time these things were done without complaints from either side. \nSometimes complaints were raised by those opposed to a particular bill \non other substantive grounds.\n  Let's look at the history of enacted tax laws that contained these \nshifts.\n  In 1994, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, that is, the landmark \ngeneral agreement on tariffs and trade legislation contained several \nchanges in payment dates for excise taxes. Check it out in section 712 \nof Public Law 103-415 of December 8, 1994. That legislation was \noverwhelmingly supported by both sides of the aisle.\n  In 1997, the Tax Relief Act of 1997 contained a change in the \npercentage for the ``safe harbor'' for payment of individual estimated \ntaxes for 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. Check it out in section \n1091 of Public Law 105-34 of August 5, 1997.\n  In 1998, the Trade and Tax Relief Extension Act of 1998 contained a \nchange for the safe harbor for payment of individual estimated taxes. \nCheck it out in section 2003 of Public Law 105-277 of October 21, 1998.\n  In 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2001, contained the much-criticized shift in corporate estimated tax \npayments. Check it out in section 801 of Public Law 107-16 of June 7, \n2001.\n  In 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 \nalso contained the much-criticized shift in corporate estimated tax \npayments. Check it out in section 501 of Public Law 108-27 of May 28, \n2003.\n  All of the laws mentioned above are major pieces of legislation. They \nwere all bipartisan measures. All of them contained shifts in dates of \npayment of excise taxes, corporate taxes, or individual income taxes. \nMembers should also be aware that these devices or similar devices were \nused in partisan bills by each side that did not become law. For \nexample, the patients bill of rights legislation considered in the \nsummer of 2001, contained a one day shift in Medicare provider \npayments. Some of the harshest critics of the corporate estimated tax \nshift were lead sponsors of that legislation.\n  Now, even though the corporate shift in this bill is a conventional \npractice, Senator Baucus and I agreed to delete it before this bill \nleft the Senate floor. Our agreement is with Senators Nickles and \nConrad. We will attempt to carry out our agreement but are subject to \nthe cooperation of our colleagues.\n  Part of the legislative process is compliance with our budget rules. \nThe Finance Committee offset its title over the five, six, and ten year \nperiod of the bill. Contrary to the critics' assertions, the corporate \nshift moved real money, corporate tax receipts, from one period to the \nother. I ask unanimous consent that a revenue table, prepared by the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, on the Finance Committee financing title, \nbe inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.006\n\n\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.007\n\n\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, section 4(f) of the highway bill \nprovides important protections for historic sites, parks, recreation \nareas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges throughout the country. With \nthe increasing demand for transportation projects, it is important that \nwe not lose sight of our natural treasures. We need to balance the \ngrowing need for transportation with responsible stewardship of our \nhistory and natural resources.\n  In my State of Vermont, we have a wealth of history and natural \nbeauty. To see the wildlife that populate the Missisquoi Wildlife \nRefuge or the covered bridges used by our forefathers is to experience \na heritage that we all want preserved for future generations.\n  Section 4(f) has helped preserve these treasures. The Revolutionary \nWar site at Fort Vehemence on Route 7 in Pittsford, Vermont, was \navoided as a result of 4(f).\n  An excellent collection of historic metal truss bridges across the \nConnecticut River were rehabilitated, not replaced, as a result of \n4(f).\n  A road in the Danville Historic District was narrowed in order to \nkeep the historic characteristics of the historic village because of \n4(f).\n  While constructing a new highway in Vermont, we have discovered a \nsignificant archeological site containing artifacts from Native \nAmericans, providing us with a piece of history that until now was not \nknown. By documenting this site, we will expand our knowledge of \nVermont's Native Americans. Also, because of 4(f) protections.\n  An amendment to 4(f) is included in this legislation. The objective \nof this amendment is to allow transportation projects and programs to \nmove forward more quickly, while maintaining the protections of 4(f). \nThose protections assure that there will be public notice and \nopportunity for public review and comment on proposed de minimis \ndeterminations for transportation projects, and that affected agencies \nwill concur in the decision of the Secretary of Transportation that \nthere will be no adverse impact on a historic site, recreation area, \npark, or wildlife or waterfowl refuge.\n  The amendment would require the Secretary of Transportation, when \nmaking a finding that a transportation project or program will have a \nde minimis impact, to consider all avoidance, minimization, mitigation, \nand enhancement measures that have been incorporated into the project. \nThis provision allows project sponsors to incorporate environmentally \nprotective measures into the project from the beginning, in order to \nsupport a finding of de minimis impact. These mitigation measures must \nbe backed by enforceable agreements and post-construction monitoring \nof the effectiveness of these impact mitigation measures, with \nidentified contingency measures to backstop the primary mitigation \nmeasures. In other words, the mitigation measures must be carried and \nbe shown to have the intended impact. If they are not having the \nintended impact, other measures must be used to ensure no adverse \nimpact.\n\n  In addition to the 4(f) provisions, this contains some modest, \ncommon-sense provisions to assure the transportation planners will \nconsider the location of important habitat, wetlands and other natural \nresources at the earliest stages of planning for new roads.\n  These provisions will make project delivery faster and more \nefficient. Currently, transportation projects are often planned without \ndetailed information on core conservation areas, sensitive resources or \nimportant habitat that might lie within the selected corridor. These \nconflicts do not come to light until the environmental review process, \nwhich then becomes more expensive and time-consuming as transportation \nand resource officials try to reconcile infrastructure and conservation \nactivities.\n  These provisions will help transportation planners in avoiding \nunnecessary impacts on wildlife habitat and in mitigating for \nunavoidable impacts of a project.\n  These provisions encourage States to utilize available wildlife \nhabitat data and maps to inform the long range transportation planning \nprocess. Planners would be able to identify potential concerns at the \nearliest stage of planning, when options for minimizing impacts are \ngreatest and costs of doing so are lowest.\n  Over 200 Americans die each year in wildlife-vehicle collisions, many \nmore are injured and more than 1 million animals are killed on our \nroadways everyday.\n  State and Federal agencies spend considerable time and money both \nprotecting natural areas and building transportation infrastructure. \nUnfortunately, conservation and growth efforts often happen \nindependently and then come into conflict during the permitting and \nconstruction phases of a transportation project. These investments need \nto be coordinated. If conservation efforts are taken into account at \nthe earliest stages of transportation planning, both priorities can be \nrealized, in less time and at less cost.\n  The most significant threat to the biodiversity of this country is \nhabitat loss. However, thoughtful, forward-looking transportation \nplanning can go a long way towards reducing negative impacts and \nmitigating for unavoidable impacts.\n  Over the next few decades, the decisions we make regarding highways \nand the ensuring loss of habitat will determine the fate of species and \nAmerica's biodiversity. These provisions are aimed at helping to \npreserve that biodiversity through coordinated planning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I congratulate the managers for their hard \nwork and efforts. Following the vote, there will be no further votes \nuntil after the Presidents Day recess. Therefore, the next vote will \noccur on Tuesday, February 24. I will have more to say on the schedule \nbefore we close this evening. I do thank all Members for their \ncooperation over the last 2 weeks.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to make this very brief, but I \ndo want to make a comment. This bill that we passed is a good bill. We \nheard all kinds of criticism. It is always difficult when you are \ndealing with formulas, but this is the first time in the history of \nthis process that we have done it without going into something such as \na minimum guarantee program that is purely political. I would like to \nhave had all the States get up to 95 percent sooner. We just could not \nmake it happen.\n  We have a safety portion of this bill that we never had before. We \nhave environmental streamlining. I would have liked to have gone a lot \nfurther on that issue. Hopefully, we will be able to do it. Maybe we \ncan do some good in conference. Nonetheless, we will get a lot more \nmiles, literally, for the dollar than we ever have before.\n  I thank, one more time, Senator Reid, Senator Jeffords, and Senator \nBond. We worked very closely together. This certainly was not a \npartisan effort.\n  I thank our staffs, too. I am going to name my staff: staff director, \nAndy Wheeler; Ruth Van Mark; Marty Hall; James O'Keeffe; Nathan \nRichmond; Greg Murrill; Mitch Surrett; Laura Berry; Genevieve Erny; \nFrank Fannon, Angie Giancarlo; Loyed Gill; Ryan Jackson; Michele \nNellenbach; John Shanahan; Jonathan Tolman; Brydon Ross; and Cori \nLucero.\n  I say this very sincerely. I know it sounds mundane, but the public \nshould know the hours people work up here on something like this. I am \ntalking about all night long, several nights, and I just applaud them \nfor doing it. I know other staff and Members have worked equally hard, \nso let me thank all of them for their dedication and the effort. I \nthink we made history in terms of the length of time in which we were \nable to get a bill of this magnitude passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first I want to commend my good friend \nfrom Oklahoma for all of the effort he put into this bill. I know, \nhaving been in the position of being the chairman at one time, the \nincredible effort that goes into the production of a bill of this size. \nI know what his staff did, and I will give my commendation to the staff \nas well.\n  I emphasize also the importance to the Nation. This is a jobs bill. \nIn fact, there is no other jobs bill that will do so much for different \nworkers of this Nation. Everyone benefits. Those who are in the \nmanufacturing area of all the tools and equipment that are necessary to \nprovide the work all benefit by the tremendous effort that goes into \nimproving roads throughout this Nation. Also, there is a tremendous \neffort put into it which requires machinery. Therefore, the companies \nthat make the machinery benefit with increased production, increased \nutilization of workers, right on down through to the people who do the \nminimal things which are also so very important.\n  As far as the staffs goes, I would like to thank the staff of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, on both sides of the aisle, for \ntheir efforts.\n  From my staff, I thank Ken Connolly, Ed Barron, Jeff Squires, Erik \nSteavens, Liz Ryan, Alison Taylor, and Carolyn Dupree; Catharine \nRansom, Jo-Ellen Darcy, and J.C. Sandberg with Senator Reid's staff. \nChairman Inhofe's staff, I would like to acknowledge and recognize Andy \nWheeler, Ruth Van Mark, Marty Hall and James O'Keefe; from Senator \nBond's staff, Ellen Stein and Trevor Blackann.\n  These staffers have made tremendous sacrifices, working long hours \nand many days, to bring about the fruition of this bill. We are all \nproud of it, and the country is going to be proud of it. The more they \nsee of it, the more they will like it, and the more people will benefit \nfrom having better jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join in the commendations particularly to \nChairman Inhofe of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and the \nranking member, Senator Jeffords, and my cohort on the Transportation \nSubcommittee, Senator Reid, who also had the double pleasure of being \nthe floor manager and probably deserves a day off before he sees his \nnew granddaughter.\n  I join also in thanking all of the staff, and I will submit their \nnames for the Record. I want my colleagues to know I had a tremendous \nstaff working with me, Trevor Blackann, Ellen Stein, Heideh Shahmoradi, \nKent Van Landuyt, and John Stoody. It was a major effort. I think we \nhave crafted a good bill. This was a group effort. I thank each for \ntheir very hard work and dedication.\n  Senator Inhofe's staff: Ruth Van Mark, James O'Keefe, Gregory \nMurrill, Andy Wheeler, Nathan Richmond, Mitch Surrett, Angie Giancarlo, \nMarty Hall, Michelle Nellenbach, Laura Berry, Brydon Ross, Cori Lucero, \nand John Shananhan.\n  Senator Jeffords' and Senator Reid's staff: Ed Barron, J.C. Sandberg, \nJeff Squires, Erik Steavens, Elizabeth Ryan, Ken Connolly, Jo-Ellen \nDarcy, Chris Miller, and Alison Taylor.\n  There are many provisions in this bill that make me proud to have \nbeen a part of drafting SAFETEA. Some of which include:\n  Safety. For the first time in our recent transportation legislation \nhistory, safety is given a prominent position, being elevated to a core \nprogram. We have accomplished this by providing much needed funding to \nreduce highway injuries and fatalities. I am pleased to say we have \naccomplished this without the use of mandates.\n  We have heard numerous testimony from the administration that nearly \n43,000 people were killed on our roads and highways last year. I am \nglad that the bill reflects the continued commitment to making not only \ninvestments in our infrastructure, but also to the general safety and \nwelfare of our constituents.\n  Equity. Our bill moves to carefully balance the needs of the donor \nStates while also recognizing the needs of donee States. While many \npeople did not think it was possible to achieve, all donor States will \nreceive a 95 cent rate of return at least by 2009. I am anxious to \nreturn to my home State of Missouri and report that we will now receive \n95 cents back on every dollar, each year of this Act.\n  Like many of the donor States, Missouri has some of the worst roads \nin the Nation and the second worst bridges in the Nation. This bill \nwill allow Missouri, as well as the other States, to address many of \nthe Nation's major transportation infrastructure needs.\n  Furthermore, I am proud to announce that all States will grow at not \nless than 10 percent over TEA-21.\n  I am very pleased to report that this bill follows the Bond/Reid \namendment by providing a 31 percent increase in funding over TEA-21.\n  This bill also addresses several environmental issues by providing \nthe necessary tools to reduce or eliminate unnecessary delays during \nthe environmental review stage. Projects more sensitive to \nenvironmental concerns will move through a more structured \nenvironmental review process more efficiently and with fewer delays.\n  And most importantly, our comprehensive 6-year bill at $255 billion \nwill sustain over 2 million new jobs. These funds will support the \nmuch-needed jobs and economic stimulus that our nation currently needs.\n  In closing, I want to again thank my colleagues, Senators Inhofe, \nJeffords, and Reid for their leadership and support in moving this \nvital piece of legislation that is focused on the needs of our Nation's \ntransportation system. I also want to thank the other Members of the \nSenate for their overwhelming bipartisan support and helping move this \nbill forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia wishes to speak. We have spoken on the floor at \nsome length over the last 2 weeks about the cooperation that bound the \nfour of us together. It really has been one where we have grown closer \nas friends and Senators.\n  We have a lot more work to do on this bill. I want to again express \nmy appreciation to the Senator from Oklahoma. We have both served in \nthe House. We have been in the Senate for a long time. During the past \nyear, I have gotten to know the distinguished junior Senator from \nOklahoma and\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\nhave developed a great deal of respect I did not have. The reason is \nthat even though there are only 100 of us, on most occasions we do not \nwork on a very close basis. We come through and vote, have committee \nhearings, and hear each other talk, but here we had no alternative but \nto sit down in the trenches and try to work out tremendous differences \nthat we began with. We were able to do that.\n  Legislation is the art of compromise. Had Senator Inhofe stuck to his \nguns and I stuck to my guns, we would not have a bill. That is nothing \nbad. That is what legislation is all about, consensus building. I \ndeeply appreciate the ability I have had to get to know my friend from \nOklahoma much better.\n  I express my appreciation, of course, to my counterpart on the \nsubcommittee, Senator Bond. I appreciate his good work. They both have \nexcellent staffs. I have gotten to know them also.\n  Of course, Senator Jeffords and I, everyone knows of our close and \nlongstanding relationship and how much we care about each other. I \nappreciate very much his work on this bill and his allowing me a little \nbit of freedom on a bill that normally but for the closeness of our \nrelationship would not have occurred.\n  The other Senators have spoken about their staffs and how much they \nappreciate them and that they would submit the names for the Record and \nthey ran off a lot of names. I have one staff person. No one knows this \nbill better than he does. No one knows the numbers better than he does. \nI am so well served by J.C. Sandberg. I appreciate so much the tireless \nefforts on his behalf. He was up until 3 in the morning this morning, \nlast night, and many nights during the past 6 months. He has worked \nvery long hours. I wish I could rattle off the names of lots of other \npeople who worked with me on this bill, but the only person who did \ngreat work on my staff was J.C. Sandberg, which was exemplary. Not only \nhas he rendered great service to me and the people of the State of \nNevada, but I believe this entire country.\n  Also, my legislative director, Lisa Moore, has done good work. She \nhas been around all the time helping J.C. and helping me, and I want \nher to know how much I appreciate her good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1267-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nfix a problem some of my colleagues have experienced in serving their \nconstituents. Immigration case work is one of the top issues my State \noffices handle on a regular basis. Occasionally, people who are in the \ncountry legally and playing by the rules can slip through the cracks as \nthey wait on the immigration process to run its course. With the \nmassive caseload handled by Immigration Services, there are bound to be \nmistakes and this legislation allows the agency to remedy those \nmistakes in the limited situation of the Diversity Visa Program.\n  The case of an Atlanta couple, Charles Nyaga and his wife Doin, \nrecently came to my attention. Charles Nyaga, a native of Kenya, came \nto the United States with his family as a student in 1996. He is \ncurrently pursuing a master's degree in divinity.\n  In 1997, he applied for the fiscal year 1998 Diversity Visa Program \nand the Immigration and Naturalization Service selected him. In \naccordance with the diversity visa requirements, Nyaga and his wife \nsubmitted an application and a fee to adjust their status to legal \npermanent resident. A cover letter on the diversity visa application \ninstructed Mr. Nyaga as follows:\n\n       While your application is pending before the interview, \n     please do not make inquiry as to the status of your case, \n     since it will result in further delay.\n\n  During the 8 months the INS had to review his application, Mr. Nyaga \naccordingly abided by what the INS told him to do and never made any \ninquiry. He unfortunately never heard back. His valid application \nsimply slipped through the cracks because at the end of the fiscal year \nMr. Nyaga's application expired, although a sufficient number of \ndiversity visas remained available.\n  Mr. Nyaga and his wife took their case all the way to the Eleventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals. In a decision last year, the court found that \nthe INS lacks the authority to act on Mr. Nyaga's application after the \nend of the fiscal year, regardless of how meritorious his case is. The \ncourt even went so far as to note that a private relief bill is the \nremedy for Mr. Nyaga in order to overcome the statutory barrier that \nprohibits the INS from reviewing the case in a prior fiscal year. The \nU.S. Supreme Court recently refused to take up the case.\n  My legislation would overcome this statutory hurdle for Charles \nNyaga, his wife, and others who are similarly situated. The legislation \nwould give the Department of Homeland Security the opportunity to \nreopen cases from previous fiscal years in order to complete their \nprocessing. The bill would still give the Department of Homeland \nSecurity the discretion to conduct background checks and weigh any \nsecurity concern before adjusting an applicant's status.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and with homeland \nsecurity officials to pass this legislation this year. We must provide \nrelief in these cases. I believe this targeted legislation strikes the \nproper balance to provide thorough processing of diversity visa \napplications while not compromising the Department's national security \nmission.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce an \nimportant piece of legislation called the Guard and Reserve Enhanced \nBenefits Act of 2004. This bill is at the desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add the following cosponsors: Senator \nLeahy and Senator Reid of Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray pertaining to the introduction of S. 2068 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, I rise today to recall one of the most \ntragic events in the history of the State of Rhode Island. It was \nalmost 1 year ago, on February 20, 2003, that a devastating fire \ndestroyed the Station nightclub in West Warwick, RI, killing 100 people \nand injuring nearly 300 more. The impact of this horrific incident on \nour small State is beyond measure, as most Rhode Islanders either \nsuffered a direct loss, or knew someone who died or was injured in this \nblaze.\n  The first anniversary of the fire will bring back painful memories \nfor many in our community. I want to express my heartfelt condolences \nto the families of those who perished and to let them know that our \nthoughts and prayers remain with them and with the survivors who \ncontinue to struggle with the physical and mental toll of this horrible \nevent.\n  Looking back on the West Warwick fire and its aftermath also reminds \nus that it brought out the best in our people. In the first minutes and \nhours of this tragedy, our firefighters, police, and emergency medical \npersonnel performed heroically under terrifying circumstances, as did \nmany of the patrons who were at the scene and helped to save others. \nNearby small businesses like the Cowesett Inn restaurant were turned \ninto triage centers, and first responders from throughout southern New \nEngland descended upon West Warwick to do whatever they could to help.\n  I visited victims at all of our hospitals and in Boston as well. I \nwas inspired by their courage and the extraordinary skill and \ncompassion of countless doctors, nurses and health professionals.\n  As our Nation continues to fight the war on terror, the response to \nthe West Warwick fire provides a good illustration of the progress we \nhave made--and\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\nhow far we have to go--in improving our emergency management \ncapabilities. As the magnitude of the tragedy became known, the Rhode \nIsland Emergency Management Agency and hospitals throughout southern \nNew England activated emergency incident command systems, many of which \nwere designed after September 11, 2001. The process of rescuing and \ntreating victims, putting out the blaze, identifying bodies, accounting \nfor the missing, providing crisis counseling for survivors put a \ntremendous strain on State and local agencies.\n  I have no doubt that Rhode Island's post-September 11 emergency \nmanagement planning efforts, backed by Federal assistance programs \nthrough the new Department of Homeland Security, made a difference in \nresponding to the West Warwick fire.\n  In the past year, Rhode Island's ability to respond to mass casualty \nevents has been further improved with the help of Federal programs such \nas the State Homeland Security Grant Program, the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program, Interoperable Communications grants, and \nthe Department of Health and Human Services' bioterror response grants \nto hospitals. All told, Congress has provided more than $75 million to \nRhode Island over the past 3 years for emergency management and \nterrorism prevention and response. Yet we continue to face tremendous \nchallenges, and we need to do more.\n  I want to say a special word of thanks to my colleagues Senator Gregg \nand Senator Hollings for their strong support in securing funding \nthrough the Department of Justice to reimburse State and local law \nenforcement agencies in Rhode Island for extraordinary expenses related \nto the fire.\n  The Station nightclub fire was a catastrophe. Fault will be appointed \nin the days ahead by the civil and criminal courts, but Rhode Island is \nalready taking steps to ensure that a tragedy like this never happens \nagain. The Rhode Island General Assembly passed the Comprehensive Fire \nSafety Act of 2003 to repeal the ``grandfather'' exemption from modern \nfire codes and require more sprinklers in places of public assembly, \nespecially nightclubs. The law also bans pyrotechnics in most indoor \nvenues and gives greater power to fire inspectors. The State fire \nmarshal now faces the task of training the State's fire inspectors and \nmeeting with businesses and institutions to explain how the code \napplied to individual buildings.\n  As State and local officials across the country reexamine their fire \nand building codes and step up enforcement of safety practices in \npublic buildings. Congress should do everything it can to support this \neffort and to encourage both State and local governments and Federal \nagencies to adopt and strictly enforce the most current fire and \nbuilding consensus codes. I was also proud to join my colleague Senator \nHollings in introducing the American Home Fire Safety Act--S. 1798--to \nrequire the Consumer Product Safety Commission to implement \ncomprehensive fire safety standards for upholstered furniture, \nmattresses, bedclothing, and candles.\n  No one in Rhode Island will forget the tragic events of February 20, \n2003, and I hope we will never forget the way Rhode Islanders came \ntogether in that dark hour to do whatever was needed to save lives and \nrelieve the suffering of the victims. That generous spirit has \ncontinued. Over the past year, Rhode Islanders and Americans across the \ncountry have donated more than $3 million to the Station Nightclub Fire \nRelief Fund to help families affected by the tragedy, including \nchildren who lost parents in the fire.\n  We often hear that it is in times of crisis that a person's true \nnature is revealed. That standard applies to communities as well, and \nas we approach a painful anniversary that will again focus the world's \nattention on the sorrow and grief felt by so many Rhode Islanders, I \nbelieve the people of our State have much to be proud of for the way \nthey responded to this tragedy. It is now our duty to do all that we \ncan to make sure that no community ever again faces a catastrophe like \nthis one.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1268-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1268-S1269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INDIAN BUDGET ISSUES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 2 days ago I talked about the need to \nfind a way to ensure that every American has access to health insurance \nand high-quality health care--and to counter the defeatism of some who \nsuggest it isn't possible. As I said, the United States is the only \nindustrialized country that has failed to achieve this goal. It is \npossible. It is a matter of political will, and we must show that we, \nas a Nation, have it.\n  Today I want to talk a little about a group of people who are counted \namong the insured in this country--Native Americans. They are counted \namong the insured, but the Government has failed utterly to deliver \neven basic health care to the vast majority of them.\n  Through treaty and statute, the Federal Government has promised \nhealth care to all Native Americans through the Indian Health Service. \nIn fact, the Federal Government provides less than half what it would \ncost to provide basic clinical services to the current IHS user \npopulation.\n  Incredibly, the Federal Government spends twice as much per capita on \nmedical treatment for Federal prisoners than it spends on treatment for \nNative Americans. Twice as much on Federal prisoners as Native American \nchildren.\n  Last year, and the year before that, I offered amendments to the \nbudget resolution to make up the difference. During consideration of \nlast year's budget resolution, we were two votes short of passing our \namendment to add $2.9 billion in funding for IHS clinical services.\n  Every Democratic Senator voted for the funding; every Republican \nSenator voted against it. Republican leaders then offered an amendment \nto provide one-tenth of those funds--$290 million to the IHS. As meager \nas that increase was, it was welcome. Unfortunately, that amendment \nnever made it through the conference with the House. Furthermore, when \nthe Interior Appropriations bill was considered, the Republican support \nfor that $290 million--their own proposal--had dried up.\n  This year, the President's budget does no better. The President's \nbudget includes a $7 million increase for IHS clinical services--less \nthan the cost of inflation, and about $3.4 billion short of what is \nneeded to meet Native Americans' basic health care needs.\n  I have spoken many times on this floor about the ``life or limb'' \ntest at the Indian Health Service. When funding is low--and that is \npretty much all the time--treatment is rationed using the ``life or \nlimb'' test.\n  If a Native American patient isn't at immediate risk of losing his or \nher life or a limb, then he or she is turned away. Of course, denying \nearly treatment often leads to a worsening condition. Sometimes by the \ntime their condition is bad enough to meet the ``life or limb'' test, \nthe funding is simply gone.\n  People are suffering preventable long-term health effects, and even \ndying, because we--the U.S. Government--are failing to meet our \nresponsibilities. Sometimes we grow numb to these realities.\n  We do not want to face them. We hear ``life and limb test'' and \nsimply don't believe it. But this is the reality in Indian country. We \nhave the power to fix it.\n  The Indian health care budget and the overall budget for Indian \ncountry were the subjects of discussion in several meetings I have had \nthis week. Tuesday afternoon I met with, among others, John Yellow Bird \nSteele, president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.\n  President Steele talked about what an affront to Indian country \nPresident Bush's fiscal year 2005 budget is. Inadequate funding for \nIndian health. Inadequate funding for Indian education. Inadequate \nfunding for law enforcement. Inadequate for housing. There is only one \narea of the budget that was increased--the Department of the Interior's \nproposed reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office \nof the Special Trustee that will oversee\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\nthe Interior Department trust reform efforts.\n  This reorganization plan was given a 50 percent increase in the \nPresident's budget. One who hasn't heard much about the trust reform \nissue might think that should be welcome news. But the truth is that \nIndian tribes and trust account holders strongly oppose the \nreorganization plan. This plan has been pursued without proper \nconsultation with Indian tribes and over the vehement objections of \nIndian tribes.\n  So this administration has dedicated wholly inadequate resources to \nIndian country and, in distributing those scarce resources, has devoted \nits only increase to a proposal that Indian people vehemently oppose. \nIn the process, the administration has ignored the needs of Indian \nhealth, education, law enforcement, and every other major priority \nfacing Indian tribes and Indian people.\n  Again, Indian country needs are not theoretical. They are real, \neveryday needs.\n  Tuesday President Steele and other representatives of the Oglala \nLakota people talked to me about a few of them. They reminded me that \nPine Ridge has four judges and two prosecutors to serve the entire \nreservation. BIA law enforcement funds cover the salaries of those two \nprosecutors for only 6 months of the year. Because the tribe's general \nfund is limited, it cannot make up the entire difference. This year, \nthe prosecutors volunteered their time for 3 months of the year.\n  Pine Ridge has 2 troopers to cover its 1,800 miles of roads. When \nthere is a car accident on one of those roads, more often than not, the \ntroopers will not be able to respond. There are more unattended crashes \non Pine Ridge than attended crashes. On Pine Ridge, the ``first \nresponders'' are often the next people who happen to drive by.\n  Waste water systems are inadequate--some underground pipes date back \nto the 1800s. Housing is inadequate--some homes have no electricity or \nrunning water. As Cora Whiting, a tribal council member, said to me, \n``How many people in America are still living that way?''\n\n  Pine Ridge has an unemployment rate of 85 percent. Tribal leaders \nlike President Steele and Cora Whiting know that the only way to \nimprove that statistic is to bring economic development to the \nreservation. But it is impossible to attract businesses without the \ninfrastructure necessary to support them. And we have a duty to help \nbuild it.\n  Yesterday I met with Chairman Harold Frazier of the Cheyenne River \nSioux Tribe. We discussed many of these same issues. We talked about \ntheir unmet needs, and their story is all too close to that of Pine \nRidge.\n  Their tribal court system is a perfect example. The Bureau of Indian \nAffairs' tribal priority allocations fund the Cheyenne River Tribal \nCourt. This year, their funding is about $300,000 short of what they \nrequire to deliver the bare minimum of services. In essence, they have \nenough funds to pay salaries and benefits for an inadequate number of \nstaff. They can pay for nothing else--no attorney fees, no supplies, no \njuror fees, nothing.\n  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe also faces some of the same \ninfrastructure problems that the Oglalas and so many other tribes face. \nWater systems cannot maintain water pressure or support building \nupgrades that are essential to the provision of basic tribal services. \nAnd, of course, Chairman Frazier and I also talked at length about \nhealth care and the system that has failed them.\n  People tend to think of budgets as intellectual exercises--something \nthat isn't binding or real. Even when we say we have balanced the \nbudget--something we actually did in the 1990s--people tend not to \nbelieve it. And now that the failed fiscal policy of the last few years \nhas turned projected surpluses into massive deficits, our credibility \nis even lower.\n  But budgets are not just numbers. They reflect choices about our \npriorities and our political will. They have real consequences for real \npeople.\n  For several years, I have watched this administration and its allies \ndefend tax cuts for the wealthy while they claim we ``can't afford'' to \nfund the Indian Health Service. We have borrowed money--from Social \nSecurity and other countries--to finance those tax cuts, but we have \ndenied Indian children the health care that federal prisoners take for \ngranted.\n  The fact that we choose to afford huge tax cuts for the wealthiest \namong us, or the construction of hospitals in Iraq, but choose not to \nafford health care or education or housing for Indian families is lost \non no one in Indian country.\n  This budget isn't Indian country budget. It isn't America's budget. \nIt is time to make our budget reflect America's true priorities, which \nare fair opportunities for every child in America, for their parents \nwho work so hard to create a better life for them, and for their \ngrandparents who deserve to retire with dignity.\n  That is the budget I'm going to be talking about and fighting for as \nthis year unfolds.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1269-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1269-S1271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VETERAN PATRIOT MAX CLELAND\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to respond to a scurrilous attack \nagainst the patriotism of a friend and former colleague, Max Cleland. \nIn a townhall.com column by Ann Coulter, which is described as a \nconservative news and information Web site, scurrilous, unprincipled \nattacks have been leveled against a patriot, a warrior, and a friend. I \nwant to put my response in context.\n  I had the privilege of serving in the U.S. Army for 12 years on \nactive duty. I did some challenging things there: qualified as an Army \nRanger, paratrooper, commanded a company in the 82nd Airborne Division \nof paratroopers. But I am not a combat veteran. I did not serve in a \ncombat zone. Max Cleland, and many, many others, did. There is a \ndifference between those who wear the uniform of the United States and \nthose who served in a combat situation, particularly a situation such \nas Vietnam.\n  The difference is that in that situation, more than any others, you \nlive constantly with a sense of your own mortality. At any moment, \nthrough any fire or mishap, you could die or be seriously injured. At \nany moment, you could see people, your fellow soldiers, die from \ninjuries. And for officers such as Max Cleland there is a special \nburden that goes along with leadership--not just officers but also \nnoncommissioned officers. You have to make tough decisions that some \nday could result in the death or injury of another. That is a very \nspecial type of service that is inherent in being in a combat zone.\n  Max Cleland served with distinction. The article that Miss Coulter \nwrote mocks his service, mocks his sacrifice, and, in doing so, mocks \nthe service and sacrifice of thousands and thousands of Americans in \nthe past and today across the globe.\n  For example, this is how she describes Max in some respects. In her \nwords:\n\n       Moreover, if we're going to start delving into exactly who \n     did what back then, maybe Max Cleland should stop allowing \n     Democrats to portray him as a war hero who lost his limbs \n     taking enemy fire on the battlefields of Vietnam.\n\n  Let's get one thing straight right now: Max Cleland is an American \nhero.\n  Let me read from the citation he received for the Silver Star, \nobtained from Senator Miller's Web site.\n\n       Captain Cleland distinguished himself by exceptionally \n     valorous action on 4 April, 1968 . . . during enemy attack \n     near Khe Sanh.\n       When the battalion command post came under a heavy enemy \n     rocket and mortar attack, Captain Cleland, disregarding his \n     own safety, exposed himself to the rocket barrage as he left \n     his covered position to administer first aid to his wounded \n     comrades. He then assisted in moving the injured personnel to \n     covered positions.\n       Continuing to expose himself, Captain Cleland organized his \n     men into a work party to repair the battalion communications \n     equipment, which had been damaged by enemy fire.\n       His gallant action is in keeping with the highest \n     traditions of the military service, and reflects great credit \n     upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\n  Max Cleland is a hero. No one has to portray him as one; he is one.\n\n[[Page S1270]]\n\n  With respect to how he lost his limbs, this goes on to say:\n\n       Cleland lost three limbs in an accident during a routine \n     noncombat mission where he was about to drink beer with \n     friends. He saw a grenade on the ground and picked it up. He \n     could have done that at Fort Dix. In fact, Cleland could have \n     dropped a grenade on his foot as a National Guardsman--or \n     what Cleland sneeringly calls ``weekend warriors.'' Luckily \n     for Cleland's political career and current pomposity about \n     Bush, he happened to do it while in Vietnam.\n\n  Yeah, Max was really lucky to be in Vietnam--really lucky.\n  This is what happened. In Max's book:\n\n       My tour of duty in Vietnam was now almost over. In another \n     month I'd be going home. I smiled, thinking of the good times \n     waiting stateside.\n       ``Oh, Captain Cleland.''\n       I looked around. It was Major Cralle who had come up to our \n     position. ``The battalion needs a better radio hookup with \n     the vision supply area,'' he said. ``I'd like you to send a \n     radio relay team back there to improve communications.''\n       That meant setting up a radio relay station on a hill back \n     at the division forward assembly area 15 miles to the east. \n     Instead of sending a team alone, I decided to go with them to \n     ensure they got set up properly.\n       It is what is called leadership, sacrifice, being willing \n     to do yourself what you ask subordinates to do. That is not \n     routine anytime. This was a combat mission in a combat area.\n       With two men, I pulled together some antennas and a \n     generator and some radios and loaded them on a chopper. The \n     three of us climbed in and the helicopter lifted off. Within \n     minutes, we had settled down by the radio relay station. The \n     men and equipment were unloaded, and I climbed back into the \n     chopper intending to go down to battalion rear headquarters.\n       Then two ideas crossed my mind. First, it would be better \n     to work personally with my team in setting up the radio \n     relay. Second, I had a lot of friends at this relay station \n     and now was a good time to have a cold beer with them.\n\n  First: I want my men to do the job. I am going to be there with them. \nBy the way, I have comrades that I have served with and, you know, if I \nhave a chance to be with them, and, oh, by the way--in his \ncharacteristic honesty--have a beer with them, I was going to do that.\n\n       I called to the pilot that I was getting out. He nodded and \n     held the ship steady. I jumped to the ground, ran in a crouch \n     until I got clear of the spinning helicopter blades, turned \n     around and watched the chopper lift.\n       Then I saw the grenade. It was where the chopper had lifted \n     off.\n       It must be mine, I thought. Grenades had fallen off my web \n     gear before. Shifting the M-16----\n\n  Let me stop. I assume if he is carrying grenades and an M-16 this was \nnot a recreational activity.\n\n       Shifting the M-16 to my left hand and holding it behind me, \n     I bent down to pick up the grenade.\n       A blinding explosion threw me backwards.\n       The blast jammed my eyeballs back into my skull, \n     temporarily blinding me, pinning my cheeks and jaw muscles to \n     the bones of my face. My ears rang with a deafening \n     reverberation as if I were standing in an echo chamber.\n       Memory of the firecracker exploding in my hand as a child \n     flashed before me.\n       When my eyes cleared I looked at my right hand. It was \n     gone.\n\n  I could go on, but I think that speaks volumes. Max thought, frankly, \nthat it was his grenade. But regardless of whose grenade it was, I was \nalways taught, as a leader, that if there was a grenade, a live \ngrenade, somebody has to take care of it.\n  Now, maybe Miss Coulter would have simply said: Sergeant, go get that \ngrenade--or maybe just turned around and run further away, leaving a \nlive grenade, with a pin or without a pin, in the middle of a landing \nzone.\n  Max did what a good soldier does. We used to say at West Point: A \ngood soldier marches to the sound of guns. And that is what he did when \nhe picked up the grenade. He was horribly wounded. Everything was \nbroken except his spirit.\n  But the fear that it was his grenade, that it was a dumb accident, \nwas allayed years later. This is an article in Esquire magazine:\n\n       He lives with the fact that he asked for it. He was in \n     college during Vietnam and left to join the Army because he'd \n     always gone toward the action.\n\n  ``March to the sound of the guns.''\n\n       He became the aide to a general stateside and fought to get \n     shipped to 'Nam.\n\n  He fought to go to Vietnam.\n\n       Once in country, he was an army captain and saw little \n     combat and fought to be sent into Khe Sanh.\n\n  Closer to the action--\n\n       And when Khe Sanh was over and they were mopping up, he \n     almost bought the farm.\n       For thirty-one years, he figured it was his fault. Before \n     he jumped out of the chopper, he'd checked his grenades to \n     make sure the pins that activated them were bent and could \n     not accidently fall out. Straight pins can get you killed. \n     The next thing he knew, he was on the ground and saw a \n     grenade beneath him. And then for thirty-one years he heard \n     that explosion and thought, ``I've blown myself up with my \n     own grenade.'' He got decorations but would have none of \n     them, because to Max Cleland they sure . . . didn't cover a \n     man who blows himself up. Then, this spring--\n\n  This was August 1999--\n\n       He was on a television show and told his story about that \n     day at Khe Sanh, and later a guy called up and said, Hey, I \n     was there, it wasn't your grenade, I saw it. And Cleland \n     checked the caller out, and it seems the guy really was \n     there. And this year--\n\n  In 1999--\n\n       Max celebrated Being Alive Day with him down in Georgia.\n\n  This is not an accurate portrayal of the service and sacrifice of Max \nCleland. It is unprincipled and scurrilous. It defames him, and it \ndefames people who wear the uniform of the United States.\n\n  She is not through yet:\n\n       Cleland wore the uniform, he was in Vietnam, and he has \n     shown courage by going on to lead a productive life. But he \n     didn't ``give his limbs for his country,'' or leave them ``on \n     the battlefield.'' There was no bravery involved in dropping \n     a grenade on himself with no enemy troops in sight. That \n     could have happened in the Texas National Guard----\n\n  There is plenty of bravery there, the bravery of leading men in \ndifficult circumstances, in the sight of the enemy or out of the sight \nof the enemy. It was the bravery of understanding instinctively that \nyou could not leave a live grenade rolling around in a landing zone. It \nwas the bravery of being willing to be with his men even though he \ncould have easily dropped them off, waved from the helicopter, and \nflown off to a happy life, 1 month before his return to the United \nStates.\n  It disturbs me about Max, but Max is quite a man. But this also \ndisturbs me about--what does it say about our soldiers today in Iraq, \nabout the soldiers I visited, National Guardsmen and regular soldiers, \nat Walter Reed, who were injured, critically injured, in vehicle \naccidents and other mishaps that are part of a combat operation?\n  They did not sacrifice their limbs and their spines for our country? \nIs that what she is saying? Is that what we are going to say when we \npat them on the back and say thanks for your service? There are no \nexcuses for this kind of unprincipled attack on an individual, \nunsubstantiated by the record, an attack, as I say again and again, not \nonly denigrates Max Cleland, it denigrates everyone who wore the \nuniform of the United States and wears it today. It denigrates \nparticularly those individuals--and I must again emphatically say, I \ndid not serve in combat--but those individuals who today serve in a \ncombat area, who wake up every morning thinking it may be their last \nmoment, who wake up every morning thinking that they may have to order \npeople to do things that will cost them their lives.\n  It is an experience that I have not known, very few people in this \nChamber have known. It is the mark of true heroism and courage, and day \nin and day out men like Max Cleland do it. And to suggest that he is \nnot a hero, to suggest that his sacrifice was some type of stunt gone \nbad, some type of foolishness is beneath contempt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island for his powerful words and for sharing his insights with \nus on this extraordinary demonstration of verbal violence. He has laid \nout the record very well.\n  I am appalled that anybody could say the things that the Senator from \nRhode Island has now reported having been said by Miss Coulter. I thank \nhim for setting the record straight.\n  I would take it one step further. I think Miss Coulter owes Max \nCleland an apology, and every other veteran in this country an apology. \nFor anyone to say that somebody could possibly be lucky to experience \nthe explosion of a grenade in Vietnam, that somehow that is lucky, just \ndefies all common\n\n[[Page S1271]]\n\nsense, all decency, any appreciation for the magnitude of the sacrifice \ngiven by any veteran under any circumstances.\n  She ought to apologize. She ought to be ashamed. How low does \npolitical discourse in this country have to go before somebody says \n``enough''? How could you possibly say things like this for political \ngain, recognizing that this isn't just an affront to one soldier but to \nall soldiers? To minimize sacrifice, and to minimize the extraordinary \ncircumstances of one's life as a result of that sacrifice, is just \ninexplicable.\n  I am grateful to the Senator from Rhode Island for his passion, his \nwords, and for the effort he has made tonight to set the record \nstraight.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1271-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ENERGY PACKAGE CONSIDERATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to let colleagues \nknown what the Democratic leader and I have discussed with respect to \nconsideration of an energy package.\n  The Chairman of the Energy Committee has been working hard, along \nwith others, to put together a slimmed-down energy package that \naddresses some of the concerns that members of the Senate had with the \nconference report last fall. While there was some interest in \naddressing energy amendments on the highway bill, the Democratic Leader \nand I agreed that we will instead consider energy separately from \nhighways.\n  Under this agreement, I will Rule 14 an energy package and put it \nbefore the Senate in an expeditious way. We will consider it as quickly \nas possible, in a constrained manner, with as few amendments as \npossible. Senator Daschle and I will seek to get an agreement to limit \namendments, but if that is not possible, we understand that it my be \nnecessary to file cloture to move the process along. The goal would not \nbe to preclude any Member's right to offer an amendment, but to ensure \nthat the Senate has an opportunity to decide: do we want to consider a \nslimmed-down energy package, or not?\n  So, for the information of colleagues, that is how Senator Daschle \nand I have agreed to handle energy issues in the immediate future. I \nwould now yield to the Democratic leader for his comments.\n  Mr. President, this is indeed how the Majority Leader and I have \nagreed to proceed with respect to the consideration of an energy \npackage.\n  I believe this is the most appropriate way to proceed, and I \nappreciate working with the Majority Leader to reach this \nunderstanding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1271-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1271-S1272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE DEFICIT OF DECENCY\n\n  Mr. MILLER. The Old Testament prophet, Amos, was a sheep herder who \nlived back in the Judean hills, away from the larger cities of \nBethlehem and Jerusalem. Compared to the intellectual urbanites like \nIsaiah and Jeremiah, Amos was just an unsophisticated country hick. But \nAmos had a unique grasp of political and social issues, and his poetic \nliterary skill was among the best of all the prophets.\n  That familiar quote of Martin Luther King, Jr.:\n\n       Justice will rush down like waters and righteousness like a \n     mighty stream. . . .\n\n  Those are Amos's words.\n  Amos was the first to propose the concept of a universal God and not \njust some tribal deity. He also wrote that God demanded moral purity, \nnot rituals and sacrifices.\n  This blunt-speaking moral conscience of his time warns, in Chapter 8, \nverse 11 of the Book of Amos, as if he were speaking to us today:\n\n       The days will come, sayeth the Lord God, that I will send a \n     famine in the land. Not a famine of bread or of thirst for \n     water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.\n       And they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north \n     even to the east. They shall run to and fro to seek the word \n     of the Lord, and shall not find it.\n\n  ``A famine in the land,'' has anyone more accurately described the \nsituation we face in America today? A famine of ``hearing the word of \nthe Lord.'' Some will say Amos was just an Old Testament prophet who \nlived 700 years before Christ.\n  That is true. So how about one of the most influential historians of \nmodern times, Arnold Toynbee, who wrote the acclaimed 12-volume ``A \nStudy of History.'' He once declared:\n\n       Of the 22 civilizations that have appeared in history, 19 \n     of them have collapsed when they reached the moral state \n     America is in today.\n\n  Toynbee died in 1975, before seeing the worst that was yet to come. \nYes, Arnold Toynbee saw the famine, ``the famine of hearing the word of \nthe Lord,'' whether it is removing a display of the Ten Commandments \nfrom a courthouse or of a nativity scene from a city square, whether it \nis eliminating prayer in the city schools or eliminating ``under God'' \nin the Pledge of Allegiance, whether it is making a mockery of the \nsacred institution of marriage between a man and a woman, or, yes, \ntelecasting around the world made-in-the-USA filth masquerading as \nentertainment.\n  The culture of far left America was displayed in a startling way \nduring the Super Bowl's now infamous half-time show, a show brought to \nus on behalf of the Value-Les Moonves and the pagan temple of Viacom-\nBabylon.\n  I asked the question yesterday: How many of you have ever run over a \nskunk with your car? I know the President has, somewhere over there \naround Frog Hollow. I have, many times. I can tell you that the stink \nstays around for a long time. You can take the car through a carwash \nand it is still there. So the scent of this event will long linger in \nthe nostrils of America.\n  I am not talking just about an exposed mammary gland with a pull-tab \nattached to it. Really, no one should have been too surprised with \nthat. Wouldn't you expect a bumping, humping, trashy routine entitled \n``I'm Going To Get You Naked'' to end that way?\n  Does any responsible adult ever listen to the words of this rap-crap? \nI would quote you some of it, but the Sergeant at Arms would throw me \nout of this Chamber, as well he should.\n  Then there was that prancing, dancing, strutting, rutting guy, \nevidently suffering from jock itch because he kept yelling and grabbing \nhis crotch. But, then, maybe there is a culture of crotch grabbing in \nthis country I don't know about. But as bad as all that was, the thing \nthat yanked my chain the hardest was seeing this ignoramus with his \npointed head stuck up through a hole he had cut in the flag of the \nUnited States of America, screaming about having ``a bottle of scotch \nand watching lots of crotch.''\n  Think about that. This is the same flag to which we pledge \nallegiance. This is the same flag that is draped over coffins of dead \nyoung uniformed warriors, killed while protecting Kid Crock's boney \nbutt. He should be tarred and feathered and ridden out of this country \non a rail. You talk about a good reality show? That would be one.\n  The desire and will of this Congress to meaningfully do anything \nabout any of these so-called social issues is nonexistent and \nembarrassingly disgraceful. The American people are waiting and growing \nimpatient with us. They want something done.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S.J. Res. 26, along with Senator \nAllard and others, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States relating to marriage; and S. 1558, the Liberties \nRestoration Act, which declares religious liberty rights in several \nways, including the Pledge of Allegiance and the display of the Ten \nCommandments.\n  Today, I join Senator Shelby and others with the Constitution \nRestoration Act of 2004 that limits the jurisdiction of Federal courts \nin certain ways.\n  In doing so, I stand shoulder to shoulder, not only with my Senate \ncosponsors and Chief Justice Roy Moore of Alabama, but more importantly \nwith our Founding Fathers in the conception of religious liberty and \nthe terribly wrong direction our modern judiciary has taken us.\n  Everyone today seems to think the U.S. Constitution expressly \nprovides for separation of church and state. I guess you could ask any \n10 people if\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\nthat is not so and I will bet you most of them will say, well, sure \nthat is so. And some would point out that is in the First Amendment.\n  Wrong. Read it. It says:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n\n  Where is the word ``separate''? Where are the words ``church'' and \n``state''? They are not there; never have been, never intended to be. \nRead the Congressional Record during the 4-month period in 1789 when \nthe amendment was being framed in Congress. Clearly their intent was to \nprohibit a single denomination in exclusion of all others, whether it \nwas anglican or Catholic or some other.\n  I highly recommend a great book entitled Original Intent by David \nBarton.\n  It really gets into how the actual Members of Congress, who drafted \nthe First Amendment, expected basic Biblical principles and values to \nbe present throughout public life and society, not separate from it.\n  It was Alexander Hamilton who pointed out that ``judges should be \nbound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and \npoint out their duty.''\n  ``Bound down.'' That is exactly what is needed to be done. There was \nnot a single precedent cited when school prayer was struck down in \n1962.\n  These judges who legislate instead of adjudicate do it without being \nresponsible to one single solitary voter for their actions.\n  Among the signers of the Declaration of Independence was a brilliant \nyoung physician from Pennsylvania named Benjamin Rush.\n  When Rush was elected to that First Continental Congress, his close \nfriend Benjamin Franklin told him ``We need you . . . we have a great \ntask before us, assigned to us by Providence.''\n  Today, 228 years later there is still a great task before us assigned \nto us by Providence. Our Founding Fathers did not shirk their duty and \nwe can do no less.\n  By the way, Benjamin Rush was once asked a question that has long \ninterested this Senator from Georgia in particular. Dr. Rush was asked, \nAre you a democrat or an aristocrat? And the good doctor answered, ``I \nam neither''. ``I am a Christocrat. I believe He, alone, who created \nand redeemed man is qualified to govern him.''\n  That reply of Benjamin Rush is just as true today in the year of our \nLord 2004 as it was in the year of our Lord 1776.\n  So, if I am asked why--with all the pressing problems this Nation \nfaces today--why am I pushing these social issues and taking the \nSenate's valuable time, I will answer: Because, it is of the highest \nimportance. Yes, there is a deficit to be concerned about in this \ncountry, a deficit of decency.\n  So, as the sand empties through my hourglass at warp speed--and with \nmy time running out in this Senate and on this Earth--I feel compelled \nto speak out for I truly believe that at times like this, silence is \nnot golden. It is yellow.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Miller, for his statement and for his outrage over \nsome of the decline in morality which was evidenced by not only by \nSuper Bowl halftime but also by the Supreme Court decision just made in \nthe State of Massachusetts where basically four individuals tried to \nlegalize same-sex marriage. It was not a vote of the people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1272-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1272-S1275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IMMIGRATION REFORM, GUEST WORKERS, AND AgJOBS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this afternoon the Judiciary Committee's \nImmigration and Border Security Subcommittee, on which I serve, held an \nimportant hearing on immigration and guest worker reform. The hearing \nfocused on broad issues related to temporary guest worker, and \nespecially on the framework for reform proposed recently by the \nPresident of the United States. Our chairman, the Senator from Georgia, \nMr. Chambliss, also welcomed statements from several Senators who have \nintroduced bills in this area.\n  Before this President came into office, the Federal Government led \nthe way as our Nation remained in denial, ignoring both the rapidly \ngrowing number of undocumented persons in this country and the \nincreasing dependence of critical sectors of our economy on \nundocumented workers. Some would say, with justification, that the \nNation actually spent the last four decades looking the other way.\n  Then, a real wake-up call came on September 11, 2001, on the need to \nmanage our borders effectively, and of the failure to do so for many \nyears before.\n  In the last 2\\1/2\\ years, we have made progress. President Bush has \ndemonstrated tireless leadership on and since September 11. The new \nDepartment of Homeland Security has been established to bring \nrationality to our border, immigration, and homeland security efforts. \nWith the hard work of the administration, our men and women in uniform, \nand the Congress, our borders are more secure and our homeland is \nsafer.\n  However, a lot of work remains to be done, as recognized at this \nhearing.\n  The President has proposed a framework for guest worker reform. I \napplaud the administration's repeated assurance that it is not taking \nany position on any one bill and has no intention to preclude any bill. \nThe President has said he wants to work out the details with Congress, \nand we are ready to work with him.\n  I also appreciated the opportunity to highlight the fact that one \nbill already introduced in Congress is ready to move. We have a vehicle \nready to road-test key principles in the President's framework. I also \nbelieve this bill is consistent with the broad goals and principles of \nseveral of our other colleagues who have introduced broad reform bills.\n  That bill is AgJOBS--the Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and \nSecurity Act, introduced as S. 1645 and HR 3142. The ranking member of \nthe Immigration Subcommittee, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, is the bill's other principal sponsor in the Senate. The \nprincipal difference from other bills is that AgJOBS deals with one \nindustry--agriculture.\n  AgJOBS is a thoroughly-developed product, fitted for the unique needs \nof agriculture. It represents more than 7 years of work on these \nissues. It reflects 4 years of tough, bipartisan negotiations. A \nmajority of the Senate are now cosponsors.\n  This bill gives us the opportunity to use reform in agriculture as \nthe demonstration program that will help us work out the details, \nanticipate challenges, prevent problems, and fine-tune the mechanics of \nan economy-wide reform package down the road.\n  Agriculture also has a unique history of guest worker programs and \nmigrant employment. We have the necessary data and experience to draw \non. There is no doubt in the minds of most of us that there really are \nfew American citizens today who want to work, on a seasonal and migrant \nbasis, at the hard physical labor of agriculture. In contrast, in some \nother industries, there remains the controversy over the availability \nof willing and qualified domestic workers and concern about their \ndisplacement by guest workers.\n  Agriculture is the industry most impacted by dependence on \nundocumented workers--not by anyone's design, but by circumstance and \nnecessity. The government's own data--based, incredibly, on self-\ndisclosure by workers, themselves--indicates that more than half of the \nagricultural work force is undocumented. Responsible private estimates \nrun as high 75 to 85 percent. Farmers are going out of business today \nbecause they cannot find legal workers at the times they are needed.\n  With AgJOBS, we could begin immediately to improve our homeland \nsecurity--and especially ensure the safety and security of our food \nsupply--by knowing who is planting and harvesting our crops, where they \ncame from, and where they are working.\n  With AgJOBS, we do not need to wait to start putting an end to the \ninhumane risks and exploitation suffered by these most vulnerable of \nworkers. Every year, more than 300 persons die in the desert, or in \nboxcars, or being smuggled in other hazardous transportation. That is \nnot tolerable in a humane society.\n  AgJOBS takes the same long-term approach consistent with the \nPresident's framework and other bills--an\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\nimproved guest worker program. It also addresses the need for a \ntransition program in the immediate term, by allowing workers the \nearned adjustment to legal status. This is not amnesty.\n  This letter brings together employers and workers--from the American \nFarm Bureau and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the United Farm Workers \nand the AFL-CIO. Cosigners include the National Association of State \nDepartments of Agriculture, worker and legal-service advocates, large \nand small employers, Latino groups, religious groups, social service \norganizations, agriculture and other sectors of the economy, \nimmigration issue advocates, and others. Legislation involving major \nlabor and immigration issues simply does not become law, unless it \nachieves this kind of bipartisan and broad-based consensus\n  I continue to invite all my colleagues to become cosponsors of AgJOBS \nand look forward to working with them to move this bill forward this \nyear.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print into the Record a letter of support \nthat Senator Kennedy and I have just received from some 420 \norganizations--national, state, and local organizations--asking \nCongress to enact AgJOBS into law expeditiously.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 12, 2004.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned organizations \n     representing a broad cross-section of America join together \n     to support enactment of S. 1645 and H.R. 3142, the \n     Agricultural Job, Opportunity, Benefits and Security Act \n     (AgJOBS). This landmark bipartisan legislation would achieve \n     historic reforms to our nation's labor and immigration laws \n     as they pertain to agriculture. The legislation reflects \n     years of negotiations on complex and contentious issues among \n     employer and worker representatives, and leaders in Congress.\n       A growing number of our leaders in Congress, as well as the \n     President, recognize that our nation's immigration policy is \n     flawed and that, from virtually every perspective, the status \n     quo is untenable. Nowhere is the status quo more untenable \n     than in agriculture. America needs reforms that are \n     compassionate, realistic and economically sensible--reforms \n     that also enhance the rule of law and contribute to national \n     security. AgJOBs represents the coming together of historic \n     adversaries in a rare opportunity to achieve reforms \n     supportive of these goals, as well as our nation's \n     agricultural productivity and food security.\n       AgJOBS represents a balanced solution for American \n     agriculture, a critical element of a comprehensive solution, \n     and one that can be enacted now with board bipartisan \n     support. For these reasons, we join together to encourage the \n     Congress to enact S. 1645 and H.R. 3142, the Agricultural Job \n     Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of 2003, before the \n     2004 Congressional April Recess.\n           Sincerely,\n         Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform; American \n           Farm Bureau Federation; National Council of \n           Agricultural Employers, AFL-CIO; U.S. Chamber of \n           Commerce; U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; National \n           Council of La Raza (NCLR); Mexican American Legal \n           Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF); League of United \n           Latin American Citizens (LULAC); William C.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize Mr. Arthur Jerry Pontius of Deadwood, SD, with a \nCongressional Fire Caucus Certificate of Award. Jerry has served the \nDeadwood Volunteer Fire Department for over 40 years, and has been an \nexemplary citizen through his selflessness and dedication to community \nsafety and well-being. I am pleased and honored to say that this award \ncould not go to a more qualified or deserving person.\n  Jerry graduated second in his class from the Deadwood Public High \nSchool system in 1957, and went on to earn a B.S. in mechanical \nengineering from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. After \nworking for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, Jerry came home to Deadwood, \nwhere he eventually became the mechanical engineer for the Homestake \nMining Company. He stayed with Homestake for 25 years, serving in \nvarious capacities, most recently as the chief plant engineer. He left \nHomestake in 1990 and retired in 1998.\n  Over the years, despite his busy work life, Jerry has found time to \nserve his country and his community in countless ways. He first joined \nthe Deadwood Volunteer Fire Department in 1963, and has been an \nintegral part of the department ever since. In addition to serving in \nvarious positions within the department, including fire chief, \ncertified instructor, and member of the Board of Trustees, Jerry has \nserved as the president of the South Dakota Firemen's Association and \non the Governor's Commission on Fire Service Training. During his \ntenure as president of the South Dakota Fireman's Association, the \nbylaws were changed to admit women, representing the best of American \nvalues of social equality. Most recently, Jerry received the \n``Outstanding Service Award for Service as assistant chief during the \nGrizzly Gulch Fire'' in 2002.\n  It is hard to imagine someone doing more for his or her community's \nsafety during their lifetime. As are so many South Dakotans, I am \nthankful for Jerry's commitment and work to ensure that not only the \ncommunity of Deadwood, but all South Dakota communities are safe and \nsecure from fires. It is only fitting that Jerry receive this award, as \ntribute to his incredible contributions to fire safety efforts in South \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1275-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND COPS FUNDING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago a 17-year-old student was shot \nand killed at Ballou High School in Washington, DC. This shooting was \nthe second in a 4-month period at the school. Earlier this week, in \nAlbany, NY, another school shooting took place, and while only minor \ninjuries resulted, the incident is another example of the impact of gun \nviolence on students.\n  School violence, or even the threat of school violence, instills fear \nin our students, and limits their ability to learn. It also threatens \nand intimidates teachers and makes instruction more difficult. Violence \nin our schools puts the learning environment in jeopardy.\n  That is one reason why I am troubled by President Bush's fiscal year \n2005 budget. The President's budget proposes a total elimination of \nfunding for the COPS in Schools Program. As my colleagues know, the \nCOPS in Schools program is designed to help law enforcement agencies \nhire school resource officers to engage in community policing in and \naround primary and secondary schools. COPS in Schools provides an \nincentive for law enforcement agencies to build collaborative \npartnerships with the school community and to use community policing \nefforts to combat school violence.\n  Since 1994, in my home State of Michigan, police departments have \nreceived more than $210 million, hired more than 3,300 officers, and \nthe COPS in Schools program has added 143 school resource officers, but \nwith the President's cuts to the COPS program, additional Federal \nassistance would not be on the way. The President's $900 million in \ncuts to COPS funding would require local police departments around the \ncountry to stretch even further the limited number of dollars they have \nto protect our schools and communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support efforts to reinstate COPS funding so \nthat we might ensure a safer environment for our children to learn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1275-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, millions of Americans have seen \ncorporations move their jobs overseas. Americans are losing jobs in \nevery sector of our economy--not only in manufacturing, but also in \ncomputer technology, the service sector, and health care. Positions \nlike call center technician, information technology specialist, and \neven health care worker are evaporating at an amazing clip.\n  Experts estimate that 40 percent of Fortune 1000 companies are \ncurrently using some form of overseas outsourcing. As many as 3.3 \nmillion jobs may be offshored in the next 15 years, causing American \nworkers to lose $136 billion in wages. Worst of all, we are losing jobs \nin sectors that once provided our economy with its greatest growth like \nthe information technology sector. As many as 500,000 information \ntechnology jobs could go overseas in coming years.\n  The tragedy of our disappearing jobs is about more than just numbers. \nThis week, a Wisconsin auto parts manufacturer announced that it was \nmoving 500 jobs overseas, putting an equivalent number of workers out \non the street. IBM has announced plans to displace thousands of \ncomputer programmers by moving their work to other countries. These \nworkers represent the human cost of offshore outsourcing.\n  This cost--all too real for most Americans--is ignored by the Bush \nadministration, whose chief economic advisor stated this week that \noutsourcing is ``a plus for the economy in the long run.''\n  Tell that to the 15 million Americans who are out of work today. Tell \nthat to the millions more who had to settle for new jobs at lower pay. \nTell that to the millions of Americans struggling every day to provide \nfor their families, pay the bills, and cope with rising health care and \ncollege costs.\n  What we are seeing is a President out of touch with the needs of \nworking Americans. He thinks it is good to deny overtime pay to \nworkers. He opposes an increase in the minimum wage. He opposes \nunemployment coverage for workers looking for new jobs. And now he \nwants to ship your jobs overseas.\n  Exporting American jobs may help the bottom line on Wall Street, but \nit hurts the bottom lines of America's families.\n  Today, we are saying enough is enough. If President Bush and his \ncorporate pals want to send your job overseas, then they will be held \naccountable.\n  The Jobs for America Act amends the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \nNotification, WARN, Act to require companies to report whenever they \nlay off workers to send jobs overseas. When company plans to lay off \nworkers and send those jobs overseas, they need to tell workers in \nadvance. And they need to inform the Department of Labor, and local \ngovernment officials. They\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\nwill have to tell the public how many jobs are affected, where the jobs \nare going, and why they are being offshored.\n  This act also requires the Department of Labor to compile much-needed \nstatistics of offshored jobs and report them on an annual basis to the \nCongress and the public. Finally, it applies WARN Act protections to \nall cases where 50 or more workers are laid off.\n  The bill shines a spotlight on offshoring practices--not only in \ncorporate boardrooms but at the White House. It is time for President \nBush and Corporate America to let every American know whether they \nstand only for more profits or whether they stand with the American \npeople.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senator \nSnowe and Senator Wyden, to support the bipartisan Medicare Enhancement \nfor Needed Drugs Act. This legislation is an important step toward \ncontrolling the spiraling cost of prescription drugs for America's \nseniors.\n  Last November, I voted in favor of the Medicare Prescription Drug \nImprovement and Modernization Act because I believed it was the right \nstep toward finally delivering on a promise Congress made to its \nseniors to modernize Medicare by providing prescription drug coverage \nin the nearly 40-year-old program.\n  I personally ran the numbers and looked at a variety of options to \nadd a prescription drug benefit in Medicare, but I decided to support \nthe final bill that was passed last November and signed into law in \nDecember because I felt it would make a genuine, positive difference \nfor the seniors in my State, particularly those with low incomes or \nvery high drug bills.\n  The key to the Medicare bill is that the prescription drug coverage \nis voluntary. No senior will be forced to enroll in drug coverage in \nMedicare, also called Medicare Part D. Those who do will receive \nassistance from the Federal Government for their drug bills up to \n$2,250 in total drug costs and will only pay 5 percent of their drug \ncosts above $3,600 in out-of-pocket spending.\n  I have said several times on the floor of the Senate that I was \ndismayed at a provision in the bill that prohibits the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services from negotiating lower prescription drug \nprices. Similarly, I said that I would take action to remove this \nprovision and work toward lowering costs of the program.\n  I feel strongly that savings to the Medicare Program can be achieved \nby provisions in the Medicare Enhancement for Needed Drugs Act. Now is \nthe time to find solutions that reduce the cost of prescription drugs \nfor our Nation's seniors and for the future of Medicare. I know seniors \nin my State who have had to make the terrible choice of paying for \ntheir prescription drugs and paying for rent and groceries. In the end, \nmany skip or reduce their dosages putting their health at risk. That is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  This bill represents a comprehensive approach to strengthening the \ndrug coverage in the Medicare bill by addressing the skyrocketing drug \ncosts.\n  First and foremost, the bill strikes language in the Medicare bill \ncalled the ``noninterference'' provision. That section bars the HHS \nSecretary from interfering with the negotiations between drug \nmanufacturers and pharmacies and sponsors of prescription drug plans. I \nstrongly believe that the Secretary should be given the authority \nsimilar to that of other Federal entities that purchase prescription \ndrugs in bulk to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered part \nD drugs.\n  CBO estimates that the effect of striking the ``noninterference'' \nprovision would have a ``negligible effect'' on Federal spending \nbecause the savings CBO predicts private plans will be able to obtain \nwill be greater than what the Secretary will be able to achieve.\n  However, what if CBO's predictions are not the reality and private \nplans cannot achieve the lowest prices available? What if competition \namong private plans does not bring about greater cost savings? In that \nscenario, the HHS Secretary would not be able to step in and use the \nfull force of the Federal Government's bulk purchasing power to lower \nprescription drug prices.\n  A 2001 inspector general's report from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services found that the Department of Veterans' Affairs, VA, paid \nan average of 52 percent less for a list of two dozen drugs than did \nMedicare. The VA employs a number of cost-saving techniques such as \nusing generics whenever available and substituting high-priced \nmedications with just as effective ones for lower prices.\n\n  I strongly believe that the Federal Government should employ the \ncost-saving techniques for Medicare as the VA does for the acquisition \nof prescription drugs.\n  As an incentive to participating Medicare drug plans to negotiate the \nlowest possible drug prices, the bill allocates $500 million from the \nMedicare Stabilization Fund to be used by the HHS Secretary for those \nplans to secure negotiated prices that are on average within 10 percent \nof VA or Department of Defense.\n  In order to ensure that seniors can make an ``apples to apples'' \ncomparison when determining which drug plan suits them best, the bill \nrequires that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \ndetermine the negotiated savings received from each plan.\n  The bill makes a significant step toward increasing access to lower \ncost reimported prescription drugs by ensuring access to these markets. \nIt prohibits any company that discriminates publicly, privately or \notherwise against foreign retailers or wholesalers who pass along \ndiscounts to consumers living in the United States from taking \nadvantage of the advertising deduction allowed under the U.S. Tax Code. \nThe purpose of this provision is to stop the practice of drug \nmanufacturers limiting their shipments to foreign countries expressly \nto prevent reimportation by American consumers.\n  I have heard concerns raised by many of my constituents about the \nimpact the Medicare bill will have on their medigap plans. This bill \ndirects the HHS Secretary to work with the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners to conduct a review of the changes to the \nmedigap policies in the new drug benefit for the purpose of evaluate \nits impact on Medicare beneficiaries.\n  CBO projects that Americans over 65 will spend $1.8 trillion on \nprescription drugs over the next 10 years. Recent studies of United \nStates and Canadian drug price comparisons show that, on average, \nprices charged by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers were higher \nin the United States, most recently by about 70 percent.\n  If we do not address the exorbitant costs of prescription drugs in \nthis country today, we threaten the viability of programs like Medicare \nfor future generations. I am pleased to join Senators Snowe and Wyden \nin the fight for lower prescription drug prices for our seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1276-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1276-S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INFANT MORTALITY RATE INCREASES FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1958\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to today to discuss some \ndisturbing news. According to a preliminary report released by the \nCDC's National Center for Health Statistics, infant mortality in the \nU.S. increased from 6.8 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2001 to a rate \nof 7.0 in 2002. This is the first time that the infant mortality rate \nhas increased since 1958. Birth defects, preterm birth and low \nbirthweight, and maternal complications of pregnancy were the major \nfactors contributing to this increase.\n  During the last session of Congress we passed legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Dodd to renew the Federal commitment to finding \nthe causes of birth defects and preventing those for which we know the \ncauses. I am very proud of the important work being conducted by the \nNational Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the \nCDC in this area.\n  Congress has not yet addressed the problem of premature birth and low \nbirthweight. In 2002, more than 480,000 babies were born prematurely in \nthe U.S 1 in 8 births. In my own State of Missouri, 12.7 percent of \nbirths are preterm, an increase of more than 11 percent over the last \ndecade. Preterm labor can happen to any pregnant woman and the causes \nof nearly half of all preterm births are unknown.\n  In January of 2003, the March of Dimes launched a 5-year, $75 million\n\n[[Page S1277]]\n\ncampaign to prevent preterm birth. Also supporting the campaign are the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and \nNeonatal Nurses and 28 other national organizations. I cannot think of \na better group of organizations to take on this serious public health \nproblem. As significant as the March of Dimes campaign will be, success \nin reducing the incidence of prematurity requires a commitment from the \nFederal Government as well.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of vital legislation aimed at reducing \nthe rates of preterm birth. The ``PREEMIE Act'' authorizes expansion of \nresearch into the causes and prevention of prematurity and increases \nFederal support of public and health professional education as well as \nsupport services related to prematurity.\n  I would like to conclude by telling you the story of Jacqueline \nReineri. Born 4 months premature, at just 24 weeks gestation, \nJacqueline was given a very slim chance for survival. She was the size \nof a small doll, weighing just 1 lb., 10 ounces. Jacqueline had a \ngrade-three brain bleed among many other complications and spent 96 \ndays in the neonatal intensive care unit, NICU.\n  Today, Jacqueline has Spastic Quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy and gets \naround in a power wheelchair. She has endured four major surgeries and \nwill continue to experience many long-term effects of prematurity. \nWhile her family worries about her future, they feel blessed that she \nis a very intelligent second grader in a typical classroom and a very \nactive advocate for prematurity and children with special needs, \nserving as the Missouri March of Dimes Ambassador.\n  As inspiring as Jacqueline's story is many premature babies aren't as \nlucky. The recent increase in the rate of infant mortality underscores \nthe importance of a comprehensive public-private effort to find the \ncauses and ultimately prevent premature birth.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to join me today in pledging to do all we \ncan to ensure a day when all children are born healthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1277-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RADIO LIBERTY STIFLED IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, several weeks ago, I addressed the \nSenate, in my capacity as Co-Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, on \ncritical Presidential elections scheduled to be held later this year in \nUkraine. In the latest twist in the lead up to those elections, \nyesterday Radio Liberty was abruptly informed that its Ukrainian \nService programming would be removed from its major radio \nrebroadcaster's FM schedule, beginning February 17. In a press release, \nRFE/RL President Tom Dine said, ``This is a political act against \nliberal democracy, against free speech and press, against RFE/RL, and \nshows, once again, that Ukraine's political leadership is unable to \nlive in an open society and is compelled to `control' the media as if \nit were the good old days of the Soviet Union.''\n  This is not the first time that there has been official Ukrainian \npressure to drop RFE/RL broadcasting since September 2001, shortly \nafter the murder of independent journalist Heorhiy Gongadze and the \nrelease of secretly-recorded tapes in Ukrainian President Kuchma's \noffice implicating him and other high-ranking officials in the \ndisappearance, corruption, and other dubious actions. Radio Liberty \ncovers these and many issues about life in Ukraine, serving as an \nobjective source of information in a media environment increasingly \ndominated by these authorities.\n  In the past I have spoken out about Ukraine's troubled pre-election \nenvironment, including its media environment. This latest move, \ntogether with repressive measures against the democratic opposition and \nindependent media over the course of the last few months, raise \nprofound questions as to whether the October presidential elections \nwill be free, fair, open, and transparent, in a manner consistent with \nUkraine's freely undertaken OSCE and other international commitments. \nEffectively unplugging an important independent source of information \ndoes not bode well for democracy in Ukraine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1277-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I acknowledge today, February 12, as the \nseventieth anniversary of the Export-Import Bank, the principal export \ncredit agency of the United States. Since 1934, the bank has played a \nunique role in helping to facilitate U.S. exports, ultimately \nsupporting thousands of jobs. As an independent U.S. Government agency, \nit assumes credit and country risks that the private sector is unable \nor unwilling to accept.\n  Eximbank has assisted in financing more than $400 billion in U.S. \nexports. On average, 85 percent of its transactions directly benefit \nsmall businesses which are clearly struggling in today's economy. \nHistorically, the Bank has a loan-loss rate of under 2 percent, which \nis a respectable record for any financial institution.\n  As the United States has become economically interdependent with a \ngrowing number of foreign trade partners, the Bank's role in leveling \nthe playing field for American companies seeking to market their goods \nand services overseas continues to grow. In turn, Eximbank plays a \nvital part in enabling U.S. companies, both large and small, to turn \nexport opportunities into concrete sales.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to make not of Eximbank's important \ncontribution to the U.S. economy and hope the institution continues to \nhonor its mission through the twenty first century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1277-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1277-S1278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF MILTON WESLEY SANDERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Milton Wesley Sanders passed away on \nTuesday, February 10, in Washington, DC. He was one of the rapidly \nvanishing members of what we rightfully call the ``greatest \ngeneration''.\n  These valiant Americans who fought in World War II did not merely \ndefeat a savage and evil enemy. They literally saved the free world. \nWhat would our own lives have been like if the forces of Nazism had \nprevailed in that war? It is truly unthinkable, and thanks to the \ngreatest generation and men like Milton Sanders, we will never have to \nknow the answer.\n  This generation of Americans grew up during the Great Depression, so \nthey already knew about sacrifice. And when their country called upon \nthem to sacrifice even more, they did not hesitate.\n  Milt Sanders' first heroic act occurred when he was still in flight \nschool in Florida. During a training flight near Tallahassee, FL, his \nnew P-47 aircraft malfunctioned because of a missing part.\n  Rather than bail out over a populated area, he decided to take the \nairplane in for a ``safe'' crash landing. He could have landed safely \non the campus of the Florida State College for Women now known as \nFlorida State. But when he saw a lot of students walking across campus, \nhe headed for a nearby field.\n  In the instant before landing he had to divert the aircraft to avoid \nhitting a farmer. In the resulting crash, he suffered a skull fracture \nand numerous other injuries. But his quick thinking and courage had \nsaved innocent lives.\n  During the war, Milt flew 116 combat P-47 fighter-bomber missions \nwith the 9th Air Force in the European theater of operations. He \nsupported operations from the pre-Normandy invasion buildup through the \nrace across France, the Battle of the Bulge, and the final victory over \nNazi tyranny. He brought back seven aircraft so badly shot up that they \nwere immediately sent to the scrap heap. He was credited with shooting \ndown one German aircraft and destroying more than 25 aircraft on the \nground. For his valor, Milt was awarded two Distinguished Flying \nCrosses, 20 Air Medals, two Presidential Unit citations, the French \nCroix de Guerre with Silver Star, and the Belgian Fourragere.\n  Milt, who was known to some of his squadron buddies as ``Sandy,'' \nexperienced the heroism of war, and he also saw the horror.\n  He saw one friend's aircraft crash into the ground. He saw another \nman bail out only to be knocked unconscious when he collided with his \nairplane. That man's parachute never opened.\n  He saw dead bodies that were booby-trapped.\n  He befriended an English family in London, only to find when he went \nto visit them that their home had been destroyed by a German V1 rocket.\n\n[[Page S1278]]\n\n  Milt and his comrades knew the dangers they faced. After flying a \nmission at night, he would later recall that ground fire is frightening \nduring the day, ``but to see it at night at a low altitude, you think \nevery shot coming up has your name on it.''\n  Yet despite the dangers, he fought without fear.\n  After World War II, Milt continued to serve in the U.S. Air Force \nReserve, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel and retiring with 20 \nyears of honorable service in 1962.\n  Even when his active duty service had ended, he continued to serve \nour country through his work with several firms providing weapons \nsystems and equipment to the Department of Defense. This association \ncontinued until his civilian retirement in 1989 at the age of 72.\n  The measure of a man's life is not solely in what he did, but in what \nhe did for others. Throughout his life, Milton Sanders constantly \nsacrificed his time and talents in service to others in his church, his \ncommunity, and his Nation. Every person who came into contact with him \nknew he was a friend they could always count on, no matter the hour, no \nmatter the need.\n  Perhaps Milt's greatest contribution to our Nation comes from the \nlegacy of his 46 years of loving marriage to his wife Jean. They have \neight children, including two graduates of our military service \nacademies; 28 grandchildren; and 17 great-grandchildren.\n  I will always treasure the memories of my monthly home teaching \nvisits to the Sanders home. His piano playing, story-telling and \nbeautiful prayers will always be vividly present in my mind. Jean, I \nlearned during these visits, has always been the foundation of their \nwonderful relationship.\n  Like so many other members of his generation, Milton Sanders was a \ngreat yet humble patriot. Because of the sacrifices they made, our \nlives are immeasurably better than they otherwise might have been. Our \nNation owes them more than words can ever convey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1278-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOMAGE TO BILL AND TERI POPP\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I pay homage to Minnesotans who are \nhelping the Minnesota National Guard and their families. The National \nGuard serves our country and the States as a unique organization among \nall branches of the United States Armed Forces. The Guard is America's \ncommunity-based defense force, located in more than 2,700 cities and \ntowns across the Nation. Sixty-two of those cities are located in \nMinnesota. National Guard members are citizen-soldiers and airmen who \nare integral members of their communities. Minnesota National Guard \nmembers live, shop, work, worship, and go to school in Minnesota's \ncities and towns. This inexorable link between the community and its \ncitizen-soldiers is what makes the National Guard an important and \nnecessary part of their local and national communities.\n  The Minnesota Army and Air National Guard are reserve components of \nthe United States Army and Air Force. During times of national \nemergency, National Guard members may be called into active Federal \nservice by the President of the United States. Guard members from \nMinnesota have served in every major conflict involving the United \nStates Armed Forces since the Guard's inception more than 360 years \nago. At this time, Minnesota National Guard members are serving in \nIraq, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Kosovo, as well as in other countries \nand within the State of Minnesota.\n  For the past 40 years, National Guard members have primarily served \nwithin their own communities, helping assist local law enforcement \nagencies during emergencies. In this capacity, members worked for the \nGuard on a part-time basis, usually just during emergency situations. \nGuard members earned the majority of their income from their jobs in \nthe community. In the past couple of years, Guard members have been \ncalled to active duty. Because of this, they no longer earn their \ncivilian incomes. For the most part, their civilian pay far exceeds \ntheir pay on active duty. In addition, when Guard members are deployed, \nthey and their families need to support two households--the Guard \nmember in their remote location and the family the Guard member leaves \nbehind. While employers are encouraged to meet the pay differential for \nthe Guard, oftentimes small companies cannot meet this obligation. Many \nGuard members and their families are caught in an unanticipated set of \ncircumstances due to long terms of deployment overseas while supporting \nand protecting our country.\n  Inspired by the National Guard's members' dedication, patriotism, and \nselflessness, many Minnesotans have stepped forward to help Minnesota \nNational Guard soldiers and their families. The efforts of Bill and \nTeri Popp, of Minnetonka, MN, deserve special praise. Long-time \nsupporters of the Guard, they gave generously and challenged other \nMinnesotans to join them in supporting the Minnesota National Guard. \nBill, founder and owner of POPP Telecom, believes that his company can \nand should improve the quality of life for everyone in his community. \nTo that end, the Popps donated $1,000 to every Minnesota National Guard \nmember who was serving in Iraq, as of November 14, 2003. The gift the \nPopps made to Guard members in Iraq totaled $166,000.\n  A true patriot, Bill included a thank you letter to each Guard member \nthat received the donation that provided: ``Thank you for putting your \nlife on hold, and on the line, in service to our country. Thank you for \n. . . risking your life to advance liberty and justice for all people \nof the world.''\n  To then set an example to the community, the Popps made an additional \ndonation to the Minnesota National Guard Foundation to help Guard \nmembers in financial need. Bill, through his company, also prepared and \nran announcements on Minnesota radio stations encouraging other people \nand companies in Minnesota to make donations to the foundation to \nsupport members of the Minnesota National Guard and military reserves \nwho have been impacted economically by extended periods of active duty \nservice.\n  The Popps not only have promised to make sure the sacrifices the \nGuard and other military personal make in service to our country will \nnot be forgotten, they have followed through to help that promise come \ntrue.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in tribute to U.S. \nArmy Sgt. Benjamin Gilman, of Meriden, Connecticut, who died in \nAfghanistan on January 29, 2004, at the age of 28.\n  Sergeant Gilman was killed along with seven other American soldiers \nin a weapons cache explosion near the town of Ghazni. He was part of \nthe 41st Engineer Battalion, 10th Mountain Division, based in Fort \nDrum, NY.\n  Benjamin Gilman was always doing his best to help others, long before \nhe enlisted in our Armed Forces. As a teenager, he won an award for his \nvolunteer work at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center. When visiting \nhis mother at her job at the Curtis Home for the elderly, he would \nspend time with the senior citizens who lived there, sharing \nconversations over games of checkers. While working at a fast food \nrestaurant at the local mall, Benjamin made friends with a group of \nelderly women he would come to call his ``adopted grandmothers.''\n  While he was committed to service of all kinds, it was always \nBenjamin Gilman's dream to serve his country in the military. Even as a \n7-year-old playing with action figures, young Benjamin told anyone who \nwould listen that he would be a soldier someday.\n  Benjamin was a special person for many people, and there were many \npeople who were special to him. One of those people was Jean Moran. \nWhen Benjamin was 11 years old, he met Jean through a local Big \nBrother/Big Sister program. It was the first time that the program's \norganizers had assigned a big sister to a boy. But Jean became a \nfixture in Benjamin's life for years to come, taking on the role of the \nolder sibling that he never had.\n  Of all the bonds and friendships Benjamin had, though, none was more \nlasting or special than his relationship with his mother, Edie Gilman. \nA single\n\n[[Page S1279]]\n\nmom, Edie poured her heart, soul, time, and energy into her only child. \nIn the last letter he sent home from Iraq, Benjamin thanked his mother \nfor everything she did for him, calling her his ``best friend in the \nentire world.''\n  My heart truly goes out to Edie Gilman, who has suffered the kind of \nloss that is difficult for most of us to comprehend. We often speak of \nthe weighty burden borne by our men and women in uniform--and \nrightfully so. But we would do well to also remember the burden placed \non the shoulders of the families of these brave Americans.\n  While our troops are defending our freedoms overseas, all across \nAmerica there are husbands and wives who must bear the responsibility \nof raising children alone. There are sons and daughters who must do \nwithout a helping hand with their schoolwork, or an enthusiastic \nsupporter at their soccer games. There are brothers and sisters who are \nmissing a role model, a mentor, a friend.\n  There are fathers and mothers, who endure anxious days and sleepless \nnights knowing that their children are in harm's way. And then there \nare people like Edie Gilman, who one day learn the heartbreaking news \nthat someone they love will never be coming home.\n  And so today I salute the courage, the commitment, and the conviction \nof Benjamin Gilman, a young man who lost his life fulfilling the \nnoblest of callings, defending our Nation and the values we hold dear. \nAnd I offer my deepest and most heartfelt sympathies to Edie Gilman, \nwho has made a sacrifice for her country that is too great for words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1279-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO ALL MILITARY SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN AND THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the service men and \nwomen who have served our country so bravely in Afghanistan and Iraq. I \nalso want to thank Peter Angelos and the world-class organization that \nhe leads, the Baltimore Orioles. All too often we hear negative stories \nrevolving around professional athletes. With this in mind, I have to \ntell you about a wonderful event that took place a few nights ago.\n  Tuesday night, my colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus, along \nwith members of the Baltimore Orioles, visited Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter. We went to Walter Reed to personally thank and honor the brave \nmen and women of our Armed Forces who have sacrificed so much for our \ncountry in Afghanistan and Iraq. When Peter Angelos was asked if anyone \nfrom the Orioles would be willing to visit soldiers at Walter Reed, \nthere was an overwhelming response from players, coaches, and front \noffice personnel alike. In fact, there were so many volunteers that not \neveryone could be accommodated. Specifically, I would like to recognize \nthe following members of the Orioles organization who joined us at \nWalter Reed last night: pitchers John Parrish, Rick Bauer, Julio Jorge, \nSidney Ponson, and Matt Riley; outfielders Larry Bigbie and Jay \nGibbons; infielders Bran Roberts and Miguel Tejada, accompanied by his \nwife Santa; Jim Beattie, executive vice president of baseball \noperations, his wife Martha; Mike Flanagan, vice president of baseball \noperations, his wife Alex and daughter Kerry; and bullpen coach, Elrod \nHendricks.\n  As a Senator from the great State of North Dakota, I know all too \nwell the sacrifices that are made by members of this country's \nmilitary. I am proud to say that North Dakota has the highest National \nGuard membership per capita in the Nation, and not surprisingly, during \nthe Iraq crisis has had the most mobilized personnel per capita of any \nState.\n  Thus, it was truly heartwarming, as we went from table to table at \nWalter Reed, to see the enthusiasm of not only my fellow Senators, but \nalso of the Baltimore Orioles in paying tribute to and recognizing the \ncourageous men and women of the United States military. It is their \nprofessionalism, dedication, and hard work that provide the very \nfreedoms that make this country great and it was obvious that these \nideals were not lost on the members of the Baltimore Orioles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1279-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               IN RECOGNITION OF BLACK EAGLE'S GRAMMY WIN\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a group of \nmusicians from my home State of New Mexico. The group, Black Eagle, won \na Grammy this past Sunday night.\n  The Black Eagle group is from the Pueblo of Jemez, which is one of \nthe 19 Indian pueblos in our State. Those of us who reside in the \nSouthwest are familiar with the pueblos and their people, but many are \nnot. The pueblos share many common traditions, but they are distinct \nentities and maintain unique identities. The Jemez Pueblo, located in \nnorth central New Mexico, is home to the beautiful red mesas, rich \nculture, and some of the most wonderfully talented people around. \nUniquely, the Pueblo of Jemez is the only remaining village of the Towa \nspeaking pueblos. The Pueblo has long been known for its artistic \ntalent and craft, but now its distinguished musicians can now add ``the \nGrammy winning'' declaration to their accolades.\n  The Black Eagle group formed in the late 1980s. The group's founder, \nMalcom Yepa, started the group when he was in his teens. With some \nurging, he, several friends, and several family members began composing \nsongs in their native Towa language. Currently, the Black Eagle's are \ncomprised of about 20 members from all across the age spectrum.\n  Prior to their Grammy for best Native American Music Album, their \nsixth album ``Flying Free,'' won the Best Pow Wow Album of the Year \naward at the 2003 Native American Music Awards held in Albuquerque this \npast November. Both awards are a remarkable tribute to their hard work, \ncommitment, and determination.\n  In addition to being musicians, the group has often reiterated their \ndedication to their village and their ancient culture. Furthermore, \ntheir resolve to positively influence young people is most admirable. \nFor that, and for all their accomplishments, I am proud, and I salute \neach and every one of them here in this Record. May their recent \nsuccess be only a prelude to future accomplishments, and may they \ncontinue to represent their people and the state of New Mexico with \ndistinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1279-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Message from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1279-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1279-5", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:31 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 743) to amend \nthe Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprovide additional safeguards for Social Security and Supplemental \nSecurity Income beneficiaries with representative payees, to enhance \nprogram protections, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 523.

A memorial adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Florida relative to enacting a \n     Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        Senate Memorial No. 1180\n\n       Whereas, the use of prescription drugs improves the quality \n     of care and helps patients live healthier, longer, and more \n     productive lives while keeping them out of more costly acute \n     care settings in the long term, and\n       Whereas, the increased use of new and improve prescription \n     drugs has changed the delivery of health care in the United \n     States since Medicare was enacted, and while two-thirds of \n     the Medicare population has some form of prescription drug \n     coverage, although it many times is inadequate, one-third of \n     Medicare beneficiaries have no coverage at all, and\n       Whereas, Congress did not enact a drug benefit in the \n     Medicare program, and therefore the program is inadequate in \n     providing the elderly and disabled the most appropriate drug \n     therapies, preventing the delivery of quality health care at \n     an affordable cost, and\n       Whereas, the private sector provides affordable coverage by \n     negotiating discounts on drugs and meeting the needs of \n     special populations with chronic diseases and those with co-\n     morbidities through coordinating\n\n[[Page S1282]]\n\n     care with disease management, drug utilization review, and \n     patient education programs, all of which aid in ameliorating \n     medical errors, and\n       Whereas, comprehensive reform of the Medicare program would \n     use the successful tools of the private sector in \n     coordinating care for this population and use the marketplace \n     to foster competition among private plans, resulting in more \n     choices of quality coverage for seniors and the disabled \n     while maintaining the financial sustainability of the \n     program, and\n       Whereas, Congress's inaction has failed to provide for \n     comprehensive reform of Medicare, encouraging states to use \n     their own resources to ease the burden of their elderly and \n     disabled populations and effectively to assume an unfunded, \n     informal mandate, and\n       Whereas, in implementing state programs to assist the \n     Medicare population, state budgetary constraints can often \n     result in requirements to restrict and limit the patient's \n     access to needed prescription drugs, and enact anticompetivie \n     price controls: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida, That \n     the Congress of the United States is urged to enact \n     financially sustainable, voluntary, universal, and privately \n     administered out-patient prescription drug coverage as part \n     of the federal Medicare program; be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-353.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to trade with foreign nations; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 166\n\n       Whereas, through international agreements and in the spirit \n     of fair and balanced trade, the United States dollar is \n     allowed to float freely, with little to no market \n     intervention; and\n       Whereas, many of the trade partners with the United States, \n     including, but not limited to, the European Union, Canada, \n     and Mexico, operate with a floating exchange rate within the \n     international financial system; and\n       Whereas, there are nations that are able to sell goods at \n     rates lower than the cost of production in the United States, \n     in part, through a manipulation of their nation's currency. \n     This contributes significantly to creating an unfair trade \n     balance; and\n       Whereas, foreign countries that manipulate their currency \n     are able to sell goods in the United States at an artificial \n     price, lower than the cost of domestically produced products. \n     Doing so undercuts American manufactured products, and it may \n     soon eliminate domestic manufacturing; and\n       Whereas, the loss of the domestic manufacturing industry \n     poses a substantial threat to the nation's security by \n     requiring the United States to depend on other nations to \n     produce critical components for our defense programs.\n       Whereas, currency manipulation has contributed to \n     substantial trade deficits with certain nations. The increase \n     in the trade deficit with China alone, one of the countries \n     known for currency manipulation, represents about 15 percent \n     of the decline in United States production since 2000; and\n       Whereas, Article IV of the International Monetary Fund \n     Articles of Agreement states that members shall ``avoid \n     manipulating exchange rates for the international monetary \n     system in order to prevent effective balance of payments \n     adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over \n     other members.'' Under IMF surveillance procedures, a \n     principal indicator of such manipulation is ``protracted \n     large scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     market'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to take the \n     necessary actions, through the International Monetary Fund or \n     otherwise, to ensure that foreign nations that trade with the \n     United States do so fairly and do not manipulate their \n     currency; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the United States Secretary of Commerce, \n     and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-355. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to funding for the Low Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 486\n\n       Whereas, our present economic situation continues to result \n     in thousands of Pennsylvanians being laid off from their jobs \n     or having to take lesser-paying jobs; and\n       Whereas, high energy prices lead to all Pennsylvanians, \n     especially low-income families, the elderly and the working \n     poor, having less money to spend on the basic necessities of \n     life such as food, clothing and shelter in the winter months; \n     and\n       Whereas, because of high natural gas prices during the \n     summer months, when gas companies normally fill their \n     reserves, Pennsylvania's natural gas distribution companies \n     expect to significantly raise their prices up to 30 percent \n     since the beginning of this year; and\n       Whereas, for typical home heating customers, this situation \n     could mean that natural gas customers will face bills this \n     coming winter of $30 to $45 per month higher than a year ago; \n     and\n       Whereas, the cost of home heating oil has risen more than \n     25 percent since last winter, and recent announcements of \n     future production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum \n     Exporting Countries (OPEC) may again lead to higher prices \n     this winter; and\n       Whereas, the Congress has begun to debate, but not yet \n     agreed on, final appropriations for the Low Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for the next fiscal year \n     which commences on October 1, 2003; and\n       Whereas, the United States House of Representatives has so \n     far only agreed to support $1.8 billion in regular and \n     contingency LIHEAP assistance; and\n       Whereas, the President of the United States has proposed \n     and the United States Senate has so far agreed to support a \n     total of $2 billion in regular and contingency LIHEAP \n     assistance; and\n       Whereas, the United States Senate recently defeated an \n     effort to authorize another $300 in emergency LIHEAP spending \n     that would lead to a total of $2.3 billion for LIHEAP; and\n       Whereas, increasing LIHEAP funding should entitle the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to a proportionate increase in \n     LIHEAP funds and would enable more people facing colder \n     weather and decreased income to help meet their present need \n     for heating assistance: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the President and \n     the Congress of the United States to support efforts to \n     increase LIHEAP funding over last year's funding; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-356.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Texas relative to the ability of \n     federal courts to levy or increase taxes; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 373\n\n       Whereas, in 1990, the United States Supreme Court, in the \n     case of Missouri, et al. v. Jenkins, et al. (495 U.S. 33), \n     chose to disregard Article I, Section 8, of the United States \n     Constitution, which reserves exclusively to the legislative \n     branch of government the power to tax the citizenry; and\n       Whereas, in drafting that constitutional section and \n     allocating the power of taxation, the Founding Fathers drew \n     on the Petition of Right, an English law initiated by Sir \n     Edward Coke, then approved by the British House of Commons \n     and accepted by King Charles I on June 7, 1628, which states \n     in pertinent part that ``. . . no man hereafter [may] be \n     compelled to make or yield any . . . tax . . . without common \n     consent by Act of Parliament . . .''; and\n       Whereas, in 1787, the framers of the United States \n     Constitution reiterated that time-tested principle of limited \n     taxation, specifically vesting with the legislative branch \n     the ``. . . Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts \n     and Excises . . .''; and\n       Whereas, their intent is unambiguous, made clear by the \n     analysis of James Madison, who observed in The Federalist No. \n     48 that ``. . . the legislative department alone has access \n     to the pockets of the people . . .''; and\n       Whereas, the same view is expressed by Alexander Hamilton, \n     who asked rhetorically in the Federalist No. 33, ``[w]hat is \n     the power of laying and collecting taxes but a legislative \n     power . . . ?,'' and follows consistently in the Federalist \n     No. 78, in which he argued that the judiciary should be the \n     least dangerous branch of government inasmuch as judges would \n     have ``. . . no influence over either the sword or the purse \n     . . .''; and\n       Whereas, yet today, Hamilton's argument no longer rings \n     true; through legal orders and the exercise of judicial \n     threat and intimidation, federal courts have usurped the \n     power of the legislative branch and have gone so far as to \n     apply it even to nonfederal levels of government, mandating \n     state and local requirements that have the direct, or \n     indirect, effect of imposing judicial taxes on the states and \n     their political subdivisions; and\n       Whereas, in so vesting itself by fiat with control of the \n     public purse strings, the federal judiciary has contravened \n     and overridden the constitutional separation of powers \n     between the different branches and levels of government, \n     threatening creation of a fiscal oligarchy unbeholden to \n     influence by the electorate; and\n       Whereas, the states and congress have too long ignored \n     this self-proclamation and seizure of taxation powers, and \n     it behooves all Americans to preserve their rights by the \n     adoption of an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, re-establishing the fundamental link between \n     taxation and representation; and\n       Whereas, seeking to reverse the aforementioned Jenkins \n     decision of 1990, lawmakers in 23 other states--and in two \n     territories of the United States--beginning in 1993, have \n     already adopted and transmitted to congress memorials \n     requesting that congress propose an amendment to the United \n     States Constitution, and those memorials have been entered in \n     the Congressional Record as follows:\n       the Missouri General Assembly in 1993 (Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution No. 9) designated as POM-175 in Volume 139 of the \n     Congressional Record at page 14565;\n       the Colorado General Assembly in 1994 (Senate Joint \n     Memorial No. 94-2) designated as POM-569 in Volume 140 of the \n     Congressional Record at page 15070;\n       the New York Senate in 1994 (Senate No. 3353) designated as \n     POM-578 in Volume 140 of the Congressional Record at page \n     15073;\n       the Tennessee General Assembly in 1994 (Senate Joint \n     Resolution No. 372) designated as POM-580 in Volume 140 of \n     the Congressional Record at page 15074;\n       the Arizona Legislature in 1995 (Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution No. 1014) designated as POM-523 in Volume 142 of \n     the Congressional Record at pages 6586 and 6587;\n       the Louisiana Legislature in 1995 (Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution No. 11) designated as POM-525 in Volume 142 of the \n     Congressional Record at pages 6587;\n       the Massachusetts Senate in 1995 (unnumbered resolution) \n     designated as POM-625 in Volume 142 of the Congressional \n     Record at pages 14940 and 14941 and designated as POM-638 at \n     page 15486;\n       the Nevada Legislature in 1995 (Senate Joint Resolution No. \n     2) designated as POM-287 in Volume 141 of the Congressional \n     Record at page 22422;\n       the Alaska Legislature in both 1996 and 1998 (House Joint \n     Resolution No. 30 in 1996) designated as POM-622 in Volume \n     142 of the Congressional Record at pages 14939 and 14940;

All persons born or naturalized in the United \n     States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens \n     of the United States, and of the state wherein they reside. \n     No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge \n     the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United \n     States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, \n     liberty or property, without due process of law, nor deny to \n     any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of \n     the laws.\n       Sec. 2.

No person shall be a senator or representative in \n     congress, or elector of president or vice president, or hold \n     any office, civil or military, under the United States, or \n     under any state, who having previously taken an oath as a \n     member of congress, or as an officer of the United States, or \n     as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or \n     judicial officer of any state, to support the constitution of \n     the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection of \n     rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the \n     enemies thereof.

This has \n     resulted in financial losses and further exacerbated the \n     challenges faced by our manufacturers; and\n       Whereas, the World Trade Organization and the World \n     Intellectual Property Organization implemented a set of \n     standards and principles outlining how international \n     intellectual property rights should be applied and how to \n     settle disputes between members of the World Trade \n     Organization and the World Intellectual Property \n     Organization; and\n       Whereas, the United States can defend the intellectual \n     property rights of domestic business through the procedures \n     established by the World Trade Organization and the World \n     Intellectual Property Organization; and\n       Whereas, to ensure a vibrant economic recovery in Michigan, \n     our businesses and entrepreneurs must be secure in their \n     intellectual property, for it is through these innovations \n     that companies build their economic strength and maintain \n     their competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to expand its \n     efforts through the World Trade Organization and the world \n     Intellectual Property Organization to ensure that the \n     intellectual property of domestic businesses and individuals \n     is protected and that actions are taken against those \n     countries that violate the World Trade Organization and World \n     Intellectual Property Organization standards; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States of America, the President \n     of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the United States Secretary of \n     Commerce, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual \n     Property in the United States Patent and Trade Office, and \n     the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-360.

The ability to raise \n     sufficient funding to start a business is one of the major \n     hurdles any entrepreneur faces in attempting to create a new \n     company; and\n       Whereas, because the creation of new businesses is \n     fundamental to job creation and a successful economy, making \n     capital more available to start-up companies is a challenge \n     of great significance to our communities and the entire \n     country. In response to the need, Congress has on several \n     occasions enacted measures to encourage the establishment of \n     new business. Congressional tools, including tax incentives \n     for high-risk companies at the early stages of development \n     and other moves that encourage investment in start-up \n     ventures, can be highly beneficial; and\n       Whereas, Michigan is strongly committed to encouraging \n     venture capital investment in this state. Our efforts, \n     however, will not be nearly as effective as they could be \n     without similar leadership from Congress. A multi-pronged \n     effort, with both the states and the national government \n     encouraging private enterprise, can lead to greater \n     innovation in any number of fields. This innovation, a \n     hallmark of American society is critical to the vitality of \n     our national economy as we respond to challenges in an era of \n     great change: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact measures that support venture \n     capital activities in Michigan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-362.

Revisiting the events surrounding the Korean War has \n     brought public attention to many aspects of what some call \n     ``the forgotten war''; and\n       Whereas, unlike other veterans groups, the Korean War \n     Veterans Association does not have a federal charter. Without \n     this charter, this respected organization--the only veterans \n     groups comprised entirely of veterans of the Korean War--\n     cannot provide the same level of services other groups can. \n     This deficiency makes it more difficult for members and \n     families to receive appropriate services; and\n       Whereas, legislation to extend a federal charter to the \n     Korean War Veterans Association is pending in both the House \n     of Representatives (H.R. 1043) and the Senate (S. 478) of the \n     Congress. Enactment of this measure will enable the Korean \n     War Veterans Association to provide a wider range of \n     services, especially the processing of claims. Clearly, this \n     long-overdue status will assist our heroes of the Korean War \n     and express the nation's respect for their sacrifices and \n     honor: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to grant a federal \n     charter to the Korean War Veterans Association; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-363.

A bill to enhance and improve benefits for members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves who serve extended periods on active duty, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation that will support hundreds of thousands \nof Americans who are making great sacrifices for our country. This bill \nwill enhance the benefits that are offered to the brave men and women \nof the National Guard and Reserves and their families when they are \ncalled to service.\n  The latest figures from the Pentagon show that more than 194,000 \nGuard and Reserves are currently serving on active duty. We have come \nto rely greatly on our Guard and Reserve Forces for extended durations. \nIt is now time that we provide them with the support that is available \nto our regular services.\n  Nationwide, we are experiencing the largest activation of Guard and \nReserves since the Korean war. In my home State this is the largest \nactivation of these brave men and women since World War II.\n  Guard and Reserves make up almost 40 percent of the total U.S. force \nin Iraq. They play a critical role in our operations in Afghanistan, \nand they support a tremendous number of our homeland security missions.\n  The Guard's 81st Armor Brigade is sending 3,600 brave Washington \nState citizens to Iraq in the next few weeks. I had the pleasure of \nmeeting with many of these soldiers and their families in early \nJanuary. During my visit with these soldiers, I heard many concerns \nabout the well-being of their families who are going to be left to \nshoulder tremendous responsibilities while they are away. Many were \nconcerned that they would leave before they could help their spouse \nfind affordable child care. Others were concerned that their children \nwould have to go to a new doctor who accepts TRICARE, and that type of \nchange when one parent is overseas and far away can be very scary for a \nyoung child.\n  My visit with the families offered a window into what they are facing \nas their loved ones serve on extended deployments. Their families were \nconcerned about the loss of income between their spouse's civilian \nsalary and their active-duty salary.\n  Some of our activated soldiers were in school. Their families were \nconcerned that they would have to begin repaying student loans while \ntheir loved ones served in Iraq.\n  It is vital that Congress take steps to ensure all members of our \nArmed Forces and their families are taken care of, especially during \nextended active-duty deployments and upon their return home. \nUnfortunately, that has not always been the case. Veterans who \nvolunteered or were drafted to serve our country were promised health \ncare and other benefits. When they returned home they found those \npromises were not kept. In recent years, the administration has barred \ncertain veterans from enrolling in the VA. The President's budget \nrequest for this year would require some veterans to pay additional \nfees for the services they are currently able to receive.\n  This evening, I am introducing a comprehensive piece of legislation \nthat will minimize the challenges at home when members of the Guard and \nReserve leave their jobs, their schools, their homes, and their \nfamilies to protect our homeland and fight terrorism. This legislation \nhelps families by extending the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow \nspouses to take time away from their job to put together a single-\nparent household and prepare for their transition.\n\n  My bill will help Guard and Reserve families with children by \nproviding access to child care, especially during times of extended \nactive duty. This provision would allow nonworking spouses with \nchildren to work while their spouse is being deployed, making child \ncare more affordable.\n  Education is a key part of this proposal. I have heard from Guard \nmembers who are worried that they had to leave their university to go \nto Iraq for a year. We have to ensure that when they return to school \nit will be without penalty, and that their student loans are deferred \nduring their extended deployment.\n  Several soldiers who work in the high-tech field said to me:\n\n       Eighteen months away from my job in the high tech field \n     means that I will not be ready to go back into my position \n     when I return.\n\n  That is why my bill will extend and update the GI Bill benefits for \nGuard and Reserve to keep better pace with the rising costs of \neducation. This will encourage education and provide a competitive edge \nfor Guard and Reserves when they return home to the private sector.\n  My proposal will improve health care coverage by providing access to \nTRICARE for all members of the Guard and Reserves and their families, \nregardless of employment or insurance status. TRICARE only works if you \nare in a community that has TRICARE available. Guard and Reserves who \nare mobilized for extended periods need the option to maintain their \nprivate health care plans. So my proposal provides that option and \ncovers their premiums during periods of extended deployment.\n  Many members of the Guard and Reserves who are mobilized are seeing a \nhuge decrease in their pay while they serve our country on active duty. \nMy proposal ensures pay equity for Federal employees called to duty and \nprovides tax credits to employers to encourage their support of \nactivated Guard and Reserves.\n  My proposal also reduces the age for Guard and Reserves to receive \nretirement pay to age 55.\n  I am very concerned that we are burning up our Guard and Reserve \nunits by placing a serious strain on their families and their finances. \nThese brave men and women need the same kind of support that our \nregular services have when they are called away from their families and \ntheir jobs for extended deployments. By addressing these shortfalls \nnow, we give the Guard and Reserves a valuable tool for recruiting and \nretaining the best and the brightest soldiers in the world.\n  This bill tells our Guard and Reserve members that they can serve our \ncountry overseas, even on long deployments, and know that their \nfamilies will be financially secure and able to get child care and \nhealth care. Spouses can take time off from work to prepare for a long \ndeployment. In addition, Guard members won't lose their place at a \nuniversity, and they won't be charged interest or have to repay loans \nuntil they resume their studies.\n  I hope we can pass this bill and do everything we can to lessen the \nburden\n\n[[Page S1289]]\n\non Americans who are already sacrificing so much for our security. We \nare asking so much of our Guard and Reserve members and their families. \nWe have an obligation to make it easier for their spouses and children \nduring these extended long deployments.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and help us move \nit quickly through the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL:\n  S. 2070. A bill to amend the Animal Health Protection Act to direct \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to implement the United States Animal \nIdentification Plan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) the authority to \nimplement the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP) for livestock, as \nwell as strengthen existing laws that protect against the spread of \ndisease in livestock.\n  Consumers in the U.S. and around the world must have confidence in \nour food supply. The discovery of the first case of Bovine Spongiform \nEncephalopathy (BSE) in the United States has raised serious concerns \nregarding the effectiveness of current U.S. disease management measures \nas well as closed U.S. beef markets overseas.\n  For years there have been efforts to develop a national animal \nidentification plan. The National Identification Task Force was created \nin 2002. The task force brought together livestock industry \nrepresentatives with USDA to participate in the development of a \ncomprehensive plan known as the United States Animal Identification \nPlan (USAIP). The final development and implementation of this plan is \nneeded now to bolster confidence in the U.S. livestock industry.\n  In a recent briefing regarding the completion of the investigation \ninto the U.S. BSE case, Dr. Ron DeHaven, Chief Veterinary Officer with \nUSDA, referring to the unfound cattle from Canada, was quoted as \nsaying, ``Many of those animals were moved into the United States a \nnumber of years ago, and so because of that timeframe some of the paper \ntrail has gotten cold.'' A national animal identification plan would \nensure the trail would not go cold in the future.\n  My legislation will direct USDA to focus its resources on \nimplementing the USAIP for beef and dairy cattle to ensure a disease \ntracking system is in place in a timely manner. This bill also provides \nfinancial assistance to aid in the cost of producer compliance.\n  In addition, this legislation directs the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) to strengthen the enforcement of current livestock \nfeed ban laws. This measure will help control disease threats to U.S. \nlivestock, provide privacy protection for the information collected and \nused in the plan, and implement an effective plan for tracking animals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2070\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the definition of immediate relative for \npurposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kennedy to \nintroduce the Family Reunification Act, a measure designed to remedy a \nregrettable injustice in our immigration laws. A minor oversight in the \nlaw has led to an unfortunate, and likely unintended, consequence. \nParents of U.S. citizens are currently able to enter the country as \nlegal permanent residents, but our laws do not permit their minor \nchildren to join them. Simply put, the Family Reunification Act will \nclose this loophole by including the minor siblings of U.S. citizens in \nthe definition of ``immediate relative.'' This legislation will ensure \nthat our immigration laws can better accomplish one of the most \nimportant policy goals behind them--the goal of strengthening the \nfamily unit.\n  Congress took an important first step in promoting family \nreunification when it enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act. By \nqualifying as ``immediate relatives,'' this law currently offers \nparents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens the ability to obtain \nimmigrant visas to enter this country legally.\n  This we can all agree is good immigration policy. Unfortunately, a\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\n``glitch'' in this law has put numerous families in an uncomfortable \npredicament. One of these unlucky families lives in my home Sate of \nWisconsin. Effiong and Ekom Okon, both U.S. citizens by birth and \ngraduates of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, requested that their \nparents be admitted to the United States from Nigeria as ``immediate \nrelatives.'' The law clearly allows for this. Their father, Leo Okon, \nhas already joined them in Wisconsin, and their mother, Grace, is \ncurrently in possession of an immigrant visa. However, Grace is unable \nto join her husband and sons in the United States because her six-year-\nold daughter, Daramfon, does not qualify as an ``immediate relative'' \nunder current immigration law. Because it would be unthinkable for her \nto abandon her small child, Grace has been forced to stay behind in \nNigeria, separated from the rest of her family.\n  This family is truly an American success story, one of first-\ngeneration citizens graduating from a top University. They want to \ncontinue to contribute to society and want to bring their family with \nthem. Unfortunately, current immigration law only permits some members \nof their immediate family to join them, but not all. This is clearly \nwrong.\n  It is difficult to determine the scope of this problem. Because minor \nsiblings do not qualify for visas, the Department of Homeland Security \ndoes not keep track of how many families have been adversely affected. \nHowever, DHS employees have assured us that the Okons are not unique. \nIn fact, this is an all too common occurrence. If only one family \nsuffers because of this loophole, changes must be made. The fact that \nthere have been numerous cases demands changes now.\n  Many parts of our immigration laws are outdated, unfair, and in need \nof repair. The definition of ``immediate relative'' is no different. \nCongress' intent when it grated ``immediate relatives'' the right to \nobtain immigrant visas was to promote family reunification, but the \nunfortunate oversight highlighted has interfered with many families' \nopportunities to do just that. The legislation introduced today would \nexpand the definition of ``immediate relatives'' to include the minor \nsiblings of U.S. citizens. By doing so, we can truly provide these \nfamilies with the ability to reunite and the chance to take advantage \nof the many great opportunities our country has to offer. This is a \nsimple and modest solution to an unthinkable problem that too many \nfamilies have already had to face.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2071\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The SECURE Act \nprovides eligible taxpayers with a non-refundable tax credit equal to \n50 percent of qualified expenses incurred on behalf of senior citizens \nabove a $1,000 spending floor.\n   The Senate Special Committee on Aging has held several hearings on \ndifferent facets of the growing long-term care crisis in this country. \nA major concern of mine is that the Federal long-term care policy mix \nmay not have the right incentives--especially when it comes to the \ntough choices faced by families who want to care for their frail and \naging relatives.\n  Earlier this week, we held a hearing in the Senate Special Committee \non Aging on a growing issue of national importance--the issue of family \ncaregiving for America's seniors.\n  Witnesses at the hearing highlighted the emotional stress and \nfinancial challenges faced by family caregivers of aging and vulnerable \nrelatives; and testified favorably about the SECURE Act. Trudy Elliott, \na witness at the hearing from North Idaho, talked about the stress and \nfinancial challenges she and her husband faced while caring for her \nmother, sister, and father. Her testimony was very moving. Mrs. \nElliott, who also works for a company in the home health field, \ntestified that her experience was not unique. More and more families \nare facing the stress and financial difficulties that come with caring \nfor their aging parents.\n  It is critical to note that families, not government, provide 80 \npercent of long-term care for older persons in the United States. This \nis an enormous strength of our long-term care system. The U.S. \nAdministration on Aging reports that about 22 million people serve as \ninformal caregivers for seniors with at least one limitation on their \nactivities of daily living.\n  These caregivers often face extreme stress and financial burden--\nespecially those we call the sandwich generation. The sandwich \ngeneration refers to those sandwiched between caring for their aging \nparents and caring for their own children.\n  It is difficult for families to balance caring for children and \nsaving or paying for college, while at the same time struggling with \nfinancing care for frail and aging parents.\n  The SECURE Act should not preclude seniors or those near retirement \nfrom purchasing long-term care insurance. The Act provides tax relief \nfor high-risk seniors who cannot qualify for long-term care insurance \npolicies.\n  For many families, the nursing home is the only solution for \nproviding long-term care, and that can be a good choice. For other \nfamilies, keeping aging and vulnerable relatives in their own home or \nin the caregiver's home makes sense.\n  An that is why I am introducing the SECURE Act. Families facing high \nlevels of stress and eldercare expenses deserve tax relief as they \nfreely care for their frail and aging parents.\n  We also heard from witnesses at the Aging Committee hearing that the \nSECURE Act will increase the eldercare choices available to families \nand has the potential to reduce the number of seniors forced to spend \ndown their nest-egg in order to qualify for Medicaid services.\n  Family caregiving for aging and vulnerable relatives requires a \nflexible national response to ensure seniors and their families have \nthe most appropriate high quality choices.\n  I invite my colleagues to cosponsor this compassionate legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a brief description \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2072\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act \nto include each year of fellowship training in geriatric medicine or \ngeriatric psychiatry as a year of obligated service under the National \nHealth Corps Loan Repayment Program; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as our Nation's 76 million Baby Boomers near \nretirement age, the number of Americans over age 65 will double to 70 \nmillion--one-fifth of the population. Americans older than 85 represent \nthe fastest growing segment of this population and membership in this \nonce exclusive demographic group is projected to grow from four million \nAmericans today to an estimated 19 million by 2050.\n  Unfortunately, our health care system is ill prepared to handle the \nstrain of this enormous senior population, largely because we have a \ncritical shortage of geriatricians. Fewer than 9,000 geriatricians \npractice in the U.S., far below the 20,000 or more needed to \neffectively care for the Nation's booming population of seniors. \nIronically, the number of geriatricians is expected to shrink as many \nof these doctors retire at the same time baby boomers start qualifying \nfor Medicare in large numbers.\n  America must plan for the burdens the baby boomers demographic shift \nwill place on our health care system and health care providers. Our \nfirst step is ensuring the country has an adequate number of well-\ntrained geriatricians.\n  I first introduced legislation to address the national shortage of \ngeriatricians during the 105th Congress. While I am encouraged that \ngreater attention has been focused on this issue, little has been \naccomplished to improve the shortage of geriatricians.\n  Today, I am re-introducing legislation that will encourage more \ndoctors to become certified in geriatrics. The Geriatricians Loan \nForgiveness Act would forgive $20,000 of education debt incurred by \nmedical students for each year of advanced training required to obtain \na certificate of added qualifications in geriatric medicine or \npsychiatry.\n  Geriatric medicine is the foundation of a comprehensive health plan \nfor our most vulnerable seniors. Geriatrics, by focusing on assessment \nand care coordination, promotes preventive care and improves patients' \nquality of life by allowing them greater independence and eliminating \nunnecessary and costly trips to the hospital or institutions. But this \nkind of specialized care is complicated and demanding. Many doctors \ninclined to study and practice geriatric medicine are dissuaded from \ndoing so because treating the elderly takes more time and carries \nfinancial disincentives for doctors.\n  Medical training takes time, so we need to lay the groundwork now to \nhave enough qualified geriatricians in place in ten years from now. \nThis legislation is a commonsense approach and cost-effective \ninvestment. We must take these steps today to meet our needs for \ntomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2075\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide direct congressional access to the office of the Chief Actuary \nin the Centers for Medicare & Medicated Services; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Congressional \nAccess to the CMS Chief Actuary Act of 2004.\n  This legislation provides Congress with greater access to cost \nestimates and other data produced and collected by the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary. The Office \nof the Actuary is a group of about 50 actuaries, economists, and other \nhealth professionals who provide non-partisan analyses of Medicare and \nother federally financed health care programs.\n  Recently we learned that the administration's cost estimate of the \nMedicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 \nis $534 billion over 10 years, nearly $140 billion higher than the \nestimates produced by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Contrary \nto statements by some members of the administration, Congress did not \nhave this estimate when it voted on this bill.\n  It would be disingenuous of me to state that the higher cost estimate \nis my biggest concern. I have voted in the past for prescription drug \nbills estimated to cost more than $534 billion. And in the conference \nnegotiations on this bill, I urged my colleagues to make changes until \nthe final hours of the negotiations that would have added additional \ncosts to the legislation.\n  My greatest concern with the higher estimate is one of transparency. \nMore specifically, I am concerned about the degree to which access to \nthe CMS career actuaries has been restricted by this administration. \nHad Congress been able to freely communicate with the career actuaries \nduring last year's Medicare negotiations, it would not have been \nsurprised by the higher estimates. Moreover, I believe that input from \nthe CMS actuaries could have informed the conferees and perhaps \nimproved certain aspects of the bill in a positive way. And why \nshouldn't Congress have access to all available information on \nlegislation under consideration?\n  The restrictions placed on congressional access to the CMS actuary is \nin clear violation of the report language that was included in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97). The 1997 BBA established the \nOffice of the Actuary within CMS, which was then called the Health Care \nFinancing Administration. Report language accompanying the legislation \nstated, ``The independence of the Office of the Actuary with respect to \nproviding assistance to the Congress is vital. The process of \nmonitoring, updating, and reforming the Medicare and Medicaid programs \nis greatly enhanced by the free flow of actuarial information from the \nOffice of the Actuary to the committees of jurisdiction in the \nCongress.''\n  While Congress intended that the Office of the Actuary would provide \nit with cost and other data as requested, a free flow of information \nhas not occurred--particularly over the past year. I requested, as well \nas several of my colleagues, information from the Office of Actuary \nthroughout last year's Medicare deliberations; however, our requests \nwere unfulfilled. I do not fault the professionals in the Office of the \nActuary. Rather, I believe the lack of response was the result of \ninappropriate restrictions placed on the office by administration \npolitical officials.\n  In order for Congress to craft good legislation, we need access to \nthe most up-to-date actuarial and cost information. CBO will always \nremain Congress's official score-keeper. But a second independent \nassessment is critical, particularly if the two estimates differ, as \nwas the case of the recent Medicare legislation. Congress needs to \nunderstand the reasons for the differences, and only then can it make \nfully-informed decisions. And again, I ask, why shouldn't Congress have \naccess to all available information on legislation under consideration?\n  The legislation that I introduce today is very simple. It codifies \nthe 1997 BBA report language to require that Congress have direct and \nopen access to information and estimates produced by the independent \nCMS career actuaries. The bill's purpose is to improve Congress's \nability to write good legislation and to make well-informed decisions.\n  I want to be clear. The administration's higher cost-estimate does \nnot change my support of this Medicare legislation. I continue to be a \nproud supporter of the bill.\n  But I have also pledged to work to improve its flaws and to address \nits shortcomings. Any efforts to improve this bill will require \nvigilant oversight of its implementation and will require having access \nto the latest information about the program's participation, payment, \nand costs. The CMS career actuaries will play a fundamental role in the \ndata collection. The administration's past practices of restricting and \ncensoring this information cannot continue.\n  This bill is about improving transparency in government and decision \nmaking. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Office of National Drug Control Policy \nAct Reauthorization Act of 1998 to ensure that adequate funding is \nprovided for certain high intensity drug trafficking areas; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nwhich will help America's families who are fighting to drive drugs and \nviolence out of their communities.\n\n[[Page S1293]]\n\n  The Dawson Family Community Protection Act of 2004 asks the Federal \nGovernment to do its fair share by devoting some of its drug fighting \nresources to communities with high intensity drug trafficking and \nsevere safety concerns. That means dedicating much needed resources to \nhelp communities fight the infiltration of drugs and the drug dealers \nthat plague their communities and threaten the safety of their \nchildren.\n  This bill is named in memory of a heroic Baltimore family--the \nDawsons--whose active role in trying to rid their neighborhood of drugs \nand violence cost them their lives. Carnell and Angela Dawson lived in \nthe community of Oliver in East Baltimore and raised five children \nthere.\n  Every day Angela, known as ``Angel,'' walked her children to school, \nshe made sure that they only rode their bikes on the sidewalk so they \nwould be safe. Her husband, Carnell, worked hard as a construction \nworker to provide for his family. Both parents were devoted to their \nchildren and wanted to make a better life for them.\n  The house they lived in on the corner of N. Eden Street made Angel \nnervous. It had too many windows and she was scared that a stray bullet \nwould come in and harm one of her children. The street also worried \nAngel. There were lots of young teens dealing drugs. She wanted the \ndrugs out of her neighborhood, away from her children and away from all \nthe neighbors' children. She fought every day to make that happen, \ncalling the police when she saw dealers, or violence on her block. She \nwas persistent and the neighbors knew it. They called her a great \nmother--``someone who stood up for what she believed in.'' Sadly, that \npersistence and those beliefs cost her and her family their lives.\n  Angel had repeatedly called the police in September of 2002 to report \ndrug activity. Then on October 3--someone threw two Molotov cocktails \nthrough the kitchen window of their house--causing a fire but no \ninjuries. They were sending a message. Two weeks later that message was \nunmistakable as someone broke through their front door and poured \ngasoline throughout the first floor of their house and lit a match. \nWithin minutes the house was in flames and it was impossible to escape. \nAlthough fire fighters arrived almost immediately--they could not save \nthe family. Angel and five of her children had perished and her husband \nCarnell had jumped from the second story with burns all over his body--\nhe survived only a week in the hospital.\n  Many in the neighborhood thought it was the final message.\n  The Dawsons are the kind of neighbors we all would want. They cared \nabout the community and wanted to make it better and safer. They \nrepresent brave families all over America who are trying to take back \ntheir neighborhoods, who have worked with law enforcement and their \nneighbors to make their communities safer.\n  Too many of these families have had to face threats and retaliation \nand sadly even murder in their attempt to help their loved ones and \nneighbors. They work hard, send their kids to school to get an \neducation and play by the rules--yet they live in communities that are \nunsafe because they are infested with drugs and drug dealers.\n  We need to get assistance to these communities, as they are working \nhard to make life better, they need the resources of law enforcement \nand government to make that a reality. We have to help communities that \nare trying to help themselves, communities that are trying get rid of \ndrugs, rehabilitate and educate drug dealers and most importantly end \nviolence and protect their neighborhood children.\n  That is why today, I join with my colleagues, Senator Sarbanes, Hatch \nand Biden in introducing this legislation that provides $5 million to \nhigh intensity drug traffic areas with severe safety and illegal drug \ndistribution problems--to support communities that are affected by drug \ntrafficking and to encourage their cooperation with local, State and \nFederal law enforcement officials.\n  These funds also help to protect families that cooperate, families \nthat report crimes and drugs and families that seek to make a \ndifference in their communities. These resources help law enforcement \nprovide witness protection and address safety issues in these \ncommunities. The funding only goes to neighborhoods--like the East \nBaltimore neighborhood that the Dawson's lived in--with severe \nneighborhood safety and illegal drug distribution problems.\n  For these communities it's time for the Federal Government to step up \nand do more, especially when average citizens put their lives on the \nline every day trying to stop the violence and crime that comes when \nthe illegal drug trade invades their neighborhoods.\n  This bill will give citizens and law enforcement the tools they need \nto make sure the community is safe and those doing the reporting are \nprotected. In honor of the Dawson family, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2081\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dawson Family Community \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the early morning hours of October 16, 2002, the \n     home of Carnell and Angela Dawson was firebombed in apparent \n     retaliation for Mrs. Dawson's notification of police about \n     persistent drug distribution activity in their East Baltimore \n     City neighborhood.\n       (2) The arson claimed the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Dawson and \n     their 5 young children, aged 9 to 14.\n       (3) The horrific murder of the Dawson family is a stark \n     example of domestic narco-terrorism.\n       (4) In all phases of counter-narcotics law enforcement--\n     from prevention to investigation to prosecution to reentry--\n     the voluntary cooperation of ordinary citizens is a critical \n     component.\n       (5) Voluntary cooperation is difficult for law enforcement \n     officials to obtain when citizens feel that cooperation \n     carries the risk of violent retaliation by illegal drug \n     trafficking organizations and their affiliates.\n       (6) Public confidence that law enforcement is doing all it \n     can to make communities safe is a prerequisite for voluntary \n     cooperation among people who may be subject to intimidation \n     or reprisal (or both).\n       (7) Witness protection programs are insufficient on their \n     own to provide security because many individuals and families \n     who strive every day to make distressed neighborhoods livable \n     for their children, other relatives, and neighbors will \n     resist or refuse offers of relocation by local, State, and \n     Federal prosecutorial agencies and because, moreover, the \n     continued presence of strong individuals and families is \n     critical to preserving and strengthening the social fabric in \n     such communities.\n       (8) Where (as in certain sections of Baltimore City) \n     interstate trafficking of illegal drugs has severe ancillary \n     local consequences within areas designated as High Intensity \n     Drug Trafficking Areas, it is important that supplementary \n     HIDTA Program funds be committed to support initiatives aimed \n     at making the affected communities safe for the residents of \n     those communities and encouraging their cooperation with \n     local, State, and Federal law enforcement efforts to combat \n     illegal drug trafficking.\n\n     SEC. 3. FUNDING FOR CERTAIN HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING \n                   AREAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 707(d) of the Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy Act Reauthorization Act of 1998 (21 \n     U.S.C. 1706(d); Public Law 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-670) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Authorization and Use of Funds.--\n       ``(1) Authorization.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated $5,000,000 to be used in high intensity drug \n     trafficking areas with severe neighborhood safety and illegal \n     drug distribution problems to--\n       ``(A) ensure the safety of neighborhoods and the protection \n     of communities, including the prevention of the intimidation \n     of potential witnesses of illegal drug distribution and \n     related activities; and\n       ``(B) combat illegal drug trafficking through such methods \n     as the Director considers appropriate, such as establishing \n     or operating (or both) a toll-free telephone hotline for use \n     by the public to provide information about illegal drug-\n     related activities.\n       ``(2) Use of funds.--The Director shall ensure that no \n     Federal funds appropriated for the High Intensity Drug \n     Trafficking Program are expended for the establishment or \n     expansion of drug treatment programs.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2083. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to protect consumers in \nmanaged care plans and other health coverage; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation \nand Harvard School of Public Health survey of non-elderly Americans \nwith private health insurance, one-half reported that they had a \nproblem with their health insurance plans in the previous year. They \ncited delays and denials of coverage or care as their two most common \nproblems. They also said they worried that if they became sick, their \nhealth plans would be more concerned about saving money than providing \nthe best treatment. For those in managed care plans, such as HMOs, over \ntwo-thirds had this concern.\n  And they have good reason to be concerned. Let me tell you about two \nof the many people, who were hurt when HMO decided it needed to save \nmoney. Ruby Calad had a hysterectomy and her doctor recommended that \nshe stay in the hospital longer than a day. Cigna, Ruby's insurance \ncompany said one day was enough. So Ruby went home, but she was soon in \nthe emergency room because she had developed serious complications. Had \nRuby been able to stay in the hospital longer, as recommended by her \ndoctor, this would not have happened.\n  Juan Davila suffers from diabetes and arthritis. His doctor \nprescribed VIOXX for his arthritis because it had a lower rate of \nbleeding and ulcers than drugs on the formulary developed by Aetna. But \ninstead of approving the VIOXX, Juan was required to enter a step \nprogram and try two other medications before VIOXX could be approved. \nHe was given naprosyn--a cheaper drug--and three weeks later was rushed \nto the hospital. He had developed bleeding ulcers, which caused a heart \nattack and internal bleeding. Juan survived but now cannot take any \npain medication that is absorbed by the stomach.\n  These examples show why medical decisions should be made by doctors, \nnot HMO bureaucrats, and in 2001, the Senate, in a bipartisan vote of \n59-36, passed S. 1052, the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act to make \nsure that happened. Yet, intransigence from the House leadership and \nthe White House prevented that bill from becoming law. Nearly 3 years \nlater, we still have not acted. So, today, I am introducing the exact \nsame bipartisan bill that passed in the Senate in 2001.\n  This bill provides comprehensive protections to all Americans in all \nhealth plans. It says to all Americans who have health insurance, you \nhave rights and protections. It says to HMOs, you have responsibilities \nand will be held accountable for your wrongful and harmful actions.\n  This bill ensures that patients have the right to have medical \ndecisions made by their doctors and not HMO bureaucrats. Patients will \nhave the right to see a specialist and go to the closest emergency room \nfor treatment. They will be able to keep the same doctor throughout \ntheir medical treatment and appeal adverse claim decisions to an \nindependent reviewer. And if they are injured by a decision made by the \nHMO, they will have the right to hold their HMO accountable in a court.\n  A meaningful patients bill of rights is long overdue. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Hutchison, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. \n        Voinovich):\n  S. 2084.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act take effect November 1, \n     2003.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation \nintroduced today that will reinstate a moratorium on State and local \ntaxation of access to the Internet. Senators Alexander and Carper have \nworked very hard to craft legislation that will protect Americans from \nbeing taxed for using the Internet, while still respecting the States' \nneed to raise revenue from traditional telecommunications taxes. As a \nfellow former Governor, I have been pleased to join them in this effort \nand hope that all of my colleagues who have supported a moratorium on \ntaxation of Internet access will support this bill.\n  Until last fall, there was a moratorium in place prohibiting taxation \nof Internet access. Unfortunately, that lapsed before Congress was able \nto craft an extension. One of the reasons that extending the moratorium \nhas been difficult is that we want to apply the lessons learned over \nthe last few years. For example, the previous moratorium was not \ntechnology-neutral. That is, people who accessed the Internet using a \nDSL connection were not always treated the same as those who used dial-\nup service or a cable modem. This was clearly an unintended consequence \nof the way that the previous legislation was drafted. In addition, over \nthe last few years, we have seen many States struggle with enormous \nbudget deficits. Recognizing that a downturn in the economy can \ncompromise a state's ability to provide vital services, including \nschools, firefighters, and police officers, we do not want to undermine \nany state's revenue base.\n  With these lessons in mind, Senators Alexander, Carper and others \nhave crafted an extension of the previous moratorium that would ensure \nthat no States impose new taxes on Internet access. The legislation \nspecifically requires that all technologies be treated equally. And \nbecause the moratorium is limited to 2 years, it ensures that Congress \nwill revisit the issue periodically as technologies develop and \ncircumstances change.\n  As a former Governor, I do not take lightly any Federal action that \nlimits the options available to local and State elected officials I \nrecognize how hard it is to balance a State budget and am only willing \nto support a moratorium on Internet access taxes because I believe that \nwe are dealing with a unique new service. The Internet has the power to \nconnect Americans as the radio, telephone, and television did for \nprevious generations. By sending e-mails, telecommuting, or banking \nonline, Americans are communicating in a new way that makes our economy \nmore productive and enhances our quality of life. If sparing Internet \naccess from taxation increasing the ability of low and moderate income \nAmericans to join the technology revolution, then it is certainly a \nworthy public policy goal.\n  Now, Senators Allen and Wyden have offered an alternative approach. \nThey have proposed legislation that would permanently bar States ad \ncities from taxing Internet access, and they have defined the service \nbroadly that many experts believe it will undermine some \ntelecommunications taxes on which States currently depend. I am not \ninterested in providing enormous tax breaks to the telecommunications \nindustry, and so I oppose their approach. Taxes that businesses \ncurrently pay to access the Internet backbone are reasonable costs of \ndoing business. I hope that my colleagues will not be intimidated by \nclaims that those of us who oppose tax breaks for telecommuncations \ncompanies actually want to tax people's e-mails. That is a false \nargument, and anyone who resorts to it is surely trying to avoid the \ndifficult issues that are addressed by the bill introduced today by \nSenators Alexander and Carper.\n  I would like to make one final point to my colleagues, and that is \nabout fallibility. Every day we get fresh evidence that things are not \nalways as they seemed and that we do not, in fact, know everything we \nthought we knew. If fallibility is part of being human, then surely it \nis part of any legislative body. If the moratorium that Congress had \nimposed 5 years ago had been permanent, then we would have had a \ndifficult time reopening the issue to address the fact that certain \ntechnologies were not protected under the act. We ought not make that \nmistake now by thinking that we can accurately foresee the exciting \ntechnological developments on the horizon. It is appropriate for \nCongress to revisit this issue in two years, as the Alexander-Carper \nproposal allows.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in support of a new \ntemporary moratorium on Internet access taxes. Enacting this \nlegislation quickly will ensure that Americans are not hit with any \ntaxes when they try to log on.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 2085. A bill to modify the requirements of the land conveyance to \nthe University of Nevada at Las Vegas Research Foundation; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Ensign \nto introduce the University of Nevada at Las Vegas Research Foundation \nReinvestment Act, which enhances the long-term viability of the \nUniversity of Nevada at Las Vegas by allowing proceeds from leases of \nthe University of Nevada at Las Vegas Research Foundation property to \nbe reinvested.\n  Mr. President, through provisions of the Southern Nevada Public Land \nManagement Act of 1998, the Clark County Department of Aviation \nacquired land that was formerly owned by the Federal Government. A \nsubsequent law, the Clark County Conservation of Public Land and \nNatural Resources Act of 2002, transferred this land to the University \nof Las Vegas Research Foundation for construction of a research park \nand technology center.\n  Under current law, only 10 percent of the proceeds from the sale, \nlease, or conveyance of this land may be reinvested. This restriction \nhinders efforts to promote research and development at the research \npark.\n  Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing today amends the Clark \nCounty Conservation of Public Land and Natural Resources Act of 2002 to \nallow the proceeds of the Foundation's research park leases to be used \nto carry out the foundation's research mission.\n  The foundation's research park and technology center in the greater \nLas Vegas area will enhance the research mission of the university, \nincreasing the potential for the high-tech industry and \nentrepreneurship in the State. It provides the public with \nopportunities for high-tech education and research, and at the same \ntime provides the State with opportunities for competition and economic \ndevelopment in the high-tech field. It is imperative that sufficient \nfunds are always available to maintain and enhance the center.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2085\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Credits; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, today, I am introducing \nlegislation that increases the Federal commitment to help families meet \nthe increasing costs of higher education.\n  In today's economy--as well as with life in general--getting a higher \neducation is essential. A college educated male worker can expect to \nearn $29,000 more each year than his counterpart without such \neducation. Over a working career, this edge results in more than $1 \nmillion. For women, the importance is even more pronounced. A college-\neducated woman can expect to earn twice what her counterpart with only \na high school diploma will earn (Condition of Education 2000, U.S. \nDepartment of Education). Perhaps Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan \nput it best when he said ``we must ensure that our whole population \nreceives an education that will allow full and continuing participation \nin this dynamic period of American economic history.''\n  Having college-educated parents also forms the foundation for better \nlives for their children. Census data reveals that children of college-\neducated parents are twice as likely to go to college, as are those \nwith parents who did not go to college. Research also suggest that \nchildren of college-educated parents are healthier and perform better \nacademically than children of those with only a high school diploma.\n  Recognizing the importance of an advanced degree is only part of the \nbattle. Attendance at a college or university is an expensive \nproposition for most American families. Worse yet, it is getting even \nmore expensive. According to the Congressional Research Service, \nincreases in tuition over the last twenty years on a constant dollar \nbasis have outpaced growth in the average household's income. The \ndifficulty of paying for college is particularly acute for lower-income \nfamilies. In 1980, college costs consumed 32 percent of the average \nhousehold income for a family in the lowest income quintile. By 2000, \nthe percentage of that family's income needed to pay for college \nincreased to 56 percent.\n  In the 2001-2002 school year, about $90 billion was awarded in \nstudent aid. The Federal Government provided seventy percent of this \naid through appropriations, guaranteed loans, and tax credits. Although \nthis $90 billion represents a substantial increase in the amount of aid \nprovided by the Federal Government from just ten years ago, the Federal \nGovernment can and should do more.\n  A recent report by the Congressional Budget Office examined the cost \nof attending colleges and universities and how those costs are borne. \nCBO estimates that the average annual cost of attendance at public \nfour-year colleges in the 1999-2000 academic year was nearly $11,300 \nafter taking into consideration that portion of the costs that are \ncovered by the institutions themselves or as a subsidy from State \nlegislatures. Parents and students on average are responsible for \nnearly three-quarters of this amount, which is a significant financial \nhurdle, particularly for low-income families.\n  Under current law the maximum credit available under the HOPE \nScholarship tax credit program is $1,500 assuming the student has at \nleast $2,000 of tuition costs. The bill I am introducing increases the \ncredit percentage to 100 percent of tuition costs and increases the \nmaximum credit available to $2,500.\n  Second, the bill extends the HOPE Scholarship credit to cover four \nyears of higher education. It recognizes that our economy increasingly \ndemands that tomorrow's worker has a college degree, and to get such a \ndegree requires at least four years. We shouldn't have a program \ndesigned to assist students in obtaining those degrees that abandons \nthem mid-stream.\n  Third, the legislation makes the HOPE credit refundable. \nRefundability is the only way to provide financial assistance through \nthe tax code to families with low incomes. And that assistance is \nsorely needed. According to CBO the HOPE tax credit amounts to $147 of \nassistance, on average, for families with income less than $30,000.\n  Finally, the bill creates a mechanism by which families can get the \nbenefits of the credit sooner than it is currently available. Today, \nfamilies must pay the tuition costs and then file for the credit in \nApril of the following year when they file their income tax returns. \nThe bill directs Treasury to create a program that would allow it to \ntransfer the value of the credit directly to an educational institution \non behalf of the taxpayer. A similar mechanism is currently available \nto those eligible for the tax credit for health insurance costs.\n  The bill I am introducing today focuses on those students who follow \na more traditional path to higher education. I will be introducing \nseparate legislation in the near future that makes changes to the \nLifetime Learning credit designed to make it more useful for \n``nontraditional'' students.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Corzine, Ms. \n        Landrieu, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 2088. A bill to restore, reaffirm, and reconcile legal rights and \nremedies under civil rights statutes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues, \nSenators Daschle, Reid, Leahy, Dodd, Harkin, Kerry, Feingold, Mikulski, \nSchumer, Murray, Durbin, Edwards, Clinton, Sarbanes, Lautenberg, \nCorzine, Landrieu, and Cantwell today in introducing the ``Fairness and \nIndividual Rights Necessary to Ensure a Stronger Society: the Civil \nRights Act of 2004''. This legislation, the ``Fairness Act,'' is vital \nto realizing the full promise of, the numerous Federal laws that have \nbeen enacted to guarantee civil rights and fair labor practices for all \nour citizens.\n  2004 is an especially significant year in commemorating the historic \nlandmarks in America's struggle for civil rights. On January 15, we \ncelebrated the 75th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King. \nOn May 17, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Supreme \nCourt's historic decision in Brown v. Board of Education. And on July \n2, we will celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964.\n  These historic milestones make this year not only a time for \ncelebration, but also a time to reaffirm our commitment to the cause of \ncivil rights, which is still the unfinished business of America. We \nmust continue moving toward the goal for which so many have given so \nmuch across the years. The bipartisan civil rights laws that have been \nenacted over the past forty years have made our Nation stronger, \nbetter, and fairer. Civil rights is at its heart the ongoing, daily \nstruggle to live up to what is best about America--our fundamental \nbelief in equal opportunity and equal justice for all.\n  The Fairness Act is part of that continuing effort. Its goal is to \nguarantee that victims of discrimination and unfair labor practices \nhave access to the courts when necessary to enforce their rights and to \nobtain effective remedies. As Congress has long realized, full \nenforcement of civil rights and fair labor practices is possible only \nif individuals are able to petition the courts. Our proposals will \nstrengthen existing protections, often in cases where the courts have \nlet us down by adopting unacceptably narrow interpretations of existing \nlaw. We recognize as well that Congress has not always made its intent \nclear in enacting specific and detailed provisions of these laws.\n  Unfortunately, recent court decisions have limited the private right \nto seek relief and to obtain effective remedies under many of our civil \nrights and labor laws. Cases like Alexander v. Sandoval and Kimel v. \nFlorida Board of Regents have effectively closed the courthouse door on \nmany persons seeking relief they deserve from discriminatory practices.\n  Key elements of our proposals will make it easier for working women \nto enforce their right to equal pay for equal work. We enhance \nprotections against discrimination in federally funded services and \nenact needed safeguards for students who are harassed because of their \nnational origin, gender, race, or disability. We also make\n\n[[Page S1297]]\n\nsure that victims of discrimination and unfair labor practices can \nreceive meaningful damages where appropriate. Our legislation will \nallow enable members of our armed forces to enforce their federal right \nto be free from discrimination by States because of their military \nstatus.\n  In addition, our proposals will ensure that older workers who suffer \nage discrimination are not denied the chance to seek relief merely \nbecause they work for a state government. We also stop employers from \nrequiring workers to sign away their right to bring discrimination \nclaims and fair labor claims to court, in order to get a job or keep a \njob.\n  These and other important proposals included in the Fairness Act are \nan essential part of our commitment to make Dr. King's dream a reality \nfor everyone in every community in our country.\n  To those who say that now is not the time to seek this new progress, \nwe reply, as Dr. King himself replied, now is always the time for civil \nrights. We know our cause is just. As Dr. King reminded us, ``the arc \nof the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.'' I urge \nall of my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2088\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) This subtitle is made necessary by a decision of the \n     Supreme Court in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001) \n     that significantly impairs statutory protections against \n     discrimination that Congress has erected over a period of \n     almost 4 decades. The Sandoval decision undermines these \n     statutory protections by stripping victims of discrimination \n     (defined under regulations that Congress required Federal \n     departments and agencies to promulgate to implement title VI \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.)) of \n     the right to bring action in Federal court to redress the \n     discrimination and by casting doubt on the validity of the \n     regulations themselves.\n       (2) The Sandoval decision attacks settled expectations \n     created by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX \n     of the Education Amendments of 1972 (also known as the \n     ``Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act'') \n     (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 \n     (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.), and section 504 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) (collectively \n     referred to in this Act as the `covered civil rights \n     provisions'). The covered civil rights provisions were \n     designed to establish and make effective the rights of \n     persons to be free from discrimination on the part of \n     entities that are subject to 1 or more of the covered civil \n     rights provisions, as appropriate (referred to in this Act as \n     `covered entities'). In 1964 Congress adopted title VI of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ensure that Federal dollars would \n     not be used to subsidize or support programs or activities \n     that discriminated on racial, color, or national origin \n     grounds. In the years that followed, Congress extended these \n     protections by enacting laws barring discrimination in \n     federally funded activities on the basis of sex in title IX \n     of the Education Amendments of 1972, age in the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975, and disability in section 504 of \n     the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n       (3) From the outset, Congress and the executive branch made \n     clear that the regulatory process would be used to ensure \n     broad protections for beneficiaries of the law. The first \n     regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice under \n     title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et \n     seq.) forbade the use of ``criteria or methods of \n     administration which have the effect of subjecting \n     individuals to discrimination . . .'' (section 80.3 of title \n     45, Code of Federal Regulations) and prohibited retaliation \n     against persons participating in litigation or administrative \n     resolution of charges of discrimination brought under the \n     Act. These regulations were drafted by the same executive \n     branch officials who played a central role in drafting title \n     VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The language used is, in \n     relevant respects, virtually indistinguishable from \n     regulations under the several Acts in effect today. For \n     example, section 304 of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 \n     (42 U.S.C. 6103) required the Secretary of the Department of \n     Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) (now Health and Human \n     Services (HHS)) to promulgate ``general regulations'' to \n     effectuate the purposes of the Act. These ``government-wide \n     regulations,'' governing age discrimination in programs and \n     activities receiving Federal financial assistance condemn \n     ``any actions which have [a discriminatory] effect, on the \n     basis of age . . .'' (section 90.12 of title 45, Code of \n     Federal Regulations).\n       (4) None of the regulations under the laws addressed in \n     this subtitle have ever been invalidated. In 1966, Congress \n     considered and rejected a proposal to invalidate the \n     disparate impact regulations promulgated pursuant to title VI \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.). In \n     1975, Congress reviewed and maintained the implementing \n     regulations promulgated pursuant to title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), pursuant to a \n     statutory procedure designed to afford Congress the \n     opportunity to invalidate provisions deemed to be \n     inconsistent with congressional intent. The Supreme Court has \n     recognized that Congress's failure to disapprove regulations \n     implies that the regulations accurately reflect congressional \n     intent. North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 533-\n     34 (1982). Moreover, the Supreme Court explicitly recognized \n     congressional approval of the regulations promulgated to \n     implement section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 \n     U.S.C. 794) in Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, 465 U.S. \n     624, 634 (1984), stating that ``[t]he regulations \n     particularly merit deference in\n\n[[Page S1298]]\n\n     the present case: the responsible Congressional committees \n     participated in their formation and both these committees and \n     Congress itself endorsed the regulations in their final \n     form.''.\n       (5) All of the civil rights provisions cited in this \n     section were designed to confer a benefit on persons who were \n     discriminated against. They relied heavily on private \n     attorneys general for effective enforcement. Congress \n     acknowledged that it could not secure compliance solely \n     through enforcement actions initiated by the Attorney \n     General. Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, 390 U.S. 400 \n     (1968) (per curiam).\n       (6) The Supreme Court has made it clear that individuals \n     suffering discrimination under these statutes have a private \n     right of action in the Federal courts, and that this is \n     necessary for effective protection of the law, although \n     Congress did not make such a right of action explicit in the \n     statute. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 \n     (1979).\n       (7)(A) Notwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court in \n     Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975) to abandon prior precedent \n     and require explicit statutory statements of a right of \n     action, Congress and the Courts both before and after Cort \n     have recognized an implied right of action under the above \n     statutes. For example, Congress has consistently provided the \n     means for enforcing the statutes. In 1972, Congress \n     established a right to attorney's fees in private actions \n     brought under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) and title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) that continued \n     with enactment of the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act \n     of 1976 (Public Law 94-559; 90 Stat. 2641). In 1973, Congress \n     provided a right to attorney's fees for prevailing parties \n     under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 \n     U.S.C. 794) without expressly stating that there was a right \n     of action. In 1978 Congress amended the Age Discrimination \n     Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.) to include a right to \n     attorney's fees. Because the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 \n     was enacted while the Cort decision was pending, Congress \n     also enacted in 1978 a limited private right of action to \n     enforce the Age Discrimination Act of 1975.\n       (B) The Senate Report that accompanied the Civil Rights \n     Attorneys' Fees Awards Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-559; 90 \n     Stat. 2641) stated that ``All of these civil rights laws . . \n     . depend heavily upon private enforcement, and fee awards \n     have proved an essential remedy if private citizens are to \n     have a meaningful opportunity to vindicate the important \n     congressional policies which these laws contain.'' S. Rep. \n     No. 94-1011 (1976).\n       (8) The Supreme Court had no basis in law or in legislative \n     history in Sandoval for denying a right of action under \n     regulations promulgated pursuant to title VI of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) while permitting \n     it under the statute. The regulations were congressionally \n     mandated and their promulgation was specifically directed by \n     Congress under section 602 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 2000d-1) \n     ``to effectuate'' the antidiscrimination provisions of the \n     statute. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stressed \n     the importance of the regulations by requiring them to be \n     ``approved by the President''. Similarly, the regulations \n     promulgated pursuant to title IX of the Education Amendments \n     of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) were also congressionally \n     authorized and specifically directed by Congress to \n     effectuate the provisions of the statute. Title IX of the \n     Education Amendments of 1972 stressed the importance of the \n     regulations by requiring them to be ``approved by the \n     President''.\n       (9) Regulations that prohibit practices that have the \n     effect of discrimination are consistent with prohibitions of \n     disparate treatment that require a showing of intent, as the \n     Supreme Court has acknowledged in the following decisions:\n       (A) A disparate impact standard allows a court to reach \n     discrimination that could actually exist under the guise of \n     compliance with the law. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. \n     424 (1971).\n       (B) Evidence of a disproportionate burden will often be the \n     starting point in any analysis of unlawful discrimination. \n     Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. \n     Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977).\n       (C) An invidious purpose may often be inferred from the \n     totality of the relevant facts, including, where true, that \n     the practice bears more heavily on one race than another. \n     Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976).\n       (D) The disparate impact method of proof is critical to \n     ferreting out stereotypes underlying intentional \n     discrimination. Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. \n     977 (1988).\n       (10) The interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), and other \n     statutes barring discrimination by covered entities as \n     prohibiting practices that have disparate impact and that are \n     not justified as necessary to achieve the goals of the \n     programs or activities supported by the Federal financial \n     assistance is powerfully reinforced by the use of such a \n     standard in enforcing title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.). When the Supreme Court \n     wavered on the application of a disparate impact standard \n     under title VII, Congress specifically reinstated it as law \n     in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-166; 105 \n     Stat. 1071).\n       (11) By reinstating a private right of action under title \n     VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) \n     and confirming that right for other civil rights statutes, \n     Congress is not acting in a manner that would expose covered \n     entities to unfair findings of discrimination. The legal \n     standard for a disparate impact claim has never been \n     structured so that a finding of discrimination could be based \n     on numerical imbalance alone.\n       (12) In contrast, a failure to reinstate or confirm a \n     private right of action would leave vindication of the rights \n     to equality of opportunity solely to Federal agencies, which \n     may fail to take necessary and appropriate action because of \n     administrative overburden or other reasons. Action by \n     Congress to specify a private right of action is necessary to \n     ensure that persons will have a remedy if they are denied \n     equal access to education, housing, health, environmental \n     protection, transportation, and many other programs and \n     services by practices of covered entities that result in \n     discrimination.\n       (13) As a result of the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Sandoval, courts have dismissed numerous claims brought under \n     the regulations promulgated pursuant to title VI of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) that challenged \n     actions with an unjustified discriminatory effect. Although \n     the Sandoval Court did not address title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), lower courts \n     have similarly dismissed claims under such Act. Courts \n     relying on the Sandoval decision have also dismissed claims \n     seeking redress for unlawful retaliation against persons who \n     opposed prohibited acts, brought actions, or participated in \n     actions, under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \n     title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Because \n     judicial interpretation of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 \n     (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.) has tracked that of title VI of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 and title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972, without clarification of Sandoval, \n     plaintiffs run the risk that courts may dismiss claims \n     brought under regulations promulgated pursuant to the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 challenging actions with an \n     unjustified discriminatory effect and claims seeking redress \n     for unlawful retaliation against persons who have brought or \n     participated in actions under the Age Discrimination Act of \n     1975.\n       (14) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 \n     U.S.C. 794) has received different treatment by the Supreme \n     Court. In Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985), the Court \n     proceeded on the assumption that the statute itself \n     prohibited some actions that had a disparate impact on \n     handicapped individuals--an assumption borne out by \n     congressional statements made during passage of the Act. In \n     Sandoval, the Court appeared to accept this principle of \n     Alexander. Moreover, the Supreme Court explicitly recognized \n     congressional approval of the regulations promulgated to \n     implement section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in \n     Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624, 634 (1984). \n     Relying on the validity of the regulations, Congress \n     incorporated the regulations into the statutory requirements \n     of section 204 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 12134). Thus it does not appear at this time that \n     there is a risk that the private right of action to challenge \n     disparate impact discrimination under section 504 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 will become unavailable.\n       (15) Since the enactment of title VI of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \n     the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and section 504 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Congress has intended that the \n     prohibitions on discrimination in those provisions include a \n     prohibition on retaliation. The ability to prevent \n     retaliation against persons who oppose any policy or practice \n     prohibited by those provisions, or make a charge, testify, \n     assist, or participate in any manner in an investigation, \n     proceeding, or hearing under those provisions, is essential \n     to realizing the prohibitions on discrimination in those \n     provisions.\n       (16) The right to maintain a private right of action under \n     a provision added to a statute under this subtitle will be \n     effectuated by a waiver of sovereign immunity in the same \n     manner as sovereign immunity is waived under the remaining \n     provisions of that statute.\n\n     SEC. 102.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As the Supreme Court has held, covered entities are \n     liable for harassment on the basis of sex under their \n     education programs and activities under title IX of the \n     Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) \n     (referred to in this subtitle as ``title IX''). Franklin v. \n     Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 75 (1992) \n     (damages remedy available for harassment of student by a \n     teacher coach); Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, \n     526 U.S. 629, 633 (1999) (authorizing damages action against \n     school board for student-on-student sexual harassment).\n       (2) Courts have confirmed that covered entities are liable \n     for harassment on the basis of race, color, or national \n     origin under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) (referred to in this subtitle as \n     ``title VI''), e.g., Bryant v. Independent School District \n     No. I-38, 334 F.3d 928 (10th Cir. 2003) (liability for \n     student-on-student racial harassment). Moreover, judicial \n     interpretation of the similarly worded Age Discrimination Act \n     of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.) and section 504 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) has tracked that \n     of title VI and title IX.\n       (3) As these courts have properly recognized, harassment on \n     a prohibited basis under a program or activity, whether \n     perpetrated by employees or agents of the program or \n     activity, by peers of the victim, or by others who conduct \n     harassment under the program or activity, is a form of \n     unlawful and intentional discrimination that inflicts \n     substantial harm on beneficiaries of the program or activity \n     and violates the obligation of a covered entity to maintain a \n     nondiscriminatory environment.\n       (4) In a 5 to 4 ruling, the Supreme Court held that \n     students subjected to sexual harassment may receive a damages \n     remedy under title IX only when school officials have \n     ``actual notice'' of the harassment and are ``deliberately \n     indifferent'' to it. Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School \n     District, 524 U.S. 274 (1998). See also Davis v. Monroe \n     County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999).\n       (5) The standard delineated in Gebser and followed in Davis \n     has been applied by lower courts regarding the liability of \n     covered entities for damages for harassment based on race, \n     color, or national origin under title VI. E.g., Bryant v. \n     Independent School District No. I-38, 334 F.3d 928 (10th Cir. \n     2003). Because of the similarities in the wording and \n     interpretation of the underlying statutes, this standard may \n     be applied to claims for damages brought under the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.) and \n     section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) \n     as well.\n       (6) Although they do not affect the relevant standards for \n     individuals to obtain injunctive and equitable relief for \n     harassment on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, \n     age, or disability under covered programs and activities, \n     Gebser and its progeny severely limit the availability of \n     remedies for such individuals by imposing new, more stringent \n     standards for recovery of damages under title VI and title \n     IX, and potentially under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 \n     and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Yet in \n     many cases, damages are the only remedy that would \n     effectively rectify past harassment.\n       (7) As recognized by the dissenters in Gebser, these \n     limitations on effective relief thwart Congress's underlying \n     purpose to protect students from harassment. By making the \n     ``policy choice'' to ``rank[] protection of the school \n     district's purse above the protection of immature high school \n     students'', the Gebser case ``is not faithful to the intent \n     of the policymaking branch of our Government''. Gebser, 524 \n     U.S. at 306 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n       (8) The rulings in Gebser and its progeny create an \n     incentive for covered entities to insulate themselves from \n     knowledge of harassment on the basis of race, color, sex, \n     national origin, age, or disability rather than adopting and \n     enforcing practices that will minimize the danger of such \n     harassment. The rulings thus undermine the purpose of \n     prohibitions on discrimination in the civil rights laws: ``to \n     induce [covered programs or activities] to adopt and enforce \n     practices that will minimize the danger that vulnerable \n     students [or other beneficiaries] will be exposed to such \n     odious behavior''. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 300 (Stevens, J., \n     dissenting).\n       (9) The Gebser ruling contravened the interpretations of \n     title VI and title IX by the Department of Education, which \n     interpretations recognized liability for damages for \n     harassment based on race, color, sex, or national origin \n     based on agency principles. Sexual Harassment Guidance: \n     Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, \n     or Third Parties, 62 Fed.

The Gebser \n     majority itself invited Congress to ``speak directly on the \n     subject'' of damages liability to provide additional guidance \n     to the courts. 524 U.S. at 292.\n       (11) Restoring the availability of a full range of remedies \n     for harassment will--\n\n[[Page S1301]]\n\n       (A) ensure that students and other beneficiaries of \n     federally funded programs and activities have protection from \n     harassment on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, \n     age, or disability that is comparable in strength and \n     effectiveness to that available to employees under title VII \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), \n     the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. \n     621 et seq.), and title I of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.);\n       (B) encourage covered entities to adopt and enforce \n     meaningful policies and procedures to prevent and remedy \n     harassment;\n       (C) deter incidents of harassment; and\n       (D) provide appropriate remedies for discrimination.\n       (12) Congress has the same affirmative powers to enact \n     legislation restoring the availability of a full range of \n     remedies for harassment as it did to enact the underlying \n     statutory prohibitions on harassment, including powers under \n     section 5 of the 14th amendment and section 8 of article I of \n     the Constitution.\n       (13) The right to maintain a private right of action under \n     a provision added to a statute under this subtitle will be \n     effectuated by a waiver of sovereign immunity in the same \n     manner as sovereign immunity is waived under the remaining \n     provisions of that statute.\n\n     SEC. 112.

AMENDMENT TO THE UNIFORMED SERVICES EMPLOYMENT AND \n                   REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ACT OF 1994.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Federal Government has an important interest in \n     attracting and training a military to provide for the \n     National defense. The Constitution grants Congress the power \n     to raise and support an army for purposes of the common \n     defense. The Nation's military readiness requires that all \n     members of the Armed Forces, including those employed in \n     State programs and activities, be able to serve without \n     jeopardizing their civilian employment opportunities.\n       (2) The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment \n     Rights Act of 1994, commonly referred to as ``USERRA'' and \n     codified as chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, is \n     intended to safeguard the reemployment rights of members of \n     the uniformed services (as that term is defined in section \n     4303(16) of title 38, United States Code) and to prevent \n     discrimination against any person who is a member of, applies \n     to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to \n     perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a \n     uniformed service. Effective enforcement of the Act depends \n     on the ability of private individuals to enforce its \n     provisions in court.\n       (3) In Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 \n     (1996), the Supreme Court held that congressional legislation \n     enacted pursuant to the commerce clause of Article I, section \n     8, of the Constitution cannot abrogate the immunity of States \n     under the 11th amendment to the Constitution. Some courts \n     have interpreted Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida as a \n     basis for denying relief to persons affected by a State \n     violation of USERRA. In addition, in Alden v. Maine 527 U.S. \n     706, 712 (1999), the Supreme Court held that this immunity \n     also prohibits the Federal Government from subjecting ``non-\n     consenting states to private suits for damages in state \n     courts.'' As a result, although USERRA specifically provides \n     that a person may commence an action for relief against a \n     State for its violation of that Act, persons harmed by State \n     violations of that Act lack important remedies to vindicate \n     the rights and benefits that are available to all other \n     persons covered by that Act. Unless a State chooses to waive \n     sovereign immunity, or the Attorney General brings an action \n     on their behalf, persons affected by State violations of \n     USERRA may have no adequate Federal remedy for such \n     violations.\n       (4) A failure to provide a private right of action by \n     persons affected by State violations of USERRA would leave \n     vindication of their rights and benefits under that Act \n     solely to Federal agencies, which may fail to take necessary \n     and appropriate action because of administrative overburden \n     or other reasons. Action by Congress to specify such a \n     private right of action ensures that persons affected by \n     State violations of USERRA have a remedy if they are denied \n     their rights and benefits under that Act.\n       (b) Clarification of Right of Action Under USERRA.--Section \n     4323 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), by striking paragraph (2) and \n     inserting the following new paragraph (2):\n       ``(2) In the case of an action against a State (as an \n     employer) by a person, the action may be brought in a \n     district court of the United States or State court of \n     competent jurisdiction.'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (j) as subsection (k); and\n\n[[Page S1303]]\n\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (i) the following new \n     subsection (j):\n       ``(j)(1)(A) A State's receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance for any program or activity of a State shall \n     constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity, under the 11th \n     amendment to the Constitution or otherwise, to a suit brought \n     by an employee of that program or activity under this chapter \n     for the rights or benefits authorized the employee by this \n     chapter.\n       ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `program or activity' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 309 of the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6107).\n       ``(2) An official of a State may be sued in the official \n     capacity of the official by any person covered by paragraph \n     (1) who seeks injunctive relief against a State (as an \n     employer) under subsection (e). In such a suit the court may \n     award to the prevailing party those costs authorized by \n     section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988).''.\n\n          TITLE III--AIR CARRIER ACCESS ACT OF 1986 AMENDMENT\n\n     SEC. 301. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In Love v. Delta Air Lines, 310 F. 3d 1347 (11th Cir. \n     2002), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh \n     Circuit held that when Congress passed the Air Carrier Access \n     Act of 1986, adding a provision now codified at section 41705 \n     of title 49, United States Code (referred to in this title as \n     the ``ACAA''), Congress did not intend to create a private \n     right of action with which individuals with disabilities \n     could sue air carriers in Federal court for discrimination on \n     the basis of disability. The court recognized that other \n     courts of appeals have held that the ACAA created a private \n     right of action. Nevertheless, the court, relying on the \n     Supreme Court's decision in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. \n     275 (2001), concluded that the ACAA did not create a private \n     right of action.\n       (2) The absence of a private right of action leaves \n     enforcement of the ACAA solely in the hands of the Department \n     of Transportation, which is overburdened and lacks the \n     resources to investigate, prosecute violators for, and \n     remediate all of the violations of the rights of travelers \n     who are individuals with disabilities. Nor can the Department \n     of Transportation bring an action that will redress the \n     injury of an individual resulting from such a violation. The \n     Department of Transportation can take action that fines an \n     air carrier or requires the air carrier to obey the law in \n     the future, but the Department is not authorized to issue \n     orders that redress the injuries sustained by individual air \n     passengers. Action by Congress is necessary to ensure that \n     individuals with disabilities will have adequate remedies \n     available when air carriers violate the ACAA (including its \n     regulations), and only courts may provide this redress to \n     individuals.\n       (3) When an air carrier violates the ACAA and discriminates \n     against an individual with a disability, frequently the only \n     way to compensate that individual for the harm the individual \n     has suffered is through an award of money damages. For \n     example, violations of the ACAA may result in travelers who \n     are individuals with disabilities missing flights for \n     business appointments or important personal events, or in \n     such travelers suffering humiliating treatment at the hands \n     of air carriers. Those harms cannot be remedied solely \n     through injunctive relief.\n       (4) Unlike other civil rights statutes, the ACAA does not \n     contain a fee-shifting provision under which a prevailing \n     plaintiff can be awarded attorney's fees. Action by Congress \n     is necessary to correct this anomaly. The availability of \n     attorney's fees is essential to ensuring that persons who \n     have been aggrieved by violations of the ACAA can enforce \n     their rights. The inclusion of a fee-shifting provision in \n     the ACAA will permit individuals to serve as private \n     attorneys general, a necessary role on which enforcement of \n     civil rights statutes depends.\n\n     SEC. 302. CIVIL ACTION.\n\n       Section 41705 of title 49, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Civil Action.--(1) Any person aggrieved by an air \n     carrier's violation of subsection (a) (including any \n     regulation implementing such subsection) may bring a civil \n     action in the district court of the United States in the \n     district in which the aggrieved person resides, in the \n     district containing the air carrier's principal place of \n     business, or in the district in which the violation took \n     place. Any such action must be commenced within 2 years after \n     the date of the violation.\n       ``(2) In any civil action brought by an aggrieved person \n     pursuant to paragraph (1), the plaintiff may obtain both \n     equitable and legal relief, including compensatory and \n     punitive damages. The court in such action shall, in addition \n     to such relief awarded to a prevailing plaintiff, award \n     reasonable attorney's fees, reasonable expert fees, and costs \n     of the action to the plaintiff.''.\n\n       TITLE IV--AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n     SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Older Workers' Rights \n     Restoration Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since 1974, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.) (referred to in this section as \n     the `ADEA') has prohibited States from discriminating in \n     employment on the basis of age. In EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. \n     226 (1983), the Supreme Court upheld Congress's \n     constitutional authority to prohibit States from \n     discriminating in employment on the basis of age. The \n     prohibitions of the ADEA remain in effect and continue to \n     apply to the States, as the prohibitions have for more than \n     25 years.\n       (2) Age discrimination in employment remains a serious \n     problem both nationally and among State agencies, and has \n     invidious effects on its victims, the labor force, and the \n     economy as a whole. For example, age discrimination in \n     employment--\n       (A) increases the risk of unemployment among older workers, \n     who will as a result be more likely to be dependent on \n     government resources;\n       (B) prevents the best use of available labor resources;\n       (C) adversely effects the morale and productivity of older \n     workers; and\n       (D) perpetuates unwarranted stereotypes about the abilities \n     of older workers.\n       (3) Private civil suits by the victims of employment \n     discrimination have been a crucial tool for enforcement of \n     the ADEA since the enactment of that Act. In Kimel v. Florida \n     Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000), however, the Supreme \n     Court held that Congress had not abrogated State sovereign \n     immunity to suits by individuals under the ADEA. The Federal \n     Government has an important interest in ensuring that Federal \n     financial assistance is not used to subsidize or facilitate \n     violations of the ADEA. Private civil suits are a critical \n     tool for advancing that interest.\n       (4) As a result of the Kimel decision, although age-based \n     discrimination by State employers remains unlawful, the \n     victims of such discrimination lack important remedies for \n     vindication of their rights that are available to all other \n     employees covered under that Act, including employees in the \n     private sector, local government, and the Federal Government. \n     Unless a State chooses to waive sovereign immunity, or the \n     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brings an action on \n     their behalf, State employees victimized by violations of the \n     ADEA have no adequate Federal remedy for violations of that \n     Act. In the absence of the deterrent effect that such \n     remedies provide, there is a greater likelihood that entities \n     carrying out programs and activities receiving Federal \n     financial assistance will use that assistance to violate that \n     Act, or that the assistance will otherwise subsidize or \n     facilitate violations of that Act.\n       (5) Federal law has long treated nondiscrimination \n     obligations as a core component of programs or activities \n     that, in whole or part, receive Federal financial assistance. \n     That assistance should not be used, directly or indirectly, \n     to subsidize invidious discrimination. Assuring \n     nondiscrimination in employment is a crucial aspect of \n     assuring nondiscrimination in those programs and activities.\n       (6) Discrimination on the basis of age in programs or \n     activities receiving Federal financial assistance is, in \n     contexts other than employment, forbidden by the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.). Congress \n     determined that it was not necessary for the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 to apply to employment \n     discrimination because the ADEA already forbade \n     discrimination in employment by, and authorized suits \n     against, State agencies and other entities that receive \n     Federal financial assistance. In section 1003 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-7), \n     Congress required all State entities subject to the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 to waive any immunity from suit \n     for discrimination claims arising under the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975. The earlier limitation in the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975, originally intended only to avoid \n     duplicative coverage and remedies, has in the wake of the \n     Kimel decision become a serious loophole leaving millions of \n     State employees without an important Federal remedy for age \n     discrimination, resulting in the use of Federal financial \n     assistance to subsidize or facilitate violations of the ADEA.\n       (7) The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to \n     condition receipt of Federal financial assistance on \n     acceptance by the States or other covered entities of \n     conditions regarding or related to the use of that \n     assistance, as in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. \n     677 (1979). The Court has further recognized that Congress \n     may require a State, as a condition of receipt of Federal \n     financial assistance, to waive the State's sovereign immunity \n     to suits for a violation of Federal law, as in College \n     Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \n     Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). In the wake of the Kimel \n     decision, in order to assure compliance with, and to provide \n     effective remedies for violations of, the ADEA in State \n     programs or activities receiving or using Federal financial \n     assistance, and in order to ensure that Federal financial \n     assistance does not subsidize or facilitate violations of the \n     ADEA, it is necessary to require such a waiver as a condition \n     of receipt or use of that assistance.\n       (8) A State's receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance in any program or activity of a State will \n     constitute a limited waiver of sovereign immunity under \n     section 7(g) of the ADEA (as added by section 404). The \n     waiver will not eliminate a State's immunity with respect to \n     programs or activities that do not receive or use Federal \n     financial assistance. The State will waive sovereign immunity \n     only with respect to suits under the ADEA brought by \n     employees within the programs or activities that receive or \n     use\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\n     that assistance. With regard to those programs and activities \n     that are covered by the waiver, the State employees will be \n     accorded only the same remedies that are accorded to other \n     covered employees under the ADEA.\n       (9) The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that State \n     sovereign immunity does not bar suits for prospective \n     injunctive relief brought against State officials, as in Ex \n     parte Young (209 U.S. 123 (1908)). Clarification of the \n     language of the ADEA will confirm that that Act authorizes \n     such suits. The injunctive relief available in such suits \n     will continue to be no broader than the injunctive relief \n     that was available under that Act before the Kimel decision, \n     and that is available to all other employees under that Act.\n       (10) In Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971), \n     the Supreme Court recognized that title VII of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) ``proscribes not \n     only overt discrimination [in employment] but also \n     [employment] practices that are fair in form, but \n     discriminatory in operation. . . .'' In doing so, the Court \n     relied on section 703(a)(2) of title VII of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(2)), which contains \n     language identical to section 4(a)(2) of the ADEA, except \n     that the latter substitutes the word age for the grounds of \n     prohibited discrimination specified by title VII of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964: ``race, color, religion, sex, or national \n     origin.'' The Court has confirmed that this and other related \n     statutory language, identical to both title VII of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964 and the ADEA, supports application of the \n     disparate impact doctrine. Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440 \n     (1982); General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976).\n       (11) Other indicia of Congress's intent to permit the \n     disparate impact method of proving violations of the ADEA are \n     legion, and include numerous other textual parallels between \n     the ADEA and title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, such \n     as in the two laws' substantive prohibitions. Lorillard v. \n     Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 584 (1978) (the ADEA's substantive \n     prohibitions ``were derived in haec verba from Title VII''). \n     Moreover, the ADEA and title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964 share ``a common purpose: `the elimination of \n     discrimination in the workplace,' ''. McKennon v. Nashville \n     Banner Pub. Co., 513 U.S. 352, 358 (1995) (quoting Oscar \n     Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U.S. 750, 756 (1979)). Interpreting \n     title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in a consistent \n     manner is particularly appropriate when ``the two provisions \n     share a common raison d'etre.''. Northcross v. Board of Educ. \n     of Memphis City Schools, 412 U.S. 427, 428 (1973).\n       (12) The ADEA's legislative history confirms Congress's \n     intent to redress all ``arbitrary'' age discrimination in the \n     workplace, including arbitrary facially neutral policies and \n     practices falling more harshly on older workers. Such \n     policies continue to be based on the kind of ``subconscious \n     stereotypes and prejudices'' which cannot be ``adequately \n     policed through disparate treatment analysis,'' and thus, \n     require application of the disparate impact theory of proof. \n     Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 990 (1988). \n     As the Supreme Court has noted, these prejudices are ``the \n     essence of age discrimination.''. Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, \n     507 U.S. 604, 610, n.15 (1993).\n       (13) In 1991, Congress reaffirmed that title VII of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 permits victims of employment bias \n     to state a cause of action for disparate impact \n     discrimination when it added a provision to title VII of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 to clarify the burden of proof in \n     disparate impact cases in section 703(k) of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(k)).\n       (14) Subsequently, several lower courts and Federal Courts \n     of Appeal have mistakenly relied on language in the Supreme \n     Court's opinion in Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604 \n     (1993), to suggest that the disparate impact method of proof \n     does not apply to claims under the ADEA. Mullin v. Raytheon \n     Co., 164 F.3d 696, 700-01 (1st Cir. 1999); EEOC v. Francis W. \n     Parker School, 41 F.3d 1073, 1076-77 (7th Cir. 1994); Ellis \n     v. United Airlines, Inc., 73 F.3d 999, 1006-07 (10th Cir. \n     1996); DiBiase v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 48 F.3d 719, 732 \n     (3d Cir. 1995); Lyon v. Ohio Educ. Ass'n and Prof'l Staff \n     Union, 53 F.3d 135, 139 n.5 (6th Cir. 1995). Congress did not \n     intend the ADEA to be interpreted to provide older workers \n     less protections against discrimination than those protected \n     under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As a result, \n     it is necessary to clarify the burden of proof in a disparate \n     impact case under the ADEA, and thereby reaffirm that victims \n     of age discrimination in employment discrimination may state \n     a cause of action based on the disparate impact method of \n     proving discrimination in appropriate circumstances.\n\n     SEC. 403. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to provide to State employees in programs or activities \n     that receive or use Federal financial assistance the same \n     rights and remedies for practices violating the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et \n     seq.) as are available to other employees under that Act, and \n     that were available to State employees prior to the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 528 \n     U.S. 62 (2000);\n       (2) to provide that the receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance for a program or activity constitutes a State \n     waiver of sovereign immunity from suits by employees within \n     that program or activity for violations of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967;\n       (3) to affirm that suits for injunctive relief are \n     available against State officials in their official \n     capacities for violations of the Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act of 1967; and\n       (4) to reaffirm the applicability of the disparate impact \n     standard of proof to claims under the Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act of 1967.\n\n     SEC. 404. REMEDIES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES.\n\n       Section 7 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 626) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(g)(1)(A) A State's receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance for any program or activity of a State shall \n     constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity, under the 11th \n     amendment to the Constitution or otherwise, to a suit brought \n     by an employee of that program or activity under this Act for \n     equitable, legal, or other relief authorized under this Act.\n       ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `program or activity' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 309 of the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6107).\n       ``(2) An official of a State may be sued in the official \n     capacity of the official by any employee who has complied \n     with the procedures of subsections (d) and (e), for \n     injunctive relief that is authorized under this Act. In such \n     a suit the court may award to the prevailing party those \n     costs authorized by section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 \n     U.S.C. 1988).''.\n\n     SEC. 405. DISPARATE IMPACT CLAIMS.\n\n       Section 4 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 623) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(n)(1) Discrimination based on disparate impact is \n     established under this title only if--\n       ``(A) an aggrieved party demonstrates that an employer, \n     employment agency, or labor organization has a policy or \n     practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of age \n     and the employer, employment agency, or labor organization \n     fails to demonstrate that the challenged policy or practice \n     is based on reasonable factors that are job-related and \n     consistent with business necessity other than age; or\n       ``(B) the aggrieved party demonstrates (consistent with the \n     demonstration standard under title VII of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) with respect to an \n     `alternative employment practice') that a less discriminatory \n     alternative policy or practice exists, and the employer, \n     employment agency, or labor organization refuses to adopt \n     such alternative policy or practice.\n       ``(2)(A) With respect to demonstrating that a particular \n     policy or practice causes a disparate impact as described in \n     paragraph (1)(A), the aggrieved party shall demonstrate that \n     each particular challenged policy or practice causes a \n     disparate impact, except that if the aggrieved party \n     demonstrates to the court that the elements of an employer, \n     employment agency, or labor organization's decisionmaking \n     process are not capable of separation for analysis, the \n     decisionmaking process may be analyzed as one policy or \n     practice.\n       ``(B) If the employer, employment agency, or labor \n     organization demonstrates that a specific policy or practice \n     does not cause the disparate impact, the employer, employment \n     agency, or labor organization shall not be required to \n     demonstrate that such policy or practice is necessary to the \n     operation of its business.\n       ``(3) A demonstration that a policy or practice is \n     necessary to the operation of the employer, employment \n     agency, or labor organization's business may not be used as a \n     defense against a claim of intentional discrimination under \n     this title.\n       ``(4) In this subsection, the term `demonstrates' means \n     meets the burdens of production and persuasion.''.\n\n     SEC. 406.

PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this subtitle is to allow recovery of expert \n     fees by prevailing parties under civil rights fee-shifting \n     statutes.\n\n     SEC. 522. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) This subtitle is made necessary by the decision of the \n     Supreme Court in West Virginia University Hospitals Inc. v. \n     Casey, 499 U.S. 83 (1991). In Casey, the Court, per Justice \n     Scalia, ruled that expert fees were not recoverable under \n     section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988), as \n     amended by the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act of \n     1976 (Public Law 94-559; 90 Stat. 2641), because the Civil \n     Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act of 1976 expressly \n     authorized an award of an ``attorney's fee'' to a prevailing \n     party but said nothing expressly about expert fees.\n       (2) This subtitle is especially necessary both because of \n     the important roles played by experts in civil rights \n     litigation and because expert fees often represent a major \n     cost of the litigation. In fact, in Casey itself, as pointed \n     out by Justice Stevens in dissent, the district court had \n     found that the expert witnesses were ``essential'' and \n     ``necessary'' to the successful prosecution of the plaintiffs \n     case, and the expert fees were not paltry but amounted to \n     $104,133. Justice Stevens also pointed out that the majority \n     opinion requiring the plaintiff to ``assume the cost of \n     $104,133 in expert witness fees is at war with the \n     congressional purpose of making the prevailing party \n     whole.''. Casey (499 U.S. at 111).\n       (3) Much of the rationale for denying expert fees as part \n     of the shifting of attorney's fees under provisions of law \n     such as section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988), \n     whose language does not expressly include expert fees, was \n     based on the fact that many fee-shifting statutes enacted by \n     Congress ``explicitly shift expert witness fees as well as \n     attorney's fees.''. Casey (499 U.S. at 88). In fact, Justice \n     Scalia pointed out that in 1976--the same year that Congress \n     amended section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988) \n     by providing for the shifting of attorney's fees--Congress \n     expressly authorized the shifting of attorney's fees and of \n     expert fees in the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2601 et seq.), the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2051 et seq.), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of \n     1976 (Public Law 94-580; 90 Stat. 2795), and the Natural Gas \n     Pipeline Safety Act Amendments of 1976 (Public Law 94-477; 90 \n     Stat. 2073). Casey (499 U.S. at 88). Congress had done the \n     same in other years on dozens of occasions. Casey (499 U.S. \n     at 88-90 & n. 4).\n       (4) In the same year that the Supreme Court decided Casey, \n     Congress responded quickly but only through the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-166; 105 Stat. 1071) by amending \n     title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et \n     seq.) and section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. \n     1988) with express authorizations of the recovery of expert \n     fees in successful employment discrimination litigation. It \n     is long past time to correct, in Federal civil rights \n     litigation, Casey's denial of expert fees.\n\n     SEC. 523.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Paycheck Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Women have entered the workforce in record numbers.\n       (2) Even today, women earn significantly lower pay than men \n     for work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and \n     responsibility and that are performed under similar working \n     conditions. These pay disparities exist in both the private \n     and governmental sectors. In many instances, the pay \n     disparities can only be due to continued intentional \n     discrimination or the lingering effects of past \n     discrimination.\n       (3) The existence of such pay disparities--\n       (A) depresses the wages of working families who rely on the \n     wages of all members of the family to make ends meet;\n       (B) prevents the optimum utilization of available labor \n     resources;\n       (C) has been spread and perpetuated, through commerce and \n     the channels and instrumentalities of commerce, among the \n     workers of the several States;\n       (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n     commerce;\n       (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition in \n     commerce;\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\n       (F) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing \n     commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce;\n       (G) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods \n     in commerce; and\n       (H) in many instances, may deprive workers of equal \n     protection on the basis of sex in violation of the 5th and \n     14th amendments.\n       (4)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n     discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex \n     continue to exist decades after the enactment of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).\n       (B) Elimination of such barriers would have positive \n     effects, including--\n       (i) providing a solution to problems in the economy created \n     by unfair pay disparities;\n       (ii) substantially reducing the number of working women \n     earning unfairly low wages, thereby reducing the dependence \n     on public assistance;\n       (iii) promoting stable families by enabling all family \n     members to earn a fair rate of pay;\n       (iv) remedying the effects of past discrimination on the \n     basis of sex and ensuring that in the future workers are \n     afforded equal protection on the basis of sex; and\n       (v) ensuring equal protection pursuant to Congress's power \n     to enforce the 5th and 14th amendments.\n       (5) With increased information about the provisions added \n     by the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and wage data, along with more \n     effective remedies, women will be better able to recognize \n     and enforce their rights to equal pay for work on jobs that \n     require equal skill, effort, and responsibility and that are \n     performed under similar working conditions.\n       (6) Certain employers have already made great strides in \n     eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace and their \n     achievements should be recognized.\n\n     SEC. 603. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Required Demonstration for Affirmative Defense.--\n     Section 6(d)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) is amended by striking ``(iv) a \n     differential'' and all that follows through the period and \n     inserting the following: ``(iv) a differential based on a \n     bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training \n     or experience, except that this clause shall apply only if--\n       ``(I) the employer demonstrates that--\n       ``(aa) such factor--\n       ``(AA) is job-related with respect to the position in \n     question; or\n       ``(BB) furthers a legitimate business purpose, except that \n     this item shall not apply where the employee demonstrates \n     that an alternative employment practice exists that would \n     serve the same business purpose without producing such \n     differential and that the employer has refused to adopt such \n     alternative practice; and\n       ``(bb) such factor was actually applied and used reasonably \n     in light of the asserted justification; and\n       ``(II) upon the employer succeeding under subclause (I), \n     the employee fails to demonstrate that the differential \n     produced by the reliance of the employer on such factor is \n     itself the result of discrimination on the basis of sex by \n     the employer.\n     An employer that is not otherwise in compliance with this \n     paragraph may not reduce the wages of any employee in order \n     to achieve such compliance.''.\n       (b) Application of Provisions.--Section 6(d)(1) of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following: ``The provisions of this \n     subsection shall apply to applicants for employment if such \n     applicants, upon employment by the employer, would be subject \n     to any provisions of this section.''.\n       (c) Elimination of Establishment Requirement.--Section 6(d) \n     of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``, within any establishment in which such \n     employees are employed,'';

and\n       (2) by inserting before the semicolon the following: ``, or \n     has inquired about, discussed, or otherwise disclosed the \n     wages of the employee or another employee, or because the \n     employee (or applicant) has made a charge, testified, \n     assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, \n     proceeding, hearing, or action under section 6(d)''.\n       (e) Enhanced Penalties.--Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 216(b)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting after the first sentence the following: \n     ``Any employer who violates section 6(d) shall additionally \n     be liable for such compensatory or punitive damages as may be \n     appropriate, except that the United States shall not be \n     liable for punitive damages.'';\n       (2) in the sentence beginning ``An action to'', by striking \n     ``either of the preceding sentences'' and inserting ``any of \n     the preceding sentences of this subsection'';\n       (3) in the sentence beginning ``No employees shall'', by \n     striking ``No employees'' and inserting ``Except with respect \n     to class actions brought to enforce section 6(d), no \n     employee'';\n       (4) by inserting after the sentence referred to in \n     paragraph (3), the following: ``Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of Federal law, any action brought to enforce \n     section 6(d) may be maintained as a class action as provided \n     by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.'';

(in this subtitle referred to as the ``NLRA''), enacted \n     in 1935, guarantees the right of employees to organize and to \n     bargain collectively with their employers. The NLRA \n     implements the national labor policy of assuring free choice \n     and encouraging collective bargaining as a means of \n     maintaining industrial peace. The National Labor Relations \n     Board (in this subtitle referred to as the ``NLRB'') was \n     created by Congress to enforce the provisions of the NLRA.\n       (2) Under section 8 of the NLRA, employers are prohibited \n     from discriminating against employees ``in regard to hire or \n     tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment \n     to encourage or discourage membership in any labor \n     organization''. (29 U.S.C. 158(a)(3)). Employers who violate \n     these provisions are subject to a variety of sanctions, \n     including reinstatement of workers found to be illegally \n     discharged because of their union support or activity and \n     provision of backpay to those employees. Such sanctions serve \n     to remedy and deter illegal actions by employers.\n       (3) In Hoffman Plastic Compounds Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U.S. 137 \n     (2002), the Supreme Court held by a 5 to 4 vote that Federal \n     immigration policy, as articulated in the Immigration Reform \n     and Control Act of 1986, prevented the NLRB from awarding \n     backpay to an undocumented immigrant who was discharged in \n     violation of the NLRA because of his support for union \n     representation at his workplace.\n       (4) The decision in Hoffman has an impact on all employees, \n     regardless of immigration or citizenship status, who try to \n     improve their working conditions. In the wake of Hoffman \n     Plastics, employers may be more likely to report to the \n     Department of Homeland Security minority workers, regardless \n     of their immigration or citizenship status, who pursue claims \n     under the NLRA against their employers. Fear that employers \n     may retaliate against employees that exercise their rights \n     under the NLRA has a chilling effect on all employees who \n     exercise their labor rights.\n       (5) The NLRA is not the only Federal employment statute \n     that provides for a backpay award as a remedy for an unlawful \n     discharge. For example, courts routinely award backpay to \n     employees who are found to have been discharged in violation \n     of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e \n     et seq.) or the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n     201 et seq.) (in retaliation for complaining about a failure \n     to comply with the minimum wage). In the wake of the Hoffman \n     decision, defendant employers will now argue that backpay \n     awards to unlawfully discharged undocumented workers are \n     barred under Federal employment statutes and even under State \n     employment statutes.\n       (6) Because the Hoffman decision prevents the imposition of \n     sanctions on employers who discriminate against undocumented \n     immigrant workers, employers are encouraged to employ such \n     workers for low-paying and dangerous jobs because they have \n     no legal redress for violations of the law. This creates an \n     economic incentive for employers to hire and exploit \n     undocumented workers, which in turn tends to undermine the \n     living standards and working conditions of all Americans, \n     citizens and noncitizens alike.\n       (7) The Hoffman decision disadvantages many employers as \n     well. Employers who are forced to compete with firms that \n     hire and exploit undocumented immigrant workers are saddled \n     with an economic disadvantage in the labor marketplace. The \n     unintended creation of an economic inducement for employers \n     to exploit undocumented immigrant workers gives those \n     employers an unfair competitive advantage over employers that \n     treat workers lawfully and fairly.\n       (8) The Court's decision in Hoffman makes clear that ``any \n     `perceived deficiency in the NLRA's existing remedial \n     arsenal' must be `addressed by congressional action[.]' '' \n     Hoffman Plastic Compounds Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U.S. 137, 152 \n     (2002) (quoting Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883, 904 \n     (1984)). In emphasizing the importance of back pay awards, \n     Justice Breyer noted that such awards against employers \n     ``help[] to deter unlawful activity that both labor laws and \n     immigration laws seek to prevent''. Hoffman Plastic Compounds \n     Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U.S. 137, 152 (2002). Because back pay \n     awards are designed both to remedy the individual's private \n     right to be free from discrimination as well as to enforce \n     the important public policy against discriminatory employment \n     practices, Congress must take the following corrective \n     action.\n\n     SEC. 702. CONTINUED APPLICATION OF BACKPAY REMEDIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 274A(h) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(4) Backpay remedies.--Backpay or other monetary relief \n     for unlawful employment practices shall not be denied to a \n     present or former employee as a result of the employer's or \n     the employee's--\n       ``(A) failure to comply with the requirements of this \n     section; or\n       ``(B) violation of a provision of Federal law related to \n     the employment verification system described in subsection \n     (b) in establishing or maintaining the employment \n     relationship.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to any failure to comply or any violation that \n     occurs prior to, on, or after the date of enactment of this \n     title.\n\n            Subtitle B--Fair Labor Standards Act Amendments\n\n     SEC. 711. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Workers' Minimum Wage \n     and Overtime Rights Restoration Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 712. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following with respect to the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) (in this \n     subtitle referred to as the ``FLSA''):\n       (1) Since 1974, the FLSA has regulated States with respect \n     to the payment of minimum wage and overtime rates. In Garcia \n     v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528 \n     (1985), the Supreme Court upheld Congress's constitutional \n     authority\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\n     to regulate States in the payment of minimum wages and \n     overtime. The prohibitions of the FLSA remain in effect and \n     continue to apply to the States.\n       (2) Wage and overtime violations in employment remain a \n     serious problem both nationally and among State and other \n     public and private entities receiving Federal financial \n     assistance, and has invidious effects on its victims, the \n     labor force, and the general welfare and economy as a whole. \n     For example, seven State governments have no overtime laws at \n     all. Fourteen State governments have minimum wage and \n     overtime laws; however, they exclude employees covered under \n     the FLSA. As such, public employees, since they are covered \n     under the FLSA are not protected under these State laws. \n     Additionally, four States have minimum wage and overtime laws \n     which are inferior to the FLSA. Further, the Department of \n     Labor continues to receive a substantial number of wage and \n     overtime charges against State government employers.\n       (3) Private civil suits by the victims of employment law \n     violations have been a crucial tool for enforcement of the \n     FLSA. In Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999), however, the \n     Supreme Court held that Congress lacks the power under the \n     14th amendment to the Constitution to abrogate State \n     sovereign immunity to suits for legal relief by individuals \n     under the FLSA. The Federal Government has an important \n     interest in ensuring that Federal financial assistance is not \n     used to facilitate violations of the FLSA, and private civil \n     suits for monetary relief are a critical tool for advancing \n     that interest.\n       (4) After the Alden decision, wage and overtime violations \n     by State employers remain unlawful, but victims of such \n     violations lack important remedies for vindication of their \n     rights available to all other employees covered by the FLSA. \n     In the absence of the deterrent effect that such remedies \n     provide, there is a great likelihood that State entities \n     carrying out federally funded programs and activities will \n     use Federal financial assistance to violate the FLSA, or that \n     the Federal financial assistance will otherwise subsidize or \n     facilitate FLSA violations.\n       (5) The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to \n     condition receipt of Federal financial assistance on \n     acceptance by State or other covered entities of conditions \n     regarding or related to the use of those funds, as in Cannon \n     v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979).\n       (6) The Court has further recognized that Congress may \n     require State entities, as a condition of receipt of Federal \n     financial assistance, to waive their State sovereign immunity \n     to suits for a violation of Federal law, as in College \n     Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \n     Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999).\n       (7) In the wake of the Alden decision, it is necessary, in \n     order to foster greater compliance with, and adequate \n     remedies for violations of, the FLSA, particularly in \n     federally funded programs or activities operated by State \n     entities, to require State entities to consent to a waiver of \n     State sovereign immunity as a condition of receipt of such \n     Federal financial assistance.\n       (8) The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that State \n     sovereign immunity does not bar suits for prospective \n     injunctive relief brought against State officials acting in \n     their official capacity, as in Ex parte Young (209 U.S. 123 \n     (1908)). The injunctive relief available in such suits under \n     the FLSA will continue to be the same as that which was \n     available under those laws prior to enactment of this \n     subtitle.\n\n     SEC. 713. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to provide to State employees in programs or activities \n     that receive or use Federal financial assistance the same \n     rights and remedies for practices violating the FLSA as are \n     available to other employees under the FLSA, and that were \n     available to State employees prior to the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999);\n       (2) to provide that the receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance for a program or activity constitutes a State \n     waiver of sovereign immunity from suits by employees within \n     that program or activity for violations of the FLSA; and\n       (3) to affirm that suits for injunctive relief are \n     available against State officials in their official \n     capacities for violations of the FLSA.\n\n     SEC. 714. REMEDIES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES.\n\n       Section 16 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 216) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f)(1) A State's receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance for any program or activity of a State shall \n     constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity, under the 11th \n     amendment to the Constitution or otherwise, to a suit brought \n     by an employee of that program or activity under this Act for \n     equitable, legal, or other relief authorized under this Act.\n       ``(2) In this subsection, the term `program or activity' \n     has the meaning given the term in section 309 of the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6107).''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Fairness and \nIndividual Rights Necessary to Ensure a Stronger Society: The Civil \nRights Act of 2004, known as the Fairness Act. In recent years. the \nSupreme Court has worked to chip away at civil rights laws. This \nlegislation is designed to address many of these decisions, \nparticularly with respect to statutes governing recipients of federal \nassistance.\n  This bill is important to all Americans because it ensures that \neveryone will be treated with fairness and equity under the laws of \nthis country. As a longstanding advocate for disability rights, I am \nparticularly pleased that this bill will reverse some decisions that \nhave limited civil rights protections for people with disabilities.\n  For example, this legislation will reverse some Supreme Court cases \nwhich limit the damage awards for intentional discrimination. A recent \negregious example is Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 2002. This case \nwas brought by an individual who used a wheelchair and was forced into \na police van that was not equipped with the proper restraints. Despite \nhis objections to the officers, the individual was strapped in with \nimproper belts that came loose, throwing him to the floor. The Supreme \nCourt held that this individual could not seek punitive damages under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act for this mistreatment. The Fairness Act will restore \nhis rights and those of others who have suffered discrimination.\n  It will also reverse Buchannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia \nDep't of Health & Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 2001. In that case, \nthe defendant had been sued under the ADA and the Fair Housing Act. The \nCourt held that even if the lawsuit causes the defendants to \nvoluntarily make changes, the plaintiff cannot recover attorneys' fees \nunless he or she has been awarded relief by a court. This case has made \nit extremely difficult to find attorneys to take disability cases.\n  The Fairness Act will also clarify that passengers with disabilities \nmay sue for violations of the Air Carriers Access Act, ACCA, and its \nregulations. A circuit court recently applied the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. to prohibit suits under the \nACAA. Congress intended that individuals have the ability to seek \nredress for violations of this statute.\n  The bill, however, does not address individuals with disabilities in \nsome areas because Congress already has provided clear protection for \nthem. So, for example, Congress has clearly indicated that a private \nright of action exists to enforce disparate impact disability-based \ndiscrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Congress \napproved of the regulations promulgated to implement section 504 and \nincorporated these regulations into the statutory requirements of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n  The bill also does not address the disability-specific negative \ndecisions of the Supreme Court. These decisions have undermined the ADA \nby dramatically narrowing those who are covered under the Act and \nimposing other restrictions. As the lead sponsor of the ADA in the \nSenate, I believe that these cases directly conflict with congressional \nintent. I am working with the disability community and others to \naddress these cases.\n  The Fairness Act is aptly named. It is designed to ensure that \neveryone is treated equally under the law and that America will be a \nNation that protects and enforces the civil rights of all its citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Cochran, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mr. Bond, Mr. Warner, Mr. Talent, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 2091. A bill to improve the health of health disparity population; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am proud to join today with Senator Mary \nLandrieu, Senator Thad Cochran, Senator Mike DeWine, Senator \nChristopher Bond, Senator James Talent, Senator John Warner, and \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison to introduce the ``Closing the Health Care \nGap Act of 2004.''\n  Earlier today, I was pleased to be joined at a press conference by an \nimpressive array of leaders in this fight--Dr. Louis Sullivan, Dr. Rene \nRodriguez, Dr. Randall Maxey, Dr. John Maupin, and Dr. James Gavin. I \nappreciate their support for this legislation, and also appreciate the \nsupport\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\nof other national leaders committed to closing the health care \ndisparity gap in America.\n  Last May, in a speech to graduating students and families at \nMorehouse University's School of Medicine, I outlined a framework for \naction to combat disparities. Since then, I have reached out broadly \nand worked with a wide range of stakeholders and leaders to gather \ntheir input and ideas to ensure the legislation we are introducing \ntoday includes the best possible strategies to eliminate health \ndisparities. I am also proud to be joined today by a number of \ncolleagues who are committed to this cause. I particularly want to \nthank Senator Landrieu for working across party lines on this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  As former Surgeon General Louis W. Sullivan, MD, said at a press \nbriefing earlier today on this legislation, ``[e]thnic minorities \nrepresent the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, and \ntherefore, it is critical that we have a sustained and coordinated \ncommitment to addressing this national problem. The ``Closing the \nHealth Care Gap Act'' seeks to do that. . .''\n  This legislation builds on past bipartisan efforts to address \ndisparities in our health care system--most importantly, the ``Minority \nHealth and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000,'' \nwhich I authored with Senator Edward Kennedy.\n  The legislation we are introducing today goes much farther.\n  Over recent years, we have made tremendous advances in our knowledge \nof and fight against disease. But we know that millions of Americans \nstill experience disparities in health outcomes as a result of \nethnicity, race, gender, or limited access to quality health care. For \nexample, disparity populations exhibit poorer health outcomes and have \nhigher rates of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, infant mortality, cancer, heart \ndisease, and other illnesses.\n  African Americans and Native Americans die younger than any other \nracial or ethnic group.\n  African Americans and Native American babies die at significantly \nhigher rates than the rest of the population.\n  African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanic Americans are at \nleast twice as likely to suffer from diabetes and experience serious \ncomplications from diabetes.\n  These gaps are simply unacceptable in America today. Let me repeat, \nthey are unacceptable. And, today, we begin a new and aggressive effort \nto address these inequities.\n  The root causes of the health care disparities are multiple and \ncertainly complex. That is why we need a broad and comprehensive \napproach to reduce and eliminate these disparities. This legislation \ntakes a bold step in that direction.\n  Many of our Nation's smartest minds have examined this problem in \ndetail. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its landmark report \n``Unequal Treatment,'' concluded that health care disparities are \ncaused by socioeconomic factors, language barriers, access to services \nproblems, behavioral risk factors, and cultural issues including, \nunfortunately, mistrust and misunderstanding of some patients toward \nthe health care system.\n  The ``Closing the Health Care Gap Act'' directly addresses the root \ncauses of health care disparities by focusing on five key areas: \nexpanding access to quality health care; strengthening national \nleadership efforts and coordination; helping increase the diversity of \nhealth professionals; promoting more aggressive health professional \neducation intended to reduce barriers to care; and enhancing research \nto identify sources of racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities and \nassess promising intervention strategies.\n  More specifically, this bill: promotes improved understanding of the \nquality of health care delivered to racial and ethnic minorities and \nhealth disparity populations; improves collection and reporting of data \non the health care of racial and ethnic minorities and health disparity \npopulations; reduces some of the fragmentation of health care delivery \nexperienced by disparity populations; strengthens the doctor-patient \nrelationship by providing a series of tools to improve communication \nand continuity of care; supports the use of community health workers; \nsupports the implementation of multidisciplinary treatment and \npreventive care teams; improves education and information to allow \npatients to better manage and control their own care; and increases the \nproportion of racial and ethnic minorities among health professionals.\n\n  It is important that we act, as well, because health care disparities \nmagnify many of the quality deficiencies in our overall health care \nsystem. This point was well documented by the IOM in a series of \nreports issued during the past several years. Therefore, the bill takes \naggressive steps to improve the quality of health care for all \nAmericans.\n  A key part of this effort necessarily involves the need to strive for \ngreater standardization of health data collection. At the same time, we \nmust ensure that this information allows us to better identify and \naddress gaps in our health care system by including important \ninformation about patients' race and ethnicity.\n  While the Federal Government has a critical role to play, it is \nimportant to remember that government alone is incapable of closing the \ncare and treatment gaps which exist in our health care system. \nTherefore, the legislation promotes partnerships between the Government \nand the private sector, and fosters collaboration at the community \nlevel to improve care, as well as access to care.\n  The bill expands access to quality health care for minority and \nunderserved patients through a community-based model that seeks to help \npatients utilize health coverage that may be available, to provide \nhealth system patient navigator services so that they may best utilize \navailable coverage, to emphasize health awareness, prevention and \nhealth literacy efforts so that patients can effectively take part in \ntheir or their children's treatment decisions, and to improve chronic \ndisease management.\n  Turning our back on these health disparity problems would be a \nnational failure. Every American deserves the best quality of health \ncare possible, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, or where \nthey live.\n  Again, I appreciate the commitment of many of my colleagues. \nTogether, I know we can make great progress against this critical \nproblem.\n  There is a growing awareness on the national level of the existence \nand importance of the serious disparities in the quality of health care \nthat many minority and underserved Americans receive. This presents us \nwith an important opportunity to move forward.\n  My intention is to continue to build this national awareness, which \ncan provide the basis for bipartisan efforts to fight and reduce these \ndisparities. Today's bipartisan bill introduction represents a key step \nin this process.\n  I would like to very quickly thank some of the organizations that are \nsupporting this bill: Interamerican College of Physicians and Surgeons, \nNational Hispanic Medical Association, National Medical Association, \nThe National Conference for Community and Justice, The Association of \nMinority Health Professions Schools, National Urban League, American \nAssociation of Family Physicians, National Patient Advocate Foundation, \nNational Association of Community Health Centers, Health Choice \nNetwork, National Association of Public Hospitals, American Hospital \nAssociation, The Endocrine Society, St. Thomas Health Services, \nAscension Health, The American Society of Transplantation.\n  With this strong base of initial support, the broad consensus that is \nbeginning to emerge on this issue, and the bipartisan commitment of so \nmany, it is my hope that we can make real progress toward eliminating \nhealth care disparities and end--once and for all--this intolerable \nblight on our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n                      Chambliss, and Mr. Cochran):\n\n  S. 2093. A bill to maintain full marriage tax penalty relief for \n2005; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \ncontinue relief from the marriage penalty--the most egregious, \nantifamily provision of the Tax Code. One of my highest priorities in \nthe U.S. Senate has been to relieve American taxpayers of this punitive \nburden.\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\n  Last year, I worked with my colleagues and President Bush to pass a \n$350 billion jobs and economic growth package to put Americans back to \nwork and stimulate the economy. We are now seeing the fruits of our \nefforts. The tax relief has left more money in the pockets of \nindividuals and small businesses, freeing the engines of the economy. \nPrivate sector growth is strong, the stock market is up, and jobs are \nbeing created.\n  One of the most important provisions of the legislation provided \nimmediate marriage penalty relief by raising the standard deduction and \nenlarging the 15-percent tax bracket for married joint filers to twice \nthat of single filers. This provision will save 34 million married \ncouples an average of almost $600 on their 2003 tax bills.\n  Enacting marriage penalty relief was a giant step for tax fairness, \nbut it may be fleeting. Even as people begin to feel the benefits from \nthe relief, a tax increase looms in the near future. Since the bill was \nrestricted by limitations imposed by Congress, the marriage penalty \nprovisions will only be in effect for 2 years. In 2005, marriage will \nagain be a taxable event for millions of Americans.\n  Without relief, 48 percent of married couples will again pay more in \ntaxes.\n  Even as the economy strengthens, many families face difficult choices \nin making ends meet. We must make sure we do not backtrack on this \nimportant reform.\n  The benefits of marriage are well established, but without marriage \npenalty relief, the Tax Code provides a significant disincentive for \npeople to walk down the aisle. Marriage is a fundamental institution in \nour society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living \nin a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or to \nsuffer from child abuse. Research indicates they are less likely to be \ndepressed or have developmental problems. Scourges such as adolescent \ndrug use are less common in married families, and married mothers are \nless likely to be victims of domestic violence.\n  I have sought to make full marriage penalty relief permanent. \nHowever, given the current budget constraints and the politics of an \nelection year, this will be difficult. I therefore am offering this \nbill to extend last year's victory for married couples for 1 year, \nthrough 2005.\n  As Valentine's Day approaches, we should celebrate marriage, not \npenalize it. We cannot be satisfied until couples never again must \ndecide between love and money. Marriage should not be a taxable event.\n  I call on the Senate to build on the 2003 tax cuts and say ``I do'' \nto extending marriage penalty relief today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2093\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 27. A joint resolution recognizing the 60th anniversary of \nthe Allied landing at Normandy during World War II; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce a joint \nresolution commemorating the 60th anniversary of the June 6, 1944 \nlandings in Normandy that paved the way for the liberation of Europe. \nOperation Overlord, code named D-Day, was the culmination of months of \nplanning and strategic air attacks. Under cover of darkness 18,000 \nBritish and American airborne forces were deployed in the initial phase \nof the operation commanded by Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight \nD. Eisenhower. Combined Allied forces landed at Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno \nand Sword as part of the largest air, land, and sea invasion ever \nundertaken. In all, over 5,000 ships and landing craft, 10,000 \nairplanes and 150,000 Allied forces took part in the operation.\n  An estimated 70,000 Americans took part in D-Day operations, \nincluding 225 U.S. Rangers who scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc to \ncapture German heavy artillery emplacements. American troops also \nlanded at Utah beach, and at Omaha beach where they faced a myriad of \nchallenges, including high seas, mines and elite German infantry \nforces.\n  In a radio address and prayer to the American people on the evening \nof June 6, President Franklin D. Roosevelt laid out the mission \nundertaken by G.I.s and Allied forces: ``They fight not for the lust of \nconquest, They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise, and \ntolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They yearn but for the end \nof battle, for their return to the haven of home.'' During the evening \nof June 6, 1944 church bells tolled throughout America and in \nPhiladelphia the Liberty Bell was rung as Americans awaited word from \nthe rocky battlefield of northern France.\n  On that fateful day, 1,465 Americans laid down their lives on the \nfield of battle. Another 3,184 were wounded, 1,928 missing, and 26 \ncaptured. In the days and weeks to follow, thousands more would spill \ntheir blood on French soil to liberate Europe. D-Day ushered in a \nseries of battles over the next three months until the liberation of \nParis in late August 1944.\n  In a very real sense, the fate of Europe hung in the balance of the \nsuccess or failure of the D-Day operations. As a senior member of the \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs, I am especially mindful of the \ntremendous sacrifice made by those men and women of the uniformed \nservices who served with distinction at D-Day and throughout the course \nof World War II. Almost forty percent of U.S. service men and women \nwere volunteers, with the duration of service for all troops averaging \n33 months. Nearly 300,000 Americans made the supreme sacrifice during \nWorld War II, including the valiant troops that took part in D-Day.\n  I would take this opportunity to recognize the World War II military \nservice of current members of the United States Senate: the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Mr. Inouye; the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings; \nthe Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens; the Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner; the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg; and the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Mr. Akaka.\n  As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nI had the privilege to lead a delegation of colleagues to the Normandy \nAmerican Cemetery in July 2001, where we participated in ceremonies \nhonoring Americans killed in D-Day operations. Maintained by the \nAmerican Battle Monuments Commission, the cemetery is the final resting \nplace for 9,386 American service men and women and honors the memory of \nthe 1,557 missing. The superintendent of the cemetery noted that each \nyear the sea surrenders the remains of Americans who fought and died in \nthe service of freedom at home and abroad.\n  The Normandy American Cemetery, Mr. President, is the resting place \nfor 100 Coloradans who gave their lives on the field of battle. From \nToffoli and Sweeney to Martinez the roster is a testament to diversity \nof those from my home state of Colorado who answered the call to defend \nfreedom along the rocky coast of a distant land.\n  I urge my colleagues to act quickly on this resolution which will \ncommemorate the 60th anniversary of D-Day and honor those who so \nbravely served in that effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\n                              S.J. Res. 27\n\n       Whereas June 6, 2004, marks the 60th anniversary of D-Day, \n     the first day of the Allied landing at Normandy during World \n     War II by American, British, and Canadian troops;\n       Whereas the D-Day landing, known as Operation Overlord, was \n     the most extensive amphibious operation ever to occur, \n     involving on the first day of the operation 5,000 naval \n     vessels, more than 11,000 sorties by Allied aircraft, and \n     153,000 soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the Allied \n     Expeditionary Force;\n       Whereas the bravery and sacrifices of the Allied troops at \n     5 separate Normandy beaches and numerous paratrooper and \n     glider landing zones began what Allied Supreme Commander \n     Dwight D. Eisenhower called a ``Crusade in Europe'' to end \n     Nazi tyranny and restore freedom and human dignity to \n     millions of people;\n       Whereas that great assault by sea and air marked the \n     beginning of the end of Hitler's ambition for world \n     domination;\n       Whereas American troops suffered over 6,500 casualties on \n     D-Day; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States should honor the \n     valor and sacrifices of their fellow countrymen, both living \n     and dead, who fought that day for liberty and the cause of \n     freedom in Europe: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the Allied landing \n     at Normandy during World War II; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the anniversary \n     with appropriate ceremonies and programs to honor the \n     sacrifices of their fellow countrymen to liberate Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1311-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 302--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT SUPPORT THE FEBRUARY 20, 2004, ELECTIONS IN \n   IRAN AND THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SEEK A GENUINE DEMOCRATIC \nGOVERNMENT IN IRAN THAT WILL RESTORE FREEDOM TO THE IRANIAN PEOPLE AND \n                         WILL ABANDON TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. DeWine, Mr. McCain, Mr. \nWyden, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Landrieu, and \nMr. Chambliss) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 302\n\n       Whereas there is a long history of mutual affection, \n     appreciation, and respect between the people of the United \n     States and the people of Iran, including the incalculable \n     efforts by the United States in providing humanitarian, \n     financial, and technological assistance to help the people of \n     Iran;\n       Whereas the people of Iran have shown support for decency \n     and freedom, and solidarity with the United States, including \n     the demonstration of such support through candlelight vigils \n     attended by the youth of Iran in the wake of the September \n     11, 2001, attacks upon the United States;\n       Whereas the Council of Guardians is a 12-member unelected \n     body, composed of the most extreme anti-American, anti-\n     democratic clerics, that has arbitrarily disqualified \n     thousands of candidates, including sitting Members of the \n     Parliament of Iran and members of the reformist movement;\n       Whereas the elections scheduled to be held on February 20, \n     2004, in Iran are fatally flawed;\n        Whereas the Council of Guardians has barred candidates \n     solely for failing to demonstrate blind loyalty to Supreme \n     Leader Ayatollah Khamenei;\n       Whereas the brave efforts of the people of Iran to promote \n     greater democracy and respect for human rights are being \n     thwarted by the actions of the Council of Guardians;\n       Whereas the blatant interference of the Council of \n     Guardians in the electoral process ensures that the elections \n     scheduled for February 20, 2004, will be neither free nor \n     fair; and\n       Whereas the circumstances in Iran clearly demonstrate that \n     authentic pro-democratic reform within the regime of Iran is \n     not possible: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should not legitimize or support the \n     elections in Iran scheduled to take place on February 20, \n     2004, as such elections stifle the growth of the genuine \n     democratic forces in Iran and do not serve the national \n     security interest of the United States;\n       (2) the support provided by the United States to Iran \n     should be provided to the people of Iran, and not to any \n     political figure who supports the preservation of the current \n     regime; and\n       (3) the policy of the United States should be to seek a \n     genuine democratic government in Iran that will restore \n     freedom to the people of Iran, will abandon terrorism, will \n     protect human rights, and will live in peace and security \n     with the international community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1311-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 303--COMMENDING THE CARROLL COLLEGE FIGHTING SAINTS \n      FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2003 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF \n  INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS (NAIA) NATIONAL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME\n\n  Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Baucus) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Carroll College \nFighting Saints and to congratulate them on their second consecutive \nNAIA National Championship.\n  The Fighting Saints won their second straight NAIA National \nChampionship by defeating Northwestern Oklahoma State University \nRangers. And what was the score? 41 to 28.\n  We were very worried what kind of game this was going to be, and I \nwas just elated when we broke the game open early and just kept the \nfeet to the fire of the other team and we won by a large margin.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. To the Senator from Oklahoma, I am sure this is a very \nsensitive topic for him and I would be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We have been in mourning over the terrible upset at the \nhands of--is it the Montana Rangers?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Saints.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Montana Saints. Is that an acronym?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Saints generally prevail.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I did not usually put Montana and saints \nin the same sentence, but I understand the Montana Saints prevailed and \nI wish to congratulate the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that. It is the Carroll College Fighting \nSaints. I might say the University of Montana has won AA national \nchampionships a couple of times in the last several years, too. We love \nfootball in Montana. I think--I know as much as people in Oklahoma love \nfootball, with the Sooners and the great history Oklahoma has had in \nfootball.\n  I might say, too, although the game was magical--it is always magical \nwhen you win--magic really did not play a large part in the Fighting \nSaints' victory. It was just good old-fashioned hard work and teamwork. \nCoach Van Diest is one very special guy, a Montanan, a real basic down-\nto-Earth guy who inspires such teamwork, just working together, hard \nwork, making sure nobody takes credit for anything. This is a team \ngame. We all work together to get this done.\n  When you meet the coach and see the team practice with him, it is \nvery apparent. They are very humble. That is why we were very worried \nabout this\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\ngame with Oklahoma. We don't take anything for granted. I am so proud \nof the team.\n  It is hard work on the football field. It is hard work in the weight \nroom. It is hard work in the classroom. These are great guys, led by a \ngroup of very honorable young men through a solid season and an \nincredible string of 12 playoff games. Mike was one of five coaches to \nreceive the American Football Coaches Association Coach of the Year \naward, one of five in the Nation, because he is such an inspirational, \nhard-working, no-nonsense, wonderful guy, representing the high caliber \nof the team and of Carroll College. We are extremely proud.\n  I might say, too, I am proud because this is my hometown. The Saints \nare from a college in Helena, MT. I thank the Saints, thank Coach Van \nDiest, thank them all for their hard work.\n  We may give Oklahoma a few points the next time we play them. We wish \nthem well, too.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes to make some \ncomments on some current issues that occurred over the course of the \nday and in the news. To begin with, I wish to make a statement on a \nbill I had the opportunity to introduce earlier today but have not yet \ntaken the opportunity to comment on, a bill entitled Closing the Health \nCare Gap of 2004.\n  I was proud to join today with my colleagues, Senator Mary Landrieu, \nSenator Thad Cochran, Senator Mike DeWine, Senator Kit Bond, Senator \nJames Talent, Senator John Warner, and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison to \nintroduce this bill, Closing the Health Care Gap of 2004. It is a bill \nthat addresses a major problem and a major challenge we have today in \nhealth care; that is, health care disparities.\n  Last year, I outlined the framework for action to combat these health \ncare disparities that plague our Nation's health care system. Since \nthen, we have reached out broadly to a wide range of national leaders \nand Senate colleagues to gather their input and their ideas. As a \nresult, I believe that legislation embodies an effective strategy to \nreduce and work toward elimination of these health care disparities.\n  Over recent years, we have made tremendous advances in our knowledge \nof and our fight against disease. But we know millions of Americans \ntoday still experience disparities in health outcomes as a result of \nethnicity, or race, or gender, or limited access to quality health \ncare.\n  A couple of examples: Disparity populations exhibit poor health \noutcomes and have higher rates of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cancer, infant \nmortality, and heart disease. The list of illnesses goes on and on. \nAfrican Americans and Native Americans die younger than any other \nracial or ethnic group. African American and Native American babies die \nat significantly higher rates than the rest of the population. Native \nAmericans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans are twice as \nlikely to suffer from diabetes and experience serious complications \nfrom their disease. Today these gaps are simply unacceptable. Today we \nbegin a new and aggressive effort to address these inequities.\n  This bill--Closing the Health Care Gap Act of 2004--addresses the \nroot causes of health care disparities by focusing on five key areas.\n  First, expanding access to quality health care.\n  Second, strengthening national leadership efforts and coordination.\n  Third, helping increase the diversity of health care professionals.\n  Fourth, promoting more aggressive health professional education \nintended to reduce barriers to care.\n  Fifth, enhancing research to identify sources of racial, of ethnic, \nand geographic disparities and assess promising intervention \nstrategies.\n  Every American believes that the best quality of health care \npossible, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or where they live, is \ndeserving. The bipartisan ``closing the health care gap'' would go a \nlong way toward achieving this goal.\n  I appreciate the support of so many colleagues and prominent outside \norganizations, including the National Medical Association, the National \nHispanic Medical Association, the Urban League, and the National \nConference for Community and Justice. Together, we can make real \nprogress toward eliminating health care disparities, closing the Health \nCare Gap Act of 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1413-7", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1413-S1414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CLONING IN SOUTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning, many awoke to the news that \nSouth Korean scientists have successfully cloned a mature human embryo. \nThis is an alarming development. Decades ago C.S. Lewis saw the dangers \nfacing human dignity. In his essay ``The Abolition of Man,'' he warned \nin conquering nature, nature is actually conquering mankind. To clone a \nhuman being is to move from procreation to the manufacture of human \nlife. And this is dangerous.\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\n  My own profession is medicine. A good physician, must, I \nfundamentally believe, also be a very good scientist. I can tell you \nfrom my own experiences as a heart and lung transplant surgeon that \nwithout the revolutionary advances in medical science and in \ntechnology, my own transplant patients, heart and lung transplant \npatients of a decade ago, simply would not be alive today.\n  Indeed, we must reject an irrational fear of technological advance. \nBut the secret of human dignity is living within limits. Those are \nethical limits and they are moral limits. They are limits that do not \nhamper human advances but they preserve them and indeed they promote \nthem.\n  We strongly support ethical stem cell research but we reject the \ncloning of human beings. Not only does human cloning experimentation of \nany kind offend the conscience, it is not medically necessary. As I \nhave said on many occasions, there is no scientific basis to claim that \nhuman cloning experimentation is necessary for the long-term success or \nclinical application of stem cell research. If human beings are \nspecial, if human beings are truly sacred, then we must devote \nourselves to a better world but we must not do evil to bring about \ngood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1414-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SAME-SEX MARRIAGE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. On another issue, and to the best of my knowledge ongoing \nnow, the Massachusetts Legislature is wrestling with how to respond to \ntheir supreme court, which has made same-sex marriage the law of that \nState. Even if the Massachusetts Legislature is successful in passing \nthe constitutional amendment to block same-sex marriage, it will not \ncome before voters for ratification for another 2 years.\n  Beginning on May 17 of this year, Massachusetts will begin issuing \nmarriage licenses to same-sex couples. Once these same-sex couples sue \nfor recognition in their home States, the wildfire will truly begin. \nSame-sex marriage is likely to spread to all 50 States in the coming \nyears. So regardless of what Massachusetts does today, it is becoming \nincreasingly clear that Congress must act and must act soon. The Senate \nwill begin working on the issue in the weeks ahead.\n\n  This is not a fight we sought, and it is a fight we do not \nparticularly relish, but the courts have brought us to it, and the \npeople of this country will respond. We will not let activist judges \nredefine marriage for our entire society.\n  We reject intolerance. We reject hatred. We must treat all our fellow \ncitizens with kindness and with civility. But marriage should remain \nwhat it has always been in our Nation, and that is the union of a man \nand a woman.\n  It is my hope the Massachusetts legislature will act today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1414-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there is one final issue that also is \ncurrent that I want to take the opportunity to comment on because it is \nlikely to be an issue that will be of interest and debated, and one \npeople will be addressing over the coming days while we are on our \nrecess.\n  Last year, President Bush and a bipartisan team of Senators and \nRepresentatives made good on our promise to strengthen and expand and \nimprove Medicare for America's seniors. The bill, the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003, represents the most significant improvement \nto Medicare in two generations. And now, because of this historic \naction, we are starting to see impressive results.\n  We said reform would strengthen the program and increase choice and \nflexibility for our seniors. That is exactly what is happening. \nMedicare now gives more seniors access to more prescription drugs at a \nlower out-of-pocket cost. It provides seniors relief from the high cost \nof prescription drugs, especially the 12 million low-income seniors who \nneed the help the most.\n  The improvements to Medicare provide seniors with choice and control \nover their own health care plans. The new bill also protects seniors \nwho already have prescription drug coverage they earned in the \nworkplace.\n  Educating seniors about improvements to the Medicare program and the \nnew Medicare drug benefit is the right thing to do. It is also required \nby law. The law says seniors have the right to know how the \nprescription drug benefit is going to work and when they can start \ntaking advantage of the new improvements to the program, such as the \ndrug discount card.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues are attempting to subvert this \nlegal obligation. They are blocking our legally required educational \nefforts. Why? Because they are trying to keep seniors from finding out \ntheir rights. They fear that the more seniors learn about the new \nMedicare benefits, the more seniors will like what they see.\n  Not only are the Medicare opponents trying to keep seniors in the \ndark about their Medicare rights, these opponents are disparaging the \neducation effort itself. But try as they may, they will not keep the \ntruth under wraps.\n  This is the ad they do not want you to see.\n  It reads:\n       First senior: So how is Medicare changing?\n\n       The announcer: It is the same Medicare you have always \n     counted on, plus more benefits like prescription drug \n     coverage.\n       Senior No. 2: Can I keep my Medicare just how it is?\n       The announcer responds: Yes, you can always keep your same \n     Medicare coverage.\n       Senior No. 3: Will I save on my medicines?\n       Announcer: You can save with Medicare drug discount cards \n     this June and save more with prescription drug coverage in \n     2006.\n       Senior 4: So my Medicare isn't different, it is just more?\n       Announcer: Right. And you can learn more, call 1-800-\n     MEDICARE.\n\n  That is it. That is the Medicare ad opponents are doing everything \npossible to keep off the air. They don't want seniors to know they are \neligible to receive prescription drug coverage under Medicare, nor do \nthey want seniors to know that starting in June, seniors will be able \nto carry a drug discount card. The opponents don't even want seniors to \nknow the number to call to ask for help. Instead, they are putting \npolitics before people.\n  They will not succeed. We will not allow election year politics to \nhurt America's seniors and individuals with disabilities. We will make \nsure every senior, every individual with a disability gets the \ninformation they need to make the very best choices they can for their \nhealth and for their life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/12/senate-section/article/S1414-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
