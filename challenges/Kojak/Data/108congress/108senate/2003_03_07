Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Virginia organizing this \nopportunity to discuss what is obviously one of the most serious issues \nwhich we as a nation are facing and which the world is facing; that is, \nthe question of how we address terrorism, and specifically how we \naddress terrorist states such as Iraq.\n  The leadership of the Senator from Virginia on this point has been \nlong and strong and continuous. I admire the fact that he has given us \nthat leadership, and I appreciate the fact that his service in the \nSenate and his expertise are brought to bear on this type of a very \ndifficult question.\n  When we begin to address this issue of terrorism, I think we should \nstart with the source. Let us turn to the\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\nwords of the man who has basically orchestrated the attacks on the \nUnited States, Osama bin Laden, and his intentions and the intentions \nof the people he directs, and unfortunately encourages. Osama bin \nLaden, on the issue of weapons of mass destruction, in an interview in \n1999 from Time magazine, said the following:\n\n       Acquiring weapons for the defense of Muslims is a religious \n     duty. If I have indeed acquired these weapons--\n\n  Weapons of mass destruction--\n\n       --then I thank God for enabling me to do so. And if I seek \n     to acquire these weapons, I am carrying out a duty. It would \n     be a sin for Muslims not to try to possess the weapons that \n     would prevent the infidels from inflicting harm on Muslims.\n\n  In a religious order he states:\n\n       We, with Allah's help, call on every Muslim who believes in \n     Allah and who wishes to be rewarded to comply with Allah's \n     order to kill Americans and plunder their money wherever and \n     whenever they find it. The ruling to kill the Americans and \n     their allies, civilians and military, is an individual duty \n     for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is \n     possible to do it.\n\n  These are the words of a fanatic who has a purpose. We have seen the \nexecution of his purpose in the attacks on Americans, with thousands \ndying in New York and others here in Washington, military men and women \nin Yemen, and in our Foreign Service personnel in Africa.\n  The question becomes: From whom would he obtain these weapons of \ndestruction? It is clear that one of the core sources of weapons of \nmass destruction is terrorist states which are producing those weapons \nof mass destruction--states which act outside the responsibility of the \ncivilized world.\n  The state which has most flagrantly pursued that course of action is, \nof course, Iraq. They have weapons of mass destruction. That has been \nconfirmed beyond question--biological and chemical--and they clearly \nare trying to develop nuclear. More importantly, Saddam Hussein has \nused those weapons not only against what he perceives as an enemy--the \nIranians--but against his own people. He has killed thousands of his \nown people and tens of thousands of Iranians using weapons of mass \ndestruction--chemical weapons.\n  We know there are literally tons of Vx gas and pounds of anthrax \nwhich are unaccounted for and which cannot be found--and which are in \nthe possession of Saddam Hussein. Should they fall into the hands of \nOsama bin Laden, it is very clear from his own words that they would be \nused against us here in the United States, and the implications are \nstaggering. If they were to be dispersed in any number of ways, tens of \nthousands of Americans might be harmed and possibly even die.\n  The United Nations has equally recognized that Saddam Hussein is a \nthreat to the civilized world, and a number of resolutions have been \npassed by the United Nations calling for action to be taken by Saddam \nHussein and his regime to comply with international law.\n  In April 1991, almost 12 years ago, the U.N. Security Council decided \nin Security Council Resolution 687 that Iraq shall unconditionally \naccept, under international supervision, the destruction, removal, or \nrendering harmless of its weapons of mass destruction, and ballistic \nmissiles with a range over 150 kilometers. It further required Iraq to \nmake a declaration within 15 days of the location, amounts, and types \nof such items.\n  Twelve years ago that resolution was passed. It is uncomplied with. \nIt has been ignored. It has been intentionally obfuscated by Saddam \nHussein.\n  In August 1991, Security Council Resolution 707 demanded that Iraq \nprovide, without further delay, full, final, and complete disclosure of \nits proscribed weapons and programs as required by the previous \nresolution.\n  That resolution has been ignored, obfuscated, undercut, and actively \navoided by Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  In June 1996, Security Council Resolution 1060 deplored the refusal \nof the Iraqi authorities to allow access to sites designated by the \nSpecial Commission, which constituted a clear violation of three \nprevious resolutions.\n  That resolution has been ignored, obfuscated, and undercut by Saddam \nHussein, and intentionally undermined.\n  In June 1997, Security Council Resolution 1115 condemned Iraq's \nactions and demanded Iraq allow UNSCOM's team immediate, unconditional, \nand unrestricted access to any sites for inspections, and officials for \ninterviews by UNSCOM. Again, the resolution has been ignored, \nundermined, and actively obfuscated and circumvented by Saddam Hussein.\n  In October 1997, Security Council Resolution 1134 demanded that Iraq \ncooperate fully with the Special Commission and demanded also that \nIraq, without delay, allow the inspection teams immediate, \nunconditional, and unrestricted access to any and all areas, \nfacilities, equipment, records, as well as to persons whom the \ninspectors wish to interview.\n  The resolution has been ignored, undermined, and actively obfuscated \nby Saddam Hussein.\n  In November 1997, Security Council Resolution 1137 condemned the \ncontinued violations by Iraq, its tampering with monitoring cameras of \nthe Special Commission, and demanded that Iraq cooperate fully, and \nimmediately.\n  That was in 1997. And there has been no immediate cooperation. In \nfact, there have been active--active--attempts to interfere with and \nundermine that resolution.\n  In March 1998, Security Council Resolution 1154 stressed that Iraq \nmust accord immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access to the \nSpecial Commission, and that any violation would result in the severest \nconsequences for Iraq.\n  Again, Iraq has ignored the resolution and actively worked to \nundermine it.\n  In November 1998, Security Council Resolution 1205 condemned the \ndecision by Iraq to cease cooperation with the Special Commission as a \nflagrant violation of Resolution 687 and other resolutions.\n  In November 2002, Security Council Resolution 1441, which was \nunanimously approved, decided that Iraq has been and remains in \nmaterial breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions and \ndecided to afford Iraq, by this resolution, a final opportunity to \ncomply with its disarmament obligations under the relevant resolutions.\n  Resolution 1441 has been ignored, obfuscated, and actively--\nactively--undermined by Saddam Hussein and his regime.\n  There can be no question--absolutely no question--but that Saddam \nHussein and his regime in Iraq continued to possess weapons of mass \ndestruction, continued to hide those weapons from the inspectors, \ncontinued to violate resolution after resolution of the world \ncommunity, as presented by the United Nations, and represents a clear \nand present and immediate threat not only to its neighbors, but more \nspecifically to us, the United States.\n  There are some in the world community, obviously--mostly in Europe--\nsome of our allies, who, for whatever their personal reasons or \nwhatever their national interests, have decided Saddam Hussein does not \nrepresent the threat we know he is. I might even recall the words of \nWashington when I think of that. Washington advised us, of course: Why, \nby interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle \nour peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, \ninterest, humor, or caprice? There are interests there that are not \nours. But in the end our purpose must be our national security and the \nsecurity of our people.\n  It was not, of course, Berlin or France or Paris that was attacked. \nIt was New York City that was attacked. As a result, it is America that \nis at risk.\n  Former President Clinton made it very clear he understood the threat \nof Saddam Hussein. He has described Iraq as a ``rogue state with \nweapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to \nterrorists, drug traffickers or organized criminals who travel the \nworld among us unnoticed.'' He went on to imagine: What if Saddam fails \nto comply with the U.N. resolutions and we fail to act, or we take some \nambiguous third course, which gives him yet another opportunity to \ndevelop this program of weapons of mass destruction? Mr. Clinton \nanswered his own question by saying:\n\n       Well, [Saddam] will conclude that the international \n     community has lost its will. He will then conclude that he \n     can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of \n     devastating destruction. And someday, some way, I guarantee \n     you he'll use the arsenal. And I think every one of you who's \n     worked on this for any length of time believes that, too.\n\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\n\n  That was President Clinton.\n  Last night, President Bush made it very clear that he understands his \npurpose as President, his responsibility as Commander in Chief, but \nmore importantly, his responsibility as a leader of the free world, and \nthe protector of the interests of the American people and the lives of \nAmericans, must involve the disarmament of Iraq.\n  There can be no question about that. Iraq must be disarmed. We are \nengaged in a war. Some on the other side have said or implied there is \nno war and, therefore, we should not go to war. But when our buildings \nwere attacked and our people died in New York, and when our people died \nin Washington, and when our sailors were killed in Yemen, and our \nForeign Service people were killed in Africa, clearly, those were acts \nof war directed at us and at our people.\n  Were this the 19th century or well into the 20th century, when \ndespots such as Saddam Hussein also existed--all through time there \nhave been despots--then maybe we could take a more casual or leisurely \napproach to this, and maybe we could live by the code of some of our \nEuropean allies: That we simply will do business with them and hope \nthey go away. But those times no longer exist.\n  Today, when a rogue nation, led by a criminal individual, attains \nweapons of mass destruction, the death and destruction which they can \nlevel on people who they perceive as their enemies is overwhelming. The \nsmoking gun is no longer a single bullet. The smoking gun may be a \nnuclear bomb or a biological weapon or a chemical attack which kills \ntens of thousands of Americans.\n\n  We cannot wait for the smoking gun. We know the weapons exist. We \nknow the person who controls those weapons is fundamentally evil. And \nwe know the people who want to attain those weapons have already killed \nthousands of Americans. We must take action.\n  So I congratulate and support our President as he moves forward to \nmake it unquestionably clear we will not tolerate an Iraq that has \nweapons of mass destruction, and we will do what is necessary to \nprotect our Nation and our people and the freedom which we enjoy.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Virginia granting me \nthis time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the contribution of \nour distinguished colleague.\n  We have two speakers on our side ready to go forward, and we will \nrotate, as the case may be. But we now have the distinguished chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, who is also the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Defense within the larger committee, a man who has \ndedicated much of his lifetime to defense issues, beginning in World \nWar II with his distinguished service in the Army Air Corps.\n  I would hope the chairman might make reference to the work that has \nbeen done in his committee with reference to the issues relating to \ninternational terrorism, Iraq, and North Korea, because there is some \nchallenge to the Senate as an institution as to whether or not we are \ngiving attention to these issues. Within the last day or so, I put into \nthe Record a very long recitation of what the Committee on Armed \nServices of the Senate has been doing. I know the Committee on \nAppropriations, particularly the subcommittee, has been very active. We \nalso are likely to hear from the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. His committee has also been doing a great deal of work.\n  We all recognize the value of debates in this historic Chamber, but \nthere is much work going on within the committee structure by \nindividual Senators in their town meetings. So, collectively, this \ninstitution has a good record of addressing the serious issues of our \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia is right. As a \nveteran of World War II and a child of the Depression, I harken back to \nthe days before World War II when we had so much information coming our \nway concerning the scourge that was threatening and did threaten and \nalmost destroyed Europe. We have tried to be vigilant in this country. \nWe have had a series of debates not only on this occasion but at the \ntime of the decision of the United States to fulfill the request of the \nUnited Nations to eject Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. We had similar \ndivisions on the floor of the Senate then. I was sad to hear comments \nmade before that action was initiated, but I was very proud of the \nSenate that after the decision was made to go to war against Iraq in \norder to eject them from Kuwait the Senate came together and supported \nPresident Bush in 1991 to achieve that objective.\n  Now we face a different circumstance. I like to harken back to the \nwords that my good friend, the former Secretary of State, Henry \nKissinger, said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last \nSeptember. He said then:\n\n       We must consider not only the result of action but the \n     consequences of our inaction.\n\n  Secretary Kissinger presents the watchwords for this body to consider \nand think about, especially since this administration and I personally \nbelieve that Saddam Hussein represents a clear and present danger to \nthe United States and to those who believe in freedom throughout the \nworld.\n  As a consequence of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and \nthe war on terrorism that ensued, Secretary Kissinger pointed out that \na new geopolitical reality was born. The world must recognize that the \npotential connection between terrorists and weapons of mass destruction \nmoved terrorism to a new level of threat. In fact, that nexus should be \nthe overriding security issue of our Nation.\n\n  President Bush and his team of national advisers has determined that \nSaddam Hussein is in possession of weapons of mass destruction--\nchemical, biological, and possibly nuclear--which could be used by \nterrorists to threaten the world. There is a great deal of information \ncollected by the United States in the past year concerning that fact.\n  In 2001, an Iraqi defector, Adnan Ihsan Saeed al-Haideri, said he had \nvisited 20 secret facilities for chemical, biological, and nuclear \nweapons. Mr. Saeed, a civil engineer, supported his claims with Iraqi \nGovernment contracts complete with technical specifications. Mr. Saeed \nsaid Iraq used companies to purchase equipment with the blessing of the \nUnited Nations and then secretly used that equipment for their weapons \nprograms.\n  Iraq admitted to producing biological agents and, after the 1995 \ndefection of a senior Iraqi official, Iraq admitted to weaponization of \nthousands of liters of anthrax, botulinum toxin, and aflatoxin for use \nwith Scud warheads, aerial bombs, and aircraft. Our Defense Department \nreported in 2001 that Iraq had continued to work its weapons programs, \nincluding converting an L-29 jet trainer aircraft for potential \nvehicles for delivery of chemical or biological weapons. Just think of \nthat, weaponization of an airplane and using an airplane in a way \nentirely foreign to its original purpose. It reminds me of September \n11.\n  This jet trainer is capable of delivering both of these systems, \nchemical and biological weapons. In fact, Iraq has not accounted for \nhundreds of tons of chemical precursors and tens of thousands of \nunfilled munitions, including Scud variant missile warheads. It has not \naccounted for at least 15,000 artillery rockets that in the past were \nits preferred vehicles for delivering nerve agents, nor has it \naccounted for almost 550 artillery shells filled with mustard agents.\n  Iraq is still purchasing chemical weapons agent precursors and \napplicable production equipment. It is making an effort to hide the \nactivities at the Fallujah plant, which is one of Iraq's chemical \nweapons production facilities, which was one of those production \nfacilities before the gulf war. At Fallujah and three other plants, \nIraq has chlorine production capacity far higher than any civilian need \nfor water treatment. Evidence indicates that some of its chlorine \nimports are being diverted for military purposes.\n  A report issued by the International Institute for Strategic Studies \nconcluded that Saddam Hussein could build a nuclear bomb within months \nif he were able to obtain fissile material. In the last 14 months, Iraq \nhas sought to buy thousands of specifically designed aluminum tubes \nwhich intelligence officials believe were intended\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\nas components for centrifuges to enrich uranium. Iraq has withheld \ndocumentation relative to its past nuclear program, including data \nabout enrichment techniques, foreign procurement, weapons designs, \nexperimental data, and technical documents.\n  Saddam Hussein has repeatedly met with his nuclear scientists over \nthe past 2 years, signaling his continued interest in developing a \nnuclear program.\n  Iraq is believed to be developing ballistic missiles with a greater \nrange than 150 kilometers, as prohibited by U.N. Security Council \nResolution 687. Iraq continues to work on the al-Samoud liquid \npropellant short-range missile which can fly beyond the 150 kilometers \nbarred by the agreements into which it has entered. The al-Samoud and \nthe solid propellant Ababil-100 appeared in a military parade in \nBaghdad on December 31, 2000, suggesting that both were nearing \noperational deployment. The al-Rafah-North facility is Iraq's principal \nsite for testing liquid propellant missile engines, and it has been \nbuilding a new larger test stand there that is clearly intended for \ntesting prohibited long-range missile engines.\n\n  Each of these actions point to the creation of an environment that \nwill permit Saddam Hussein to go after his enemies, whether they are in \nIraq or any other region in the world. And we have seen time and time \nagain Saddam Hussein has no regard for the ideals of freedom, equality, \nand justice for others. He lives in an empty echo chamber of evil.\n  What we must face is that the United Nations resolutions were \nsystematically and brutally ignored and violated for the past 12 years. \nIt was the U.N. inspectors who found it impossible to do their job and \nhad to leave their work unfinished. They returned, and they have been \nat it again, trying to find the evidence to prove what we all believe \nis true.\n  Clearly, the Senator from New Hampshire has just stated Iraq has \nignored now 17 resolutions and blatantly violated the agreement it made \nafter defeat in 1991.\n  What we face is existence of a rogue state with weapons of mass \ndestruction. I wonder if anyone here denies that. They have the \nwillingness to use these weapons and have demonstrated in the past, \nboth against the Kurds and Iran, that they have a hatred for the \ncivilized world. It is a terrorist state now, in my opinion. If we were \nto go to war with Iraq again, we will not be ignoring our war on \nterrorism but trying to stamp out the source of it. Americans must face \nthis responsibility and the realization that we are the one country in \nthe world that can both eradicate this man, bring him to justice, and \nbring the seeds of democracy to a new nation.\n  I hope we will finally hear soon that all of the nations we believed \nwere our partners in seeking freedom will support the objectives of the \nU.N. resolutions that have already passed. I think if we would enforce \nthose, we would achieve a safe and lasting peace for Iraq and remove \nSaddam Hussein from power. In fact, I remind the Senate and the \nPresident of section 6 of the Iraqi Liberation Act of 1998, which urged \nthen-President Clinton to call upon the U.N. to establish an \ninternational criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, \nprosecuting, and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials, \nincluding his sons Qusay and Uday, who are responsible for crimes \nagainst humanity, genocide, and other criminal violations of \ninternational law.\n  Mr. President, I also awakened this morning to find the Washington \nTimes. This story bothers me considerably. It is a story headlined \n``Iraq Strengthens Air Force with French Parts.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full article be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this disturbs me greatly. For the last 20 \nyears, 21 years, I have been privileged to attend the Paris Air Show, \nalong with a substantial number of Americans and our American \ncompanies. I visited those companies in their chalets there. We tried \nto develop what was called a ``two-way street.'' We would buy some \nmaterials from them and they would buy some from us.\n  There is no need for France to sell equipment to Saddam Hussein. It \nis international treason, Mr. President. It is in violation of a U.N. \nresolution, and there should be no question about French officials--\nthey should come forward quickly to deal with this story. As a pilot \nand former war pilot, it disturbs me greatly that the French would \nallow, in any way, parts for the Mirage to be exported so the Iraqis \ncould continue to use those planes. They are good planes, Mr. \nPresident. The French make very good aircraft parts. But they should \nnot be finding their way to Saddam Hussein at this time.\n  I share the concern of the writer of that article about the position \nof the French government, in view of this information now disclosed by \nour intelligence officials. As Senator Warner stated, as chairman of \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I intend to get to the bottom \nof that. We intend to make inquiries today and find out what more we \nknow about what is disclosed in the article regarding the shipment of \nmilitary parts from either France or Germany into Iraq. I believe the \nAmerican people need to know more about this. We need to know why these \ntwo countries, among the best of our allies, are standing on the \nsidelines as we prepare to try to destroy this regime that threatens \nthe world. In my judgment, it is something the Senate must take very \nseriously if either of those governments has allowed the export of war \nmaterials to go to Iraq at this time.\n  I thank my friend for allowing me this time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 7, 2003]\n\n              Iraq Strengthens Air Force With French Parts\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       A French company has been selling spare parts to Iraq for \n     its fighter jets and military helicopters during the past \n     several months, according to U.S. intelligence officials.\n       The unidentified company sold the parts to a trading \n     company in the United Arab Emirates, which then shipped the \n     parts through a third country into Iraq by truck.\n       The spare parts included goods for Iraq's French-made \n     Mirage F-1 jets and Gazelle attack helicopters.\n       An intelligence official said the illegal spare-parts \n     pipeline was discovered in the past two weeks and that \n     sensitive intelligence about the transfers indicates that the \n     parts were smuggled to Iraq as recently as January.\n       Other intelligence reports indicate that Iraq had succeeded \n     in acquiring French weaponry illegally for years, the \n     official said.\n       The parts appear to be included in an effort by the Iraqi \n     military to build up materiel for its air forces before any \n     U.S. military action, which could occur before the end of the \n     month.\n       The officials identified the purchaser of the parts as the \n     Al Tamoor Trading Co., based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \n     A spokesman for the company could not be reached for comment.\n       The French military parts were then sent by truck into Iraq \n     from a neighboring country the officials declined to \n     identify.\n       Iraq has more than 50 Mirage F-1 jets and an unknown number \n     of Gazelle attack helicopters, according to the London-based \n     International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n       An administration official said the French parts transfers \n     to Iraq may be one reason France has so vehemently opposed \n     U.S. plans for military action against Iraq. ``No wonder the \n     French are opposing us,'' this official said.\n       The official, however, said intelligence reports of the \n     parts sale did not indicate that the activity was sanctioned \n     by the French government or that Paris knows about the \n     transfers.\n       The intelligence reports did not identify the French \n     company involved in selling the aircraft parts or whether the \n     parts were new or used.\n       The Mirage F-1 was made by France's Dassault Aviation. \n     Gazelle helicopters were made by Aerospatiale, which later \n     became a part of a consortium of European defense companies.\n       The importation of military goods by Iraq is banned under \n     U.N. Security Council resolutions passed since the 1991 \n     Persian Gulf war.\n       Nathalie Loiseau, press counselor at the French Embassy, \n     said her government has no information about the spare-parts \n     smuggling and has not been approached by the U.S. government \n     about the matter.\n       ``We fully comply with the U.N. sanctions, and there is no \n     sale of any kind of military material or weapons to Iraq,'' \n     she said.\n       A CIA spokesman had no comment.\n       A senior administration official declined to discuss Iraq's \n     purchase of French warplane and helicopter parts. ``It is \n     well known that the Iraqis use front companies to try to \n     obtain a number of prohibited items,'' the official said.\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\n       The disclosure comes amid heightened anti-French sentiment \n     in the United States over Paris' opposition to U.S. plans for \n     using force to disarm Iraq.\n       A senior defense official said France undermined U.S. \n     efforts to disarm Iraq last year by watering down language of \n     U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 that last fall required \n     Iraq to disarm all its chemical, biological and nuclear \n     weapons programs.\n       France, along with Russia, Germany and China, said \n     yesterday that they would block a joint U.S.-British U.N. \n     resolution on the use of force against Iraq.\n       French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin told \n     reporters in Paris on Wednesday that France ``will not allow \n     a resolution to pass that authorizes resorting to force.''\n       ``Russia and France, as permanent members of the Security \n     Council, will assume their full responsibilities on this \n     point,'' he stated.\n       France has been Iraq's best friend in the West. French arms \n     sales to Baghdad were boosted in the 1970s under Premier \n     Jacques Chirac, the current president. Mr. Chirac once called \n     Saddam Hussein a ``personal friend.''\n       During the 1980s, when Paris backed Iraq in its war against \n     Iran, France sold Mirage fighter bombers and Super Entendard \n     aircraft to Baghdad, along with Exocet anti-ship missiles.\n       French-Iraqi ties soured after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait \n     that led to the 1991 Persian Gulf war.\n       France now has an estimated $4 billion in debts owed to it \n     by Iraq as a result of arms sales and infrastructure \n     construction projects. The debt is another reason U.S. \n     officials believe France is opposing military force to oust \n     Saddam.\n       Henry Sokolski, director of the private Nonproliferation \n     Policy Education Center, said French transfers of military \n     equipment to Iraq would have ``an immediate and relevant \n     military consequence, if this was done.''\n       ``The United States with its allies are going to suppress \n     the Iraqi air force and air defense very early on in any \n     conflict, and it's regrettable that the French have let a \n     company complicate that mission,'' Mr. Sokolski said.\n       Secretary of State Collin L. Powell last month released \n     intelligence information showing videotape of an Iraqi F-1 \n     Mirage that had been modified to spray anthrax spores.\n       A CIA report to Congress made public in January stated that \n     Iraq has aggressively sought advanced conventional arms. ``A \n     thriving gray-arms market and porous borders have allowed \n     Baghdad to acquire smaller arms and components for larger \n     arms, such as spare parts for aircraft, air defense systems, \n     and armored vehicles,'' the CIA stated.\n       Iraq also has obtained some military goods through the \n     U.N.-sponsored oil-for-food program.\n       A second CIA report in October on Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction stated: ``Iraq imports goods using planes, \n     trains, trucks, and ships without any type of international \n     inspections--in violation of UN Security Council \n     resolutions.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is always a great pleasure to listen to \nmy distinguished colleague.\n  I wonder if I might just make reference to a point of history. Give \nor take a year or so, both of us lived through the World War II period. \nYou were a distinguished aviator with the Air Corps. I was a mere \nsailor in the closing months. You got overseas and, fortunately, my \ngeneration didn't have to go because of the courage of Harry Truman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am always pleased to be with young men, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  We have to use history as a rearview mirror to explain the complexity \nof the times. You will recall that period in 1937 when the war clouds \nwere gathering in Europe, and Neville Chamberlain went over to see \nwhether or not he could reconcile the situation involving Hitler and \nthe extraordinary buildup of his forces. The world was apprehensive. \nChamberlain emerged from the meeting and flew back to London with a \npiece of paper that said ``peace in our times.'' And then we know the \ntragic events that unfolded after that, with the invasion of Poland in \n1939, and then down through and into France in 1940, and the entrapment \nof the British forces at Dunkerque. The whole world came in on top of \nus because we failed to heed what was absolutely manifest--that Hitler \nwas a despotic dictator, with the then-current generation of weapons of \ndestruction, and he unleashed them on the whole world as we stood by.\n  Mr. President, I fear the same consequences now. That is why I \ncommend our President for his steadfastness, tenaciousness, courage, \nand wisdom in addressing these issues and not flinching or blinking, \nbut staying the course and trying, as he said last night, to make \ndiplomacy work, but recognizing that if diplomacy fails, we have to \nstep into the breach and lead.\n  The Senator mentioned the only nation is the United States, but I \nknow he wishes to include Great Britain.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is why I amended my comment. I certainly do \nadmire greatly the position of Great Britain and its leaders right now.\n  Regarding the comment of the Senator about my memories of 1937, I was \n14 then. I recall listening to people who tried to explain to me what \nwas going on in Europe. It wasn't until much later, really, that I \nlearned, as I entered college and started studying about world \npolicies, just really the sadness of that trip Chamberlain made.\n  I join the Senator from Virginia, Mr. President, because I have just \ntotal admiration for our President and his fortitude.\n  Would there had been leaders in Europe at the time we are discussing \nwho had the courage to stand up to Hitler and try to put together \ncoalitions to stop him from expanding. Once on the floor I compared \nSaddam Hussein to Hitler, and I was criticized for that. In my mind, a \ntyrant is a tyrant and evil is evil. From the days of my youth, Hitler \nwas the epitome of evil. In the time we are now living, I believe \nSaddam Hussein is the epitome of evil, and the President is correct to \ntalk about evil in relationship to this man and his intentions.\n  Above all, I admire the President for his courage to stand up despite \nall the criticism, all the apparent division that is developing in this \ncountry, and saying: We, as a nation, have declared ourselves to be the \nagents for freedom in the world, and we are going to pursue our goal of \nchanging that regime so it cannot threaten the world.\n  I am involved, as the Senator knows, with the problems of the \ndevelopment of oil in my State. I shudder every day to think that as \nthe delivery of oil from Alaska to what we call the south 48 States has \ndeclined, our purchase of Iraqi oil has increased. I wonder how many \nAmericans realize we are sending daily to Iraq moneys that Saddam \nHussein uses to buy this equipment, uses to buy these Mirage parts.\n  The problem of today is we compartmentalize information to the extent \nof saying: Yes, we know that, but on the other hand, some people say, \nwe should not be disturbed by those facts.\n  I am disturbed, and I wonder, as we do go to war with Iraq, about the \nfuture of this country and what happens to that oil and what happens to \nour Nation as we now import about 55 percent of the oil we consume \ndaily. We used to be self-sufficient in oil and gas. We are not today. \nIt is because we have been lured into thinking perhaps if we traded \nwith tyrants such as Iraq, they would recognize the bond of business \nrather than the bond of commitment to principle.\n  I hope we will find the day when the Nation as a whole will join \nPresident Bush and his advisers--what a wonderful array of advisers he \nhas with Secretary Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Secretary Rumsfeld. I \ncannot think of a generation of individuals who are better trained to \nguide this country through a period of crisis than the ones with whom \nthe President has surrounded himself, with the approval of the Senate.\n  I have every confidence in what the President is trying to do. I \nthink it will be a swift and decisive war. It will involve casualties--\ncasualties that could be avoided if other nations of the world would \njoin with us and the people of Iraq understood the world was joined \ntogether to condemn this man and his cohorts.\n  Right know, I believe it is time for us to realize, those who support \nthe President, that we may have to do what he says: We may have to go \nit alone almost. We will have a coalition. The coalition will actually \nbe bigger than 1991 but not the same partners.\n  I agree with the President, we do not need partners on this one. We \ndo not need them. I believe we have right on our side and we have might \non our side and we should use that might for the best interest of the \nworld and the future.\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\n  I thank the Senator for the privilege of being with him this morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I wish to associate \nmyself with his comment about the great team of advisers the President \nhas. They have time and again gone into the forums of the world to \nindicate the necessity for strong action and strong leadership at this \ntime. We certainly have it in this President and his administration. I \nthank my colleague.\n  I see, Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, with the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee still in the Chamber and likewise my \ncolleague, Senator Warner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I \nwish to say what a privilege it is to work with these two great \nSenators.\n  Senator Warner, mentioned, as did Senator Stevens, the great team the \nPresident has assembled with Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Powell, and \nCondoleezza Rice. We are very pleased in the Senate with the leadership \nof Bill Frist as our majority leader, and committee chairmen are \nworking together vigorously.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Virginia for his construction this \nmorning of a very important opportunity for us to think together about \nthe events of the present and likewise our possibilities for the \nfuture.\n  My hope is that the United States of America will continue to lead in \nforming a global coalition that will combat terrorism in a very \neffective way.\n  Terrorists, when armed with weapons of mass destruction, are in a \nposition to create what philosophers would call existential events for \ncountries. By that I mean that weapons of mass destruction in the hands \nof relatively few people--a rogue state, a sub-national group, or maybe \neven a small terrorist cell--are capable of obliterating large cities, \nkilling hundreds of thousands of people, and creating panic in entire \ncountries. One terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction has \nthe potential to create such dislocations in the economy of a country \nthat recovery could take decades. This existential threat from \nterrorism is a new condition for the world that requires changes in our \npolicy priorities. All nations do not understand this with the same \nprecision that the United States and our leadership does. All nations \nhave not been attacked in the same manner we have been.\n  For some members of our body politic, the September 11 attacks were a \nwake-up call, but it was a call that has been heard. When President \nBush and his strategists put forward a response, it was supported by \nthe vast majority of the American people. We knew that the hijackers \nwere from the al-Qaida group. We knew there were al-Qaida terrorists in \nAfghanistan who had been in training camps. We knew that the \nAfghanistan Government, under the Taliban regime, had been hospitable \nto terrorists.\n  We asked the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to turn over the \nterrorists. They were unwilling to do so. As a result, our country led \nan international effort in Afghanistan to root out the terrorists. As \nPresident Bush has pointed out, we pursued this mission in the most \ncareful and humane way with regard to innocent civilians in that \ncountry. We sought to find one by one the individuals who were \nperpetrating not only deeds in the United States of America, but a long \nstring of terrorist atrocities over the previous decade.\n  The military action that occurred there had the support of our NATO \nallies.\n  It had the support of many countries that understood immediately the \nproblems terrorism in the world presents. For example, President Putin \nof Russia and President Bush were on the phone both voicing mutual \nsupport. I mention that particular call because in the past 2 days the \nSenate has had extensive debate on the Moscow Treaty. This debate had \nsignificance for our global position and for an important relationship \nthat has been changing for the better, and which must continue to \nimprove.\n  One reason for discussing the Moscow Treaty at this particular point \nin the life of the Senate was because the Senate is deeply engaged in \nworld affairs, in foreign policy, in defense policy, and deeply \nconcerned about our relationship with Russia. The participation of \nRussia in the war against terrorism is vital. Even at this moment, \nPresident Bush and Secretary of State Powell are working with the \nRussians to come to a somber understanding of what our mutual \nobligations are with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and \nin North Korea and, for that matter, everywhere.\n  These are important conversations. The President of the United States \nin his news conference last night, talked about this vigorous \ndiplomacy. Our President has been reaching out to world leaders on the \nphone. He has been active in attempting to make certain that all \nnations understand the gravity of danger to each one of us and how much \nthe community of nations depend upon the actions of the Security \nCouncil and those who take leadership in the United Nations. These are \nextremely important days for diplomacy. They are critical days for the \nsuccess of the Security Council and the United Nations.\n  In the Senate, we have understood this in our committees. Chairman \nWarner pointed out already the extraordinary number of hearings in the \nArmed Services Committee and the specific ways in which the problems of \nIraq have been addressed by his committee. I congratulate the chairman \nand his committee.\n  Likewise, Senator Stevens has mentioned this morning the \nextraordinary amount of work that occurs in all of the subcommittees on \nappropriations, but especially those that are dealing with our national \nsecurity. In the Foreign Relations Committee we have had hearings \nalmost daily on Iraq, on North Korea, on Afghanistan.\n  Last week, the President of Afghanistan, President Karzai, was before \nour committee making a personal appeal for the kind of support that he \nhopes will be forthcoming from not only the United States, but also \nfrom the European countries and from nations in his neighborhood. \nDemocracy must succeed in Afghanistan, as we hope that it will in Iraq, \nand as we hope that it will in all countries of the Middle East. \nAspirations for freedom can be fulfilled if democratic institutions are \nbuilt.\n  This is what the coalition against terrorism is about. Clearly, we \nare concerned with the threats from Iraq, but we also want the \ncoalition to understand the role of expanding freedom. The future is a \ngreat one for people who have freedom, but at this particular moment \nterrorists would deny all of us the opportunity to have freedom.\n  Last evening President Bush indicated that Saddam Hussein has the \nability and opportunity to surrender the weapons of mass destruction \nthat were cataloged by the United Nations in 1998 and 1999 and are \nstill in Iraq. Resolution 1441, adopted unanimously by the Security \nCouncil of the United Nations, said to Saddam Hussein: This is your \nlast chance. Disarm or show evidence you have disarmed.\n  Each of the succeeding reports from the inspectors have indicated \nthat Iraq has minimally cooperated in allowing inspectors to go to \nvarious sites, but the Iraqi regime obviously has been very reluctant \nto show evidence of disarmament or, in fact, to disarm. Even the Iraqi \nmissiles possessing an illegal range, which are an undisputed and \ntangible violation, are being surrendered only gradually in the most \nresistant manner possible.\n  There are reports in the American press of destruction of a few of \nthese, but in the Iraqi press, or at least among people in that \ncountry, there is no word of this. In part, it is supposed that Saddam \nwould be embarrassed by the disclosure that he has been found out and \nis disarming at all.\n  I mention all of this because these are fateful days in bringing \ntogether a coalition, hopefully of the Security Council--absent that, a \ncoalition of the willing--that knows the war against terrorism can only \nbe won if weapons of mass destruction in the hands of aggressive \ndictators are destroyed. Our President has said as the bottom line, \nSaddam will be disarmed. In the aftermath of that event, we will have a \ngreat deal of work to do in this body.\n  There are expenses involved in disarming Saddam. I think every one of \nus, as committee chairmen, as Senators, have been up front with our \npeople. We know this is costly and we\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\nknow our Armed Forces are at risk. We know a lot of things are at risk. \nOne thing that must not be at risk, however, is the movement to build a \ngreater coalition in the war against terrorism.\n  I will now speak specifically about the fact that in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, starting March 25, we will be having hearings on \nratification of the NATO treaty of enlargement. The occupant of the \nchair will recall that a fairly short time ago, seven nations were \ninvited into NATO membership. They have been busy fulfilling the \nrequirements that came with that invitation. They include the Baltic \nStates, as well as Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia and Slovakia. I will \nsuggest that the hearings on NATO enlargement will, in fact, fulfill an \neven a greater purpose. We will have an opportunity to discuss the \nimportance of each of the countries in NATO and the historical \nimportance of America and Canada reaching across the Atlantic for over \n50 years and working with European friends to guarantee peace on a \ncontinent which has known no peace in any 50-year period in the last \nmillennium.\n  This is the reason that European countries have sought NATO \nmembership. They have wanted to be in a Europe whole and free. They \nhave talked freely about obligations out of area. They are eager to \nparticipate in the war against terrorism. They want to be strong \nfriends of the United States of America and manifest that every day. \nThat is something to celebrate. We will do so as we discuss NATO.\n\n  But as we discuss NATO, we will also discuss its future, which must \nbe a very strong future. My prayer is that all of our NATO allies will \nbe with us in the event Saddam Hussein does not disarm. I hope that in \nthe event NATO allies are not with us on that particular day, they will \nget their soon. All of our friends are going to be needed as we think \nabout the future of Iraq and work with the people of that country for \nthe building of democratic institutions.\n  I hope we are all prepared for vigorous activity in Afghanistan to \nensure the success of that state. I hope that we will sustain a \npartnership with Afghanistan that will inspire confidence throughout \nthe world in our commitment to freedom.\n  I conclude simply by saying that the President is offering strong \nleadership and I support him. I am prepared to work with the President \nin pursuit of all the objectives he has in the days and months ahead. I \nknow from the words of the President that he foresees a future that is \nfilled with complexity, but one that also is filled with promise for \nour country and for others that share our vision.\n  Therefore, we should face this day with optimism because we have a \nplan for a future that looks brighter than the future did on September \n11, 2001. On that date we discovered that the oceans did not guarantee \nour safety, that we were vulnerable, that Americans were dying, that \nour most cherished landmarks--including this Capitol--were at risk. And \nI suspect each of us prudently understands that this is still the case. \nBut rather than going into a situation of panic, as resolute Americans, \nwe found leadership with President Bush and new reservoirs of strength \nwithin ourselves. This is a place of resolute activity in each of our \ncommittees and on the floor of the Senate in discussing the most basic \nforeign policy and defense issues of our time, doing so with \nintelligence, with optimism, and likewise, with an ability to listen to \neach other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am very grateful for the services of our \ndistinguished colleague from Indiana and his long experience in the \nSenate and now having risen to new heights in his distinguished career \nas chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I have also enjoyed a very warm and strong relationship with my \ncolleague through the years. He is too modest to talk about it, but he \nserved in the U.S. Navy in a position as adviser on foreign policy to \nthe then-Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Burke. He watched many of \nthe key issues on the world scene unfold.\n  I made reference to the Chamberlain speech that we will have peace in \nour time. I addressed this colloquy to Senator Stevens who, like me, \nlived through that era. I wonder if the Senator might have some \ncomments on it. It is so appropriate that the world be reminded that \nthere have been parallels in history where we have been faced with the \nrise of a dictator, and the dictator possessed vast arsenals of weapons \nand had a proven track record of having used the weapons against other \npeople and other nations, and how this is the time for the strongest \nleadership, which I believe is being offered by our friend. It is being \noffered by the Prime Minister of Great Britain.\n  How severely we regret the leadership of France and Germany, \ncertainly nations venerable in history, having lived through so many \nperiods of turbulence on that continent, cannot recognize today the \nparallels of years past. I wonder if the Senator might have a viewpoint \non that, particularly with reference to France.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, who, \nlikewise, distinguished himself as Secretary of the Navy at another \ntime in his career. The Senator clearly has seen parallels at various \ntimes.\n  Historically the path for the United States, France, and Germany was \nnot always easy during the Cold War period. The potential for \nhostilities with the old Soviet Union tested us many times. I can \nrecall, as can the Senator, when Helmut Schmidt went to London in 1979, \nand came forward with a very bold statement. He said that if the Soviet \nUnion did not withdraw medium-range missiles that were aimed at Europe, \nthen NATO must put missiles on European soil to counteract them. The \nRussians perhaps predictably, moved their missiles forward and \nindicated in an intimidating way that they might be prepared to take \naction sooner, rather than later, against Europe.\n  There were rallies throughout Europe, with people saying, ``better \nred than dead.'' All the major capitals had frequent marches with \npeople claiming peace is what they wanted, but also with some admitting \nthat they would be prepared to live under communism as opposed to \nhaving the proper military preparation to combat and deter communism.\n  In those days the stepping forward of Prime Minister Kohl was \ncritical. Germany came forward and said you can put Pershing missiles \non our soil, and so did the Italians.\n  I cite that event because it was an important and courageous step in \na time of great uncertainty and fear. It led, ultimately, to President \nBush, the father of our current President, committing America to German \nunification well before Great Britain, well before France. And Germans \nunderstand that. That was the basis upon which the unification of the \ncountry came.\n  Now, from time to time, the French have been extraordinarily helpful, \nand I think we need to remember that they have participated in many \ncritical NATO policies and operations. They have asked us to step \nforward specifically in Bosnia where they believed they had a history, \nas did Germany, that they simply could not overcome.\n  I mention all these things off the top of the head because they are \nimportant, as ways in which we have worked together when there were \nurgent mutual problems. NATO has not been a hollow alliance. It has \nbeen central to the security of Europe and our nation.\n  On this floor we debated the INF Treaty which provided that all \nintermediate-range missiles come down, every one of them, on both \nsides. This happened only because of the strength of the alliance and \nour mutual action. That is what we ask of our friends now, that they \nremember that fairly recent history of our solidarity against \ntyranny. And they understand that terrorism could hit them. The war \nagainst terrorism is not just the United States versus al-Qaida. \nTerrorists could just as well level the Brandenburg Gate or the Eiffel \nTower or symbols that are important quite apart from the human losses \nof those who got in harm's way.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. If I might bring \nanother issue to the forefront on which he has a great deal of \nexperience? As this debate is taking place in the Senate Chamber this \nmorning, Hans Blix presumably is addressing the Security Council. I, \nfrankly, think that the inspection process under his leadership--they \nhave tried and tried hard. What the world fails to realize is that \nSaddam Hussein, having observed the first\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\ninspection process, has carefully made his infrastructure, which has \ngone on creating the weapons of mass destruction, be they biological, \nchemical, or indeed his vigorous efforts to acquire a nuclear \ncapability. They have gone right on throughout this entire period of \ntime. And they have been constructed in such a way that they are \nmoveable. He did that recognizing that at some point in time another \ninspection regime could be imposed upon him by the United Nations, as \nwas done with Resolution 1441.\n  I think the inspectors have tried. They have unearthed very little. \nThey have not received the cooperation from Saddam Hussein that was the \npredicate on which Resolution 1441 was adopted. It simply said you are \nto cooperate, the inspectors to verify and destroy. But in reality the \ninspectors have been converted to a group trying to search out, given \nthe failure of cooperation, where these weapons might be located.\n  I will discuss later this morning a letter I received yesterday from \nthe Central Intelligence Agency, under the signature of George Tenet, \nresponding to the cooperation that our country has given the inspection \nefforts of Hans Blix, by virtue of sharing the intelligence information \nwe had with regard to the location of probable caches of these weapons.\n  In fact, it has not borne out to be very fruitful because of Saddam \nHussein's skill of moving these caches, of moving the infrastructure of \nmanufacturing in such a manner that they cannot be detected and \ndiscovered without his cooperation, which he has steadfastly refused to \ngive. Our President addressed that issue last night.\n  I wonder if my colleague would comment a little bit on the inspection \nprocess. As we are speaking, Blix is giving his most recent report. As \nyou know, there are statements to the effect, from other nations, that \nperhaps the period of time should be extended. The President last \nnight, when confronted with those questions, simply said, as I think he \nshould and very properly said: Time will tell.\n  I invite the Senator's observations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator for his inquiry. The Senator is \ncorrect, times have changed with regard to inspection. Let me offer as \nan anecdote the Russian facility at Pokrov. This situation is not well \nknown, but it is an agricultural chemical station. Pokrov is an example \nof the problems which confront Hans Blix and the inspectors.\n  As I and others went there at the invitation of Russians, we looked \naround at a rather desolate-looking place with run-down buildings. We \nwere led to a room in which people were making shampoo. They were using \nstainless steel equipment. I would say, without two Russians at my \nside, I would have had no idea about the history of that room, quite \napart from the facility. But they pointed out that just months before, \nanthrax was produced in the same machinery. This is dual use in \na dramatic way. Equipment used for biological weapons had been easily \nconverted to producing a commercial product. Likewise on this premise, \nbut clearly not within view, were stores of anthrax. In fact, on the \nthird floor of another building they had been making anthrax. In \nanother building, they had been making dual-use materials for \nagricultural livestock. One was to produce antidotes so they could \nprotect, they thought, the Russian livestock. The other use was to \nproduce toxins, deadly toxins, out of 14 serums that were in vials in a \nroom, in an icebox, that could kill all the livestock in the United \nStates.\n\n  My point is that we would have been clueless without those who could \ngive us a 25-year history of the activities at Pokrov. All of it could \nhave been completely hidden. There was not a ghost of a chance an \ninspector would find anything there in years, quite apart from months.\n  These are old facilities. Saddam Hussein, and others, have gone to \nschool on dual use. Therefore I simply say, as the chairman already \nknows, the production of chemical weapons is clearly enveloped in dual \nuse. There is not a ghost of a chance you will find a scintilla of it \nunless Iraq wants you to find it.\n  Regarding the biological situation, as Secretary Powell already \npointed out in his public address at the U.N., the Iraqis are able to \nbreak down all the equipment, put it in vans and cart it down the road \n200 miles. Unless the inspector is clued in that this particular van \nout of all the vans in Iraq has a biological laboratory in it, there is \nnot a chance, zero, of finding anything there.\n  This is the reason why the inspection business is at best a holding \naction. Those who argue in favor say: After all, with all those \ninspectors there, with all of the press following them out every day, \nsurely Saddam Hussein cannot now be producing a whole lot.\n  But that doesn't solve the problem of what is there, detailed by the \nU.N., after all these years. Nor does it solve the problem of the \nintellectual inquiry of scientists who even as we speak are working on \nnew formulations. They don't need huge factories and installations \nvisible from the air. They need only the necessary scientific knowledge \nand, ultimately, fissile material from somewhere else to get the bomb. \nAnd each intelligence report that we have all seen--those now made \npublic--say Iraq may be a year, 2 years, 3 years from making a nuclear \nweapon. But there is always the footnote: If they get the fissile \nmaterial from somewhere else--it will take far less time.\n  That is the basis on which our President has to say the security of \nthe American people is at stake. This is not a speculative business for \nwe all know fissile material exists in the world, a lot of it in \nRussia. A lot of it is still not pinned down by the cooperative threat \nreduction program or anything else. That is a tremendous danger, and we \nall ought to recognize that. It is not going to go away with \ninspectors.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I guess what both you \nand I find so perplexing is how responsible world leadership, most \nparticularly France and Germany, which have seen the same facts, have \naccess to basically the same intelligence, and cannot reach those \nlogical conclusions which our President and the Prime Minister of Great \nBritain have reached.\n  Mr. LUGAR. We must continue to assist them in reaching those \nconclusions.\n  Mr. WARNER. I must say, if I could just ask the indulgence of my \ncolleague, my father served in World War I as a doctor in the U.S. Army \nin the trenches in France. My most prized possession, I say to my good \nfriend, is on the wall in my Senate office. For these 25 years that I \nhave been here, on that wall hangs this Croix de Guerre awarded him by \nthe French Government for his heroism in the trenches for administering \nhealing to Americans, British, Frenchmen, and Germans. I sometimes \nthought myself, and when the French ambassador visited my office a few \ndays ago, in a courteous way I pointed it out and I said, you know, I \nam thinking of taking it down, but perhaps better judgment will prevail \nin your leadership. And therefore for a while I am going to leave it \nup, in the hopes that reality can be brought to bear.\n  I thank my colleague for his time.\n  I recognize the order entered into at the direction of both the \nmajority and minority leaders of the Senate was that the Senate would \nproceed this morning on the debate with regard to the worldwide \nsituation on terrorism with an emphasis on Iraq, North Korea, and other \nareas, and the time under the control of the Senator from Virginia, the \ntime having been equally divided, is rapidly approaching the 2-hour \nmark which is the halfway.\n  I see a colleague desiring recognition, but I remind that colleague, \nwho courteously advised me that perhaps the subject matter was not that \nin the order, but I would have to say the time that he uses would have \nto be charged to the other side.\n  I have some maybe 15 minutes remaining under the control of the \nSenator from Virginia, which I will hold in reserve for such rebuttal \nas may be required on the issues specifically recited in the order \nbefore the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The order before the Senate is for \nmorning business. Those in control of time may choose to speak on any \nmatter they so choose.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/07/senate-section/article/S3348-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3348-S3356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AIR POLLUTION AND GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, my subject is different but it is \nsimilar in\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\nthat it talks about loss of lives and possible threats, the apparent \nand real threats to the people in this country from a different angle \nbut a much more serious one and one that is going to result in many \nmore deaths. I wish to speak on the subject of the threat to lives in \nthe United States of a different and more insidious nature, and in the \nlong run much more costly in human lives as well as health conditions--\nair pollution and the administration's failure to recognize this threat \nthrough adequate pollution controls.\n  I rise today to draw Senators' attention to the administration's \nflawed plans on air pollution and global warming. I am pleased to see \nthat the administration has finally revived an interest in dangerous \npublic health and environmental threats like acid rain and smog. They \nhave even acknowledged that climate change could have severe and \ndamaging consequences.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's solution seems to be little more \nthan a public relations distraction from what is really going on: \ncorporate regulatory relief.\n  What Americans really need now is relief from air pollution, and \nswift and serious action to avert global warming. They have a right to \nbreathe air that isn't contaminated by greed. They have a right to full \nand vigorous implementation of the Clean Air Act. Sadly, the \nadministration has lost sight of these rights.\n  The devastation caused by dirty air is staggering. As many as 60,000 \npremature deaths each year are linked to air pollution, according to an \nAmerican Cancer Society study and researchers at the Harvard School of \nPublic Health.\n  A study by the respected Abt Associates says that 30,000 of these \ndeaths are due to power plant pollution alone. That is an enormous loss \nof human potential, and a huge cost to society. There is no good reason \nto allow such a tragedy to continue unfolding.\n  This chart illustrates the magnitude of this terrible situation. More \npeople are dying from power plant pollution every year than die from \nhomicides or drunk driving accidents.\n  With real reductions in air pollution, such as those in S. 366, the \nClean Power Act of 2003, which I introduced almost 3 weeks ago with \nSenators Collins, Lieberman and 17 others, we can save two-thirds of \nthose lives.\n  This benefit is reflected on the right side of the chart.\n  The Abt Associates report also says that power plants are responsible \nfor the following statistics each year: 20,000 hospitalizations; \n600,000 asthma attacks; 19,000 cases of chronic bronchitis; and 5 \nmillion lost work days due to illness.\n  Fine particulate matter is a serious form of air pollution that poses \nan especially severe health threat. Fine particles result from the \ninteraction of water vapor with sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide \nemissions.\n  Most of these pollutants come from power plants. These tiny particles \nreach easily into the deepest depths of the human lungs.\n  A host of scientific studies have linked particulate matter with a \nbarrage of health problems.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a representative list of such studies be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Bibliography of Select Research on the Health Impacts of Soot\n\n     2002:\n       National Environmental Trust 2002. ``Toxic Beginnings: \n     Cancer Risks to Children from California's Air Pollution.'' \n     See http://environet.policy.net/health/\ntoxic__beginnings02.pdf.\n       Pope, C.

Mr. President, when these tiny particles get deep into \nthe lungs, they can lead to premature death, as well as health problems \nlike: heart and lung disease; aggravated asthma; acute respiratory \nsymptoms; chronic bronchitis; decreased lung function; and even lung \ncancer.\n  There is even evidence that this pollution causes an increased \nincidence of low birth rate and infant mortality. Sensitive populations \nlike children, asthmatics, and the elderly are at particular risk of \nhealth damage.\n  Power plant emissions of nitrogen oxides and emissions from mobile \nsources contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone as well. This \nis another serious threat that scientists increasingly believe to be a \nchronic health problem, not just one that poses acute risks.\n  Recently, respected scientists from the University of Southern \nCalifornia School of Medicine, and elsewhere published an important \nasthma study.\n  They found that children in communities with high average ozone \nlevels who compete in three or more team sports have a three-to-four-\ntimes higher risk of developing asthma than non-athletic kids. They \nhave three times the normal expectations of illness than nonathletic \nkids. This is because athletes get a higher dose of pollutants to the \nlung, and because they breathe rapidly and deeply.\n  We should listen to these and other scientific findings, and take to \nheart the suffering that many Americans experience due to air \npollution. Power plants are a major culprit. It is our duty as \nlawmakers to do something now to curb these dangerous emissions and \nprotect public health.\n  While the Clean Air Act has been successful in removing millions of \ntons of particulate-forming emissions from our air, it has not gone far \nenough, and these health problems remain. Plus, there are major signs \nthat this administration is slowing down implementation and enforcement \nof the act. This delays its benefits and increases human health damage.\n  Air pollution causes significant harm to our natural environment as \nwell. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides--emitted mainly from fossil \nfuel combustion--eventually fall to earth as acid.\n  Acid rain washes vital minerals out of the soil, weakens the health \nof trees, lowers the pH of water bodies, and leaches aluminum into \nlakes where fish slowly suffocate from the lack of oxygen. A stunning \n41 percent of lakes in the Adirondacks are acidified.\n  A 1996 EPA report admitted that the Acid Rain Program of the present \nClean Air Act could only slow the rate of ecosystem damage that, \ndespite this program, more lakes would die. Acid rain scientist Dr. \nGene Likens has said:\n\n       We still have a very major problem with acid rain. That is \n     scientific fact. In that regard, the 1990 Clean Air Act \n     Amendments have not worked very well.\n\n  An important new study by researchers at the University of Vermont \nconfirms that the acid rain problem is far worse than previously \nthought. Tightening sulfur emissions further--combined with strict, new \ncontrols in nitrogen emissions--would help restore our forests, lakes, \nand streams.\n  The Hubbard Brook Research Foundation knows what is required to \nensure biological recovery from acid rain by mid-century in the \nnortheastern U.S. They say we must reduce utility sulfur dioxide \nemissions by 80 percent beyond what is currently required in the year \n2010. It is clearly time to act.\n  Current air pollution levels are also hindering visibility at our \nmajestic National Parks. Chronic air pollution continues to envelop the \nGreat Smoky Mountains, Acadia National Park, Shenandoah, and other \nsites in a blanket of haze.\n  This not only costs regions vital tourism dollars, but endangers the \nhealth of park visitors, plants, and wildlife.\n  Air emissions of mercury cause severe health effects as well. Mercury \nis a potent nervous system toxic. After being emitted into the air, it \nfalls into lakes and streams. Mercury then bioaccumulates in fish and \nanimal tissue, taking on a highly toxic form.\n  Eating contaminated fish can cause serious nervous system impairment, \nespecially to a pregnant mother's developing fetus, or to a young \nchild.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 12 \nwomen of childbearing age in the U.S. have mercury levels above those \nconsidered protective of newborns by the EPA. That means as many as \n390,000 children are born each year at risk of developmental problems.\n  We have such a widespread mercury contamination problem in our \ncountry that 41 States currently post fish consumption warnings.\n  Power plants, especially coal-fired utilities, emit the bulk of \nuncontrolled mercury emissions in the U.S. Yet the technology exists \ntoday to save lives. As James Willis, Director of the UN Environment \nProgramme 2003 Global Mercury Assessment, states:\n\n       There are technologies available already which will reduce \n     mercury emissions from power stations by about 80% . . . what \n     we can do now is often cheap--and it can cut other pollutants \n     as well.\n\n  I have highlighted some of the ways in which air emissions of sulfur \ndioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury--especially from power plants--\nthreaten the health and safety of millions of Americans and the natural \nenvironment. But I am afraid to say that Americans may face an even \ngreater long-term threat from greenhouse gas pollution.\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\n  Carbon dioxide is the most significant greenhouse gas emitted as a \nresult of human activities. The National Academy of Sciences faults \nfossil fuel combustion with causing most of the global warming problem. \nIn fact, fossil fuel-burning power plants are responsible for 37 \npercent of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.\n  The U.S. made a commitment under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change to adopt voluntary measures to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels. But despite this goal, \nemissions from the power sector have grown steadily and are now 20 \npercent above those levels.\n  Our world has already seen about one degree of warming in the last \ncentury. The NAS and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \ngenerally agree that the Earth will warm another 2.5 to 10 degrees \nFahrenheit over the next 100 years. This could cause significant, \nabrupt climate changes, as well as threaten our public health, the \neconomic infrastructure, and many ecosystems.\n  The President's own Climate Action Report says, ``the best scientific \ninformation indicates that if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to \nincrease, changes are likely to occur.''\n  Global warming is expected to have wide-reaching and mostly negative \nimpacts on human health. We are likely to see direct impacts like death \nand illness due to heat stress and extreme weather. We are also likely \nto see indirect impacts from worsened air pollution and allergens, and \nincreases in the occurrence and transmission of diseases like malaria \nand, perhaps, West Nile Virus.\n  We have already seen a dramatic number of heat-related deaths since \nthe 1980s. A 1980 heat wave in the U.S. resulted in 1,700 deaths, while \nthose in 1983 and 1988 killed around 500 people each. Also, we all \nremember the deadly heat wave of 1995 that killed 765 people in Chicago \nalone. That is what we are looking towards if we continue to allow the \ncarbon to accumulate.\n  These numbers are much too high, and they are only going to get \nhigher if the climate models are right. Experts predict that in cities \nsuch as New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Los Angeles, heat-\nrelated deaths could increase 100 percent.\n  According to EPA and others, sea-level rise from global warming will \nbring on another set of consequences. Sea level is predicted to rise by \none foot in the next 20 to 50 years. In the next 100 years, a two-foot \nrise is most likely, and a four-foot rise is possible.\n  To put this in perspective, the EPA says that simply raising existing \nbulkheads and sea walls along the Manhattan shoreline alone to help \nprotect it from a one to three-foot rise would cost up to $140 million.\n  According to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a 20-inch sea \nlevel rise could have significant cumulative impacts on coastal \nproperty in the U.S.\n  These impacts could range from about $20 billion to about $150 \nbillion by the year 2100.\n  The environmental impacts of sea level rise would be devastating as \nwell. Nationwide, a two-foot rise in sea level could inundate 17 to 43 \npercent of U.S. wetlands, and could eliminate a total of 10,000 square \nmiles of wet and dry land in our country. I do not want to see that \nhappen.\n  Because of global warming, our forests will see dramatic changes as \nwell. A 3.6 degree Fahrenheit warming could shift many North American \nforest species 200 miles north.\n  Given the likely time frame for this warming, these tree species \nwould have to migrate about two miles every year to stay viable.\n  This poses a grave threat to my State's maple syrup industry, since \nabout half of the hardwood species like maple will disappear. I do not \nwant to see this happen either.\n  A recent article in the journal Nature shows there is strong new \nevidence of global warming impacts on animal and plant worlds. \nResearchers say that as many as 677 species are already reacting to \nglobal warming by adjusting their range northward in search of cooler \ntemperatures, or breeding earlier in the spring in response to warmer \ntemperatures.\n  A recent study by the American Bird Conservancy and the National \nWildlife Federation reports that some birds like the Baltimore Oriole \nmay completely disappear from their home States. The Nation's 63 \nmillion birdwatchers will likely be frustrated by the coming changes in \nbird habitat.\n  Also, the EPA has predicted that even a modest warming would \neliminate nearly 90 percent of Idaho habitat for the majestic grizzly \nbear, which will likely have impacts on Yellowstone tourism income.\n  Even the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is running into problems \nbecause of global warming. Unseasonably warm temperatures have meant \nthat the race will have to take detours for the first time in its \nhistory. Much of the snow has melted. The Alaskan route is now marred \nby bare ground and open rivers.\n  Alaska's global warming problems made the news last year as well. As \nyou can see in this poster, a New York Times news story from June \nillustrated that in Alaska, climate change is a stark reality, not an \nabstraction. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 16, 2002]\n\n       Alaska, No Longer So Frigid, Starts To Crack, Burn and Sag\n\n                           (By Timothy Egan)\n\n       To live in Alaska when the average temperature has risen \n     about seven degrees over the last 30 years means learning to \n     cope with a landscape that can sink, catch fire or break \n     apart in the turn of a season.\n       In the village of Shishmaref, on the Chukchi Sea just south \n     of the Arctic Circle, it means high water eating away so many \n     houses and buildings that people will vote next month on \n     moving the entire village inland.\n       In the Barrow, the northernmost city of North America, it \n     means coping with mosquitoes in a place where they once were \n     nonexistent, and rescuing hunters trapped on breakaway ice at \n     a time of year when such things once were unheard of.\n       From Fairbanks to the north, where wildfires have been \n     burning off and on since mid-May, it means living with \n     hydraulic jacks to keep houses from slouching and buckling on \n     foundations that used to be frozen all year. Permafrost, they \n     say, is no longer permanent.\n       Here on the Kenai Peninsula, a recreation wonderland a few \n     hours' drive from Anchorage, it means living in a four-\n     million-acre spruce forest that has been killed by beetles, \n     the largest loss of trees to insects ever recorded in North \n     America, federal officials say. Government scientists tied \n     the event to rising temperatures, which allow the beetles to \n     reproduce at twice their normal rate.\n       In Alaska, rising temperatures, whether caused by \n     greenhouse gas emissions or nature in a prolonged mood swing, \n     are not a topic of debate or an abstraction. Mean \n     temperatures have risen by 5 degrees in summer and 10 degrees \n     in winter since the 1970's, federal officials say.\n       While President Bush was dismissive of a report the \n     government recently released on how global warming will \n     affect the nation, the leading Republican in this state, \n     Senator Ted Stevens, says that no place is experiencing more \n     startling change from rising temperatures than Alaska.\n       Among the consequences, Senator Stevens says, are sagging \n     roads, crumbling villages, dead forests, catastrophic fires \n     and possible disruption of marine wildlife.\n       These problems will cost Alaska hundreds of millions of \n     dollars, he said.\n       ``Alaska is harder hit by global climate change than any \n     place in the world,'' Senator Stevens said.\n       Scientists have been charting shrinking glaciers and \n     warming seas in Alaska for some time. But only recently have \n     experts started to focus on what the warming means to the \n     people who live in Alaska.\n       The social costs of higher temperatures have been mostly \n     negative, people here say. The Bush administration report, \n     which was drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     also found few positives to Alaska's thermal rise. But it \n     said climate change would bring a longer growing season and \n     open ice-free seas in the Arctic for shipping.\n       ``There can no longer be any doubt that major changes in \n     the climate have occurred in recent decades in the region, \n     with visible and measurable consequences,'' the government \n     concluded in the report to the United Nations last month.\n       It does not take much to find those consequences in a state \n     with 40 percent of the nation's surface water and 63 percent \n     of its wetlands.\n       Here on the Kenai Peninsula, a forest nearly twice the size \n     of Yellowstone National Park is in the last phases of a \n     graphic death. Century-old spruce trees stand silvered and \n     cinnamon-colored as they bleed sap.\n       A sign at Anchor River Recreation Area near this little \n     town poses a question many tourists have been asking, \n     ``What's up with all the dead spruce trees on the Kenai \n     Peninsula?'' The population of spruce bark beetles, which \n     have long fed on these evergreen trees, exploded as \n     temperatures rose, foresters now say.\n       Throughout the Kenai, people are clearing some of the 38 \n     million dead trees, answering the call from officials to \n     create a ``defensible\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\n     space'' around houses for fire protection. Last year, two \n     major fires occurred on this peninsula, and this year, with \n     temperatures in the 80's in mid-May, officials say fire is \n     imminent. ``It's just a matter of time before we have a very \n     large, possibly catastrophic forest fire,'' said Ed Holsten, \n     a scientist with the Forest Service.\n       Joe Perletti, who lives in Kasilof in the Kenai Peninsula, \n     has rented a bulldozer to clear dead trees from the 10 acres \n     where he lives.\n       ``It's scary what's going on,'' Mr. Perletti said. ``I \n     never realized the extent of global warming, but we're living \n     it now. I worry about how it will affect my children.''\n       Mr. Perletti, an insurance agent, said some insurers no \n     longer sold fire policies to Kenai Peninsula homeowners in \n     some areas surrounded by dead spruce.\n       Another homeowner, Larry Rude, has cut down a few trees but \n     has decided to take his chances at the house he owns near \n     Anchor Point. Mr. Rude says he no longer recognizes Alaska \n     weather.\n       ``This year, we had a real quick melt of the snow, and it \n     seemed like it was just one week between snowmobiling in the \n     mountains and riding around in the boat in shirt-sleeve \n     weather,'' Mr. Rude said.\n       Other forests, farther north, appear to be sinking or \n     drowning as melting permafrost forces water up. Alaskans have \n     taken to calling the phenomenon ``drunken trees.''\n       For villages that hug the shores of the Bering, Chukchi and \n     Beaufort Seas, melting ice is the enemy. Sea ice off the \n     Alaskan coast has retreated by 14 percent since 1978, and \n     thinned by 40 percent since the mid-1960's, the federal \n     report says. Climate models predict that Alaska temperatures \n     will continue to rise over this century, by up to 18 degrees.\n       Kivalina, a town battered by sea storms that erode the \n     ground beneath houses, will have to move soon, residents say. \n     Senator Stevens said it would cost $102 million, or $250,000 \n     for each of the 400 residents.\n       The communities of Shishmaref, Point Hope and Barrow face a \n     similar fate. Scientists say the melting ice brings more wave \n     action, which gnaws away at ground that used to be frozen for \n     most of the year.\n       Shishmaref, on a barrier island near the Bering Strait, is \n     fast losing the battle to rising seas and crumbling ground. \n     As the July 19 vote on whether to move approaches, residents \n     say they have no choice.\n       ``I'm pretty sure the vote is going to be to move,'' Lucy \n     Eningowuk of Shishmaref said. ``There's hardly any land left \n     here anymore.''\n       Barrow, the biggest of the far northern native villages \n     with 4,600 people, has not only had beach erosion, but early \n     ice breakup. Hunters have been stranded at sea, and others \n     have been forced to go far beyond the usual hunting grounds \n     to find seals, walruses and other animals.\n       ``To us living on the Arctic coastline, sea ice is our \n     lifeline,'' Caleb Pungowigi testified recently before a \n     Senate committee. ``The long-term trend is very scary.''\n       A 20-year resident of Barrow, Glenn Sheehan, says it seems \n     to be on a fast-forward course of climate change.\n       ``Mosquitoes, erosion, breakup of the sea ice, and our \n     sewage and clean-water system, which is threatened by erosion \n     as well,'' he said. ``We could be going from a $28 million \n     dollar sewage system that was considered an engineering model \n     to honey buckets--your basic portable outhouses.''\n       The people who manage the state's largest piece of \n     infrastructure--the 800 mile-long Trans-Alaska Pipeline--have \n     also had to adjust to rising temperatures. Engineers \n     responsible for the pipeline, which carriers about a million \n     barrels of oil a day and generates 17 percent of the nation's \n     oil production, have grown increasingly concerned that \n     melting permafrost could make unstable the 400 or so miles of \n     pipeline above ground. As a result, new supports have been \n     put in, some moored more than 70-feet underground.\n       ``We're not going to let global warming sneak up on us,'' \n     said Curtis Thomas, a spokesman for the Alyeska Pipeline \n     Service Company, which runs the pipeline. ``If we see leaning \n     and sagging, we move on it.''\n       North of Fairbanks, roads have buckled, telephone poles \n     have started to tilt, and homeowners have learned to live in \n     houses that are more than a few bubbles off plumb. Everyone, \n     it seems, has a story.\n       ``We've had so many strange events, things are so different \n     than they used to be, that I think most Alaskans now believe \n     something profound is going on,'' said Dr. Glenn Juday, an \n     authority on climate change at the University of Alaska at \n     Fairbanks. ``We're experiencing indisputable climate warming. \n     The positive changes from this take a long time, but the \n     negative changes are happening real fast.''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Cities in Alaska are having to cope with mosquitoes \nwhere they once did not exist. Hunters are being trapped on break-away \nice. Houses are sinking due to slouching and buckling permafrost.\n  Mean temperatures in Alaska have risen by five degrees since the \n1970s. That is an extremely rapid rate of change, and I am afraid \nAlaska is somewhat of a testing ground for what is yet to come around \nthe globe.\n  These are just some of the environmental and economic consequences of \nglobal warming that may affect our country and our people. My \ncolleagues can imagine the potential harm that less developed economies \nwill face.\n  I have spoken now in some detail about the ways in which our serious \nair pollution and global warming problems threaten public and \nenvironmental health, as well as economic prosperity.\n  I have shown how millions of people suffer the ill effects of \nparticulate pollution and mercury contamination. I have explained how \nacid rain continues to strip our beautiful forests of vegetation, leach \nnutrients out of our once-rich soils, and suffocates many of our lakes \nand streams.\n  It is time now to take a look at what our administration is doing to \nrelieve Americans from these costly burdens.\n  Over the last few months, I have joined my colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle to speak out in defense of a vital Clean Air Act program \ncalled New Source Review, or NSR. NSR plays a crucial role in ridding \nour air of some of industry's most harmful air emissions, and it \nresults in hundreds of millions of dollars in health-related benefits.\n  However, the administration has chosen to ignore public health \nconcerns and side with industry. These new NSR rules will make it much \neasier for polluters to send even more poison into our air.\n  The administration tells us not to worry about these so-called NSR \n``reforms''--that any holes left in clean air protections will be \npatched up by another proposal that was reintroduced in Congress last \nweek, called Clear Skies. I am afraid Clear Skies will not provide such \na safety net.\n  In fact, a look at the fine print shows that Clear Skies actually \nprovides less protection--less protection--than existing law. More \nimportantly, it will not do enough to address this country's already \nsignificant air pollution problem.\n  Unlike the new NSR changes, which affect all major sources of air \npollution, Clear Skies only addresses some of the air pollution coming \nfrom one source--powerplants. So purging broad NSR protections while \npromoting a narrower proposal doesn't make any sense.\n  Plus, Clear Skies will eliminate important Clean Air Act programs \nthat protect local air quality, not supplement them. For utilities, \nClear Skies will strip the Clean Air Act of the Mercury Air Toxics Rule \nand the Regional Haze Rule.\n  And, while the administration's new NSR rule could allow 50 percent \nof all sources to avoid environmental review, Clear Skies will give \npowerplants even greater exemptions.\n  Clear Skies will also degrade the ability of States to pursue \ninterstate air pollution problems, and will prevent evolution of \ntougher New Source Performance Standards.\n  As you can see from this chart beside me, the true result of Clear \nSkies will be less protection and more pollution than business as \nusual.\n  In the chart, blue, gray, and red bars represent the so-called Clear \nSkies reduction plan for sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury emissions, \nrespectively. But take a look at the yellow bars. These yellow bars \nrepresent where we would already be headed with full and faithful \nimplementation of the present, existing Clean Air Act. We are not even \ndoing that under this administration.\n  In other words, the administration's plan allows more pollution. It \nis a serious weakening of current programs. In fact, Clear Skies will \nresult in hundreds of thousands of tons more emissions than full \nimplementation of these and other Clean Air Act programs.\n  According to EPA's own estimates, by the year 2010--Clear Skies would \nallow 125 percent more sulfur dioxide, 60 percent more nitrogen oxides, \nand 420 percent--420 percent--more mercury pollution than enforcement \nof current law. Total carbon dioxide emissions would continue to grow \nby leaps and bounds, despite the administration's goal of reduced \nemission intensity.\n  I ask my colleagues to be wary of the administration's proclamations \nabout the benefits of Clear Skies. While they tout reductions of 70 \npercent for sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury emissions, they are actually \nusing outdated information to arrive at these numbers. Real reductions \nin 2010 from the year 2000 would be only 60 percent for SOX \nand NOX, and 46 percent for mercury.\n  Clear Skies will also push compliance deadlines out further into the \nfuture\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\nthan present law, by as much as 10 years. Compared to the Clean Air \nAct, emission reductions would occur 8 years later for nitrogen, 6 \nyears later for sulfur, and 10 years later for mercury.\n  This delay would result in thousands of additional asthma attacks, \nhospitalizations, and deaths.\n  To be more specific, EPA's own data shows that full implementation of \nthe Clean Air Act will result in approximately 200,000 avoided deaths \nfrom air pollution. The Administration's Clear Skies rollback, on the \nother hand, will allow 100,000 of those lives to end prematurely--\n100,000 lives prematurely.\n  Approaches such as the Jeffords-Collins-Lieberman Clean Power Act are \nwhat we need to save these lives.\n  Our bill would surpass the Clean Air Act in saving as many as 250,000 \nlives--150,000 more lives saved than the Bush Clear Skies plan.\n  Our bill will also result in benefits of $100 billion more per year \nin health and visibility improvements than the Clear Skies plan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table illustrating the differences \nbetween these three approaches be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        COMPARING THE CLEAN AIR ACT, CLEAN POWER ACT, AND ``CLEAR SKIES''\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Clean Air Act \\1\\        Clean Power Act \\2\\          ``Clear Skies''\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSO2:\n    Total emissions (cap).......  2 mil tons (2012).......  2.2 mil tons (2009).....  4.5 mil tons (2010)\n    Percent reduction from 2000.  82%.....................  81%.....................  60%\nNOX:\n    Total emissions (cap).......  1.25 mil tons (2010)\\3\\.  1.51 mil tons (2009)....  2.1 mil tons (2008)\n    Percent reduction from 2000.  76%.....................  71%.....................  60%\nHg:\n    Total emissions (cap).......  5 tons (2008)...........  5 tons (2008)...........  26 tons (2010)\n    Percent reduction from 1999.  90%.....................  90%.....................  46%\nCO2:                              Business as usual:                                  Business as usual:\n    Total emissions (cap).......  3.5 bil tons (no cap)...  2 bil tons (2009).......  3.5 bil tons (no cap)\n    Percent change from 2000....  46% increase in 2018....  21% decrease............  46% increase in 2018\nLives saved (from PM\n reductions):\n    Total lives by 2020.........  190,000-238,000.........  210,000-250,000.........  74,000-102,000\nNonattainment areas:              prior to imp of new PM\n                                   std:\n    PM 2.5......................  2020: 100 (national)....  2010: \n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/07/senate-section/article/S3356-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3356-S3358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WAR WITH IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, first, I say to my friend from Virginia, \nthis is an opportunity for us to spend a few minutes talking about the \nissue of war with Iraq. We all listened last evening to the comments of \nthe President during his press conference. We all have great respect, \nobviously, for the Presidency of the United States. I would not call \nthe President's press conference a Churchillian moment, but certainly \nthe President expressed his views on what he believes ought to be done.\n  On October 11, 2002, I voted for H.J. Res. 114, a resolution \nproviding the President with the authority to use force against Iraq if \nproved necessary. The vote on that resolution was 77 to 23. I voted for \nthe entire resolution including language which requires the President \nto first determine that ``reliance by the United States on further \ndiplomatic or other peaceful means alone either will not adequately \nprotect the national security of the United States against the \ncontinuing threat posed by Iraq or is not likely to lead to the \nenforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Resolutions.'' The \nparticular requirement seems to have gotten lost in recent discussions \nabout Iraq and deserves repeating in the context of our debate this \nmorning.\n  My concern is that the Bush administration, at this juncture, has not \nmade the case that we have reached the point that we can say that \ndiplomacy has failed.\n  I do not know of anyone who disagrees with the notion that we would \nbe far better off with Iraq disarmed. Every person I know supports that \nconclusion. The debate, if you will, is not over whether Iraq should be \ndisarmed but whether there are means short of military conflict for \ndoing so. Knowing all the hazards and dangers that will arise when we \nsend American service men and women into combat to achieve that result, \nwe must not take that decision precipitously, without first exhausting \nother options, particularly diplomatic options.\n  As I stated earlier, I voted for H.J. Res 114 last fall, and I would \nvote for it again because I believe force, coupled with with diplomacy, \nare needed in this circumstance. Threats of force alone without \ndiplomacy can too often lead us to unnecessary armed conflict and \ncostly destruction and loss of life.\n  We fail sometimes to recognize and understand the value of diplomacy \nand how well it has worked for us in times past. We saw diplomacy at \nwork during the Kennedy administration when President Kennedy diffused \nthe Cuban missile crisis. We saw it at work as well in the Carter \nadministration when Sadat and Begin came together at Camp David to end \nconflict between Israel and Egypt. We saw it at work in 1993 when, \nthrough the efforts of former-President Carter in North Korea, we were \nable to diffuse a situation that was getting very serious. Diplomacy \nhas successfully resolved many disputes large and small. On each \noccasion it requires our President to put his credibility on the line \nand work diligently day in and day out to bring those warring parties \ntogether to avoid the conflict that would have ensued.\n  I think too often we fail to appreciate the value of what can be done \nthrough diplomacy. There are countless examples throughout our history.\n  My plea this morning, is not that we renounce the use of force \nmultilateral or unilateral--in the case of Iraq or any other \ncircumstance where US national security interests are at stake. I would \nnever support a resolution that would deprive our Nation of the \nopportunity to protect and defend its security and its sovereignty, \nincluding by the unilateral use of force. My only concern is that we \nought not rush unnecessarily to that conclusion when other options \nstill remain. Do we really want to unnecessarily put at risk the lives \nof innocent Iraqi people or more importantly the lives of our own young \nmen and women in uniform who have been deployed to the Middle East and \nawait the orders of the Commander in Chief?\n\n  My plea today is that the President seriously consider giving the \nU.N. effort the diplomatic track a bit more time. Obviously, there is a \nthreat in Iraq. We all know that. But it is a threat at this moment \nthat is being effectively contained by the presence of international \ninspectors and the threat of force. Yes, Iraq is a threat, but there \nare graver and more immediate threats confronting the United States. I \nbelieve that North Korea poses a far greater and far more immediate \ndanger to the United States and the region. U.S./Korean experts across \nthe political spectrum share that view.\n  I am concerned that our impatience over Iraq is doing great harm to \nour relationships with our long standing friends and allies. U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 1441 did not contain an end date by which \nthe inspectors were to conclude their mission. However, from the very \nbeginning, the administration showed very little patience for the \ninspections process. Almost before it began, members of the Bush \nAdministration were ridiculing the process, suggesting it would never \nwork anyway; why are we bothering with it?\n  One might ask the basic question: If we never thought it was going to \nwork, why did we support U.N. Security Resolution 1441 in the first \nplace?\n  The problem of Iraq and Saddam Hussein is not weeks old, it is years \nold. We all know that. Nonetheless, we drafted, worked, suggested, and \nsupported the resolution that called for an inspections process. There \nis no certainty that an inspections process will necessarily succeed, \ngiven the size of the country and the difficulties involved, but we \nvoted to send inspectors to Iraq and we supported the terms of their \nmission as spelled out in the text of the resolution.\n  Yet as the inspection mission was getting underway, the \nadministration seemed to already have lost patience with it. Perhaps \nthat is why other members of the Security Council began to question \nwhether the United States was ever genuinely committed to an \ninspections regime.\n  U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix spoke before the United Nations this \nmorning. Let me share with my colleagues some of his conclusions--very \nsignificant conclusions in my view. Mr. Blix said that the inspectors \nwere in a better position to carry out their work than they had been in \nthe 1990s because of the existence of international pressure. The \nPresident should claim victory that his policy is succeeding--the \ncombination of diplomacy and the threat of force is bearing fruit.\n  We ought to be celebrating the fact that the inspectors have made \nprogress in disarming Iraq. I do not think that a call for inspections \nwithout a threat of force would have produced positive results. The \ncombination of the threat of force and the inspections process is, \naccording to those we have asked to perform these duties, producing far \nbetter results than we ever could have imagined.\n  Mr. Blix went on to say that there is no air surveillance over the \nentire country, and that inspectors can move freely anywhere in Iraq. \nEven with enhanced Iraqi cooperation, Mr. Blix stated that the mission \nwould need some additional months not years to complete its work.\n  I am not interested in seeing the inspections process prolonged \nindefinitely. I do not think that is in anyone's interest. We have men \nand women in uniform deployed abroad, waiting for orders. We cannot \nkeep them there indefinitely without having the necessary rotations. \nThat poses some problems. I hope we never reach the conclusion that \nsimply because we have deployed our forces to the Middle East, we see \nthat action as putting our credibility on the line if we don't then \ntake military action, even though diplomacy may be working.\n  American service men and women certainly understand that when they \nare called to duty, there may be times\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\nthey are asked to put their lives on the line. They also know there may \nbe times when they are going to be asked to wait. Certainly, we need to \nunderstand the conduct of this particular delicate situation. Asking \nour men and women in uniform to be patient as we try to see if we \ncannot resolve this problem without putting them in harm's way is not \nan irresponsible way to proceed at all, given the fact we may get \nexactly what we are seeking as a result of the combined efforts of \ndiplomacy and threat of force.\n  I believe this process is working and the President ought to claim \nvictory, in a sense, because as a result of his efforts, we are getting \nthe job done better than we might have imagined we could.\n  In a sense, I almost get the feeling we are trying to snatch defeat \nfrom the jaws of victory by moving away from a process that appears to \nbe working despite all the difficulty surrounding it.\n  Obviously, if we want the multilateral support of our allies then we \nneed to allow the U.N. effort some time. I can make a strong case that \nwe probably do not need multilateral forces to win the military contest \nhere. I am quite confident the United States military can more than \nadequately perform the challenges posed in Iraq militarily. But the \nproblem becomes greater when you think of the aftermath, of how we \nmanage that, how this event will affect other relationships we have \nwhere international cooperation is important.\n  I say this with a great deal of lament. Diplomacy has been suffering \nterribly here over the last few years. This is not just my conclusion. \nThis is the conclusion of the responsible people who have watched, \ntragically over the last 24 months, where diplomacy has not been \nworking as well as it could. I don't want to digress very much. I will \nkeep focused on the discussion in front of us, but from the outset \nthere was a notion that international cooperation was somehow a sign of \nweakness; that, in fact, the comments of our friend from Alabama \nsuggesting a moment ago that international organizations and the United \nNations could not perform duties when asked to act and asked to get a \njob done, I disagree with.\n  I have my difficulties with the performance of the U.N. from time to \ntime, but I ask anyone to suggest what the world might look like if we \ndid not have a U.N. system to respond all over the globe to every \nimaginable crisis that emerges. The idea of deriding and ridiculing and \ndiminishing the role of the U.N. system is not in our interest, and I \ndon't think it is in our interest to ridicule our allies in Europe and \nelsewhere. These are good friends. They have been and will continue to \nbe. But we need to work at those relationships to keep them strong. \nUnfortunately, we have not been doing that. And, we are paying a price \nfor that. That is why the American public and so many around the world \nare worried about unnecessarily taking unilateral action. Particularly \na preemptive unilateral action.\n  Having said that, I applaud the President's decision last night to go \nto the U.N. and to put a resolution on the table. I feared he might \nabandon the U.N. effort without doing so because some of his advisors \nhave recommended this course of action. I commend the President for \nstill being willing to try and get that international support. I hope a \nresolution can be crafted which our allies and others will feel \ncomfortable supporting, one that gives the inspections more time to see \nif they can succeed. If I didn't feel time might work for us here, or \nthat there was an imminent threat to our nations, then I would stand \nwith those who would say we have to go forward now and unilaterally \nrespond to the threat. I don't believe that moment has arrived.\n  Last night the President said that the world has changed since \nSeptember 11th. I agree with him. The administration's eyes obviously \nwere opened to the fact we needed help and support from the nations in \ncoping with the amorphous nature of the stateless and faceless \nterrorist organizations. We heard the great news in the last few days \nof the capture of some al-Qaida operatives. I would respectfully say \nthat this would not have happened without international cooperation. So \nin this particular set of circumstances, we have seen the value of \ninternational cooperation.\n  While Bush administration officials have seen the wisdom of \ncooperating with our allies in combating terrorist organizations, key \nadministration policymakers still hold--too many of them--the \nfundamental belief that as the world's only remaining superpower, the \nUnited States does not need to consult or build the support from other \nnations in the conduct of foreign policy. They believe that we can \nsinglehandedly decide who are good guys and bad guys, the members of \nthe axis of evil, in the Bush administration's lexicon. It is this \ntension that brings us where we are in Iraq and North Korea.\n  Now we have, of course, the paradox that the administration is in no \nparticular hurry, it would appear, to resolve the North Korean problem \nwhich was precipitated in part, I argue, by our handling and engagement \nwith Iraq. It has no patience in the case of Iraq to allow the \ninspections process to play out. I appreciate that the administration \nis trying to maintain the readiness of more than 200,000 American \ntroops that are or will soon be in the region and that this cannot go \non indefinitely without troop rotation. However, I strongly believe the \nAmerican forces are carrying out an incredibly important mission, even \nif the order is never given to attack. Just being there has a \ntremendous value in terms of what we are trying to achieve in the \nMiddle East.\n  Their presence signals a seriousness and resolve on the part of the \nUnited States that Iraq must disarm. Iraq is, in fact, beginning, as we \nsee here, to respond--not as quickly as I would like, not in the ways \nsome might prefer--but Hans Blix has reported progress. We should not \nyet draw the conclusion that in U.N. effort has failed.\n  I want to see Iraq disarm. Every American does. I believe as a way of \ndoing this, at least a way worth trying to get this accomplished \nwithout resorting to force. The bellicose and public efforts by the \nadministration to end the inspections process is going to have severe \ndiplomatic costs in the months and years ahead. My hope is that we will \nbe able to repair these relationships. The quick way we might do that \nis to allow this process to work a bit longer. If we do that, I think \nwe can build the kind of support that is necessary to achieve not only \nthe desired results in Iraq, but also to allow us to continue to build \nthe relationships that are going to be critically important to deal \nwith other pressing foreign policy concerns.\n  We live in a world that absolutely requires international \ncooperation, and the United States must be a leader in this effort. The \ngreat leaders in the post-World-War-II period understood this. The \ngreat people we revere and talk about often, people like Omar Bradley \nand George Marshall, the Dulles brothers and others, who understood the \nvalue and the importance of international organizations. They were the \narchitects of these institutions. They were the ones who argued so \nvociferously to create a U.N. system, international courts of justice, \nto build a NATO system. They understood the importance of international \ncooperation. They understood that even a great power such as ours could \nnot solve all the world's problems single-handedly.\n  Too often, as we engage in this debate, many Americans and many \npeople across the globe have the impression that the United States no \nlonger believes that international cooperation is important in the \nconduct of our foreign policy. I disagree with that profoundly.\n  That worries this Senator very deeply. I will not take a backseat to \nanybody in my concern about Saddam Hussein. I would support the \nresolution which I voted for in October again today if it were the \npending business of this body. I don't believe that the resolution \ncalls upon the President to abandon diplomacy.\n  For those reasons I would urge and encourage the President to \ncontinue his efforts with the framework of the U.N. Again, I want to \ncompliment him for indicating he is going to go back to the U.N. in the \ncoming days to see if we can get a resolution that will build the kind \nof international cooperation that is necessary. But I have this nagging \nfear that there are some in the President's inner circle who believe \nthis is all a waste of time and effort, that it is not in our interests \nto do it,\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\nand the sooner we move away from seeking international cooperation the \nbetter off we are going to be.\n  That mentality seems to be gaining currency in the minds of far too \nmany. That is a dangerous road to follow. It is one I hope and pray \nthat the President does not take.\n  Mr. President, let me associate myself with what others have said in \nthe course of this debate. If or when the President orders U.S. Service \nMembers into combat, I and every other member of this body will support \nthese brave men and women one hundred percent and we will pray that \nthey return home to their families unharmed.\n  With those thoughts in mind, I thank my colleagues for the \nopportunity to express some views on this critical issue. I am \ncertainly anxious to hear the thoughts of my colleagues as they express \nthose during the remaining time of this debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator allow me to have one or \ntwo questions, by way of a colloquy?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to do it. I understand the \nagreement goes to 12:30. I have not had an opportunity, and I have been \nhere almost an hour. We extended the time shortly over on the other \nside.\n  I will be glad to yield if we can work that out, but I would like an \nopportunity.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why do we not just agree now to extend the time by 30 \nminutes, equally divided between the two of us? That will take us to \nthe hour of 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That will be fine with me. I am glad if we agree the \ncolloquy go maybe 5 or 6 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/07/senate-section/article/S3358-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3358-S3365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly. The Senator from Massachusetts has been most \npatient.\n  I ask unanimous consent that morning business be extended to the hour \nof 1 o'clock, the time equally divided between myself and my colleagues \non the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. With reference to two points that you make, Senator, \nfirst--I copied in my notes--you questioned was the United States ever \ngenuinely engaged in the inspection process, some words to that effect.\n  Mr. DODD. Before you put words in my mouth, my concern has been that \nthe administration has not been terribly supportive of the inspections \nprocess. Numerous Administration officials have been very dismissive of \nthe inspections effort. My colleague from Virginia may have a different \none. But my impression is that the administration has never embraced \nthe inspections process, endorsed it, or supported it with the kind of \nrhetoric that I would have assumed would have been the case since we \ncertainly supported the resolution that established the inspections \ninitiative.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are entitled to an honest difference of \nopinion. My colleague and I debated last night in a public forum on \nthis very issue. But I believe our Government has been very thoroughly \nengaged in the inspection process, trying to support it.\n  I provide today some tangible evidence in the sense that I have a \nletter from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, addressed \nto me with a copy to my distinguished colleagues, Senator Levin and \nSenator Roberts, in which they set out for the record exactly what we \nhave done by way of giving the U.S. intelligence regarding likely sites \nwhere weapons of mass destruction could be in the process of being \nmanufactured, stored, or otherwise. We have cooperated mightily in this \neffort.\n  I think that corroborates the assertion of the Senator from Virginia \nthat our Government is engaged. I just read one paragraph here, Tenet \nstating we, the United States:\n\n       . . . have now provided detailed information on all of the \n     high value and moderate value sites to UNMOVIC and the IAEA.\n\n  That is in rebuttal to your comment about genuine engagement. I think \nthat shows good faith.\n  Second, this rush headlong?\n  As the Senator well knows, 1441 was adopted on November 8. \nImmediately thereafter the United Nations began to put in place and \nformalize work that Blix had been doing for some period of time.\n  As you well know, the United Nations contemplated that there could be \na second inspection regime, and Blix was put in office and began his \nwork some months before. Had he undertaken to go into Iraq as quickly \nas I think feasible from a logistics standpoint, and having with him \ntrained individuals, and he has been there basically since the latter \npart of November, early December--am I not correct in that?\n  The reason there has not been greater productivity by Blix--I think \nhe has tried diligently--is the absolute lack of cooperation of Iraq, \nto which my colleague from Connecticut has agreed.\n  Here we are now. Our President and the Prime Minister and other \nnations of the coalition of the willing, having called up their \nreserves, called up their guard, transported the forces and put them in \nplace. I was visiting there with Senator Levin, Senator Roberts, and \nSenator Rockefeller 10 days ago. We have placed them there. As the \nSenator from Connecticut I think quite properly said, in fairness, \ntheir presence has, indeed, supported the diplomatic efforts undertaken \nby the President and others in the United Nations, which is still going \non.\n  Our President said last night that we will wait and see what the Blix \nreport comes forth with. He has come forth again today. With due \nrespect to Blix, he tends to be somewhat contradictory.\n\n  In previous reports he quite actively deplored the fact that Iraq has \nnot been more cooperative and that lack of cooperation has hindered his \nefforts. As the Senator well knows, the concept of this inspection was \nnot that Blix and his team had to find the weapons; it was that Iraq \nwas to cooperate and show where the weapons are so Blix could supervise \ntheir destruction.\n  This thing got totally, as we say as sailors, off course because of \nthe need for Blix to do both the destruction, which he is now \nsupervising, of a modest cache of missiles, and at the same time trying \nto search, using U.S. intelligence and intelligence from other nations, \nfor the sites.\n  I say to the Senator, I see no basis for saying that this President, \nthe Prime Minister of Great Britain, or others are rushing, as you \nsaid, headlong to try to utilize force as the final solution. We have \nbeen at this thing 12 years. Blix has been in business since November.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me respond to your rather long question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I presume there is a question there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. My response is the inspection teams were not at full \nstrength until about the end of January.\n  Obviously, we didn't think Saddam Hussein was a wonderfully truthful, \nreliable head of state last fall when the U.S. voted for U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 1441. We have known Saddam Hussein for a long time, \nand it therefore comes as no great surprise that it has taken \ninternational pressure to get results.\n  It has only been about a month since the inspections team has been \nfully operational in Iraq. That is a fact. To expect somehow that \nwithin a month's period of time, or a little more than a month, an \ninspections team was going to be able to complete the job was naive.\n  This morning U.N. Weapons Inspections chief, Mr. Blix--whom I think \nmost people respect as being an honorable person and certainly one who \nhas dedicated much of his career to eliminating weapons of mass \ndestruction--reported that the inspections are making progress, that \ntoday inspectors are getting a lot more done than they did in the \n1990s. We should listen to Mr. Blix and give his remarks serious \nconsideration as we decide the next steps.\n  My only point in taking the floor today is not to suggest, as some \nmay, that we ought to under no circumstances in dealing with Iraq ever \ncontemplate the use of force. I would disagree with that. I think \nhaving a threat of force is absolutely critical to achieving a desired \nresult. The only point is that we ought not do this alone. I don't \nthink it is necessary, and I think we ought to at least give this \nprocess time to work. I think the cost\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\nof not doing that could be profoundly dangerous to our country. I hope \nI am wrong about that, but I am fearful I may be right. In waiting a \nfew weeks to get this right, I don't think the dangers posed by Iraq \nare that imminent that a few weeks or a few months would necessarily \ncost us.\n  I would argue differently about North Korea. I don't think we have \nthat much time. I think every day we lose in dealing with North Korea \nraises the risks to this country and the world profoundly. I don't \ndisagree with my colleague from Virginia at all about this except to \nthe extent that the impression is we really are not going to give this \nthe kind of time to prove it can work and then have the kind of support \nthat I think we ought to have internationally.\n  We only paid about 10 percent of the cost of the gulf war. The rest \nof the world which felt most threatened by Iraq contributed 90 percent \nof that cost.\n  As I shared with my colleagues last evening a conversation which I \nhad with one of the major European Commissioners, a great ally of ours, \nthe Commissioner said: We have been delighted to support the effort in \nAfghanistan. I think the European Community contributed about $1 \nbillion. He said: I would not anticipate any financial support under \nthe present circumstances in winning the peace in Iraq if this is a \nunilateral effort on the part of the United States.\n  That is a very troubling comment. This problem is a problem not just \nfor us, it is a problem for the region, as my colleagues have said.\n  I believe Saddam Hussein poses a global threat, and that certainly \nneeds to be addressed. But we need to understand that diplomacy has \nvalue. And I think there are those who today are in positions of making \na difference who don't appreciate that enough. That is my concern as I \ntake the floor today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time the Senator from Virginia \nconsumed in this colloquy be charged to his allocation and the time \nconsumed by the Senator from Connecticut be charged to the other side.\n  I thank my colleague. I hope to have more to say on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this morning we heard the most \nencouraging report so far on the recent developments in Iraq from the \nUnited Nations' chief weapons inspectors. Progress is clearly being \nmade. Iraq is beginning to destroy its missiles. As a result of strong \ninternational pressure on Saddam, the inspectors are receiving greater \ncooperation from the Iraqi Government.\n  Hans Blix, the chief United Nations weapons inspector, reported this \nmorning that the international pressure is working. He says the \ninspectors are encountering fewer difficulties than when inspections \noccurred there a decade ago. The inspectors have free access to the \nentire country, and they can now conduct air surveillance throughout \nIraq. The question is, For how long? Hans Blix says it will not take \nyears or weeks, but months. So we are not talking about an endless \nprocess. Saddam knows he is on the clock at the United Nations. The \neyes of the world are on him, and he must disarm.\n  We all agree there is still much more to be done before full \ndisarmament is achieved. But inspections are working and Saddam is \nbeing disarmed. Yet in its rush to war with Iraq, the Bush \nadministration ignores this progress and rejects the wise words of \ncaution from our allies.\n  President Bush deserves great credit for the progress so far--both in \nthe war against al-Qaida terrorism, and in disarming Saddam. Al-Qaida \nis on the run, and Saddam is disarming.\n  But it is time for this President and this White House to pause \nbefore pushing aside the rest of the world and ordering an invasion of \nIraq. Rash action will only place our troops in greater harm's way. As \nwe unleash a firestorm of military might over Iraq, we could easily \nunleash a firestorm of hatred for America creating a far more dangerous \nworld for Americans here at home and in many other countries.\n  We are squandering the immense good will and support for America \nfollowing the tragedy of 9/11. We are shattering the coalition that is \neffectively fighting the war against terrorism, and that is pursuing \nOsama bin Laden at this very moment. War now will inflame the Arab and \nMuslim world against us as never before, and generate intense new \nsupport for anti-American terrorists who will stop at nothing to do us \nharm.\n  In recent days, Iraq has destroyed 34 of its 100 illegal missiles--a \nprocess which continues. Seven more scientists have been privately \ninterviewed, and each day more come forward. The Iraqi government \nstepped up and revealed the location of previously destroyed biological \nweapons in order to enable the inspectors to verify their destruction.\n  Many of us wish that this cooperation had occurred earlier, and that \nIraqi officials were more forthcoming. No one ever said it would be \neasy to disarm Iraq. Even South Africa, which agreed to unilaterally \ndisarm its nuclear program, required two full years of inspections to \nconfirm that its nuclear capability was destroyed.\n  Disarmament is a process--not a single simple event. Disarmament \ntakes time. Progress comes step by step. But when progress does occur, \nit makes no sense to reject it out of hand. It makes no sense to start \na war when we have a genuine chance to preserve the peace.\n  The wisest course for America is to give the inspectors more time and \nto maintain the pressure on Saddam by keeping our troops in the region. \nIt is better to pay the price of keeping our troops there to pressure \nSaddam than to pay the far greater cost of going to war.\n  It is clear from the foreign ministers who spoke today at the \nSecurity Council that a majority of the world's governments still want \nto wait before pulling the trigger for war. Even the British are now \nasking for more time.\n  This is a delicate and dangerous situation. We need allies to help us \nmeet our goals, and to provide for the security of the American people. \nBut surely we can have effective relationships with other nations \nwithout adopting a chip-on-the-shoulder, my-way-or-the-highway policy \nthat makes all our other goals in the world more difficult to achieve. \nWe cannot be a bully in the world schoolyard and expect cooperation, \nfriendship, and support from the rest of the world.\n  The threat of war may be tough talk that Saddam needs to hear. But \ncontinuing inspections is a tough-minded policy. It takes patience and \nperseverance. There is the chance that they will succeed in disarming \nIraq. And inspections build international support if other steps are \nrequired.\n  The goal is the disarmament of Iraq by peaceful means--not to use \nevery opportunity to justify a war, as the administration is doing.\n  All of us agree that Saddam is a despicable and deceitful dictator, \nbut I am deeply concerned that such a war will make the world even more \ndangerous for Americans--not less dangerous. But as long as inspectors \nare on the ground and making progress, we must give peace a chance. War \nmust always be a last resort.\n  The question now is whether the Bush Administration will view Iraqi \ncooperation as a glass half empty, or a glass half full.\n  At his press conference last night, President Bush still failed to \noffer adequate answers to the key questions on the minds of the \nAmerican people about the issues at stake in this war and its \naftermath. In his speech last week, he also painted a simplistic \npicture of the brightest possible future--with democracy flourishing in \nIraq, peace emerging among all nations in the Middle East, and the \nterrorists with no place of support there. We have all heard of rosy \nscenarios, but that was ridiculous.\n  War with Iraq runs the very serious risk of inflaming the Middle East \nand provoking a massive new wave of anti-Americanism in other countries \nthat may well strengthen the terrorists, especially if the Muslim world \nopposes us. What if al-Qaida were to time the next terrorist attack to \nthe day we go to war?\n  A year ago, the Wall Street Journal quoted a dissident in Saudi \nArabia who has turned his focus from his own government to the U.S. \nGovernment. He said the main enemy of the Muslims and the Arabs is \nAmerica, and that they do not want us to impose on them.\n\n[[Page S3360]]\n\nHe said many Arabs would rather tolerate dictatorship in their own \ncountries than import reforms from America.\n  The burning of the U.S. flag has become a common ritual in Arab \ncapitals. Calling someone an American is now regarded as an insult in \nparts of the Arab world.\n  What a tragic change in the support we had in the world after 9/11, \nlet alone from the time when America stood as a beacon of hope and a \nmodel for freedom and democracy throughout the world.\n  In a desperate effort to justify its focus on Iraq, the \nadministration has long asserted there are ties between Osama and \nSaddam--a theory with no proof, and widely doubted by the intelligence \nexperts.\n  Two weeks after 9/11, Secretary Rumsfeld claimed we had \n``bulletproof'' evidence of the link. But a year later, CIA Director \nTenet conceded in a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee that \nthe administration's understanding of the link was still ``evolving'' \nand was based on sources of ``varying reliability.''\n  In fact, the link is so widely doubted that intelligence experts have \nexpressed their concern that intelligence is being politicized to \nsupport the rush to war.\n  The Bush administration was wrong to allow the anti-Iraq zealots in \nits ranks to exploit the 9/11 tragedy by using it to make war against \nIraq a higher priority than the war against terrorism.\n  Al-Qaida--not Iraq--is the most imminent threat to our national \nsecurity. Our citizens are asked to protect themselves from Osama with \nplastic sheeting and duct tape, while the administration prepares to \nsend our Armed Forces to war against Iraq. Those priorities are wrong.\n  There is also much more we need to do at every level of government to \nstrengthen our defenses at home against terrorist attack, especially if \nwe go to war alone against Iraq and inflame the Arab world. America is \nalready on constant alert. There is no time to shortchange our security \nat home. Yet across the country the Bush administration is leaving \nlocal governments high and dry in the face of continuing threats at \nhome. Despite promises of funding from Washington, our cities are not \nreceiving the urgent help they need.\n  If there is any lesson from September 11, it is that we cannot afford \nto fail to meet this threat. The cost in lives at home is too great. \nThe war with al-Qaida is far from over, and war with Iraq may well make \nit worse.\n  And what about the aftermath of war? We know a stable government will \nbe essential in a postwar Iraq. But the administration refuses to \ndiscuss, in any real detail, how it will be achieved and how long our \ntroops will need to stay. President Bush assumes everything will go \nperfectly.\n  But war and its consequences hold enormous risks and uncertainties.\n  As Retired General Anthony Zinni has asked, will we do what we did in \nAfghanistan in the 1970s--drive the old Soviet Union out and let \nsomething arguably worse emerge in its place?\n  The administration has also tried to convince us the war will not be \ncostly to the Treasury. If our national security were at stake, we \nwould spare no expense to protect American lives. But the \nadministration still owes the Nation a more honest discussion about the \nwar costs we are about to face, especially if America has to remain in \nIraq for many years, with little support from others.\n\n  The vast majority of the Iraqi people may well want the end of \nSaddam's rule, but they may not welcome the United States to create a \ngovernment in its own image. Regardless of their own internal \ndisagreements, the Iraqi people still feel a strong sense of national \nidentity and could quickly reject an American occupation force that \ntramples on local cultures.\n  We must recognize that the day we occupy Iraq, we shoulder the \nresponsibility to protect and care for its citizens. We are accountable \nunder the Geneva Convention for public safety in neighborhoods, for \nschools, and for meeting the basic necessities of life for 23 million \nIraqi civilians.\n  This daunting challenge has received little attention from the \nadministration. As the dust settles, the repressed tribal and religious \ndifferences of the past may come to the fore--as they did in the brutal \ncivil wars in the former Yugoslavia, in Rwanda, and other countries. As \nour troops bypass Basra and other Iraqi cities on our way to Baghdad, \nhow will we prevent the revenge bloodletting that occurred after the \nlast gulf war in which thousands of civilians lost their lives? What do \nwe do if the Kurds in northern Iraq claim an independent Kurdistan or \nthe Shia in southern Iraq move toward an alliance with Iran, from which \nthey have long drawn their inspiration?\n  We have told the Government of Turkey that we will not support an \nindependent Kurdistan, despite the fact the Kurdish people already have \na high degree of U.S.-supported independence and have even completed \nwork on their own constitution. Do we send troops again to keep Iraq \nunited? This administration's record in postwar Afghanistan is not \nexactly the best precedent for building democracy in Iraq.\n  Sixteen months after the fall of the Taliban government in \nAfghanistan, President Hamid Karzai is still referred to as the ``Mayor \nof Kabul'' because of the weak and fragile hold of his government on \nthe rest of the nation. Warlords are in control of much of the \ncountryside. The Afghan-Pakistan border is an area of anarchy and \nominous al-Qaida cells.\n  If we have not been able to get it right in Afghanistan, where we \nwent in with strong international support and involvement, how do we \nexpect to go it alone in Iraq? Everyone talked about a Marshall Plan \nfor Afghanistan where there is a clear need to rebuild and get it right \nso the Taliban and al-Qaida cannot take over again.\n  President Karzai was here last week at the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, begging for the adequate support and resources his new \ngovernment needs to take hold. To get it right in Iraq, we need the \ninternational community and a long-term commitment on the part of the \nUnited States. That is less likely to happen if we do not have the \ninternational community with us from the start.\n  Depending on our welcome, it could take as many as 200,000 American \ntroops, as General Shinseki told the Armed Services Committee just over \na week ago, or even more, to stabilize Iraq. We already have 37,000 \ntroops in South Korea, 8,000 in Afghanistan, 5,000 in the Balkans, and \nanother 1,000 in the Philippines and Colombia. We need to know whether \nour Armed Forces are being spread too thin. We need to know how long \nthey can keep up this pace.\n  The large-scale mobilization of the National Guard and Reserves for \nIraq is already having an effect on police, firefighters, and others \nwho are needed on the front lines at home, especially if there are new \nterrorist attacks on the United States. We have called up 167,000 Guard \nand Reserve personnel for active duty. We know the effect on their \nfamilies who are left behind. What is the effect on the economy in lost \nproductivity as these jobs go unfilled?\n\n  Can we meet all these obligations now, let alone shoulder the long-\nterm costs of war with Iraq? These may well total hundreds of billions \nof dollars in the years ahead.\n  One of the highest and worst costs of the war may be the humanitarian \ncosts. Sixty percent of the Iraqi people rely on the United Nations \nOil-for-Food Program for their daily survival. Food is distributed \nthrough 46,000 government distributors supplied by a network of food \nstorage barns. A war with Iraq will disrupt this network. Many Iraqis, \nespecially low-income families, have no other source of food. Women and \nchildren will be the most vulnerable victims of war. According to \nrecent reports, 500,000 Iraqi children already suffer from \nmalnutrition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks an excellent article in this morning's \nWashington Post by Ken Bacon and George Rupp.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will quote from the article.\n\n       . . . The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the world's \n     first responder when people flee their countries, lacks the \n     resources to prepare for a flood of refugees. . . .\n       Although the United States has spent $2.4 billion to send \n     troops to the Persian Gulf region, it has spent less than $1 \n     million to position relief agencies in the region. An \n     official at the U.N. Office for the Coordination\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\n     of Humanitarian Affairs recently told a conference that his \n     biggest concern is the small number of private relief \n     agencies ready to move quickly into Iraq.\n\n  We don't have the nongovernmental agencies that do humanitarian work \nin Iraq. We had them in Afghanistan. We have refused to permit them \nlicenses to go in and set up some kind of system in the past months, \nalthough they have all desired to do so.\n  Listen to this:\n\n       Lack of preparedness by the [United Nations] and private \n     relief agencies means the U.S. military will have to do most \n     of the relief work, and this in turn could mean the suffering \n     of the Iraqi people will be greater than necessary. \n     Administration officials have done little to match the skills \n     of relief agencies--some are specialists in medical care, \n     others in water and sanitation projects, for instance--with \n     projected needs.\n\n  It is talking about the nongovernmental agencies. It continues:\n\n       In modern warfare, precision bombs will limit civilian \n     casualties during the conflict, so that most death and \n     suffering occurs in the post-conflict period, when people are \n     displaced, poorly fed or prone to disease because water \n     sanitation and sewer systems have been disabled. This means \n     that rapid humanitarian intervention is just as important to \n     holding casualties and quick military victory.\n       The United States may be ready for war, but it is not yet \n     ready to help Iraq recover from war.\n\n  This is Ken Bacon and the spokesman for the nongovernmental agencies \nthat have worked so well historically on humanitarian needs. The U.S. \nmilitary is far from equipped to handle the challenge. Our Government \nmust have a plan in place to care for the population. Despite the \nimmense need for help from relief organizations, we have had too few \ndiscussions with key nongovernmental agencies to provide the food, \ntents, medicines, and other supplies that will be needed. All we have \nto do is look in the newspaper and we find out where the preposition of \nevery one of these aircraft carriers are, where the armored divisions \nare. Yet when you ask the Defense Department where are the prepositions \non food, the tents, and medicines, we can't disclose those because \nthose are secret.\n  Are all these possible consequences acceptable to the American \npeople? Are they manageable? Does the administration really have a plan \nthat considers how we will reap--in the international community, in the \nArab street, and in American families--what we sow in a war with Iraq.\n  Finally, the President must explain why war with Iraq won't distract \nus from the more immediate and graver danger posed by North Korea. \nSomething is gravely wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if we rush to \nwar with a country that poses no nuclear threat, but won't even talk to \none that brandishes its nuclear power right now. Any nuclear threat \nfrom Iraq is at least five years into the future. But the threat from \nNorth Korea exists now--today. CIA Director George Tenet recently \ninformed the Senate Armed Services Committee, North Korean missiles can \nnow reach American soil with a nuclear warhead.\n  Look at this article from the Washington Post of March 4:\n\n       The United States and Asian countries have begun to accept \n     the idea of a nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Continuing from the article:\n\n       ``The administration has acquiesced in North Korea becoming \n     a nuclear power,'' said a Senate source who was briefed last \n     week on the administration's evolving policy.\n       ``Our major fear is that North Korea would pass on fissile \n     materials or other nuclear technology'' to ``rogue states'' \n     or outlaw groups, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. \n     Armitage warned Congress last month. ``I don't think, given \n     the poverty in North Korea, that it would be too long'' \n     before such sales could take place, he said.\n\n  In other words, they are willing to accept North Korea as a nuclear \npower that has sold missiles to Iran, to Syria, to other countries that \nhave supported terrorism and not give that the first priority when we \nare talking about the security of the United States.\n  This makes no sense.\n\n       ``The total red line is the sale of nuclear weapons \n     material,'' said [a spokesman for the administration] who \n     follows the North Korea issue closely. ``Nuclear weapons \n     transferred to the Iraqis would be tantamount to nuking \n     Jerusalem.''\n\n  You can have them, as long as you don't sell them, for a country that \nhas already sold the technology of making nuclear weapons to Iran, to \nSyria, and other nations and has that capability itself.\n  Experts--including professionals within our own government--have been \nringing alarm bells for months about North Korea's pursuit of nuclear \nweapons. The views of the experts are brushed aside, despite the \ncontinually growing list of dangerous behavior by that government.\n  This is a country that celebrated the inauguration day of South \nKorea's new president by test firing a missile into the nearby sea. \nYet, last night, President Bush did not even mention North Korea in his \nstatement.\n  North Korea has long had advanced missiles which it sells to other \ncountries. It has restarted its plutonium--producing reactor, kicked \nout the international inspectors, pulled out of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, and threatened to break the Armistice agreement \nthat has brought 50 years of peace to the Korean peninsula.\n  Desperate and strapped for cash, North Korea is the greatest current \nnuclear danger to the United States, and it is clearly taking advantage \nof the situation in Iraq. It is the country most likely to sell nuclear \nmaterial to terrorists, and has missiles that can strike our soil. How \nlong can the Administration continue to ignore North Korea? How will a \nwar with Iraq affect our ability to deal with this escalating danger?\n  Just the other day, two North Korean Mig fighter jets tailed an \nAmerican plane near the Korean Peninsula, in a further attempt to get \nthe attention of President Bush.\n  But in his zeal on Iraq, the President has refused to call the \nsituation on the Korean peninsula what it is--a genuine crisis. He has \nrefused to even talk directly to the North Koreans to try to end its \nnuclear program.\n  The Administration may even have tried to conceal information about \nNorth Korea. Intelligence analysts at the Lawrence Livermore National \nLaboratory in California concluded in November 2001 that North Korea \nhad begun construction of a plant to enrich uranium to use in nuclear \nweapons. Yet, the Administration did not reveal this information until \neleven months later, in October 2002--after Congress had voted on the \nlegislation authorizing the use of force in Iraq.\n  Only the Administration knows if the timing of the release of the \ninformation on North Korea was by design or coincidence. But if the \nAdministration did conceal its knowledge of North Korea's dangerous \nnuclear weapons program until after the Congressional vote on Iraq, it \nwould represent a breach of faith by our government not seen since the \nVietnam War.\n  The very real danger is that the Administration is making it more \nlikely that North Korea will provide nuclear material or even nuclear \nweapons to terrorists or nations supporting terrorists. Is war with \nIraq worth that risk--not taking more time with inspectors?\n  We are poised at a moment of truth in the stewardship of the \nPresident. If President Bush commits our men and women to war, then all \nof us will close ranks behind them, and pray for their safety and a \nswift end to the conflict.\n  But with inspectors on the ground and stiff international pressure \nstill possible, this is an unnecessary war. History will judge how well \nwe meet the challenges of this new era and this new century. We should \nmove forward as the great and honorable nation we are--with patience \nand perseverance--as we carry on the difficult work of build a better \nand more peaceful world for all its people.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 7, 2003]\n\n                       Unready for the Aftermath\n\n                 (By Kenneth H. Bacon and George Rupp)\n\n       Despite months of planning by the Bush administration to \n     respond to the humanitarian challenges that could follow an \n     attack against Iraq, preparations for dealing with \n     displacement, injury, illness and food shortages remain \n     inadequate. If current problems continue, the suffering \n     caused by war could be amplified by lack of aid resources and \n     coordination.\n       The most urgent need could be food. The United States \n     boasts that it has shipped 3 million humanitarian daily \n     rations to the region to help feed Iraqis. But individual \n     meal\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\n     packets will feed only a tiny portion of Iraq's 24 million \n     people, and for just a few days. A United Nations official \n     recently called U.S. and U.N. preparations to feed the Iraqi \n     people ``grossly inadequate.'' The official said that ``they \n     need to be sending ships of wheat to the Persian Gulf, along \n     with ships of soldiers.''\n       More than a decade of U.N. sanctions has left approximately \n     16 million Iraqis dependent on government rations for their \n     entire food supply under the U.N. Oil-for-Food program; most \n     of the remaining 8 million Iraqis rely on government rations \n     for a portion of their daily food basket. The U.N. Children's \n     Fund estimates that more than 2 million Iraqi children will \n     require therapeutic feeding in the event of a conflict.\n       A break in the U.N. food pipeline could cause ``extremely \n     grave'' conditions, Ramiro Lopes da Silva, director of the \n     U.N. World Food Program office in Baghdad, told The Post. He \n     estimates that 10 million people could run out of food within \n     six weeks of the start of a war. ``After that we will have to \n     feed 10 million people. Eventually, we'll have to feed the \n     entire population,'' Lopes da Silva said. The World Food \n     Program currently has enough food in the region to feed \n     900,000 people for 10 weeks.\n       Preparations to deal with refugees and displace people also \n     are behind schedule. The United Nations estimates that in the \n     ``medium impact scenario''--a two- to three-month conflict \n     involving ground troops--1.45 million refugees and asylum \n     seekers would try to reach neighboring countries, and 900,000 \n     people would be newly displaced within Iraq. Yet Ruud Lubbers \n     says that his agency, the U.N. High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, the world's first responder when people flee their \n     countries, lacks the resources to prepare for a flood of \n     refugees.\n       So far the U.N. refugee office has raised less than $20 \n     million of the $60 million it is seeking for tents, stoves, \n     blankets and other materials for refugee camps. Most of that \n     money came from the United States. As a result, the agency \n     has positioned only about 20 percent of the equipment it \n     needs in the region.\n       In a flurry of news conferences last week, administration \n     officials admitted that the military may have to provide food \n     and medical assistance during and immediately after a \n     conflict, but they say humanitarian tasks would quickly be \n     turned over to the United Nations and private relief \n     agencies. Sadly, private relief agencies, most of which \n     depend on government funding, aren't yet well prepared for \n     the task.\n       Although the United States has spent $2.4 billion to send \n     troops to the Persian Gulf region, it has spent less than $1 \n     million to position relief agencies in the region. An \n     official at the U.N. Office for the Coordination of \n     Humanitarian Affairs recently told a conference that his \n     biggest concern is the small number of private relief \n     agencies ready to move quickly into Iraq.\n       Lack of preparedness by U.N. and private relief agencies \n     means the U.S. military will have to do most of the relief \n     work, and this in turn could mean that the suffering of the \n     Iraqi people will be greater than necessary. Administration \n     officials have done little to match the skills of relief \n     agencies--some are specialists in medical care, others in \n     water and sanitation projects, for instance--with projected \n     needs. One urgent unanswered question is: Who will care for \n     Iraqis exposed to weapons of mass destruction? Humanitarian \n     organizations lack the skills and equipment to handle this \n     challenge.\n       In modern warfare, precision bombs limit civilian \n     casualties during the conflict, so that most death and \n     suffering occurs in the post-conflict period, when people are \n     displaced, poorly fed or prone to disease because water \n     sanitation and sewage systems have been disabled. This means \n     that rapid humanitarian intervention is just as important to \n     holding casualties down as quick military victory.\n       The United States may be ready for war, but it not yet \n     ready to help Iraq recover from war.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5, 2003]\n\n               Foes Giving In to N. Korea's Nuclear Aims\n\n                   (By Doug Struck and Glenn Kessler)\n\n       Tokyo, March 4.--The United States and Asian countries have \n     begun to accept the idea of a nuclear-armed North Korea, \n     according to officials and analysts here and in Washington. \n     Increasingly, the Bush administration is turning its \n     attention to preventing the Communist government in Pyongyang \n     from selling nuclear material to the highest bidder.\n       Envoys for the new South Korean president, Roh Moo Hyun, \n     shocked Bush advisers in Washington recently when they said \n     they would rather have a nuclear North Korea than a chaotic \n     collapse of the government there, according to sources in \n     Seoul.\n       And in Japan, located within missile range of North Korea, \n     officials feel their neighbor cannot be stopped from \n     producing a bomb. ``We need to be debating how to live with \n     North Korea, with or without nuclear weapons,'' Taro Kono, a \n     lawmaker from the ruling party, said in an interview.\n       Washington had issued repeated warnings to North Korea not \n     to begin reprocessing materials that could become fuel for a \n     nuclear bomb, but administration officials have become \n     resigned to North Korea taking that step sometime within the \n     next two to four weeks. ``The administration has acquiesced \n     in North Korea becoming a nuclear power,'' said a Senate \n     source who was briefed last week on the administration's \n     evolving policy.\n       U.S. officials have begun to contend that a decision by \n     North Korea to begin reprocessing spent nuclear fuel rods \n     into weapons-grade plutonium will represent a diplomatic \n     opportunity to swing international opinion to its side in the \n     impasse over North Korea's nuclear ambitions, administration \n     and congressional officials said today.\n       The administration thinks the shock of a decision by \n     Pyongyang to export nuclear materials would force Russia, \n     China, South Korea and other nations to drop their reluctance \n     to confront the Communist state. According to that view, they \n     would go along with the United States in mounting a tough \n     campaign to further isolate the North and possibly to try to \n     interdict suspected shipments of nuclear materials.\n       Production of plutonium that could flow abroad in \n     clandestine sales ``fundamentally changes the equation,'' \n     contends an administration official. ``Literally every city \n     on the planet would be threatened.''\n       During the last crisis over North Korea's nuclear \n     ambitions, in 1994, the Clinton administration warned \n     Pyongyang that reprocessing materials for a nuclear bomb \n     could prompt a military strike. Many officials in Asia \n     believe that Washington will now set new ``red lines'' that \n     it will not tolerate North Korea crossing. But Bush and his \n     senior advisers have refused to do that, publicly at least, \n     saying it would only encourage North Korea to charge past \n     them.\n       North Korean already is a major source of missile \n     technology, and an Iranian resistance group recently said \n     that North Korean experts are assisting Iran in its pursuit \n     of nuclear weapons. Now officials worry about a new kind \n     of export.\n       Even the Administration says North Korea's nuclear weapons \n     are dangerous. ``Our major fear is that North Korea would \n     pass on fissile material or other nuclear techology'' to \n     ``rogue states'' or outlaw groups, Deputy Secretary of State \n     Richard L. Armitage warned Congress last month. ``I don't \n     think, given the poverty of North Korea, that it would be too \n     long'' before such sales took place, he said.\n       ``The total red line is the sale of nuclear weapons \n     material,'' said Rep. Mark S. Kirk (R-Ill.), who follows the \n     North Korea issue closely. ``Nuclear weapons transferred to \n     the Iraqis would be tantamount to nuking Jerusalem.'' You can \n     have them, as long as you don't sell them?\n       The Senate source said the administration was playing ``a \n     very dangerous game'' in not acting to stop reprocessing \n     before it starts, because the resulting materials could be \n     hidden in the country's network of caves awaiting export.\n       But administration officials argue they have no good \n     military options for eliminating North Korea's nuclear \n     capability. A surgical strike might neutralize the plutonium \n     plant, but the country's effort to enrich uranium is \n     proceeding at another, unknown site.\n       President Bush told reporters this week that he was still \n     seeking a diplomatic solution and that a ``military option is \n     our last choice.'' He also said that he would seek to \n     ``accelerate the development of an anti-ballistic missile \n     system'' to counter a potential threat from North Korean \n     missiles.\n       U.S. officials quietly dropped the phrase that the United \n     States has ``no hostile intent'' toward North Korea in their \n     talking points about a month ago, an official said ``It's \n     clear North Korea has hostile intent to us,'' he said.\n       ``I wouldn't rule out use of military coercion if North \n     Korea crosses . . . red lines,'' said Michael A. McDevitt, a \n     retired rear admiral and director of the Center for Strategic \n     Studies in Washington. ``The one I am most worried about is \n     if they produce enough plutonium to start hawking it on the \n     open market.''\n       An administration official said Chinese officials have told \n     North Korea that China would consider any attempt to produce \n     nuclear weapons a ``direct threat to Chinese national \n     security.'' While the Chinese told U.S. officials that they \n     made it clear to North Korea they would not accept such a \n     step, the Chinese statement did not address reprocessing or \n     foreign sales of the resulting materials.\n       Many strategists have long asserted that the United States, \n     China and Russia would not allow a nuclear-armed North Korea \n     because it could dramatically alter the power structure in \n     northeastern Asia and lead to an arms race as both Seoul and \n     Tokyo demanded nuclear weapons.\n       Increasingly, however, it appears that North Korea is \n     determined to defy those wishes. ``In a way we are wasting \n     our time to talk about dialogue with North Korea,'' said \n     Masashi Nishihara, president of Japan's National Defense \n     Academy. ``Only after they develop a nuclear program will \n     they come to the table.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. I would like to maybe ask him a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could ask unanimous consent to ask him a question \nand retain the right to the floor.\n  I was interested in what our rules of engagement will be for our men \nand\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\nwomen in Iraq. I am concerned, as are many of the nongovernmental \nagencies, that if we go past Basra, if we let it alone for a period of \n48 hours--this is a community that is largely Shia, ruled by the \nSunnis--I have heard estimates of up to 10,000 people being slaughtered \nthere in bloodletting unless there is an immediate kind of police \naction and force presence which would keep these parties apart.\n  I am wondering, in those circumstances, what will be the rules of \nengagement of American servicemen. Are they going to be called upon in \nterms of separating these blood feuds, which have been so much a part \nof these revolutions in Iraq? I want to know whether American \nservicemen are going to be instructed that they are to fire on the \nIraqi people who are involved in these kinds of acts of violence. I am \ninterested in what the rules of engagement will be for northern Iraq, \nif there should be a rush by the Kurds to go back to their old homes \nwhere, in many instances, families have lived for centuries and have \nbeen separated by Saddam Hussein. What are American troops going to be \ntold to do when the Iraqi forces collapse and the Kurds make a rush to \nKirkuk, for example, one of the great oil-producing areas? What are \nAmerican service men and women going to be told to do? What will be the \nrules of engagement outside of just engaging with the Iraqi Army? What \nare going to be the rules of engagement in terms of maintaining \ncivilian control?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I welcome the question from my colleague. \nHe is a very valued member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  We had briefings this week by the Department of Defense, and indeed a \nrepresentative from the Department of State, on the plans now being \nformulated by the Bush administration, should force be necessary, as to \nexactly what we would do with respect to the questions raised by my \ncolleague.\n  First and foremost, our forces, as they would move in, are \nresponsible for the objective of trying to keep Iraq together and \nconstituted as a nation, as it is today. It is the elimination of \nweapons of mass destruction and the consequent regime change that are \nthe goals. Now, they are to provide first protection for the \nnongovernmental organizations which stand ready to assist our country. \nIn other words, we will be making an effort to feed and care for the \npeople of Iraq, as well as outsiders. That is the highest priority. So \nwe are to provide a secure framework in which the people of Iraq can be \ncared for as best they can under wartime conditions.\n  With respect to factions in Iraq and their desire to fight among each \nother, we are going to do our best to contain that. Our goal is to have \nIraq as a nation, with its present boundaries, remaining intact. We are \nbringing in experts to put out any fires Saddam Hussein may set at the \noil wells. We are bringing in people to establish, as quickly as \npossible, a secure framework in which the people of Iraq can begin to \nselect their own leadership and government in due course. So there has \nbeen a lot of planning.\n  As to the exact rules of engagement that commanders, as the Senator \nand I understand, will issue to their troops, at the moment I do not \nhave those orders. But I assure the Senator that we are contemplating \nthe challenge to maintain the integrity of Iraq as a nation. That could \nwell involve stopping the civil strife between factions. But a lot of \nplanning has been done.\n  I think the administration has been subjected to undue criticism \nbecause the planning as yet has not been fully made public. But it is \nthere, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's response. This is enormously \nimportant because we have seen in Kosovo and other areas where \nservicemen did not protect local populations because they did not have \nwhat they call the ``orders'' and the appropriate rules of engagement \nto provide those protections.\n  We are on notice about what is going to happen now in northern Iraq, \nwith the desire of Kurd families returning to many of their home \ncommunities. We are on notice about the southern part of Iraq, where \nmany of the Shia who have been denied their cities and communities want \nto reclaim them. It seems to me we ought to have some understanding \nabout what our servicemen are going to be asked to do during those \nperiods. I don't understand, for the life of me, why we cannot know \nthat information and cannot have that information.\n\n  One more word. Why can we not say, if we are going to have these \ncircumstances, these are going to be the rules of engagement? At least \nwe need to have some awareness and understanding that we are going to \nmeet our responsibilities under the Geneva Convention. We have an \ninternational responsibility, obviously, in terms of protecting \ncivilian populations. We have seen, in Kosovo and Serbia, where those \npopulations were not protected in a number of instances because the \nrules of engagement were not proper.\n  I say to the chairman of the committee, I hope prior to the time we \ngo to war, we will have at least some understanding about what these \ninstructions are. There is no reason they need to be kept secure. If we \nare interested in avoiding large bloodletting in that region of the \ncountry, we ought to know exactly what we are expecting of our service \nmen and women. They are the best in the world, and they are trained to \novercome any military force.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I assure my colleague that we are greatly \nconcerned about the safety of our service personnel as they undertake \nthis mission, if it has to be done. I visited with them, together with \nSenators Levin, Rockefeller, and Roberts. They are ready.\n  The Senator raises, quit properly, the record we had first in Kosovo. \nI happen to have visited there during the early part of that securing \nof it by the United States and other forces. I assure the Senator that \nthe rules of engagement were spelled out. I remember American \nservicemen guarding the Serbian churches from destruction. I remember \ninstances where they would carefully respond to protect the Serbs, who \nwere at that point in time in minority status, so to speak. So we \nperformed that mission, and we did it admirably, together with a \ncoalition of nations.\n  We will have other nations assisting us in this engagement. Then you \nbring about Afghanistan. That is a country, historically, that has been \nfought over by factions. We visited there a week or 10 days ago. There \nis relative quietude there. There is no severe amount of factional \nstrife today; that is, outbursts of actual casualties and the like. \nTensions are present. We are trying to reconstitute an armed forces \nunder the Government of Afghanistan now. So we have a good track record \non that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator want to explain, on the reconstituting \nof the armed forces, how successful that has been?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. We met with President Karzai. I assume you saw him \nwhen he visited here. Incidentally, the French are very active in the \ntraining of those forces, and the Germans are taking an active role in \nthe training of those forces. It is coming together, I say to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, my information is somewhat different from the \nSenator's, in terms of the recruitment and the ability to hold these \nindividuals into any kind of a national army.\n  I want to finish with this point. We are facing a variety of security \nchallenges in this country. My belief is the No. 1, which is \ncontinuing, is al-Qaida and the dangers of terrorism. We have to look \nat everything. We know Saddam Hussein is a despot. We know progress is \nbeing made. We also have on the scene the danger of North Korea and the \nimminent threat they present. We ought to be making a judgment about \nour national security interests, our overall security--the security of \nthe American people within the construct of the dangers of al-Qaida, \nthe threat that is posed in North Korea, and whatever the current \nsituation is with the inspectors in Iraq.\n  On that kind of a situation, I draw the conclusion that we should \ngive more time to the inspectors and work to try to galvanize the \ninternational community to support us in that effort.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to also--if I may, on my \ntime--address points raised by my colleague from Massachusetts. Quite \nproperly, the Senator raises the issue of North Korea. The President \naddressed that last night.\n\n[[Page S3364]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record his comments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The PRESIDENT. We, of course, are consulting with our \n     allies at the United Nations. But I meant what I said, this \n     is the last phase of diplomacy. A little bit more time? \n     Saddam Hussein has had 12 years to disarm. He is deceiving \n     people. This is what's important for our fellow citizens to \n     realize; that if he really intended to disarm, like the world \n     has asked him to do, we would know whether he was disarming. \n     He's trying to buy time. I can understand why--he's been \n     successful with these tactics for 12 years.\n       Saddam Hussein is a threat to our nation. September the \n     11th changed the strategic thinking, at least, as far as I \n     was concerned, for how to protect our country. My job is to \n     protect the American people. It used to be that we could \n     think that you could contain a person like Saddam Hussein, \n     that oceans would protect us from his type of terror. \n     September 11th should say to the American people that we're \n     now a battlefield, that weapons of mass destruction in the \n     hands of a terrorist organization could be deployed here at \n     home.\n       So, therefore, I think the threat is real. And so do a lot \n     of other people in my government. And since I believe the \n     threat is real, and since my most important job is to protect \n     the security of the American people, that's precisely what \n     we'll do.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. These are in strong rebuttal of my colleague's comments. \nI will read what the President said with reference to North Korea:\n\n       Well, I think it is an issue. Obviously, I am concerned \n     about North Korea developing nuclear weapons, not only for \n     their own use, but perhaps choose to proliferate them, sell \n     them.\n\n  The President is working in a national multilateral forum to try to \naddress this problem because it is regional in that Russia, Japan, \nSouth Korea and, indeed, China have a heavy stake in seeing that the \nKorean peninsula does not become nuclearized.\n  It is clear as that, I say to my friend, and I think the President, \nin a very responsible way, the initial approach to this, a multilateral \napproach, the approach my colleague is urging on the President with \nregard to Iraq, is applying in the Korean peninsula situation. It does \nnot preclude possibly bilateral discussions at some later date and \ntime.\n  Second, on the issue of Iraq, the question is time, months. Time is \nnot on our side. The President addressed this very explicitly last \nnight in his remarks. He simply said that his concern--and I will put \nthe text in the Record--his concern is, again, the question of \nproliferation.\n  No one in this Chamber thus far, in the weeks and the months we have \ndebated this issue, has denied Saddam Hussein has enormous caches of \nweapons of mass destruction which he has failed to declare and which \nthe inspectors have failed to destroy because of the inability to \nlocate them through lack of cooperation from Iraq.\n  What is to prevent Saddam Hussein, if he has not already done it, \nfrom taking small amounts of these weapons and allowing an \ninternational terrorist organization, be it al-Qaida or others, to take \nthis material and begin to carry it to places throughout the world, \nwhether it be Europe or the United States, and dissemble it?\n  I bring back the tragic aftermath of the discovery of anthrax sent to \nMembers of this body. Postal employees lost their lives. One of our \nSenate office buildings was shut down. We suffered a severe blow as a \nconsequence of an unopened envelope which contained but a few ounces, \nif that, of this material. And Saddam Hussein, it is documented, has \ntons of it, undeclared, not found, and all of this could have been \nachieved if he had cooperated with the inspection regime which was \ninitiated in November of last year.\n  Time is not on our side. The failure of the United States and the \ncoalition of willing nations, principally Great Britain, not to act is \nnot in our interest. The price of inaction is far greater than the \nprice of action.\n  As I listened to my colleague from Massachusetts--and he has spoken \nvery eloquently on these subjects over the past several days. I admire \nhis courage to get out and lead in this debate. It is an important \ndebate. It is taking place across the Nation. But I cannot find in my \ncolleague's comments where he specifically has a program whereby to \nforce Iraq to cooperate. Why is it that he has not emphasized the need \nfor Iraq to cooperate and what steps should our country, Great Britain, \nor others do to force that cooperation, other than the steps we have \ntaken thus far, which have not proved fruitful?\n  Yes, here and there Saddam Hussein steps up and does some little \nthing to buy time, but he would not have needed that time if he had \ncooperated and began that cooperation when the inspection regime began \nlast November. Mr. President, wherein does the Senator lay out a \nprogram to compel Iraq to cooperate?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me answer, if I may, in this way. First of all, the \nadministration was strongly opposed to inspections. I heard the \nexchange with my friend and colleague from Connecticut. That is very \nclear. Secretary Rumsfeld said it. They never believed in inspections, \nNo. 1.\n  Then they agreed to the inspection process at the United Nations. It \nis only today, evidently, when the CIA is giving the inspectors all the \ninformation we have.\n  The Senator from Virginia attended the Armed Services Committee \nhearings that I attended where our colleague and friend from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, pointed out time and again that the administration and \nthe CIA had still not provided all of the material on intelligence to \nthe inspectors. But all during this time, the administration was \nsaying: Let's go to war; let's go to war; let's go to war; Saddam isn't \ncomplying.\n\n  Now the Senator--and I have not had a chance to look at the \ndocument--says the record is clear, and he put the document in the \nRecord an hour ago, that finally we are giving everything to the \ninspectors. Today, we had the leader of the inspection team say he \nbelieves they can do the job not in weeks, not in years but in some \nmonths. The international community says: We will be with you if you \ncan do that in a period of months.\n  My position is, it is better to work the international community to \ntry and do it in weeks--if we cannot, do it in months. It is cheaper in \nterms of treasure and human life to keep the necessary military force \nthere to make sure it is done.\n  That is my position, I say to the Senator. I know we differ on some \naspects, but we do not differ on the willingness to give to the \ninspectors the intelligence information.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, a couple of \nletters are about to be handed to him. They are in the Record. He is \nmistaken in the facts. The letters cite what we have done over an \nextensive period of time--over the last 3 or 4 months. I personally, \ntogether with the former chairman, Senator Levin, now ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, have consulted with Director Tenet on \nthis matter. We have been in a room with the actual person entrusted to \nconvey on a daily basis to Hans Blix this information. It has been \ngoing on for months. It did not just start.\n  Let me read one paragraph, and then I will yield.\n\n       Statement for the record: The American intelligence \n     community has--\n\n  That is past tense--\n\n     has provided extensive intelligence and other support to the \n     United Nations on Iraq and WMD, and potential inspection \n     sites for over 10 years. There is, therefore, a very strong \n     common understanding of sites of potential interest to the \n     inspectors, whether UNSCOM inspectors or UNMOVIC inspectors \n     or IAEA inspectors. When the current round of inspections \n     began, the Intelligence Community assembled several lists of \n     suspect sites, which we combined into a common list in early \n     January. This list consisted of high, moderate, and low value \n     sites, depending on our assessment of recent activities \n     suggesting ongoing WMD association or other intelligence \n     information that the sites were worth inspecting.\n\n  We have now provided detailed information on all of the high value \nand moderate value sites to UNMOVIC and IAEA.\n  The letter continues to detail what has been done over a period of \nmonths, I say to the Senator. It just did not start yesterday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on this point? First of all, I \nwill put in the Record--and the Senator was there--the exchange between \nSenator Levin and Secretary Rumsfeld. The Senator from Virginia was at \nthe Armed Services Committee meeting. I remember this meeting--it was \n2\\1/2\\ weeks ago--when Senator Levin said the briefing he had and the \nanswers he\n\n[[Page S3365]]\n\nhad from the intelligence community were not consistent with Secretary \nRumsfeld.\n  I am going to put that exchange in the Record, and that will stand in \nterms of 3 weeks ago.\n  I want to draw attention to this letter. ``The American intelligence \ncommunity has provided extensive intelligence''--extensive \nintelligence. It does not say ``all'' or ``complete intelligence.'' It \nsays ``extensive intelligence.'' That is what my letter says.\n  Mr. WARNER. Go on to the second paragraph.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know, but why do they say--I will be glad to read this \nand go through it, Mr. President, but I want to stick with the facts I \nknow about. The facts I know about are the testimony of the Secretary \nof Defense and the exchange that he had with Senator Levin in open \nsession in the Armed Services Committee where Senator Levin had been \ntold the evening before, and it was represented that a complete list of \nthese sites had been provided, and he had the materials that \ndemonstrated it had not been complete. Those are security matters, as \nthe Senator well knows. That was 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago.\n  The point is, as to the intelligence given to the inspector, whatever \nhas been given, is it the Senator's statement now as chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee that all of the information the intelligence \nagency has in terms of weapons has been given to the inspectors? Is \nthat what the Senator is telling us?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think this letter answers Senator \nKennedy's first statement: We have just begun to provide information.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I did not say ``just begun.'' No, the Senator is not \ncorrect. There was a provision, there was a filtering out of this \nmaterial.\n  It was very slow in January. We are getting close to classified. I \nremember the briefing we had from the deputy of the CIA at that time. \nIt was clear they were cooperating. It was also clear there were a \nlimited number of inspectors and they were going to provide more, and \nit would be soon. I think the Senator would remember that briefing. I \nremember it clearly. This has been a process of filtering out.\n  The authority I have, I sat right next to Carl Levin, 2\\1/2\\ weeks \nago, when he looked in the eyes of the Secretary of Defense and they \nreviewed documents, and the Secretary of Defense leaned over and shared \nvarious documents. At the end of that, he had to agree with the \nposition Senator Levin had, that all of the information had not been \nprovided. I will put that in the Record.\n  My point is, if we still, 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago, had a ways to go with \nintelligence information that would be advantageous to the inspectors, \nit strengthens those who believe we should make sure our inspectors \nhave all of the relevant material that will help them do the job which \nwe all agree should be done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in fairness, this letter is part of a very \ncomplex and long dialog between Senator Levin and various members of \nthe administration. Were he here today, he would say he is still not \nsatisfied with regard to this issue.\n  At one point I recognized that one member of the administration said \nto him, Senator, I gave you incorrect numbers at one time and I am now \ncorrecting them. I think a good-faith effort has been made by the \nadministration to resolve such differences as Senator Levin has had.\n  Having been in most, if not all, of the discussions with Senator \nLevin at the time he raised these important questions, the \npreponderance of the facts shows unequivocally our Nation has \ncooperated fully on the matters of intelligence. I stand by that. I \nheard the National Security Adviser state that, the Director of Central \nIntelligence state that, and others. We have cooperated.\n  Have there been some disjoints of timing and perhaps numbers? I \ncannot say it is perfect, but there has been overall sincere \ncooperation.\n  We have had an excellent debate today. I thank my colleagues for \njoining me on the floor, both on my side of the aisle and the other \nside of the aisle. We have met the test of the Senate addressing this \nquestion.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on this day in the halls of the United \nNations Security Council and in the distant lands of the Middle East, \nthe United States is making a stand for the causes of freedom and \ndemocracy, for order and peace.\n  The President and the Congress have made clear that we will no longer \ntolerate Saddam Hussein's production or possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Further, it is our solemn belief that the people of Iraq \ndeserve to live in freedom. They have suffered long enough under the \ntyranny and the oppression of the day.\n  As is so often the case, challenging the status quo is not easy even \nif that status quo is a dictator pursuing and possessing weapons of \nmass destruction that are explicitly prohibited by the United Nations \nSecurity Council.\n  We are fast approaching that moment of reckoning with Saddam Hussein. \nIf he were to voluntarily disarm, it would be welcomed. But he will \nnot. If he flees his country, the chances for peace are much better. \nBut he will never flee unless he is absolutely convinced that there are \nno other options for his survival.\n  If individuals within Saddam's regime rise up and overthrow him, \nthere will be an opportunity for a new beginning in Iraq. But none will \ntake this brave step if they doubt the fortitude of the United States \nand the international community.\n  Let there be no mistake about our Nation's purpose in confronting \nIraq. Saddam Hussein's regime poses a clear threat to the security of \nthe United States, its friends and its allies. And it is a threat that \nwe must address, and we must address now.\n\n  Recall that in 1991 we were concerned Saddam would use weapons of \nmass destruction to further his expansionist desires in the Middle \nEast. Now, a decade later, we live with the reality--the reality--that \nterrorists may acquire and use such weapons on our soil.\n  I have no doubts that terrorists seek such weapons to use against \nthis Nation. I am equally certain that Saddam Hussein possesses such \nweapons and would provide them to terrorists, if he has not already. \nAnd it is this nexus of a tyrannical dictator, those weapons of mass \ndestruction, and terrorists who seek to inflict harm--grievous harm--\nupon the American people that compels us to act now.\n  The Senate--this body--and the House of Representatives voted \noverwhelmingly last fall to authorize the President to use force, if \nnecessary, against Iraq if Saddam Hussein did not disarm. In those \nvotes, the Congress stated unambiguously that the United States will \nnot tolerate the pursuit and possession of weapons of mass destruction \nby Saddam Hussein.\n  Nothing has fundamentally changed. I guess one could say the possible \nexception to that statement would be we have even further evidence, \nbecause of the passage of time, that Saddam Hussein will not \nvoluntarily disarm.\n  Last fall, to reaffirm the broad international commitment to disarm \nIraq, President Bush successfully pursued a United Nations resolution \nthat offered Saddam Hussein a final chance to meet the demands of the \nworld community or face the consequences. Saddam has missed his final \nchance.\n  Now we are told the United States must pursue a second resolution \nbefore Iraq can be disarmed. The United Nations Security Council, on 17 \nseparate occasions, over a 12-year period, demanded the disarmament of \nIraq. For the record, this will not be a second resolution, but this \nwill be an 18th resolution over this 12-year period. Nothing in history \nhas been made more meaningful by repeating it 18 different times.\n  In the end, it is not a multilateral approach our opponents seek--for \nthe\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\nUnited States is already joined by a multitude of others who share our \ncommitment to disarm Saddam. No, it is the false comfort of unanimity \nto which they aspire. When everyone is responsible, no one is \naccountable.\n  My friends, the hour has arrived for democratically elected leaders \nto stand up and be counted. Will the free world tolerate Saddam \nHussein's continued brutality, his possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and his continued defiance of the international community, \nor will we act to stop it now?\n  To those who would suggest we are acting in isolation to confront \nSaddam's evil, I remind you we are not alone in the conviction. In the \npast month, the leaders of 18 European countries have publicly endorsed \nthe U.S. call for final action, including force, if necessary, to \ndisarm Saddam Hussein.\n  Over two dozen countries are providing basing for our troops, access \nfor our aircraft, and material support in preparation for a possible \nconflict with Iraq. And if it comes to that, with allies such as the \nUnited Kingdom, Australia, Spain, Italy, Denmark, as well as many of \nthe new democracies of Eastern Europe all on our side, we will not \ncarry this burden alone.\n  America is at its strongest when it is standing in common cause with \nour friends and allies. The inverse, of course, is that America's \nallies are at their strongest when they are standing with the United \nStates.\n\n  To those leaders who have spoken out with us against the threat posed \nby Saddam Hussein, I commend your courage. As America has risen to \nchallenge the threats posed and supported by Saddam Hussein, you chose \nto stand by her side. And such loyalty and such leadership will not \nsoon be forgotten.\n  Some of our erstwhile allies would be well advised to recall their \nown freedom was regained by such courage and conviction. I remind them \ntheir own liberation in World War II was a less popular undertaking \nthan a possible war in Iraq.\n  What about popular opinion at the time? If one goes back and looks at \nsurveys and polls from the time, in October 1939, when asked whether \nthe U.S. should enter the war in Europe, only 16.8 percent of Americans \nresponded yes. And 17.2 percent said yes in December 1939. In July \n1940, 26.9 percent said yes.\n  After winning reelection in 1940, President Roosevelt tried to move \npublic opinion toward greater U.S. involvement, while offering \nsignificant material support to the allied war effort. Yet asked again \nin January of 1941 whether they would support a declaration of war, \nonly 14 percent of the American people responded yes.\n  And as late as October 1941, President Roosevelt commented that 70 \npercent of Americans wanted us to stay out of the war in Europe.\n  Sadly, at that time, many around the world recoiled at the thought of \nconfronting Nazi Germany head on. After all, it was Europe's war, not \nours, and Hitler was killing foreign Jews, not Americans. Many leaders \nof the day demanded we look after America first. They called for our \ncountry to stay within its borders, protected by the false security of \ntwo oceans. But then, as now--on December 7, 1941, and September 11, \n2001--we were reminded that America is most vulnerable to attack when \nit is in retreat.\n  President Roosevelt demonstrated then, as President Bush does today, \nthat the essential measure of a world leader is not in his ability to \nchase public opinion--no--but, rather, his courage to make the country \nsafer by leading public opinion.\n  President Bush deserves much credit for confronting the grave and \ngrowing threat posed by the mad pursuit of a ruthless tyrant for the \nworld's most deadly weapons. The President is right when he says that \nneither more time nor more inspections will stop Saddam.\n  The consequences of war with Iraq cannot be certain and those \nfeelings of uncertainty we felt as the issues surrounding Iraq and the \nfuture have been discussed on the floor today. But our goals and our \nmotives must be understood for what they are. We seek to defend our own \npeople. We seek the liberation of the Iraqi people. We seek the \nfoundation of a democratic government in Baghdad, and we seek the \nspread of peace in the Middle East. These are worthy goals of a great \nnation, and they are goals worth fighting for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/07/senate-section/article/S3366-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          MR. HENRI LANDWIRTH\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to \nacknowledge the accomplishments of Mr. Henri Landwirth, a great \nphilanthropist from my home State of Florida. Mr. Landwirth, a \nHolocaust survivor born in Belgium in 1927, has beaten the odds to live \nthe true American dream. In addition to his success in the hotel \nindustry, Mr. Landwirth has founded several charitable organizations. \nHis countless acts of charity continue to affect tens of thousands of \nlives. Mr. Landwirth has received numerous honors for his contributions \nto society, and today I rise to show my appreciation for all that he \nhas done for the state of Florida and for people in need.\n  Henri Landwirth spend most of his teenage years during World War II \nin death camps and labor camps in Nazi Germany. He narrowly escaped \nwith his life after a Nazi firing squad marched him into the woods to \nbe shot and decided at the last minute to spare his life. After the \nwar, Mr. Landwirth immigrated to the United States in 1950 with only \n$20 to his name. He was drafted into the United States Army within \nthree years. After serving in the military and learning English, he \nenrolled in a course in hotel management and found entry-level \nemployment in a New York hotel, quickly mastering his job and learning \nevery job in the hotel.\n  Mr. Landwirth moved to Florida in 1954, and became Manager of the \n100-room Starlite Motel in Cocoa Beach near Cape Canaveral, home of the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, Kennedy Space \nCenter. The original seven astronauts, referred to as the ``Mercury \nSeven''--M. Scott Carpenter, L. Gordon Cooper, Jr., John Glenn, Jr.; \nVirgil ``Gus'' Grissom; Walter Schirra, Jr.; Alan Shepard, Jr.; and \nDonald ``Deke'' Slayton--chose the Starlite Motel as their temporary \nresidence. During this period, Mr. Landwirth developed strong \nfriendships with these astronauts, which still bind them together.\n  Mr. Landwirth is now a partner in a successful Central Florida hotel \ncompany, with John Glenn and others, and he has spearheaded several \ninitiatives to help those in need. He and the Mercury Seven astronauts \nfounded the Mercury Seven Foundation, now known as the Astronaut \nScholarship Foundation, which provides scholarships to young science \nstudents. In the 1970's, Mr. Landwirth founded an organization in honor \nof his mother, the Fanny Landwirth Foundation, through which he built a \nschool and a center for senior citizens in Orlando, Florida. He also \ncreated a scholarship program, which allowed underprivileged Israeli \nstudents to come to the United States as visiting scholars.\n  In 1986, Mr. Landwirth founded Give Kids the World, a non-profit \nresort in Kissimmee, Florida, that provides terminally ill children and \ntheir families an all-expenses paid week-long vacation to central \nFlorida and its popular attractions. Give Kids the World has served \nover 55,000 children throughout the United States and worldwide. The \norganization has grown from serving 329 children in its first year to a \n51-acre resort that can accommodate 7,000 families a year.\n  In 1999, Mr. Landwirth founded Dignity U Wear, a Jacksonville-based \nfoundation that provides new clothing to children and families who are \nhomeless, abused, abandoned, or neglected. The operation donates new \nclothing, shoes and personal hygiene items to 98 shelters in 16 states, \nand is currently working to expand into 30 states across the nation.\n  In 2001, Mr. Landwirth founded Building for Life based in \nJacksonville, which works in collaboration with other organizations, \nOperation Hope and FreshMinisters, an interfaith organization, of which \nMr. Landwirth serves on the Board of Trustees. This most recent \ncharitable organization aims to refurbish neglected homes while \nproviding an opportunity for the homeless to learn new job skills.\n  I am proud to have Henri Landwirth as a citizen of the great state of \nFlorida. On behalf of all Floridians, I offer him thanks and \nappreciation for all that he has done to help those in need.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/07/senate-section/article/S3367-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3367]]\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred February 26, \n2003 in Charlottesville, VA. Daisy Lundy was assaulted on the \nUniversity of Virginia campus by an unknown man. Lundy, a 19 year-old \nof African American and Korean descent, left a friend's room just \nbefore 2 a.m. to retrieve a cell phone. When she got to her car, the \nassailant, described only as a ``heavyset'' white man, attacked her, \nslamming her head into the steering wheel.

The benefit of the Maccabi Games lies not only in the \nsporting events themselves, but because the Games bring together young \nJewish people from all over the world.\n  Along with the athletic competitions, there will be social activities \nthat bring together people from all over the world who nonetheless \nshare the same history, values, and pride. The Games will also feature \ncultural programs and community service projects. When the Games \nconclude, these teenagers will take with them memories and friendships \nto last a lifetime.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the participants of the \n2003 JCC Maccabi Games.

Mr. President, I pay tribute to the heroic \n``Four Chaplains'' of World War II. In February, the Jewish War \nVeterans of Monmouth County and the Marlboro Jewish Center hosted the \nMonmouth County Interfaith Memorial Commemoration. These organizations \nhonored four chaplains who bravely gave their life during World War II.\n  On February 3, 1943 the U.S. Troopship S.S. Dorchester was in the \nAtlantic Ocean when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat submarine 150 \nmiles from Greenland. On board the ship were four chaplains. Protestant \nMinisters George L. Fox and Clark V. Poling, Roman Catholic Priest John \nP. Washington and Rabbi Alexander D. Goode. All went down with the \nDorchester.\n  Two hundred and twenty-nine of the 902 Army GIs on board were \nrescued. Indications are that not as many would have made it safely to \nthe rescue ships if not for the bravery of these four men. They helped \nsoldiers to the rescue ships and when life vests ran out they gave up \ntheirs so four soldiers could live. According to some eyewitnesses, the \nfour men were last seen with their arms linked and their heads bowed in \nprayer.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and the Jewish War Veterans of New \nJersey in paying tribute to these four brave souls who died with \ndignity and gave their lives so others could live.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/07/senate-section/article/S3367-5", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3367-S3368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING EPHRAIM AND JOANNE ZAYAT, DR.

Mr. President, I raise an issue that has come to my \nattention regarding the Justice Department's reported attempt to \nrestrict the use of the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem by local law enforcement. According to the Brady Campaign to \nPrevent Gun Violence and the Associated Press, a Department of Justice \nattorney recently threatened to bring charges against a top firearm \nofficial in California. The charges stem from California's practice of \nconducting National Instant Criminal Background Check System or NICS \nbackground checks.\n  According to reports, the dispute involves the use of the NICS \ndatabase by law enforcement to determine if guns seized in criminal \ninvestigations should be returned to their owners. California officials \nneed access to the NICS database because it includes data from across \nthe country and therefore more accurately determines whether a person \nis prohibited from possessing a firearm. Local law enforcement in \nCalifornia performs these checks thousands of times per year.\n  An example from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence \nillustrates the problem. When responding to a domestic violence \ncomplaint, law enforcement in California ask if there are any firearms \npresent in the home and take temporary custody of any guns they find. \nBefore returning the guns, law enforcement asks the California \nDepartment of Justice to run a NICS background check to determine \nwhether the gun owner is prohibited from purchasing or possessing a \nfirearm. The U.S. Department of Justice is challenging this practice, \nclaiming that it is a misuse of the NICS background check system. The \nU.S. Justice Department wants law enforcement to stop performing these \nchecks and immediately return guns to their owner.\n  The Brady Law contains nine categories of individuals prohibited from \npurchasing and possessing a firearm including felons and illegal \nimmigrants. I believe that law enforcement in all 50 states and the \nDistrict of Columbia should do everything within the law to insure that \nthese potentially dangerous individuals do not gain access to firearms. \nThe State of California is carrying out a common sense application of \nthe law. As the Los Angeles Times said in a recent editorial, the \nJustice Department's threatened actions are reckless, and are contrary \nto both public safety and sensible public policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Los Angeles Times \neditorial be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Ashcroft's Russian Roulette\n\n       Last year, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft tried but failed to get \n     the U.S. Supreme Court to buy his theory that the 2nd \n     Amendment allows pretty much anyone to buy pretty much any \n     gun, a view the court has consistently if infrequently \n     rejected.\n       Now Ashcroft has threatened California's top firearms \n     control official with criminal charges if the state continues \n     to use a federal databank to hunt down those making illegal \n     gun purchases, as it has done for years. Ashcroft's latest \n     decree is reckless and could emasculate this nation's gun \n     laws, hamstring police and put the public at risk.\n       Since 1998, firearms dealers across the country have used \n     the Department of Justice's National Instant Criminal \n     Background Check System, or NICS, to check, supposedly within \n     30 seconds, whether a customer is prohibited from owning a \n     gun because of, for example, a felony or a history of mental \n     illness.\n       California also has used the system to check whether \n     someone recently found by doctors to be mentally unstable--\n     and therefore barred from purchasing a weapon--had earlier \n     bought a firearm.\n       In addition, state law enforcement officials use this \n     background check to determine whether police should return a \n     weapon confiscated from an arrested person. The police are \n     required to withhold a gun if, for example, they learn that \n     the suspect had committed a crime in another state since he \n     bought it.\n       These have been standard law enforcement practices in \n     California for years.\n       Ashcroft wants to stop such practices, believing that a gun \n     owner's right to privacy trumps public safety.\n       The federal Brady law, requiring the background check for \n     handgun buyers, requires gun dealers to take one peek at an \n     individual's criminal record. A buyer with a clean record \n     takes the gun home. But if that same individual later commits \n     a crime, is slapped with a restraining order or becomes \n     mentally unstable, Ashcroft has decreed no one should know.\n       Ashcroft would force California law enforcement officials \n     to play Russian roulette 7,000 times a year when they release \n     a suspect for lack of evidence, spring a parolee from prison \n     or discover that a judge has put a restraining order on a \n     wife beater who has a firearm. Only, in this game, the \n     bullets will be aimed at law-abiding citizens.\n       For the moment, California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and his \n     firearms division chief, Randy Rossi, are standing firm, as \n     they should, vowing to continue using the NICS database to \n     protect Californians despite Ashcroft's vague threats of \n     prosecution. Pressure from Sen. Dianne Feinstein's (D-Calif.) \n     office may have prompted staffers from Ashcroft's and \n     Lockyer's offices to agree to talk Thursday by telephone in \n     an effort to end this impasse.\n       A large part of Ashcroft's responsibility is protecting the \n     public, not undercutting laws that would help him do that \n     job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/07/senate-section/article/S3368-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3368-S3369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO GREENUP COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL VARSITY CHEERLEADING SQUAD\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I pay tribute to the Greenup \nCounty High School Varsity Cheerleading Squad. On February 9, the \nGreenup County High School Varsity Cheerleading Squad won the Universal \nCheerleading Association's National Championship in Orlando, FL.\n  Greenup County High School has a long standing tradition of bringing \nhome the national title. Over the years, Greenup County has been named \nNational Champions 11 times, a feat that no other high school \ncheerleading program in the country has accomplished.\n  For the young women on this squad this is not just an trophy, it is \nan affirmation that with hard work and determination, anything is \npossible. To accomplish this goal the members not only have to juggle \nlong practices and games, but they continue to achieve academic \nexcellence. Not only are these young women excellent athletes and \nstudents but they pride themselves in giving back to their community \nfor\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\nsupport they have received by doing community service, fundraising, and \npublic relations for their school system. The citizens of Greenup \nCounty, KY are fortunate to have the 2003 National Champions living and \nlearning in their community. Their example of hard work and \ndetermination should be followed by all in the Commonwealth.\n  I am very proud of the accomplishments these young women have made. I \nwould like to congratulate the members of the Greenup County High \nSchool Varsity Cheerleading Squad for their success. But also, I want \nto congratulate their peers, coaches, teachers, administrators, and \nparents for their support and sacrifices they've made to help the \nGreenup County High School Varsity Cheerleading Squad make their dreams \na reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/07/senate-section/article/S3369-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1446.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto toll the 5-year limit for assistance under the temporary assistance \nto needy families program for recipients who live in a State that is \nexperiencing significant increases in unemployment; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation, \nthe Unemployment Protection for Low-Income Families on TANF Act, or \nUPLIFT Act, that will protect low-income families who are transitioning \nfrom welfare to work from losing their welfare benefits during periods \nof high unemployment. I want to thank my colleague, Senator Murray, for \njoining me in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Forcing families off welfare during a recession because they cannot \nfind a job lacks commonsense. In fact, during an economic downturn, \nwhich we are in right now, low-skilled workers and recently employed \nworkers are more likely to lose their jobs, and unfortunately, only 30 \nto 40 percent of former welfare recipients who become unemployed \nqualify for Unemployment Insurance. Furthermore, there are 1.5 million \nfewer jobs today than there were a year ago, when the economic downturn \nbegan, making it increasingly difficult for these individuals to find \nemployment, particularly full-time employment.\n  A single parent receiving welfare assistance while working 30 hours a \nweek who loses her job during a recession should not be penalized. For \nfamilies like this, welfare is the only unemployment insurance they \nhave. But, under current law, federal welfare time limits and work \nrequirements continue to apply during periods of high-unemployment.\n  The Unemployment Protection for Low-Income Families through TANF Act, \nor UPLIFT Act, would require states to disregard federal TANF \nassistance for all recipients when the national unemployment rate \nreaches or exceeds 6.5 percent or when a state unemployment rises by \n1.5 percentage points over a three-month period.\n  Every percentage point increase in unemployment results in a welfare \ncaseload increase of 5 percent. In addition to enacting a strong \ncontingency fund for states experiencing high unemployment and \nincreased caseloads, Congress must act to ensure that welfare \nrecipients are not time-limited off of welfare when the economy is weak \nand jobs are in short supply. In addition to promoting self-\nsufficiency, TANF programs should be a safety net for low-income \nfamilies who are unable to find work or meet their needs.\n  My legislation will help parents who are trying to transition from \nwelfare to work, but are unable to find work during a weak economy, to \nprovide for their families without the fear of losing cash assistance. \nThe TANF program is not only about moving people from welfare to work, \nit is also about reducing poverty and helping families in need.\n  While welfare reform has succeeded at moving thousands of people into \nwork, its success has come in strong economic times. As people reach \ntheir 5-year time limits, we can only hope they will be able to find \njobs in what is now a more difficult economy. The reality is that many \nstates are experiencing high unemployment right now, making it \nextremely difficult for welfare recipients to find good paying full-\ntime jobs. We shouldn't penalize people who are trying to transition \nfrom welfare to work just because the economy is bad. We need to \ncontinue to help these families build their skills and find employment \nwhen times are tough.\n  As Congress acts to reauthorize the TANF program I ask my colleagues \nto support legislation that will protect families transitioning from \nwelfare to work from losing their benefits during a recession.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 574\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Native American Languages Act to provide \nfor the support of Native American language survival schools, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend \nthe Native American Languages Act to provide authorization for the \nestablishment of Native American Language Survival Schools. I am \npleased to be joined in the co-sponsorship of this measure by the \nChairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell.\n  As part of the United States' forced assimilation policies towards \nNative Americans in the 1880s, the Federal Government initiated a \nsystem of off-reservation boarding schools. Native American Children \nwere forcibly taken from their families and transported hundreds of \nmiles to schools were they were subjected to efforts to eradicate all \nvestiges of their cultural background: their hair was cut \nnotwithstanding the religious importance of hair length in most native \ncultures; their clothes were replaced with military-style uniforms; \nthey were forbidden to practice their native religions; and they were \npunished for speaking their native languages. This effort to eradicate \nIndian culture was unsuccessful and the United States eventually \nabandoned this policy. However, the long-lasting impacts have separated \ngenerations of Native Americans from their native languages.\n  The Native American Languages Act of 1990 officially repudiated the \npolicies of the past and declared that ``it is the policy of the United \nStates to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom of \nNative Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American \nlanguages.'' The Native American Languages Act Amendments of 1992 \namended the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to establish a grant \nprogram to support Native American language projects which would be \nadministered by the Administration for Native Americans, Department of \nHealth and Human Services. This bill would bring the Nation one step \ncloser to assuring the preservation and revitalization of Native \nAmerican languages by supporting the development of Native American \nLanguage Survival Schools.\n  The purpose of this bill is to address the effects of past \ndiscrimination against Native American language speakers and to support \nrevitalization of such languages through the development of Native \nAmerican Language Survival Schools and Native American language Nests. \nIn addition, the bill seeks to demonstrate the positive effects of \nNative American Language Survival Schools on the academic success of \nNative American students and their mastery of standard English. An \nimportant component in language revitalization is family involvement \nwith the Native American Language Survival Schools, as well as \neducational exchanges among Native American Language Survival Schools. \nFurthermore, the bill provides support for Native American Language \nSurvival School facilities and endowments, the development of local and \nnational teaching models, and the creation of a university-level \nsupport center system for Native American Language Survival Schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mr. Fitzgerald, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 576. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na shorter recovery period for the depreciation of certain leasehold \nimprovements, to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today, joined again by my colleague \nMr. Nickles and many others, to introduce important legislation to \nprovide a 10-year depreciation life for leasehold improvements. \nLeasehold improvements are the alterations to leased space made by a \nbuilding owner as part of the lease agreement with a tenant.\n  This is a common sense move that will help bring economic development \nto cities and towns around the country that want to revitalize their \nbusiness districts. It will allow owners of commercial property to \nremodel their buildings to better meet the business needs of their \ncommunities--whether for new computer ports and data lines for high-\ntech entrepreneurs, or better lighting and sales space for retailers.\n  In actual commercial use, leasehold improvements typically last as \nlong as the lease--an average of 5 to 10 years. However, the Internal \nRevenue Code requires leasehold improvements to be depreciated over 39 \nyears--the life of the building itself.\n  Economically, this makes no sense. The owner receives taxable income \nover the life of the lease, yet can only recover the costs of the \nimprovements associated with that lease over 39 years--a rate nearly \nfour times slower. This preposterous mismatch of income and expenses \ncauses the owner to incur an artificially high tax cost on these \nimprovements.\n  The bill we are introducing today will correct this irrational and \nuneconomic tax treatment by shortening the cost recovery period for \ncertain leasehold improvements from 39 years to a more realistic 10 \nyears. The proposal being offered today would apply to property placed \nin service after September 10, 2004, in order to provide a smooth \ntransition from the temporary bonus depreciation system enacted as part \nof the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.\n  This legislation would more closely align the expenses incurred to \nconstruct improvements with the income they generate over the term of \nthe lease. By reducing the cost recovery period, the expense of making \nthese improvements could fall more into line with the economics of a \ncommercial lease transaction, and more building owners would be able to \nadapt their buildings to fit the needs of today's business tenant.\n  It is good for the economy to keep existing buildings commercially \nviable. When older buildings can serve tenants who need modern, \nefficient commercial space, there is less pressure for developing \ngreenfields in outlying areas. Americans are concerned about preserving \nopen space, natural resources, and a sense of neighborhood. The current \nlaw 39-year cost recovery period for leasehold improvements is an \nimpediment to reinvesting in existing properties and communities.\n  Shortening the recovery period will make renovation and \nrevitalization of business properties more attractive. That will be \ngood not just for property owners, but also for the economic \ndevelopment professionals who are working hard every day to attract new \nbusinesses to empty downtown storefronts or aging strip malls. And it \nwill be good for the architects and contractors who carry out the \nrenovations.\n  I urge all Senators to join us in supporting this legislation to \nprovide rational depreciation treatment for leasehold improvements.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am joining my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Conrad, in introducing legislation to provide that \nleasehold improvements are depreciated over 10 years instead of the \ncurrent-law 39 years. Leasehold improvements are modifications to the \ninterior of rental space, either office or retail space, not \nresidential real estate, made by a building owner as part of a lease \nagreement with a tenant. These improvements include electrical and \ncommunications outlets, data ports, floor coverings, fire and security \nsystems, and internal walls.\n  Under the current depreciation system, leasehold improvements to \nrental property are depreciated over the same time period as the \nbuilding itself--39 years. However, this 39 year depreciable life does \nnot reflect the actual\n\n[[Page S3372]]\n\nlife of these improvements. Lease terms average 7 to 10 years for \noffice space and 3 to 5 years for retail space. Building owners \ntypically must remove any leasehold improvements they have made to a \nproperty at the end of the lease term. Or, in the case of a lease \nrenewal, tenants frequently demand that owners make improvements to the \nproperty as a condition of renewing the lease. Requiring business \nowners to depreciate these improvements over 39 years leads to a \nmismatch of income and expenses, thereby increasing the tax consequence \nof making such improvements. The long depreciation period simply makes \nno economic sense.\n  I believe that our tax laws should be updated to treat leasehold \nimprovements in a more rational manner. That is why my colleague and I \nare introducing legislation to reduce the depreciable life of these \nimprovements from 39 years to 10 years. By reducing the time period \nover which leasehold improvements are depreciated, our bill will more \naccurately align income and expenses related to rental property, and \nwill mitigate the tax disincentives to modernizing commercial \nbuildings.\n  In last year's economic stimulus bill Congress provided some relief \nto owners of rental property by allowing a 30 percent depreciation \nbonus for qualified leasehold improvements. However, this relief is \nonly partial and is temporary. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact my legislation that will provide more rational tax-\ntreatment of leasehold improvements on a permanent basis. By so doing, \nwe will take an incremental step toward modernizing the tax code's \noutdated depreciation rules.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. \n        Sununu):\n  S. 577. A bill to establish the Freedom's Way National Heritage Area \nin the States of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nestablish the Freedom's Way National Heritage Area in New Hampshire and \nMassachusetts. The bill is cosponsored by Senator Kennedy, Senator \nGregg and Senator Sununu.\n  The bill proposes to establish a national heritage area including 36 \ncommunities in Massachusetts and six communities in New Hampshire. The \narea has important cultural and natural legacies that are important to \nNew England and the entire Nation. I want to highlight just a few of \nthe reasons I believe this designation makes sense.\n  The Freedom's Way is an ideal candidate because it is rich in \nhistoric sties, trails, landscapes and views. The land and the area's \nresources are pieces of American history and culture. The entire \nregion, and especially places like Lexington and Concord, is important \nto our country's founding and our political and philosophical \nprinciples. Within the 42 communities are truly special places. These \ninclude the Minuteman National Historic Park, more than 40 National \nRegister Districts and National Historic Landmarks, the Great Meadows \nNational Wildlife Refuge, Walden Pond State Reservation, Gardener State \nPark, Harvard Shaker Village and the Shirley Shaker Village.\n  In addition, there is strong grassroots support for this designation. \nThe people of these communities organized themselves in this effort and \nhave now turned to us for assistance. I hope we can provide it. \nSupporters include elected officials, people dedicated to preserving a \nsmall piece of American and New England history, and local business \nleaders. It is an honor to help their cause.\n  Finally, I am very pleased that Senators from both Massachusetts and \nNew Hampshire have embraced this proposal. I thank Senators Kennedy, \nGregg, and Sununu.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Akaka, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 578. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include \nIndian tribes among the entities consulted with respect to activities \ncarried out by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Government Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include Indian tribal \ngovernments amongst the governmental entities that are consulted with \nrespect to activities carried out by the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security. This bill is entitled the ``Tribal Government \nAmendments to the Homeland Security Act of 2002'', and I am pleased to \nbe joined in the sponsorship of this measure by the Chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, as \nwell as our colleagues Senator Daniel Akaka, and Senator Maria \nCantwell.\n  The amendments proposed in this measure were developed in \nconsultation with the Senate Government Affairs Committee in the last \nsession of the Congress but were not included in the final version of \nthe Act because of the procedural posture of the bill as it came to the \nSenate from the House of Representatives.\n  There are 260 miles of tribal lands which form our northern and \nsouthern borders with Canada and Mexico, and along those border lands, \ntribal governments are the principal and frequently the only law \nenforcement presence with the capacity to protect those borders and to \nassure the safety of our homeland. In addition, there are hundreds of \nmiles of tribal lands that border the waters surrounding the United \nStates, and there too, tribal law enforcement is the first line of \ndefense for purposes of homeland security.\n  In the Homeland Security Act of 2002, tribal governments are included \nin the definition of ``local governments''. As we all know, local \ngovernments are political subdivisions of the States. In contrast, \ntribal governments are recognized as separate sovereigns under the \nUnited States Constitution that do not derive their sovereign status \nfrom the States, and accordingly, we believe that Federal law should \ncontinue to reflect the legal distinction between local governments \nthat are political subdivisions of the States and tribal governments.\n  Accordingly, these amendments would remove tribal governments from \nthe definition of ``local governments'' as currently set forth in the \nAct, and insert tribal governments in the appropriate and relevant \nsections of the Act.\n  There can be no doubt that tribal governments have a critical role to \nplay in our Nation's homeland security efforts and the protection of \nour land and water borders. Thus, this measure also makes clear that \nfor purposes of homeland security, the United States recognizes the \ninherent authority of tribal governments to exercise jurisdiction \ncurrently with the Federal government to assure that applicable \ncriminal, civil and regulatory laws are enforced on tribal lands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, and Mrs. Hutchison).\n  S. 579.

For the information of all Senators, on Monday, the Senate \nwill once again resume consideration of the Estrada nomination. We will \ncontinue to pursue an agreement to allow for an up-or-down vote which \nis the end point for this nomination. At 5 o'clock on Monday, the \nSenate will begin consideration of S. 3, the partial-birth abortion \nbill. A number of Senators have indicated they will be available to \nmake their opening statements on that bill during Monday's session. As \na reminder, the first rollcall vote of Monday's session will occur at 6 \np.m. on the nomination of Gregory Frost to be a U.S. District Judge for \nthe Southern District of Ohio.\n  I thank all Members for their attention.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, Monday afternoon from 2 until 5 we will be on \nthe Estrada nomination again. We have had a long, thorough debate on \nthis matter. There has been some difficult dialog, but it has all been \nfor the advocacy that should be present in the Senate. What this is \nleading up to is everything has gone so well at this point, we would \nhope--and I will be here virtually all the time that afternoon--that \nthere would be no effort to try to sneak in a vote when somebody is not \non the floor or anything like that. I think it would really take away \nfrom what has happened here. I continue to ask that question.\n  I am not sure that there will be people from the Judiciary Committee \navailable all that afternoon. That means I will have to cover that. \nThere are times when I am indisposed for various reasons.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we can assure the other side that we will \nbe engaged just in discussion on the Estrada nomination and have no \nintention to\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\nbe voting during that period. We will be continuing the very important \ndiscussion on the nomination itself.\n  My goal in that discussion next week is to begin to talk, not to \nextend what has been a very good debate, but have a discussion on this \nnomination in terms of the constitutional significance of advice and \nconsent. Monday, hopefully in the afternoon, some of that discussion \nwill begin, and then also continue that through Tuesday.\n  I do thank the assistant minority leader and really the whole other \nside of the aisle. We have had a productive week. We made real progress \nto complete the treaty yesterday, a very important initiative. I look \nforward to next week being a productive week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the other \nquestion I have is, I learned yesterday that there may be an effort on \nTuesday morning from 11 to 12:30 to get back on Estrada, talking about \nsome constitutional issues people think are there. That is fine. I was \njust wondering if that, in fact, is the case because the Judiciary \nCommittee members want to plan their schedules if in fact that were the \ncase.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is the time that has been set aside, similar to \ntoday. There had been a request from both sides of the aisle today to \nspend time talking about the issue that has been discussed; that is, \nIraq and the events there. Similarly, people have asked, well, we have \nbeen on Estrada, but why don't we take a period of time to give focus \nto the big issues that affect the institution in terms of advice and \nconsent and balance of power. In response to that, we have set aside \nthis period between 11 o'clock and 12:30 on Tuesday. It is my hope that \nwe have many Senators here to participate in that debate because I look \nforward to it. The whole purpose is to set that period aside. We will \ndiscuss the best way to construct that between both sides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through you to the leader, I extend my \nappreciation for his courtesy, as usual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/07/senate-section/article/S3374-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 2 P.M., MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
